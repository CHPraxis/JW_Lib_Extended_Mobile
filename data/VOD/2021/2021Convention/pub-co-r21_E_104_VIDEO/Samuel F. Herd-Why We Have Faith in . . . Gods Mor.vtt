Pressure from the world can erode
our determination to do what is right.

00:00:05.526 --> 00:00:07.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, even a mature Christian

00:00:07.862 --> 00:00:10.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may be inclined to do what is bad.

00:00:10.656 --> 00:00:14.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please find Romans 7:21-23.

00:00:14.702 --> 00:00:17.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul was certainly mature,

00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:20.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but notice what he said of himself

00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:24.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we read Romans 7:21-23:

00:00:26.797 --> 00:00:30.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I find, then, this law in my case:

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When I wish to do what is right,

00:00:32.303 --> 00:00:35.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“what is bad is present in me.

00:00:35.097 --> 00:00:37.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I really delight in the law of God

00:00:37.558 --> 00:00:39.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“according to the man I am within,

00:00:39.602 --> 00:00:42.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but I see in my body another law

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“warring against the law of my mind

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:48.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and leading me captive to sin’s law

00:00:48.652 --> 00:00:50.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is in my body.”

00:00:52.114 --> 00:00:55.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Paul, we might find that we have a war, 

00:00:55.784 --> 00:00:58.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a struggle, inside us

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we fight against the law of sin.

00:01:01.707 --> 00:01:03.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, like Paul,

00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:06.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know that for us to please Jehovah,

00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:10.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we must live in harmony with His standards.

00:01:11.884 --> 00:01:15.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at 1 Corinthians 6:9, 10.

00:01:15.638 --> 00:01:19.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are some of Jehovah’s moral standards?

00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:22.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice the list of moral issues

00:01:22.978 --> 00:01:26.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we choose not to succumb to.

00:01:26.815 --> 00:01:31.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 Corinthians 6:9, 10, it says:

00:01:33.155 --> 00:01:36.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Or do you not know that unrighteous people

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will not inherit God’s Kingdom?

00:01:38.577 --> 00:01:40.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be misled.

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Those who are sexually immoral,

00:01:42.873 --> 00:01:45.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“idolaters, adulterers,

00:01:45.376 --> 00:01:48.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“men who submit to homosexual acts,

00:01:48.295 --> 00:01:51.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“men who practice homosexuality,

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“thieves, greedy people,

00:01:53.717 --> 00:01:57.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“drunkards, revilers, and extortioners

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will not inherit God’s Kingdom.”

00:02:01.225 --> 00:02:04.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must be firmly convinced
that these moral standards

00:02:04.895 --> 00:02:08.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah are right and beneficial.

00:02:09.608 --> 00:02:12.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can we have faith in these standards?

00:02:12.611 --> 00:02:16.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To find out, find Isaiah 48:17.

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:21.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you will see
that we can have faith in God’s standards

00:02:21.286 --> 00:02:25.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they always benefit us.

00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:29.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 48:17 says:

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is what Jehovah says,

00:02:31.755 --> 00:02:34.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“your Repurchaser, the Holy One of Israel:

00:02:34.425 --> 00:02:37.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I, Jehovah, am your God,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘the One teaching you to benefit yourself,

00:02:40.264 --> 00:02:44.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the One guiding you
in the way you should walk.’”

00:02:45.144 --> 00:02:47.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see the point?

00:02:47.187 --> 00:02:49.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is teaching us

00:02:49.857 --> 00:02:52.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to benefit ourselves.

00:02:52.568 --> 00:02:56.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can have faith
in his standards of right and wrong.

00:02:57.781 --> 00:03:01.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re unchanging,
and they produce good results

00:03:01.285 --> 00:03:05.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under all circumstances and in all cultures.

00:03:05.748 --> 00:03:09.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider God’s standard for marriage.

00:03:09.293 --> 00:03:12.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah created marriage as a permanent,

00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:16.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
loving union between a man and a woman.

00:03:16.925 --> 00:03:20.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gave Adam a wife, Eve

00:03:20.095 --> 00:03:24.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not Eve and B and D—
just Eve.

00:03:24.558 --> 00:03:28.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He told them:
“Be fruitful and become many . . .

00:03:28.145 --> 00:03:30.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fill the . . . earth.”

00:03:30.272 --> 00:03:33.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at 1 Corinthians 6:18.

00:03:33.525 --> 00:03:36.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is making the point that sex

00:03:36.361 --> 00:03:41.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
outside of marriage
is prohibited by Jehovah.

00:03:41.116 --> 00:03:44.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians 6:18 says:

00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:46.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Flee from sexual immorality!

00:03:46.997 --> 00:03:49.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Every other sin that a man may commit

00:03:49.792 --> 00:03:51.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is outside his body,

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:55.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but whoever practices sexual immorality

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:59.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is sinning against his own body.”

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When family members
follow Jehovah’s standards,

00:04:03.972 --> 00:04:07.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the family is secure, stable, and happy.

00:04:07.392 --> 00:04:10.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video, note how a couple

00:04:10.646 --> 00:04:14.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
benefited from applying
God’s moral standards.

00:04:16.068 --> 00:04:18.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We met at a party when I was in the military.

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was on the dance floor, and I saw Frenchie.

00:04:25.244 --> 00:04:26.411 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And I was like, ‘Oh!

00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:28.455 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’m going to talk to this girl right here.’

00:04:30.415 --> 00:04:33.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The whole time we were just smiling
at each other

00:04:33.085 --> 00:04:34.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this instant attraction.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was mutual.

00:04:36.922 --> 00:04:40.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gradually, we were living together.

00:04:40.384 --> 00:04:43.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And a few months go by,

00:04:43.762 --> 00:04:45.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and things are going well,

00:04:45.764 --> 00:04:48.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then I find out I’m pregnant.

00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:52.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he left.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was shocked

00:04:55.858 --> 00:04:59.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(though I shouldn’t have been),
but I was shocked.

00:04:59.361 --> 00:05:02.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And truthfully, I was scared,

00:05:02.865 --> 00:05:05.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like, ‘What am I going to do now?’

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like a failure,

00:05:08.495 --> 00:05:11.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I kept asking myself,
‘How did I let this happen?’

00:05:15.294 --> 00:05:19.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that I had to be there,
and I wanted to be there.

00:05:19.131 --> 00:05:21.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just didn’t know how.

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:26.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We prayed together for the first time
as a couple.

00:05:26.388 --> 00:05:29.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a Friday night.

00:05:29.641 --> 00:05:32.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saturday morning, we had a knock on the door.

00:05:32.644 --> 00:05:35.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We decided to have a Bible study.

00:05:35.814 --> 00:05:37.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had us study the chapter

00:05:37.816 --> 00:05:40.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on family life and marriage.

00:05:40.861 --> 00:05:42.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that moment,

00:05:42.905 --> 00:05:45.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that I wanted to have our relationship

00:05:45.908 --> 00:05:49.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be honorable before Jehovah.

00:05:49.912 --> 00:05:51.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You learn that Jehovah

00:05:51.663 --> 00:05:54.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meant for marriages to be a permanent bond.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The insecurities of every disagreement

00:05:59.588 --> 00:06:02.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ending in a breakup or a divorce

00:06:02.424 --> 00:06:04.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all of that went away.

00:06:05.135 --> 00:06:08.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We started to see Jehovah’s training

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:10.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in practical ways,

00:06:10.933 --> 00:06:13.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just learning

00:06:13.227 --> 00:06:15.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to be a husband

00:06:15.854 --> 00:06:20.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who respected and cared for his wife.

00:06:20.734 --> 00:06:24.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We became partners
—a team, a complement—

00:06:24.947 --> 00:06:27.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that was only because Jehovah

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:30.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taught us how to do it.

00:06:30.494 --> 00:06:33.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though it was difficult at the outset,

00:06:34.414 --> 00:06:38.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we made that decision
to dedicate our life to do Jehovah’s will,

00:06:38.752 --> 00:06:40.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we got baptized together.

00:06:43.966 --> 00:06:45.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve been married 25 years,

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:49.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the insecurities are gone.

00:06:49.596 --> 00:06:53.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I focus on all the blessings that have come

00:06:53.225 --> 00:06:56.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just from keeping Jehovah in our life,

00:06:56.144 --> 00:06:58.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s the best feeling in the world.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.156 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You can go at it on your own,

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:10.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you’ll never find the joy,

00:07:10.951 --> 00:07:13.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll never find the peace,
you’ll never find the security

00:07:13.912 --> 00:07:16.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that comes from doing it Jehovah’s way.

00:07:21.378 --> 00:07:24.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was only after coming to know Jehovah

00:07:24.131 --> 00:07:26.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and having faith in his standards 

00:07:26.383 --> 00:07:29.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the couple came to have a stable

00:07:29.303 --> 00:07:34.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enduring marriage of 25 years.

00:07:34.016 --> 00:07:36.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about us?

00:07:36.018 --> 00:07:40.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we strengthen our faith
in God’s moral standards?

00:07:40.647 --> 00:07:42.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Contemplate the benefits

00:07:42.983 --> 00:07:46.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of obeying God’s moral standards

00:07:46.028 --> 00:07:49.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the consequences of disobeying them.

00:07:51.116 --> 00:07:53.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Note two Bible principles.

00:07:53.285 --> 00:07:56.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Deuteronomy 32:29 says:

00:07:56.288 --> 00:07:59.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[Be] wise! . . .
Ponder over this . . .

00:07:59.875 --> 00:08:02.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about [the] outcome.”

00:08:02.044 --> 00:08:05.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, contemplate the benefits

00:08:05.255 --> 00:08:07.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of obeying God’s moral standards.

00:08:09.009 --> 00:08:12.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In contrast, the consequences of disobeying

00:08:12.262 --> 00:08:15.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s moral standards can be severe.

00:08:17.225 --> 00:08:20.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Galatians 6:8 says:

00:08:20.187 --> 00:08:23.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[Sow] with a view to his flesh

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[and] reap corruption from [the] flesh.”

00:08:29.821 --> 00:08:33.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world’s entertainment industry
often ignores this fact.

00:08:33.575 --> 00:08:37.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your faith in God’s standards will grow

00:08:37.204 --> 00:08:41.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you experience
the benefits of living by them.

00:08:41.375 --> 00:08:45.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obeying God’s moral standards
protects us physically,

00:08:45.212 --> 00:08:47.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
emotionally, and spiritually.

00:08:49.508 --> 00:08:53.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s standards make us wise

00:08:53.095 --> 00:08:56.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we do not have to learn

00:08:56.306 --> 00:08:59.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from painful experiences.

00:08:59.226 --> 00:09:01.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To illustrate:

00:09:01.311 --> 00:09:04.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re driving, and you see a sign.

00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:07.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “School speed limit:

00:09:07.984 --> 00:09:10.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
15 miles an hour.”

00:09:10.821 --> 00:09:14.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if you do not adhere
to that standard of law?

00:09:15.575 --> 00:09:19.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Suppose you are driving at 50 miles an hour.

00:09:19.246 --> 00:09:21.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You hit a child crossing the road.

00:09:21.748 --> 00:09:25.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The consequence for not obeying the standard—

00:09:25.419 --> 00:09:29.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would be
an extremely painful experience.

00:09:30.382 --> 00:09:35.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s standards protect us from the pain.

00:09:36.805 --> 00:09:40.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s conclude by sharing
some verses from Psalm 19.

00:09:40.976 --> 00:09:42.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn there.

00:09:44.229 --> 00:09:47.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This psalm is speaking
about Jehovah’s standards,

00:09:47.315 --> 00:09:50.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his laws, and reminders.

00:09:50.402 --> 00:09:55.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will first read Psalm 19:7:

00:09:55.198 --> 00:09:58.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The law of Jehovah is perfect,

00:09:58.785 --> 00:10:01.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“restoring strength.

00:10:01.037 --> 00:10:04.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy,

00:10:04.082 --> 00:10:08.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making the inexperienced one wise.”

00:10:10.046 --> 00:10:14.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do not need
to remain naive and inexperienced.

00:10:14.551 --> 00:10:16.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We become wise.

00:10:16.636 --> 00:10:20.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now read with me verses 8 and 9:

00:10:20.765 --> 00:10:23.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The orders from Jehovah are righteous,

00:10:23.894 --> 00:10:26.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“causing the heart to rejoice;

00:10:26.688 --> 00:10:29.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the commandment of Jehovah is clean,

00:10:29.649 --> 00:10:32.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“making the eyes shine.

00:10:32.444 --> 00:10:35.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The fear of Jehovah is pure,

00:10:35.155 --> 00:10:37.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“lasting forever.

00:10:37.532 --> 00:10:39.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The judgments of Jehovah are true,

00:10:39.993 --> 00:10:42.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
altogether righteous.”

00:10:44.122 --> 00:10:48.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Living by God’s standards
brings approval from Jehovah.

00:10:48.376 --> 00:10:50.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We enjoy a clean conscience

00:10:50.712 --> 00:10:53.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a good relationship with him.

00:10:54.466 --> 00:10:57.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, verse 11 says:

00:10:57.219 --> 00:11:01.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By them your servant has been warned;

00:11:01.306 --> 00:11:05.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in keeping them, there is a large reward.”

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:11.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says “a large reward” awaits us.

00:11:11.149 --> 00:11:15.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have faith in God’s moral standards.

00:11:15.529 --> 00:11:19.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obey them and become wise.

00:11:19.282 --> 00:11:21.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will protect you physically, 

00:11:21.618 --> 00:11:24.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
emotionally, and spiritually.

00:11:24.996 --> 00:11:30.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will have a clean conscience
and Jehovah’s approval

00:11:30.001 --> 00:11:33.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and in the end, everlasting life.

00:11:36.508 --> 00:11:39.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Gerrit Lösch of the Governing Body
will now present 

00:11:39.886 --> 00:11:42.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the final talk of this symposium,

00:11:42.847 --> 00:11:47.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why We Have Faith in . . . God’s Love.”

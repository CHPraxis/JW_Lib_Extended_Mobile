When tragedies strike,

00:00:07.778 --> 00:00:11.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many people have a hard time
believing that God cares about us.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever felt that way?

00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:21.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Honestly?
Yeah.

00:00:21.292 --> 00:00:23.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to believe he cares,

00:00:23.294 --> 00:00:25.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he hasn’t done much for me;
that’s for sure.

00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:28.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Last year my father had a heart attack,

00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:30.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I just lost my job.

00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:32.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sorry to hear that.

00:00:32.636 --> 00:00:34.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How’s your father recovering?

00:00:34.263 --> 00:00:35.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s OK now.

00:00:35.472 --> 00:00:37.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were really worried about him for a while.

00:00:37.474 --> 00:00:39.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m glad he’s improving.

00:00:39.894 --> 00:00:41.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we face problems,

00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:44.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it helps to know that someone cares.

00:00:44.398 --> 00:00:48.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we know
that God cares about us as individuals?

00:00:48.652 --> 00:00:53.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please note Jesus’ words
at Matthew 10:29-31.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tom, would you please read that for us?

00:00:55.784 --> 00:00:57.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure.

00:00:57.786 --> 00:01:02.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Two sparrows sell for a coin of small value,
do they not?

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:05.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Yet not one of them will fall to the ground

00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:07.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“without your Father’s knowledge.

00:01:07.212 --> 00:01:11.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But even the hairs of your head
are all numbered.

00:01:11.383 --> 00:01:15.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So have no fear;
you are worth more than many sparrows.”

00:01:21.185 --> 00:01:22.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:01:22.811 --> 00:01:26.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how detailed is God’s knowledge of us?

00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:30.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He numbers the hairs of our head?

00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:32.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.
Impressive, right?

00:01:32.905 --> 00:01:34.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:01:34.073 --> 00:01:37.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if God numbers
even the hairs of our head,

00:01:37.368 --> 00:01:40.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would it make sense
that he cares about us

00:01:40.162 --> 00:01:42.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and knows when we’re going
through a hard time?

00:01:42.414 --> 00:01:44.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seems logical.

00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:46.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now the question is,

00:01:46.418 --> 00:01:49.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does God help us
to cope with present problems?

00:01:49.463 --> 00:01:51.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to discuss that
the next time we talk.

00:00:06 We’re making brief visits on our neighbors
00:00:08 to discuss how the Bible can help us today.
00:00:11 How do you view the Bible?
00:00:13 Some would say it’s a book of human wisdom,
00:00:15 others say myths and legends.
00:00:17 Still others view it as God’s Word.
00:00:19 What are your thoughts?
00:00:26 Hmm. That’s a good question.
00:00:28 I think of the Bible as a good book,
00:00:31 but I can’t say that I really know what’s in it.
00:00:33 Many have said the same.
00:00:35 I’d like to show you a verse that gives four ways that the Bible can help us.
00:00:40 Susan, would you please read Romans 15:4?
00:00:43 Sure.
00:00:44 It says: “For all the things that were written beforehand
00:00:48 “were written for our instruction,
00:00:50 “so that through our endurance
00:00:52 “and through the comfort from the Scriptures
00:00:54 we might have hope.”
00:00:55 Thank you.
00:00:57 So did you notice the four specific ways
00:00:59 that the Bible can help us?
00:01:01 It gives instruction, endurance,
00:01:04 comfort, and hope.
00:01:07 Which of these do you feel that we need the most right now?
00:01:10 Hmm.
00:01:11 I would say “hope”
00:01:13 because this world is in a real mess.
00:01:17 I agree.
00:01:18 Hope is needed more than ever.
00:01:21 The Bible can give us real hope.
00:01:24 May I return in a few days and show you an example of this?
00:01:27 Sure.

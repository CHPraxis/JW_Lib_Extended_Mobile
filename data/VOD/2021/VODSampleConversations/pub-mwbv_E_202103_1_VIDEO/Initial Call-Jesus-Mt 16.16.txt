00:00:08 Today, I’ve been discussing with people the identity of Jesus Christ.
00:00:12 What are your thoughts about Jesus?
00:00:21 I think he was a good man.
00:00:23 He certainly was.
00:00:25 In fact, he was the greatest man who ever lived.
00:00:28 But the Bible identifies him as being much more than that.
00:00:31 Consider what we read here at Matthew 16:16.
00:00:36 Jesus has just asked his disciples who they believe he is.
00:00:40 Notice their response:
00:00:42 “Simon Peter answered: ‘You are the Christ,
00:00:46 the Son of the living God.’”
00:00:49 So according to this verse, who was Jesus?
00:00:53 Was Jesus just a good man, or more?
00:00:56 More.
00:00:58 It says he was the Son of God.
00:01:00 That’s right.
00:01:02 Of course, we might wonder,
00:01:03 ‘Since Jesus is the Son of God
00:01:06 —and a perfect Son at that— why did he die?’
00:01:10 Maybe we can discuss the Bible’s answer the next time we talk.
00:01:13 Yes, I’d like that.

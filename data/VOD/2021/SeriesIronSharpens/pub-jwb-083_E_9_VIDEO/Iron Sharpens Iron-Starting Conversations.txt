00:00:01 Hi, I’m Taylor, and this is “Iron Sharpens Iron.”
00:00:13 Today, we’re going to practice
00:00:14 how to start a conversation
00:00:16 that could lead to a witness.
00:00:19 Now, for many, this can be terrifying.
00:00:22 Why?
00:00:24 Well, as soon as we see someone that we’d like to talk to,
00:00:27 we can start to think to ourselves: ‘What am I going to say?
00:00:30 How am I going to give a witness?’
00:00:32 Or, ‘How are they going to react?’
00:00:34 And we can become so overwhelmed with anxiety or nerves,
00:00:38 thinking about how the conversation will end, that we never even start.
00:00:43 So here’s something that we must keep in mind.
00:00:46 Our goal is simply
00:00:48 to start  a conversation.
00:00:52 So if we’ve started a conversation,
00:00:54 we’ve succeeded—we’ve reached our goal!
00:00:57 Then we can just relax and see if it leads to a witness.
00:01:02 The September 2018
00:01:05 Life and Ministry Meeting Workbook
00:01:08 shows us how we can start a conversation
00:01:11 like Jesus did with the Samaritan woman in John chapter 4.
00:01:16 So when we see someone that we would like to talk to,
00:01:20 we want to keep these three steps in mind:
00:01:22 Step 1: Be friendly.
00:01:27 That’s it. Just be friendly.
00:01:30 Now, we could be nervous.
00:01:32 So we can say a quick prayer to Jehovah to give us courage,
00:01:35 but then we can give a friendly greeting.
00:01:38 Then we can mention something that’s happening right then and there:
00:01:41 maybe the weather, a long line at the grocery store,
00:01:45 their nice car, or another genuine compliment.
00:01:49 When Jesus started his conversation, in verse 7,
00:01:52 with the Samaritan woman, he simply said
00:01:55 (and no doubt in a friendly way): “Give me a drink.”
00:01:59 Step 2:
00:02:01 Let the conversation progress naturally.
00:02:05 Don’t rush it.
00:02:07 If the conversation ends before we are able to give a witness, it’s OK.
00:02:11 We accomplished our goal. We started a conversation.
00:02:15 Now we’re ready to try again.
00:02:17 Now, if the conversation continues on,
00:02:20 then we can look for an opportunity to take step 3:
00:02:23 Make a simple expression of our faith.
00:02:27 Seven verses after Jesus started the conversation
00:02:32 with the Samaritan woman, he then witnessed to her.
00:02:36 He said he had water that imparts everlasting life.
00:02:39 But between those two points, he didn’t lecture her.
00:02:43 He let her talk and express herself,
00:02:46 and he listened to what she had to say.
00:02:48 So with those three steps in mind, now it’s our turn.
00:02:52 It’s our turn to practice
00:02:55 starting a conversation that could lead to a witness.
00:02:58 Now, tied in with us, we have
00:03:01 Taís and Carolina who have joined us for a demonstration.
00:03:05 So where are you going to try to start your conversation today?
00:03:09 We are in a department store.
00:03:10 Yes, we are in a Portuguese congregation,
00:03:12 and it’s common to hear people speak Portuguese when we are out shopping.
00:03:16 Excellent.
00:03:17 So you’ve heard the three steps that we want to try.
00:03:20 But first, let’s see what could happen if we rush the conversation.
00:03:24 OK.
00:03:25 Oi, tudo bem?
00:03:26 I heard you speaking Portuguese.
00:03:28 Where are you from?
00:03:29 Oi, I’m from Rio de Janeiro.
00:03:31 I’m from São Paulo.
00:03:33 How long have you been here?
00:03:34 Just three months.
00:03:36 It’s so hard to adjust, isn’t it?
00:03:38 You know, the Bible helped me so much when I moved here.
00:03:41 I don’t want to keep you from your shopping, but you can read
00:03:44 the Bible in Portuguese on our website,
00:03:46 and it has articles that I know you will find comforting.
00:03:49 OK, so time-out.
00:03:51 Now, Taís, we know you rushed that on purpose,
00:03:53 but how did it make you feel when you did?
00:03:56 Yeah, it didn’t feel right to start witnessing so quickly.
00:03:59 And I saw that she wasn’t expecting it.
00:04:01 Right.
00:04:02 And Carolina, how about you? How did it make you feel?
00:04:05 It started OK, but then it got awkward real fast.
00:04:08 Right.
00:04:09 So now, maybe you can show us
00:04:12 what it’s like when the conversation will progress more naturally.
00:04:15 OK.
00:04:16 Oi, tudo bem?
00:04:17 I heard you speaking Portuguese.
00:04:19 Where are you from?
00:04:20 Oi, I’m from Rio de Janeiro.
00:04:23 Oh, nice. I’m from São Paulo.
00:04:25 I recognized your accent.
00:04:27 I’m Taís.
00:04:28 I’m Carolina. Nice to meet you.
00:04:30 Wow! How long have you been here?
00:04:32 Only three months.
00:04:34 Well, for me it’s been three years,
00:04:37 and the first was the hardest.
00:04:40 Yes, we finally have work.
00:04:42 But we are still looking for a place to live.
00:04:45 And immigration has been harder than we thought.
00:04:48 Wow! I’m so sorry.
00:04:50 Do you have family with you?
00:04:52 My husband.
00:04:53 We had to leave our son with my mother.
00:04:55 I miss him so much.
00:04:57 Wow, that’s so hard.
00:04:59 But we have to keep trusting in God.
00:05:02 In my case, it’s what got me through.
00:05:04 I know, but I still worry when I don’t know what He will do for us.
00:05:09 OK, so let’s stop there.
00:05:10 Really nice, thank you.
00:05:13 So Taís, where do you feel the conversation is at at this point?
00:05:16 Yeah, I felt like I found a good time to say something about my faith.
00:05:20 And now she’s saying how she feels.
00:05:23 Nice, excellent.
00:05:25 And Carolina, how about you?
00:05:26 It was just a nice conversation.
00:05:28 So when she mentioned God, it was not awkward.
00:05:31 Thank you, sisters, for letting us learn from your conversation.
00:05:35 I found that helpful, and I hope you did too.
00:05:39 Make it your goal to start conversations with those three steps:
00:05:44 Be friendly, converse naturally,
00:05:48 and find the right time to express your faith.
00:05:51 Practice at home or with a friend,
00:05:54 and see for yourself how “iron sharpens iron.”

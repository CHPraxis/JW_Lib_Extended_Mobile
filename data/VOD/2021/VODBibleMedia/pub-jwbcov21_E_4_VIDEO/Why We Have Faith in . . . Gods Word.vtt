The Bible is a book of facts.

00:00:05.192 --> 00:00:08.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s about real people, real events,

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
real history in real places.

00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:12.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Hebrew Scriptures,

00:00:12.616 --> 00:00:15.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are at least 53 people

00:00:15.286 --> 00:00:17.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
confirmed archaeologically.

00:00:17.955 --> 00:00:21.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One example is Pharaoh Shishak of Egypt.

00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:24.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible mentions his invasion of Judah,

00:00:24.295 --> 00:00:26.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
specifically dating it

00:00:26.463 --> 00:00:30.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the fifth year
of [Judean] King Rehoboam.”

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:32.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a long time,

00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:35.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the only record of that invasion

00:00:35.097 --> 00:00:37.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the one found in the Bible.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then a relief on the wall of a temple
at Karnak, Egypt,

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:43.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was discovered, depicting

00:00:43.647 --> 00:00:46.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shishak with captives.

00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:50.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also records names
of conquered Israelite towns,

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:54.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many of which have been identified
with Biblical sites.

00:00:54.074 --> 00:00:58.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also mentions the “Field of Abram,”

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the earliest reference in Egyptian records

00:01:01.123 --> 00:01:05.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Biblical patriarch Abraham.

00:01:05.628 --> 00:01:08.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This strengthens our confidence and faith

00:01:08.756 --> 00:01:12.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Bible as God’s Word.

00:01:12.134 --> 00:01:14.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible was written
on perishable materials,

00:01:14.553 --> 00:01:18.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as papyrus and parchment.

00:01:18.057 --> 00:01:20.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While no originals are known to exist today,

00:01:20.684 --> 00:01:23.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the number of ancient copies available now

00:01:23.854 --> 00:01:28.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is staggering:
some 11,000 Hebrew and Greek manuscripts,

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:33.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than for any other
ancient piece of literature.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By comparing the earliest,
most authoritative manuscripts,

00:01:37.952 --> 00:01:41.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
scholars can identify inaccuracies

00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:44.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and mistakes that have crept in.

00:01:44.083 --> 00:01:46.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the vast majority of differences

00:01:46.752 --> 00:01:49.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not change the meaning at all.

00:01:49.254 --> 00:01:51.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One example is found at Luke 4:17,

00:01:51.882 --> 00:01:56.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which says that Jesus
“opened the scroll” of Isaiah.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But some manuscripts say

00:01:58.472 --> 00:02:01.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he “unrolled the scroll.”

00:02:01.684 --> 00:02:04.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But isn’t the meaning the same?

00:02:05.312 --> 00:02:09.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s message has even survived
changes in language.

00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:14.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures
quoted the Hebrew Scriptures,

00:02:14.196 --> 00:02:17.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but often
from the <i>Greek Septuagint</i>  translation.

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:20.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, they paraphrased such quotations,

00:02:20.244 --> 00:02:22.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
using slightly different wording.

00:02:22.496 --> 00:02:25.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the message remained the same.

00:02:25.416 --> 00:02:27.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And most of Jesus’ words,

00:02:27.543 --> 00:02:29.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
likely spoken in first-century Hebrew,

00:02:29.795 --> 00:02:32.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were recorded in Greek.

00:02:32.214 --> 00:02:35.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, his message is clear.

00:02:35.384 --> 00:02:38.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, at least parts of God’s Word

00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:41.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be read in more than 3,000 languages.

00:02:42.766 --> 00:02:44.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible’s survival reveals

00:02:44.518 --> 00:02:46.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a puzzling paradox:

00:02:46.186 --> 00:02:47.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout history,

00:02:47.771 --> 00:02:50.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people were willing to die
to preserve the Bible

00:02:50.441 --> 00:02:53.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and make it available to everyone.

00:02:53.277 --> 00:02:55.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others were willing to kill

00:02:55.654 --> 00:02:58.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prevent access to it
and wipe it out of existence.

00:02:58.907 --> 00:03:00.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:02.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the book’s content.

00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:06.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Word “is alive and exerts power.”

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It changes people’s lives

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:10.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in ways that some welcome

00:03:10.586 --> 00:03:14.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but others resist—violently at times.

00:03:14.923 --> 00:03:19.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, responding
to Roman Emperor Diocletian’s edict

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 303 C.E.

00:03:21.513 --> 00:03:24.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to destroy the sacred Scriptures by fire,”

00:03:24.516 --> 00:03:28.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Felix, a bishop of Thibiuca, reportedly said,

00:03:28.771 --> 00:03:32.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is better for me to be burned
than the sacred Scriptures.”

00:03:32.691 --> 00:03:35.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He paid with his life.

00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:40.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Efforts to destroy God’s message for mankind
continue today,

00:03:40.574 --> 00:03:44.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but the word of our God endures forever.”

Daniel received a prophecy

00:00:07.152 --> 00:00:09.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the coming of two rivals:

00:00:09.154 --> 00:00:11.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the king of the north”

00:00:11.031 --> 00:00:13.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “the king of the south.”

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How has it been fulfilled?

00:00:22.209 --> 00:00:25.212 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In the late 1800’s, the German Empire

00:00:25.212 --> 00:00:27.256 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
became the king of the north.

00:00:27.256 --> 00:00:28.716 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That government brought

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:30.009 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
its “power and . . . heart

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:31.343 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“against the king of the south

00:00:31.343 --> 00:00:33.929 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with a large army.”

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:36.140 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In fact, its navy was

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.601 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the second largest on earth.

00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:43.606 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Who became the king of the south?

00:00:43.606 --> 00:00:45.608 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The alliance between Britain

00:00:45.608 --> 00:00:47.818 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the United States.

00:00:47.818 --> 00:00:49.820 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He fought during World War I

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.822 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“with an exceedingly large

00:00:51.822 --> 00:00:53.699 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and mighty army.”

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.118 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He “swept away” and “humbled”

00:00:56.118 --> 00:00:58.329 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the king of the north.

00:00:59.496 --> 00:01:00.915 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But that was not the end

00:01:00.915 --> 00:01:03.000 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the king of the north.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.127 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He turned his attention to and then hurled

00:01:05.127 --> 00:01:08.130 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“denunciations against the holy covenant.”

00:01:09.757 --> 00:01:12.009 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He removed “the constant feature”

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.011 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by limiting the freedom of God’s people

00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:16.805 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to preach,

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:19.058 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
imprisoning many,

00:01:19.058 --> 00:01:21.060 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and even killing hundreds

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.311 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of God’s anointed ones

00:01:22.311 --> 00:01:24.313 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and their fellow workers.

00:01:26.398 --> 00:01:28.943 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
After Germany was defeated in World War II,

00:01:28.943 --> 00:01:30.945 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Soviet Union

00:01:30.945 --> 00:01:33.030 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
became the king of the north.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.032 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It worked with the king of the south

00:01:35.032 --> 00:01:37.409 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to “put in place the disgusting thing

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.912 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that causes desolation”

00:01:39.912 --> 00:01:42.122 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—the United Nations.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.218 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Beginning in the early 1900’s,

00:01:54.218 --> 00:01:56.512 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Soviet government tried to eliminate

00:01:56.512 --> 00:01:59.139 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
religion in the lands under its control,

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:02.267 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
fulfilling the words

00:02:02.267 --> 00:02:03.852 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that he would “show no regard

00:02:03.852 --> 00:02:06.063 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for the God of his fathers.”

00:02:10.067 --> 00:02:12.945 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He gave glory, not to the God of heaven,

00:02:12.945 --> 00:02:15.823 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but “to the god of fortresses.”

00:02:16.865 --> 00:02:18.450 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
As prophesied,

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.285 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
he used this military might

00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:21.829 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
against the king of the south

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.416 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by engaging “with him in a pushing.”

00:02:25.416 --> 00:02:26.458 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Anglo-America competed

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:27.584 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with the Soviet Union

00:02:27.584 --> 00:02:29.545 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for world domination,

00:02:29.545 --> 00:02:31.672 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
fighting in and supporting wars

00:02:31.672 --> 00:02:34.133 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and political struggles around the globe.

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:42.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991,

00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:45.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was unclear who would fill the role
of the king of the north.

00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:48.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a time, God’s people there

00:02:48.147 --> 00:02:50.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had been able to preach
and worship peacefully.

00:02:52.026 --> 00:02:55.070 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But in recent years, Russia and its allies

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.990 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
have pushed back at the king of the south.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.992 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Both kings have accused each other

00:02:59.992 --> 00:03:03.162 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of destructive cyber and economic attacks.

00:03:04.038 --> 00:03:06.457 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But the king of the north has not limited

00:03:06.457 --> 00:03:08.792 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
his attacks to the king of the south.

00:03:08.792 --> 00:03:10.878 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
As foretold, he also entered

00:03:10.878 --> 00:03:14.256 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“into the land of the Decoration”

00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:16.467 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—our realm of spiritual activity.

00:03:17.885 --> 00:03:19.970 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Today, Russian authorities continue

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.181 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to attack true worship.

00:03:23.932 --> 00:03:27.061 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We expect such persecution,

00:03:27.061 --> 00:03:30.439 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but we also expect it to end.

00:03:48.665 --> 00:03:50.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our King, Jesus Christ,

00:03:50.793 --> 00:03:54.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is more powerful than any human government.

00:03:56.256 --> 00:04:00.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon he will destroy
not only the kings of the north and the south

00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:03.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but all of his enemies,

00:04:03.847 --> 00:04:07.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will deliver God’s loyal people.

Three days before Jesus was put to death,

00:00:12.783 --> 00:00:14.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his disciples posed a question

00:00:14.994 --> 00:00:19.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that has great importance
for all of us today.

00:00:19.582 --> 00:00:21.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They asked Jesus:

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:24.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What will be the sign of your presence

00:00:24.545 --> 00:00:28.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and of the conclusion
of the system of things?”

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In reply, Jesus foretold that a time period

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:33.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
preceding the promised new world

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:37.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be marked by events such as wars,

00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:39.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
earthquakes, food shortages,

00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:42.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pestilence.

00:00:42.354 --> 00:00:44.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus then said:

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For as they were in those days

00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:48.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“before the Flood,

00:00:48.402 --> 00:00:50.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“eating and drinking,

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:51.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“men marrying

00:00:51.238 --> 00:00:53.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and women being given in marriage,

00:00:53.365 --> 00:00:56.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“until the day that Noah entered into the ark,

00:00:56.535 --> 00:00:58.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they took no note

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“until the Flood came

00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:02.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and swept them all away,

00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:06.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so the presence of the Son of man will be.”

00:01:07.922 --> 00:01:09.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With those words,

00:01:09.924 --> 00:01:13.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus confirmed
that Noah was a real person

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:18.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that the Flood
was an actual, historical event.

00:01:18.557 --> 00:01:23.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also warned us
that the period just before the Flood

00:01:23.103 --> 00:01:26.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mirrors the period in which we live today.

00:01:27.608 --> 00:01:32.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s important to consider closely
what happened in Noah’s day

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:34.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to see what we can learn from it.

00:01:35.908 --> 00:01:39.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The opening chapters of the book of Genesis

00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:42.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
give us a picture of what life was like

00:01:42.373 --> 00:01:45.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the centuries prior to Noah

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:48.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—after Adam and Eve were expelled
from the garden of Eden.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone spoke the same language,

00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:57.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and people had possibly
developed the art of writing.

00:01:57.096 --> 00:02:00.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had built a city, maybe several cities.

00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:04.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had learned 
how to forge copper and iron.

00:02:04.687 --> 00:02:06.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They made musical instruments

00:02:06.772 --> 00:02:08.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—harps and flutes.

00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:11.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because they were much closer

00:02:11.694 --> 00:02:14.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the physical perfection of Adam and Eve,

00:02:14.905 --> 00:02:17.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they lived long lives

00:02:17.032 --> 00:02:19.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—hundreds of years.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But all was not well.

00:02:24.123 --> 00:02:26.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People turned away from Jehovah

00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:31.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, as a result,
they became very violent and immoral.

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:33.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Things got so bad

00:02:33.924 --> 00:02:36.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah moved
a righteous man named Enoch,

00:02:36.802 --> 00:02:38.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the seventh man

00:02:38.137 --> 00:02:41.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the genealogical line from Adam,

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prophesy that God
would not forever tolerate

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a wicked and rebellious world;

00:02:47.563 --> 00:02:51.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’d execute judgment against the ungodly.

00:02:52.693 --> 00:02:55.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course,
the ungodly people in Enoch’s day

00:02:55.195 --> 00:02:57.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t like what he was saying.

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They hated Enoch,
and they may have tried to kill him.

00:03:02.578 --> 00:03:06.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enoch never saw the fulfillment
of this prophecy.

00:03:06.915 --> 00:03:09.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another 600 years passed,

00:03:09.585 --> 00:03:13.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and by then conditions on earth
had become even worse.

00:03:15.758 --> 00:03:20.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read Genesis 6:1-7:

00:03:24.725 --> 00:03:27.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now when men started to grow in number

00:03:27.144 --> 00:03:29.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on the surface of the ground

00:03:29.146 --> 00:03:31.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and daughters were born to them,

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the sons of the true God began to notice

00:03:33.901 --> 00:03:36.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that the daughters of men were beautiful.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So they began taking as wives all whom they chose.

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:42.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then Jehovah said:

00:03:42.284 --> 00:03:45.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘My spirit will not tolerate man indefinitely,

00:03:45.954 --> 00:03:48.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘because he is only flesh.

00:03:48.207 --> 00:03:52.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Accordingly, his days will amount to 120 years.’

00:03:52.878 --> 00:03:55.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The Nephilim were on the earth

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:57.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in those days and afterward.

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“During that time the sons of the true God

00:03:59.885 --> 00:04:03.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“continued to have relations with the daughters of men,

00:04:03.222 --> 00:04:05.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and these bore sons to them.

00:04:05.724 --> 00:04:08.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They were the mighty ones of old times,

00:04:08.811 --> 00:04:10.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the men of fame.

00:04:10.813 --> 00:04:14.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Consequently, Jehovah saw that man’s wickedness

00:04:14.274 --> 00:04:16.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“was great on the earth

00:04:16.276 --> 00:04:19.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart

00:04:19.655 --> 00:04:22.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“was only bad all the time.

00:04:22.574 --> 00:04:26.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah regretted that he had made men on the earth,

00:04:26.036 --> 00:04:28.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and his heart was saddened.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So Jehovah said:

00:04:30.207 --> 00:04:33.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I am going to wipe men whom I have created

00:04:33.418 --> 00:04:35.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘off the surface of the ground,

00:04:35.754 --> 00:04:38.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘man together with domestic animals,

00:04:38.215 --> 00:04:40.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 “‘creeping animals,

00:04:40.217 --> 00:04:42.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and flying creatures of the heavens,

00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:45.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for I regret that I have made them.’”

00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:49.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During that time,

00:04:49.643 --> 00:04:51.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some angels from heaven

00:04:51.645 --> 00:04:54.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
noticed beautiful human women

00:04:54.022 --> 00:04:58.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and developed lustful feelings for them.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These angels rebelled against God

00:05:01.196 --> 00:05:04.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by coming to earth and taking on human bodies

00:05:04.825 --> 00:05:08.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to have sex with the women.

00:05:08.829 --> 00:05:12.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They became selfish, wicked demons.

00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:14.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may have been charming,

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
intelligent, handsome,

00:05:16.837 --> 00:05:19.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they had supernatural powers.

00:05:20.632 --> 00:05:22.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They must have been irresistible,

00:05:22.634 --> 00:05:27.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially to women
who themselves had no love of God.

00:05:28.432 --> 00:05:32.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps the angels took some women by force.

00:05:32.436 --> 00:05:36.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever the case,
the angels took “all whom they chose.”

00:05:38.108 --> 00:05:41.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What human on earth at that time

00:05:41.195 --> 00:05:44.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could hope to stop demons?

00:05:44.198 --> 00:05:46.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To these godless creatures,

00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:48.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people lost their daughters,

00:05:48.493 --> 00:05:50.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their sisters,

00:05:50.537 --> 00:05:53.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and possibly even their wives.

00:05:55.584 --> 00:05:57.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The women became pregnant

00:05:57.753 --> 00:06:00.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gave birth to sons,

00:06:00.047 --> 00:06:03.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but their sons were not like other boys.

00:06:03.258 --> 00:06:05.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were stronger.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were bullies
—aggressive, fierce, and brutal.

00:06:11.683 --> 00:06:14.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those qualities stayed with them
as they grew.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The boys became men,

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:20.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they were unusually cruel.

00:06:20.108 --> 00:06:22.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were called Nephilim,

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:27.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
possibly meaning
“those who cause others to fall down,”

00:06:27.074 --> 00:06:29.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and people feared them.

00:06:29.576 --> 00:06:34.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like their fathers,
the Nephilim had no love for God,

00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:38.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they cared only about their fame

00:06:38.043 --> 00:06:40.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for being strong and vicious.

00:06:41.713 --> 00:06:46.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The materialized angels
and their savage offspring

00:06:46.218 --> 00:06:49.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dominated the world of that time,

00:06:49.096 --> 00:06:51.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and people followed their lead.

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:56.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah saw
that man’s wickedness was rampant

00:06:56.812 --> 00:07:00.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and that every inclination
of the thoughts of his heart

00:07:00.607 --> 00:07:03.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was only bad all the time.”

00:07:04.778 --> 00:07:07.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How Satan must have delighted

00:07:07.572 --> 00:07:10.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see most humans reject Jehovah

00:07:10.951 --> 00:07:14.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and become more and more corrupt!

00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:20.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in that world of depraved people,

00:07:20.168 --> 00:07:23.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was a man who was faithful to Jehovah.

00:07:24.464 --> 00:07:29.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read about him at Genesis 6:8:

00:07:32.597 --> 00:07:36.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.

00:07:36.268 --> 00:07:38.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is the history of Noah.

00:07:38.937 --> 00:07:41.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Noah was a righteous man.

00:07:41.356 --> 00:07:44.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He proved himself faultless among his contemporaries.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Noah walked with the true God.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In time Noah became father to three sons,

00:07:52.034 --> 00:07:54.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

00:07:54.911 --> 00:07:57.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the earth had become ruined

00:07:57.289 --> 00:07:59.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the sight of the true God,

00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:02.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the earth was filled with violence.

00:08:02.294 --> 00:08:05.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Yes, God looked upon the earth,

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and it was ruined;

00:08:07.299 --> 00:08:10.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all flesh had ruined its way on the earth.”

00:08:12.596 --> 00:08:17.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some people today say
that there was no such person as Noah

00:08:17.225 --> 00:08:19.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that the account
of the ark and the Flood

00:08:19.978 --> 00:08:23.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are just a legend or a fairy tale.

00:08:23.648 --> 00:08:28.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the Bible writer knew
that Noah really existed

00:08:28.528 --> 00:08:31.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that the Flood truly happened.

00:08:31.698 --> 00:08:36.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel
both refer to Noah.

00:08:36.536 --> 00:08:38.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezra, the writer of First Chronicles,

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:40.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Gospel writer Luke

00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:45.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both include Noah
in the chronologies they compiled.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostles Peter and Paul both confirm

00:08:48.799 --> 00:08:52.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Genesis account of the Flood.

00:08:52.386 --> 00:08:54.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, as we mentioned earlier,

00:08:54.429 --> 00:08:57.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Son of God himself testified

00:08:57.891 --> 00:09:00.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Noah was a real person

00:09:00.644 --> 00:09:04.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that the Flood really happened.

00:09:05.982 --> 00:09:09.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah’s faith was outstanding.

00:09:09.319 --> 00:09:11.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He lived in an evil world

00:09:11.822 --> 00:09:15.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a world dominated
by materialized angels,

00:09:15.325 --> 00:09:19.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their violent offspring,
and a society of ungodly people.

00:09:20.622 --> 00:09:22.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah lacked

00:09:22.081 --> 00:09:24.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many of the things we have today

00:09:24.209 --> 00:09:26.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us keep our faith strong.

00:09:26.795 --> 00:09:30.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had no Bible to help him
to love Jehovah

00:09:30.298 --> 00:09:32.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to understand his ways.

00:09:32.426 --> 00:09:35.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t know
about all the faithful men and women

00:09:35.679 --> 00:09:38.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would live after him.

00:09:38.723 --> 00:09:42.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Noah had no congregation
of fellow believers

00:09:42.018 --> 00:09:46.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to encourage him
and to strengthen his faith.

00:09:46.314 --> 00:09:49.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, Noah knew much.

00:09:50.861 --> 00:09:53.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew what happened in the garden of Eden,

00:09:53.905 --> 00:09:57.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he could see the tragic results.

00:09:57.033 --> 00:10:00.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He saw that people grew old and died.

00:10:00.579 --> 00:10:04.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew that the way
to the garden of Eden was barred

00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:07.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the ground outside had been cursed.

00:10:07.752 --> 00:10:11.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He understood
what his great-grandfather Enoch

00:10:11.381 --> 00:10:13.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had foretold.

00:10:13.508 --> 00:10:16.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Noah knew that his father, Lamech,

00:10:16.011 --> 00:10:20.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had given him a name
likely meaning “rest” or “consolation”

00:10:20.599 --> 00:10:23.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he would, as his father foretold,

00:10:23.602 --> 00:10:26.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“bring us comfort from our labor

00:10:26.021 --> 00:10:29.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and from the painful toil of our hands

00:10:29.524 --> 00:10:33.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the ground
that Jehovah has cursed.”

00:10:34.696 --> 00:10:39.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Surely, Noah wondered about these prophecies.

00:10:39.659 --> 00:10:42.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would he bring comfort?

00:10:42.037 --> 00:10:44.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How and when would God act

00:10:44.122 --> 00:10:47.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against the wicked ones who surrounded him?

00:10:48.502 --> 00:10:53.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For hundreds of years,
Noah prayed and he wondered.

00:10:54.049 --> 00:10:57.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the time he had lived well over 500 years,

00:10:57.636 --> 00:11:01.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had married and had a family
—three sons.

00:11:03.266 --> 00:11:05.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though he lived in a wicked world,

00:11:05.977 --> 00:11:08.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah remained faithful to God,

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he helped his family to do the same.

00:11:12.984 --> 00:11:15.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then Jehovah delivered a message

00:11:15.445 --> 00:11:18.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that surely must have stunned Noah.

00:11:19.157 --> 00:11:24.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s continue reading from Genesis 6:13:

00:11:27.999 --> 00:11:31.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“After that God said to Noah:

00:11:31.836 --> 00:11:35.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I have decided to put an end to all flesh,

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

“‘so I am bringing them to ruin together with the earth.

“that God had commanded him.

00:13:29.204 --> 00:13:31.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did just so.”

00:13:32.999 --> 00:13:35.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah had long wondered

00:13:35.543 --> 00:13:39.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how Jehovah would act
against an ungodly world.

00:13:39.422 --> 00:13:41.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now he knew;

00:13:41.424 --> 00:13:45.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a catastrophic flood would cleanse the earth.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:50.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah also knew
what he and his family must do.

00:13:50.558 --> 00:13:54.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So much depended on him!

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:58.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The thought must have been overwhelming.

00:13:58.233 --> 00:14:01.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The ark would be gigantic.

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:05.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now new questions occupied his mind.

00:14:05.824 --> 00:14:09.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trees, a great many trees,

00:14:09.202 --> 00:14:11.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would have to be felled

00:14:11.204 --> 00:14:14.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the timber hauled, shaped, and joined.

00:14:14.082 --> 00:14:16.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would he do that?

00:14:16.543 --> 00:14:20.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would he gather so many kinds of animals?

00:14:20.171 --> 00:14:22.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would he get food supplies

00:14:22.382 --> 00:14:25.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the animals and for his family?

00:14:27.345 --> 00:14:30.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about the godless people around him?

00:14:30.515 --> 00:14:32.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would they think?

00:14:33.601 --> 00:14:35.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah knew what had happened

00:14:35.979 --> 00:14:38.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the righteous men who preceded him.

00:14:38.898 --> 00:14:42.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Abel had been killed by his brother Cain.

00:14:42.444 --> 00:14:44.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Enoch likely was

00:14:44.528 --> 00:14:47.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in such danger of being slain
by ungodly ones

00:14:47.449 --> 00:14:50.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God mercifully cut his life short

00:14:50.618 --> 00:14:53.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that he wouldn’t fall into their hands.

00:14:53.997 --> 00:14:55.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People would see

00:14:55.664 --> 00:14:57.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what he was doing,

00:14:57.375 --> 00:15:01.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’d soon learn why he was doing it.

00:15:01.212 --> 00:15:04.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These God-dishonoring,
Nephilim-influenced people

00:15:04.466 --> 00:15:06.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might react violently.

00:15:07.719 --> 00:15:10.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, Noah trusted in Jehovah,

00:15:10.472 --> 00:15:12.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he got to work.

00:15:12.766 --> 00:15:16.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did all that God had commanded him.

00:15:16.686 --> 00:15:18.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It took a long time

00:15:18.688 --> 00:15:20.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Noah’s family to build the ark,

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:24.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps some 40 or 50 years.

00:15:24.194 --> 00:15:26.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There must have been challenges,

00:15:26.696 --> 00:15:29.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we never read that Noah complained.

00:15:29.866 --> 00:15:33.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The family had no support from others.

00:15:33.453 --> 00:15:36.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember that Jesus said that the people

00:15:36.122 --> 00:15:40.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“took no note until the Flood came
and swept them all away.”

00:15:41.711 --> 00:15:46.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, people took note
that Noah was building an ark.

00:15:46.257 --> 00:15:48.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His neighbors must have asked him

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:52.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why he was building
such an enormous structure.

00:15:52.764 --> 00:15:56.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Noah explained to them
why he was building it.

00:15:56.518 --> 00:15:59.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Noah’s contemporaries took no note

00:15:59.896 --> 00:16:02.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah was blessing Noah

00:16:02.732 --> 00:16:05.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his construction efforts.

00:16:05.485 --> 00:16:09.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They took no note
of what this would mean for them.

00:16:09.656 --> 00:16:13.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, the people
were caught up in everyday affairs

00:16:13.493 --> 00:16:16.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—eating, drinking, and marrying;

00:16:16.663 --> 00:16:19.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those were the things that concerned them.

00:16:19.791 --> 00:16:21.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To those godless people,

00:16:21.793 --> 00:16:25.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah and his family were fools
—crackpots.

00:16:25.505 --> 00:16:28.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were the butt of ridicule, jeers,

00:16:28.633 --> 00:16:31.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and probably threats.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:36.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The ark was finally completed.

00:16:36.307 --> 00:16:41.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can imagine Noah and his family
looking at it with pride

00:16:41.271 --> 00:16:44.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and remembering how God had helped them.

00:16:44.816 --> 00:16:48.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah always directs
his servants when needed.

00:16:49.821 --> 00:16:53.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now Jehovah spoke again to Noah.

00:16:53.199 --> 00:16:58.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read chapter 7, starting with verse 1:

00:16:59.321 --> 00:17:01.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“After that Jehovah said to Noah:

00:17:01.666 --> 00:17:03.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Go into the ark,

00:17:03.668 --> 00:17:05.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘you and all your household,

00:17:05.753 --> 00:17:07.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘because you are the one I have found

00:17:07.797 --> 00:17:10.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘to be righteous before me among this generation.

00:17:10.717 --> 00:17:12.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘You must take with you

00:17:12.719 --> 00:17:15.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘every kind of clean animal by sevens,

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:18.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘the male and its mate;

00:17:18.016 --> 00:17:22.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and of every animal that is not clean just two,

00:17:22.061 --> 00:17:24.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘the male and its mate;

00:17:24.522 --> 00:17:28.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘also of the flying creatures of the sky by sevens,

00:17:28.401 --> 00:17:30.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘male and female,

00:17:30.445 --> 00:17:34.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘to preserve their offspring alive over all the earth.

00:17:34.198 --> 00:17:36.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘For in just seven days,

00:17:36.492 --> 00:17:38.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I will make it rain on the earth

00:17:38.536 --> 00:17:40.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for 40 days and 40 nights,

00:17:40.622 --> 00:17:43.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and I will wipe from the surface of the ground

00:17:43.166 --> 00:17:46.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“every living thing that I have made.’

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:48.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then Noah did everything

00:17:48.421 --> 00:17:50.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah had commanded him.”

00:17:52.425 --> 00:17:55.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was no time to lose.

00:17:55.261 --> 00:17:57.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was urgent work to do.

00:17:57.972 --> 00:18:01.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In seven days, the rains would come.

00:18:01.017 --> 00:18:05.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Animals, many animals,
had to be situated in the ark.

00:18:05.021 --> 00:18:07.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Supplies had to be secured.

00:18:07.523 --> 00:18:11.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah listened, and he obeyed.

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:14.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the second time in this inspired account,

00:18:14.072 --> 00:18:18.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are told that Noah did all
that he was commanded to do.

00:18:19.702 --> 00:18:24.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now please turn to Genesis 7:6:

00:18:25.984 --> 00:18:28.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Noah was 600 years old

00:18:28.336 --> 00:18:31.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

If Noah had wondered
how he would collect all those animals,

he now knew.

They would come to him.

00:21:53.624 --> 00:21:55.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah would bring them.

strutting, hopping, slithering,

00:22:15.521 --> 00:22:18.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and waddling into the ark!

00:22:18.191 --> 00:22:22.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can imagine Noah’s family
finding places for them all,

stroking the soft fur
of some animals as they passed

while avoiding
the rough hides or spines of others

The birds came too
—fluttering, soaring.

What colors!

00:22:42.173 --> 00:22:43.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What smells!

What sounds!

00:22:45.635 --> 00:22:48.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah and his family must have shouted

00:22:48.054 --> 00:22:51.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to hear one another above the din.

00:22:52.475 --> 00:22:57.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When all were inside, Jehovah shut the door.

—listening, straining to hear?

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then it came.

00:23:08.032 --> 00:23:10.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rain!

00:23:10.451 --> 00:23:13.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps it began almost imperceptibly,

00:23:13.496 --> 00:23:16.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but soon it came in torrents.

00:23:16.207 --> 00:23:18.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sound was deafening.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What they had long anticipated

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:23.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was now happening!

00:23:23.506 --> 00:23:27.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were tired, exhausted,

00:23:27.051 --> 00:23:31.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there was likely little sleep that night.

00:23:32.348 --> 00:23:34.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were animals to check.

00:23:34.684 --> 00:23:36.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was the din of the rain.

00:23:36.852 --> 00:23:39.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how they prayed!

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:44.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did their thoughts turn to those outside?

00:23:44.443 --> 00:23:46.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Certainly.

00:23:46.445 --> 00:23:49.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They knew those people
and had preached to them.

00:23:49.949 --> 00:23:52.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many were relatives.

00:23:52.118 --> 00:23:54.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How sad for them!

00:23:55.746 --> 00:23:57.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Jehovah,

00:23:57.748 --> 00:24:02.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah took no delight
in the death of the wicked.

00:24:02.336 --> 00:24:06.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It saddened him that so many had to die,

00:24:06.007 --> 00:24:08.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he knew that those who perished

00:24:08.843 --> 00:24:12.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had ample warning of what was to come.

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:16.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even if they hadn’t seen
the ark Noah was building,

00:24:16.892 --> 00:24:19.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would have heard about it.

00:24:19.395 --> 00:24:22.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’d know why he was building it.

00:24:22.106 --> 00:24:24.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now it was too late for them.

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:27.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah had shut the door.

00:24:30.156 --> 00:24:35.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah’s family listened as the rain
battered the ark without letup.

00:24:38.122 --> 00:24:40.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then came a moment
they would never forget

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:42.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—movement!

00:24:42.752 --> 00:24:47.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They felt their massive wooden ark
lifting from the ground.

00:24:47.173 --> 00:24:49.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was floating!

00:24:49.884 --> 00:24:53.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their hearts were beating loud and fast.

00:24:53.179 --> 00:24:55.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would their vessel hold together?

00:24:57.224 --> 00:24:59.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s resume our reading

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:03.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Genesis 8:1

00:25:03.147 --> 00:25:05.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see what happened next.

00:25:06.525 --> 00:25:08.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But God gave attention to Noah

00:25:08.861 --> 00:25:12.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and to all the wild animals and domestic animals

00:25:12.156 --> 00:25:14.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that were with him in the ark,

00:25:14.158 --> 00:25:17.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and God caused a wind to blow over the earth,

00:25:17.828 --> 00:25:21.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the waters began to subside.

00:25:21.123 --> 00:25:23.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The springs of the watery deep

00:25:23.292 --> 00:25:26.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the floodgates of the heavens were stopped up,

00:25:26.295 --> 00:25:30.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so the rain from the heavens stopped falling.

00:25:30.091 --> 00:25:32.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then the waters began

00:25:32.093 --> 00:25:35.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to recede progressively from the earth.

00:25:35.054 --> 00:25:37.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By the end of 150 days,

00:25:37.932 --> 00:25:40.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the waters had subsided.

00:25:40.142 --> 00:25:42.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the seventh month,

00:25:42.144 --> 00:25:44.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on the 17th day of the month,

00:25:44.522 --> 00:25:48.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.

00:25:48.401 --> 00:25:51.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And the waters were steadily decreasing

00:25:51.862 --> 00:25:53.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“until the tenth month.

00:25:53.906 --> 00:25:56.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the tenth month, on the first of the month,

00:25:56.909 --> 00:26:00.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the tops of the mountains appeared.

00:26:00.079 --> 00:26:02.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So at the end of 40 days,

00:26:02.331 --> 00:26:05.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Noah opened the window that he had made in the ark

00:26:05.626 --> 00:26:08.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and sent out a raven;

00:26:08.003 --> 00:26:11.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it continued flying outside and returning,

00:26:11.507 --> 00:26:14.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“until the waters dried off the earth.

00:26:14.593 --> 00:26:17.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Later he sent out a dove

00:26:17.138 --> 00:26:19.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to see whether the waters had receded

00:26:19.473 --> 00:26:21.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from the surface of the ground.

00:26:21.642 --> 00:26:24.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The dove did not find any resting-place to perch,

00:26:24.728 --> 00:26:27.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so it returned to him into the ark

00:26:27.189 --> 00:26:29.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because the waters were still covering

00:26:29.567 --> 00:26:32.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the surface of the whole earth.

00:26:32.027 --> 00:26:34.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So he reached his hand out

00:26:34.238 --> 00:26:36.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and brought it inside the ark.

00:26:36.907 --> 00:26:39.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He waited seven more days,

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:43.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and once again he sent out the dove from the ark.

00:26:43.289 --> 00:26:45.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When the dove came to him toward evening,

00:26:45.708 --> 00:26:47.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he saw that there was

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:50.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a freshly plucked olive leaf in its bill!

00:26:50.838 --> 00:26:53.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So Noah knew that the waters

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:55.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“had receded from the earth.

00:26:55.593 --> 00:26:58.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He waited still another seven days.

00:26:58.637 --> 00:27:01.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then he sent out the dove,

00:27:01.724 --> 00:27:05.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it did not return to him anymore.”

00:27:06.145 --> 00:27:08.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For 40 days and 40 nights,

00:27:08.856 --> 00:27:12.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the noise of torrential rain filled the ark,

00:27:12.026 --> 00:27:14.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then it stopped.

00:27:15.738 --> 00:27:18.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine Noah
and his family peering out of the ark

00:27:18.449 --> 00:27:20.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seeing nothing but water,

00:27:20.451 --> 00:27:22.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no land anywhere.

00:27:22.661 --> 00:27:26.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A wind blew, and the waters subsided.

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:32.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, 150 days after the downpour began,

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:35.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the ark settled on land.

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:38.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a happy day that must have been!

00:27:39.428 --> 00:27:41.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was it safe to go out?

00:27:41.722 --> 00:27:43.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:27:43.766 --> 00:27:47.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The waters had to subside further.

00:27:47.686 --> 00:27:51.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was plenty to do
to keep the family busy.

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:54.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were animals to feed and to care for.

00:27:54.902 --> 00:27:58.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, Noah’s family
must have longed to be outside,

00:27:58.906 --> 00:28:01.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be free of the confinement,

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:04.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to feel the ground under their feet.

00:28:04.662 --> 00:28:07.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Patience was needed.

00:28:07.081 --> 00:28:10.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Picture the family spending time together,

00:28:10.251 --> 00:28:14.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
planning what they’d do
when they came out of the ark.

00:28:14.171 --> 00:28:18.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another 73 days passed.

00:28:18.217 --> 00:28:21.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now they could see the tops of the mountains.

00:28:22.763 --> 00:28:26.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now was it safe to exit?

00:28:26.225 --> 00:28:28.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah peered out of a window.

00:28:28.727 --> 00:28:31.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He selected from the birds a raven,

00:28:31.313 --> 00:28:35.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he sent it out, but it kept returning.

00:28:35.192 --> 00:28:37.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah put the raven back in its place

00:28:37.528 --> 00:28:39.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and selected a dove.

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:41.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It too flew and returned,

00:28:41.824 --> 00:28:44.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not having found a place to perch.

00:28:44.868 --> 00:28:47.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A week later, he released it again,

00:28:47.538 --> 00:28:51.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it returned
with an olive leaf in its bill.

00:28:52.167 --> 00:28:55.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seven days later, Noah sent it again.

00:28:55.629 --> 00:28:59.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time it did not return.

00:28:59.675 --> 00:29:02.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What next?

00:29:02.428 --> 00:29:07.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s continue reading
from chapter 8, verse 13:

00:29:09.101 --> 00:29:13.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now in the 601st year, in the first month,

00:29:13.314 --> 00:29:15.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on the first day of the month,

00:29:15.524 --> 00:29:18.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the waters had drained from the earth;

00:29:18.319 --> 00:29:21.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and Noah removed the covering of the ark

00:29:21.655 --> 00:29:24.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and saw that the surface of the ground was drying.

00:29:24.867 --> 00:29:26.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the second month,

00:29:26.869 --> 00:29:28.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on the 27th day of the month,

00:29:28.954 --> 00:29:31.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the earth had dried off.

00:29:31.248 --> 00:29:33.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God now said to Noah:

00:29:33.834 --> 00:29:37.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Go out of the ark, you, your wife,

“‘your sons, and your sons’ wives.

“‘Bring out with you all the living creatures

“‘that they may multiply on the earth

00:29:52.186 --> 00:29:55.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and be fruitful and become many on the earth.’

00:29:55.606 --> 00:29:59.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So Noah went out, together with his sons,

“his wife, and his sons’ wives.

00:30:02.404 --> 00:30:06.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Every living creature, every creeping animal

“and every flying creature,

“everything that moves on the earth,

00:30:10.579 --> 00:30:13.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“went out of the ark by families.

00:30:13.707 --> 00:30:16.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then Noah built an altar to Jehovah

00:30:16.752 --> 00:30:19.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and took some of all the clean animals

00:30:19.088 --> 00:30:21.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and of all the clean flying creatures

00:30:21.632 --> 00:30:25.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and offered burnt offerings on the altar.

00:30:25.094 --> 00:30:29.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And Jehovah began to smell a pleasing aroma.

00:30:29.348 --> 00:30:32.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So Jehovah said in his heart:

00:30:32.768 --> 00:30:35.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Never again will I curse the ground

“‘From now on,

and day and night.’”

00:31:02.131 --> 00:31:05.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the dove didn’t return,

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:09.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah removed part of the roof of the ark.

00:31:09.012 --> 00:31:12.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now he could see
that much of the land had dried out.

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:17.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Possibly, he could see
vegetation growing and flourishing

00:31:17.271 --> 00:31:19.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way that it hadn’t been possible

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:23.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the days before the Flood,
when the earth had been cursed.

00:31:23.318 --> 00:31:27.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, Noah waited for Jehovah’s direction.

00:31:28.699 --> 00:31:32.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then it came, Jehovah’s command:

00:31:32.911 --> 00:31:34.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go out of the ark.”

00:31:34.913 --> 00:31:36.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At last!

00:31:38.208 --> 00:31:41.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a joyful day that must have been!

00:31:41.795 --> 00:31:45.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’d been in the ark for 370 days.

00:31:46.467 --> 00:31:49.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Picture the family coming out of the ark

00:31:49.219 --> 00:31:52.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—laughing, breathing fresh air,

00:31:52.848 --> 00:31:56.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
eager to adjust to their new life.

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:58.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The animals came out too,

00:31:58.896 --> 00:32:03.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the family watched
as they dispersed in all directions.

00:32:03.525 --> 00:32:05.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some they had drawn close to,

00:32:05.526 --> 00:32:07.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now it was farewell

00:32:07.863 --> 00:32:10.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a happy farewell.

00:32:10.908 --> 00:32:13.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were no materialized angels,

00:32:13.577 --> 00:32:17.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no Nephilim, and no wicked people.

00:32:18.707 --> 00:32:22.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How grateful they were to Jehovah!

00:32:23.253 --> 00:32:25.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah wasted no time.

00:32:25.714 --> 00:32:28.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He built an altar and sacrificed to Jehovah,

00:32:28.926 --> 00:32:32.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and God expressed his pleasure.

00:32:33.305 --> 00:32:35.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah assured the family

00:32:35.724 --> 00:32:40.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he would never again strike down
every living thing.

00:32:41.438 --> 00:32:44.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he did more than that.

00:32:44.399 --> 00:32:48.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He concluded a covenant
with Noah and his sons

00:32:48.362 --> 00:32:52.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gave them a sign
that we too can observe.

00:32:53.283 --> 00:32:56.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read about it at Genesis chapter 9,

00:32:56.745 --> 00:32:59.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
starting with verse 8:

00:33:00.624 --> 00:33:04.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him:

00:33:04.711 --> 00:33:08.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I am now establishing my covenant with you

00:33:08.257 --> 00:33:10.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and with your offspring after you,

00:33:10.926 --> 00:33:14.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and with every living creature that is with you,

00:33:14.221 --> 00:33:16.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘the birds, the animals,

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:19.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and all the living creatures of the earth with you,

00:33:19.351 --> 00:33:22.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘all those that came out of the ark

00:33:22.062 --> 00:33:24.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘—every living creature of the earth.

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:28.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Yes, I establish my covenant with you:

“‘Never again will all flesh be destroyed

00:33:31.697 --> 00:33:33.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘by the waters of a flood,

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:37.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and never again will a flood bring the earth to ruin.’

00:33:37.536 --> 00:33:39.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And God added:

00:33:39.538 --> 00:33:41.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘This is the sign of the covenant

00:33:41.748 --> 00:33:44.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘that I am making between me and you

00:33:44.084 --> 00:33:46.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and every living creature that is with you,

00:33:46.753 --> 00:33:49.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for all future generations.

00:33:49.882 --> 00:33:52.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I put my rainbow in the cloud,

00:33:52.843 --> 00:33:55.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and it will serve as a sign of the covenant

00:33:55.888 --> 00:33:58.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘between me and the earth.

00:33:58.724 --> 00:34:01.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Whenever I bring a cloud over the earth,

00:34:01.518 --> 00:34:04.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘then the rainbow will certainly appear in the cloud.

00:34:04.855 --> 00:34:08.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And I will certainly remember my covenant

00:34:08.108 --> 00:34:10.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘that I made between me and you

00:34:10.819 --> 00:34:14.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and every living creature of every kind;

00:34:14.281 --> 00:34:16.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and never again will the waters

“‘And the rainbow will occur in the cloud,

“‘between God and every living creature

of every kind on the earth.’”

00:34:34.635 --> 00:34:39.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a magnificent sign Jehovah gave!

00:34:39.056 --> 00:34:41.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every rainbow would remind

00:34:41.683 --> 00:34:45.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both God and man of his promise.

00:34:45.604 --> 00:34:48.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How Noah’s family must have marveled

00:34:48.565 --> 00:34:52.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see the colors spanning across the sky

00:34:52.861 --> 00:34:57.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—violet, indigo, blue, green,
yellow, orange, and red!

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:05.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never again will a flood deluge the earth.

00:35:06.375 --> 00:35:10.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah is not one
to tolerate wickedness forever.

00:35:11.755 --> 00:35:15.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read what the apostle Peter wrote.

00:35:15.384 --> 00:35:20.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn to 2 Peter 2:5.

00:35:20.931 --> 00:35:23.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle wrote:

00:35:23.725 --> 00:35:26.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he [God] did not refrain

00:35:26.687 --> 00:35:28.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from punishing an ancient world,

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:31.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but kept Noah, a preacher of righteousness,

00:35:31.984 --> 00:35:35.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“safe with seven others when he brought a flood

00:35:35.487 --> 00:35:38.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
upon a world of ungodly people.”

00:35:40.867 --> 00:35:45.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, we live in a world
that resembles the one before the Flood.

00:35:46.665 --> 00:35:48.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s violence,

00:35:48.667 --> 00:35:52.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and people do
all sorts of things that Jehovah hates.

00:35:53.755 --> 00:35:57.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People are concerned
with the everyday affairs of life

00:35:57.467 --> 00:36:01.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take no note of the message of salvation

00:36:01.888 --> 00:36:03.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we proclaim.

00:36:04.891 --> 00:36:08.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ridiculers of God’s people mockingly say:

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:11.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Where is this promised presence of his?

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:15.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why, . . . all things are continuing exactly

00:36:15.235 --> 00:36:18.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they were from creation’s beginning.”

00:36:19.072 --> 00:36:22.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are wrong.

00:36:22.451 --> 00:36:26.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah acted against wickedness
in the time of Noah,

00:36:26.288 --> 00:36:28.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and He’ll act again.

00:36:29.416 --> 00:36:34.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, like Noah, the faithful will be saved.

00:36:34.337 --> 00:36:36.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Word assures us:

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:39.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah knows how to rescue

00:36:39.426 --> 00:36:43.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“people of godly devotion out of trial,

00:36:43.472 --> 00:36:45.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but to reserve unrighteous people

00:36:45.766 --> 00:36:49.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be destroyed on the day of judgment.”

00:36:51.354 --> 00:36:54.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will make the earth a paradise,

00:36:54.608 --> 00:36:57.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as he originally purposed.

00:36:57.861 --> 00:37:01.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Paradise will be inhabited
by good people.

00:37:01.573 --> 00:37:05.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There will be no people
who rebel against God.

00:37:05.577 --> 00:37:09.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what of the rebellious spirit creatures?

00:37:09.498 --> 00:37:12.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the flood deluged the earth
in Noah’s day,

00:37:12.709 --> 00:37:15.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the rebellious angels left their human bodies

00:37:15.754 --> 00:37:19.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and returned to the spirit realm in disgrace.

00:37:20.967 --> 00:37:24.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, these demons have continued to exert

00:37:24.596 --> 00:37:28.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an evil influence on humans down to this day.

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:31.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when Jehovah acts again,

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:34.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the demons and their ruler, Satan,

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:37.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be put out of action.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Word of God says this:

00:37:42.823 --> 00:37:45.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By faith Noah,

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“after receiving divine warning

00:37:47.285 --> 00:37:49.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of things not yet seen,

00:37:49.329 --> 00:37:52.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“showed godly fear and constructed an ark

00:37:52.207 --> 00:37:55.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the saving of his household.”

00:37:56.044 --> 00:37:59.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith moved Noah to obey Jehovah.

00:37:59.589 --> 00:38:03.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result,
he and his family survived the Flood.

00:38:04.469 --> 00:38:09.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noah lived a long life, some 950 years.

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:13.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when that faithful man is resurrected,

00:38:13.353 --> 00:38:17.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’ll have the prospect of living forever.

00:38:19.359 --> 00:38:22.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we display the faith of Noah
and obey Jehovah,

00:38:22.863 --> 00:38:27.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we too can walk
with Jehovah as our Friend

00:38:27.033 --> 00:38:31.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and that friendship can last forever!

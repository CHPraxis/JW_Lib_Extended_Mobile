Many religions teach that God condemns

00:00:07.736 --> 00:00:10.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the wicked to eternal torment after they die

00:00:10.948 --> 00:00:13.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hope that this fear of torment

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prevents them from doing bad.

00:00:16.787 --> 00:00:19.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does God really punish people after they die?

00:00:33.053 --> 00:00:35.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible reassures us

00:00:35.306 --> 00:00:37.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the dead are unconscious

00:00:37.349 --> 00:00:39.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that “[they] know nothing at all.”

00:00:39.768 --> 00:00:42.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the dead are unconscious,

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they cannot suffer.

00:00:44.815 --> 00:00:47.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does that mean God does not

00:00:47.276 --> 00:00:49.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
punish wicked people at all?

00:00:49.403 --> 00:00:51.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:00:51.071 --> 00:00:54.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God explained to the first human couple

00:00:54.074 --> 00:00:57.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how they would be punished
if they rebelled against him.

00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:05.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God said nothing about torment or hell.

00:01:05.377 --> 00:01:07.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He simply said:

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:10.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You will certainly die.”

00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:13.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after being expelled
from the garden of Eden,

00:01:13.886 --> 00:01:18.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is exactly what happened
to wicked Adam and Eve

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they passed away and became dust.

00:01:21.435 --> 00:01:23.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible says that after death,

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one is no longer accountable
for past mistakes

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because “the one who has died 

00:01:29.777 --> 00:01:31.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been acquitted from his sin.”

00:01:32.655 --> 00:01:34.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there is an even greater reason

00:01:34.657 --> 00:01:37.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why a hell of torment could never exist.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible tells us:
“God is love.”

00:01:43.123 --> 00:01:47.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would a loving God command
that sinners be tormented,

00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:52.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just for minutes, but for all eternity?

00:01:52.257 --> 00:01:55.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider the following:

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:59.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Bible times, God condemned the practice

00:01:59.515 --> 00:02:03.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of sacrificing children
in the fire to false gods.

00:02:04.895 --> 00:02:08.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that such a cruel deed

00:02:08.148 --> 00:02:10.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘never even entered his heart.’

00:02:12.528 --> 00:02:15.531 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We hate the idea of such brutality

00:02:15.531 --> 00:02:17.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we are made in the image

00:02:17.616 --> 00:02:20.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a loving, merciful God.

00:02:21.704 --> 00:02:25.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, we do not need to worry
that our dead loved ones

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:27.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might be suffering punishment somewhere.

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:33.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible tells us
that they are at peace, at rest.

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:38.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why do good people die?

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What happens to them when they die?

00:02:42.016 --> 00:02:45.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What hope is there for our dead loved ones?

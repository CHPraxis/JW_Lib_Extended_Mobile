00:00:05 Ever since the first humans rejected Jehovah God as Ruler,
00:00:09 our world has been plagued with evil and suffering.
00:00:14 But Jesus offered hope.
00:00:16 He taught that as King of God’s Kingdom,
00:00:19 he would restore peace and justice to the earth.
00:00:22 But when would that Kingdom begin to rule?
00:00:25 According to the Bible, it is ruling right now!
00:00:29 How do we know that?
00:00:31 Consider what happened over 2,600 years ago.
00:00:37 Jehovah God caused Nebuchadnezzar,
00:00:40 a King of ancient Babylon,
00:00:42 to have a prophetic dream.
00:00:44 In the dream,
00:00:45 Nebuchadnezzar saw a giant tree
00:00:48 that reached all the way to heaven.
00:00:50 The tree was cut down,
00:00:52 but its stump was left in the ground.
00:00:55 After a period of “seven times,”
00:00:57 the tree grew again.
00:01:01 The Bible indicates that this dream
00:01:03 would have two fulfillments.
00:01:06 The first had to do
00:01:08 with King Nebuchadnezzar himself.
00:01:10 He was very prominent
00:01:12 —like the tree that reached
00:01:14 all the way to heaven.
00:01:15 But he was cut down for “seven times.”
00:01:19 This happened when Nebuchadnezzar
00:01:21 lost his sanity for seven years.
00:01:25 During that time,
00:01:26 he was unable to rule as king.
00:01:30 At the end of the seven times,
00:01:32 Nebuchadnezzar regained his sanity
00:01:34 and started ruling again.
00:01:37 That was the first fulfillment of this prophecy.
00:01:42 What was the second fulfillment?
00:01:44 It had to do with God’s rulership.
00:01:49 The Bible says that kings in ancient Israel
00:01:52 “sat on Jehovah’s throne.”
00:01:55 In other words,
00:01:56 they represented God and his rulership.
00:02:01 However, most of those kings
00:02:04 became disobedient to Jehovah
00:02:06 and so did most of their subjects.
00:02:09 Because of their disobedience,
00:02:12 God allowed the Israelites
00:02:13 to be conquered by the Babylonians,
00:02:16 who destroyed the city of Jerusalem
00:02:18 in 607 B.C.E.
00:02:21 From that time on,
00:02:23 no more kings represented Jehovah
00:02:26 in Jerusalem.
00:02:28 Thus, 607 B.C.E.
00:02:31 marked the beginning of the seven times,
00:02:34 or the period when God’s rulership
00:02:36 would be interrupted.
00:02:38 That period would last
00:02:40 until Jehovah installed
00:02:41 a new king to represent Him
00:02:43 —this time, someone in heaven.
00:02:47 When would that happen?
00:02:49 In the second fulfillment of this prophecy,
00:02:52 the seven times must be
00:02:54 more than seven literal years.
00:02:56 How do we know?
00:02:58 For one thing, nothing significant
00:03:01 relating to God’s rulership happened
00:03:03 seven years after Jerusalem was destroyed.
00:03:07 And centuries later,
00:03:09 Jesus indicated that the seven times
00:03:12 had not yet ended.
00:03:14 In a prophecy about the last days,
00:03:17 Jesus said that Jerusalem,
00:03:19 or God’s rulership,
00:03:21 would “be trampled on by the nations
00:03:23 “until the appointed times of the nations
00:03:26 are fulfilled.”
00:03:28 “The appointed times of the nations”
00:03:31 are the same as the “seven times.”
00:03:34 When would those “times” end?
00:03:37 The Bible book of Revelation says
00:03:40 that three and a half times
00:03:43 equal 1,260 days.
00:03:47 So seven times is double that number,
00:03:49 or 2,520 days.
00:03:53 In Bible prophecy,
00:03:55 a day can represent a year.
00:03:58 That is the case with the prophecy
00:04:00 about the seven times.
00:04:03 They represent 2,520 years.
00:04:09 Counting forward from 607 B.C.E.,
00:04:13 2,520 years
00:04:15 takes us to the year 1914
00:04:19 —the year that the seven times ended
00:04:22 and Jesus began ruling from heaven
00:04:24 as King of God’s Kingdom.
00:04:27 That began a period
00:04:29 that the Bible calls “the last days.”
00:04:33 Soon,
00:04:35 Jesus will finish gathering
00:04:37 the rest of his corulers to join him in heaven.
00:04:39 God’s Kingdom will then undo every problem
00:04:44 that afflicts us and our families.
00:04:47 Imagine living there
00:04:49 under the rulership of a King
00:04:51 who really cares about you!

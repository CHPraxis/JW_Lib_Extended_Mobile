00:00:05 In Japan, we noticed
00:00:07 that we weren’t really reaching the younger generation in our field ministry.
00:00:12 However, Tokyo
00:00:14 is a place where many come for work and to go to school.
00:00:21 So the Japan branch planned
00:00:23 a special preaching campaign
00:00:24 for the Tokyo city area.
00:00:28 More than 26,000 publishers applied for this campaign.
00:00:32 This was a nice surprise.
00:00:34 The publishers were given personal territories
00:00:37 so they could be flexible
00:00:39 in deciding when it would be most effective to reach people.
00:00:44 I realized that city people were out
00:00:45 and about in the evenings,
00:00:47 so I decided to try to start witnessing at 7:00 p.m.
00:00:51 We reached people living
00:00:54 in high-security apartment buildings through informal witnessing,
00:00:57 and some even accepted Bible studies.
00:01:00 We were amazed when we learned
00:01:04 that 2,389 Bible studies
00:01:06 had been started in just four weeks!
00:01:09 Thanks to this campaign,
00:01:11 I now know that there are still many here
00:01:14 in my territory who would agree to a Bible study.
00:01:17 It was wonderful!
00:01:20 You could see Jehovah’s rich blessing on the brothers and sisters
00:01:24 who stepped out of their comfort zones
00:01:26 to try to meet as many as they could.

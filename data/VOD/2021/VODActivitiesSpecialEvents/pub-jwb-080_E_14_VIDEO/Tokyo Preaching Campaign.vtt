In Japan, we noticed

00:00:07.903 --> 00:00:11.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we weren’t really reaching
the younger generation in our field ministry.

00:00:12.783 --> 00:00:14.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, Tokyo

00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:18.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a place where many come
for work and to go to school.

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:23.002 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So the Japan branch planned

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:24.795 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a special preaching campaign

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:27.339 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for the Tokyo city area.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than 26,000 publishers
applied for this campaign.

00:00:32.303 --> 00:00:34.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was a nice surprise.

00:00:34.805 --> 00:00:37.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The publishers
were given personal territories

00:00:37.558 --> 00:00:39.894 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so they could be flexible

00:00:39.894 --> 00:00:41.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in deciding when it would be
most effective to reach people.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.983 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I realized that city people were out

00:00:45.983 --> 00:00:47.359 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and about in the evenings,

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:50.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I decided to try
to start witnessing at 7:00 p.m.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.116 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We reached people living

00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:57.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in high-security apartment buildings
through informal witnessing,

00:00:57.036 --> 00:01:00.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some even accepted Bible studies.

00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:04.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were amazed when we learned

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:06.170 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that 2,389 Bible studies

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.339 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
had been started in just four weeks!

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.634 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to this campaign,

00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:14.053 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I now know that there are still many here

00:01:14.053 --> 00:01:17.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in my territory
who would agree to a Bible study.

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:19.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was wonderful!

00:01:20.809 --> 00:01:24.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could see Jehovah’s rich blessing
on the brothers and sisters

00:01:24.438 --> 00:01:26.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who stepped out of their comfort zones

00:01:26.523 --> 00:01:29.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to try to meet as many as they could.

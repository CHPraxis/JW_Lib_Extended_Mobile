00:00:06 During the months of December 2017
00:00:09 and January 2018,
00:00:11 we were thrilled to have over 100
00:00:14 Karen-S’gaw-speaking campaign volunteers
00:00:17 from Australia, Thailand, and the United States
00:00:21 join our local Karen-S’gaw-speaking publishers.
00:00:26 The Karen field here in Myanmar
00:00:28 has progressed quickly.
00:00:29 However, the majority of Karen people here
00:00:32 have not yet had an opportunity to hear the good news.
00:00:35 So when they see
00:00:36 the Bible literature or video
00:00:38 in their language, it touches their heart.
00:00:41 One man that we met in our ministry
00:00:42 used to chew betel nut,
00:00:44 but he realized God did not approve.
00:00:46 So he prayed to God for help,
00:00:49 and he was able to quit betel nut with God’s help.
00:00:55 Serving in the Karen S’gaw field in Myanmar
00:00:57 is really a dream come true for me.
00:00:59 There are challenges and adjustments,
00:01:02 but they’re nothing compared to all the blessings I have gained.
00:01:05 The preaching campaign was a real success.
00:01:08 As a result, many new Bible studies were started
00:01:12 and we have also located the areas with the greatest potential of growth.
00:01:16 It is very, very exciting.
00:01:19 The clear evidence of Jehovah’s spirit
00:01:21 on the campaign arrangements
00:01:24 has led us to the conclusion
00:01:26 that “God had summoned us to declare the good news”
00:01:28 among the Karen S’gaw people.

and January 2018,

00:00:11.991 --> 00:00:14.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were thrilled to have over 100

Karen-S’gaw-speaking campaign volunteers

The Karen field here in Myanmar

00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:29.842 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
has progressed quickly.

00:00:29.842 --> 00:00:32.761 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
However, the majority of Karen people here

00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:35.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have not yet had an opportunity
to hear the good news.

00:00:35.764 --> 00:00:36.807 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So when they see

00:00:36.807 --> 00:00:38.225 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Bible literature or video

00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:41.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their language, it touches their heart.

One man that we met in our ministry

00:00:42.563 --> 00:00:44.189 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
used to chew betel nut,

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:46.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he realized God did not approve.

00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:49.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he prayed to God for help,

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:51.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was able
to quit betel nut with God’s help.

Serving in the Karen S’gaw field in Myanmar

00:00:57.494 --> 00:00:59.538 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is really a dream come true for me.

00:00:59.538 --> 00:01:02.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are challenges and adjustments,

00:01:02.207 --> 00:01:05.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they’re nothing compared
to all the blessings I have gained.

00:01:05.377 --> 00:01:08.172 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The preaching campaign was a real success.

00:01:08.172 --> 00:01:12.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result,
many new Bible studies were started

00:01:12.092 --> 00:01:15.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we have also located the areas
with the greatest potential of growth.

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:19.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is very, very exciting.

The clear evidence of Jehovah’s spirit

on the campaign arrangements

00:01:24.104 --> 00:01:26.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has led us to the conclusion

00:01:26.523 --> 00:01:28.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “God had summoned us
to declare the good news”

00:01:28.817 --> 00:01:31.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
among the Karen S’gaw people.

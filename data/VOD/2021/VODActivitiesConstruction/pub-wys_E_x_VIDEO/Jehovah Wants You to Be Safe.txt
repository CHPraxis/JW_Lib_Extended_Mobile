00:00:05 From ancient times, Jehovah has directed his people to build.
00:00:12 The joyful work of constructing
00:00:15 and remodeling buildings
00:00:16 to advance pure worship
00:00:17 has continued in our time.
00:00:21 But who could have anticipated the tremendous scale and need
00:00:26 for today’s worldwide building work,
00:00:29 requiring so many volunteers,
00:00:31 tools, equipment,
00:00:34 and often working in challenging situations?
00:00:37 With all this building comes
00:00:40 the risk of accidents that can result in serious injury.
00:00:45 That’s why we, as Jehovah’s people,
00:00:47 care deeply about protecting
00:00:49 the lives and safety of all our fellow construction volunteers.
00:00:55 This is not a hypothetical consideration.
00:00:58 Sadly, some of our brothers and sisters have experienced
00:01:01 serious injuries while volunteering on projects
00:01:04 —some, the most serious imaginable.
00:01:07 Our Global Life Safety and Loss Prevention Guidelines
00:01:12 clearly state:
00:01:14 “Our goal is to have an accident-free environment
00:01:17 “with minimum loss . . .
00:01:20 “This zero-accident goal can be accomplished
00:01:23 “if each one realizes that his attitude
00:01:26 “toward [the] life safety and loss prevention
00:01:28 reflects his spirituality.”
00:01:31 How can we accomplish this?
00:01:33 Let’s consider three important aspects:
00:01:37 our attitude toward our work,
00:01:39 how we plan for it,
00:01:41 and how we work to avoid potential danger.
00:01:44 First, our attitude.
00:01:45 Proverbs 16:18 tells us:
00:01:48 “Pride is before a crash,
00:01:50 and a haughty spirit before stumbling.”
00:01:56 No matter how skilled or experienced we may be,
00:01:59 we need to humbly follow safety direction.
00:02:05 We also need to show modesty if we’re inexperienced
00:02:09 and let others train us properly
00:02:11 before we begin to work with unfamiliar equipment.
00:02:16 Ecclesiastes 10:9 tells us:
00:02:18 “The one who quarries stones may be hurt by them,
00:02:22 and the one who splits logs may be endangered by them.”
00:02:28 Many aspects of construction are inherently dangerous.
00:02:32 This underscores our second aspect:
00:02:35 the need to plan wisely.
00:02:37 How can we plan for a safe work experience?
00:02:41 We have tools to help.
00:02:44 The guideline Working Together Safely
00:02:46 provides standards for our construction
00:02:48 and maintenance projects.
00:02:51 It also reminds us of our personal responsibility.
00:02:54 Are you familiar with its sound guidance?
00:02:57 Our Job Hazard Analysis forms for maintenance and construction
00:03:01 help us anticipate potential safety risks.
00:03:06 Let’s examine just a few of the potential dangers
00:03:10 it helps us to foresee in advance of working on a project.
00:03:18 This pipe here has a leak and needs to be fixed.
00:03:21 We’re going to have to do a weld here, I’m afraid.
00:03:23 Well, we’ll have to insulate this part here, in between the wall and the pipe.
00:03:26 OK.
00:03:27 Otherwise, we’ll end up creating a fire hazard here in the Kingdom Hall.
00:03:30 I see! Let me write that down.
00:03:32 I was thinking, too, we should assign someone
00:03:35 to stand by with a fire extinguisher while the weld is being done.
00:03:38 You’re right.
00:03:39 And also I think we should put someone on fire-hazard duty
00:03:43 to make sure nothing catches fire after the weld is done.
00:03:45 Mm. I agree. Good idea.
00:03:48 Perfect.
00:03:49 I’ll go ahead and make the assignments then.
00:03:51 OK, I’ll get things ready here.
00:03:52 Let’s do it.
00:03:58 I think that here the brothers are going to need safety boots
00:04:00 so that they don’t slip and fall.
00:04:02 They’re also going to need safety harnesses since they’ll be up pretty high.
00:04:06 What do you think?
00:04:07 Do you remember if all the brothers assigned were trained to work with safety harnesses?
00:04:12 We’re also going to need a support team
00:04:14 to be ready to help in case of an accident.
00:04:16 It would be best if we could have less people up on the roof.
00:04:19 But it’s impossible to inspect things from down here, right?
00:04:23 I have an idea.
00:04:24 What if we put a camera on a long pole
00:04:27 and do the inspection from down here?
00:04:30 We can check everything out from one end to the other.
00:04:32 OK! Great idea, sounds good.
00:04:34 This wise planning reflects the third aspect
00:04:37 of achieving our zero-accident goal:
00:04:40 Pay close attention to direction
00:04:43 so we can work to eliminate or avoid danger.
00:04:58 When working on a large project
00:05:00 or a smaller one, including maintenance work,
00:05:06 the right attitude, planning, and actions
00:05:09 will help keep our brothers and sisters safe.
00:05:13 So remember the steps we can take to ensure safety.
00:05:17 First, have Jehovah’s view of things.
00:05:19 Life is precious.
00:05:22 Second, be wise and anticipate the potential hazards.
00:05:26 And third,
00:05:27 once you anticipate a risk,
00:05:30 take precautions to remove or reduce it.
00:05:34 Never forget how serious maintaining safety is.
00:05:38 It demonstrates obedience to Jehovah
00:05:41 and affects our relationship with him.
00:05:44 While we are working on theocratic building projects,
00:05:48 we cannot expect miraculous protection.
00:05:52 Just as Jehovah wants us to exert ourselves
00:05:54 in preaching to others to help save lives,
00:05:58 he requires us to work obediently
00:06:00 to protect our fellow volunteers.
00:06:03 Jehovah tells us in Proverbs:
00:06:06 “Safeguard practical wisdom and thinking ability;
00:06:09 “they will give you life and be an adornment for your neck;
00:06:13 then you will walk on your way in safety.”
00:06:18 Let us all act wisely and walk safely
00:06:23 as we work together
00:06:25 on Kingdom Hall projects and maintenance
00:06:28 and construction projects.

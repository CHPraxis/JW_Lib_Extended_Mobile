From ancient times,
Jehovah has directed his people to build.

00:00:12.283 --> 00:00:15.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The joyful work of constructing

00:00:15.244 --> 00:00:16.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and remodeling buildings

00:00:16.453 --> 00:00:17.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to advance pure worship

00:00:17.746 --> 00:00:21.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has continued in our time.

00:00:21.584 --> 00:00:26.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But who could have anticipated
the tremendous scale and need

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:29.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for today’s worldwide building work,

00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:31.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
requiring so many volunteers,

00:00:31.886 --> 00:00:34.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tools, equipment,

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and often working in challenging situations?

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:40.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With all this building comes

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:45.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the risk of accidents
that can result in serious injury.

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.526 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That’s why we, as Jehovah’s people,

00:00:47.526 --> 00:00:49.820 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
care deeply about protecting

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the lives and safety
of all our fellow construction volunteers.

00:00:55.784 --> 00:00:58.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is not a hypothetical consideration.

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, some of our brothers and sisters
have experienced

00:01:01.707 --> 00:01:04.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
serious injuries
while volunteering on projects

00:01:04.752 --> 00:01:07.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—some, the most serious imaginable.

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:12.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our <i>Global Life Safety</i>
<i>and Loss Prevention Guidelines </i>

00:01:12.384 --> 00:01:14.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
clearly state:

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Our goal is to have
<i>an accident-free environment </i>

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“<i>with minimum loss</i> . . .

00:01:20.017 --> 00:01:23.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This zero-accident goal can be accomplished

00:01:23.187 --> 00:01:26.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“if each one realizes that his attitude

00:01:26.148 --> 00:01:28.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“toward [the] life safety and loss prevention

00:01:28.943 --> 00:01:31.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reflects his spirituality.”

00:01:31.695 --> 00:01:33.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we accomplish this?

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:37.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider three important aspects:

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our attitude toward our work,

00:01:39.662 --> 00:01:41.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how we plan for it,

00:01:41.664 --> 00:01:44.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how we work to avoid potential danger.

00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:45.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, our attitude.

00:01:45.918 --> 00:01:48.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 16:18 tells us:

00:01:48.504 --> 00:01:50.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Pride is before a crash,

00:01:50.506 --> 00:01:53.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a haughty spirit before stumbling.”

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter how skilled or experienced
we may be,

00:01:59.556 --> 00:02:03.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to humbly follow safety direction.

00:02:05.562 --> 00:02:09.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also need to show modesty
if we’re inexperienced

00:02:09.274 --> 00:02:11.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let others train us properly

00:02:11.777 --> 00:02:16.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before we begin to work
with unfamiliar equipment.

00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:18.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ecclesiastes 10:9 tells us:

00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:22.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The one who quarries stones
may be hurt by them,

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the one who splits logs
may be endangered by them.”

00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:32.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many aspects of construction
are inherently dangerous.

00:02:32.548 --> 00:02:35.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This underscores our second aspect:

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the need to plan wisely.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we plan for a safe work experience?

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have tools to help.

00:02:44.435 --> 00:02:46.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The guideline <i>Working Together Safely </i>

00:02:46.562 --> 00:02:48.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provides standards for our construction

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maintenance projects.

00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:54.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also reminds us
of our personal responsibility.

00:02:54.278 --> 00:02:57.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you familiar with its sound guidance?

00:02:57.823 --> 00:03:01.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our Job Hazard Analysis forms
for maintenance and construction

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help us anticipate potential safety risks.

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:10.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s examine just a few
of the potential dangers

00:03:10.502 --> 00:03:14.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it helps us to foresee
in advance of working on a project.

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:21.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This pipe here has a leak
and needs to be fixed.

00:03:21.388 --> 00:03:23.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to have to do a weld here,
I’m afraid.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’ll have to insulate this part here,
in between the wall and the pipe.

00:03:26.977 --> 00:03:27.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:03:27.603 --> 00:03:30.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Otherwise, we’ll end up creating
a fire hazard here in the Kingdom Hall.

00:03:30.397 --> 00:03:32.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I see! Let me write that down.

00:03:32.524 --> 00:03:35.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was thinking, too, we should assign someone

00:03:35.027 --> 00:03:38.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to stand by with a fire extinguisher
while the weld is being done.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re right.

00:03:39.031 --> 00:03:43.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also I think we should put someone
on fire-hazard duty

00:03:43.118 --> 00:03:45.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make sure nothing catches fire
after the weld is done.

00:03:45.954 --> 00:03:47.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mm. I agree. Good idea.

00:03:48.874 --> 00:03:49.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perfect.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll go ahead and make the assignments then.

00:03:51.752 --> 00:03:52.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, I’ll get things ready here.

00:03:52.878 --> 00:03:53.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s do it.

00:03:58.133 --> 00:04:00.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think that here the brothers
are going to need safety boots

00:04:00.677 --> 00:04:02.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they don’t slip and fall.

00:04:02.888 --> 00:04:06.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re also going to need safety harnesses
since they’ll be up pretty high.

00:04:06.475 --> 00:04:07.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think?

00:04:07.893 --> 00:04:12.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember if all the brothers assigned
were trained to work with safety harnesses?

00:04:12.022 --> 00:04:14.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re also going to need a support team

00:04:14.024 --> 00:04:16.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be ready to help in case of an accident.

00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:19.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would be best if we could have
less people up on the roof.

00:04:19.071 --> 00:04:23.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s impossible to inspect things
from down here, right?

00:04:23.033 --> 00:04:24.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have an idea.

00:04:24.535 --> 00:04:27.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if we put a camera on a long pole

00:04:27.496 --> 00:04:30.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and do the inspection from down here?

00:04:30.332 --> 00:04:32.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can check everything out
from one end to the other.

00:04:32.626 --> 00:04:34.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK! Great idea, sounds good.

00:04:34.878 --> 00:04:37.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This wise planning reflects the third aspect

00:04:37.506 --> 00:04:40.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of achieving our zero-accident goal:

00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:43.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pay close attention to direction

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:47.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we can work to eliminate or avoid danger.

00:04:58.277 --> 00:05:00.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When working on a large project

00:05:00.571 --> 00:05:04.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a smaller one, including maintenance work,

00:05:06.076 --> 00:05:09.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the right attitude, planning, and actions

00:05:09.413 --> 00:05:13.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help keep our brothers and sisters safe.

00:05:13.375 --> 00:05:17.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So remember the steps we can take
to ensure safety.

00:05:17.087 --> 00:05:19.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, have Jehovah’s view of things.

00:05:19.965 --> 00:05:22.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Life is precious.

00:05:22.176 --> 00:05:26.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, be wise
and anticipate the potential hazards.

00:05:26.471 --> 00:05:27.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And third,

00:05:27.764 --> 00:05:30.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
once you anticipate a risk,

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take precautions to remove or reduce it.

00:05:34.563 --> 00:05:38.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never forget
how serious maintaining safety is.

00:05:38.817 --> 00:05:41.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It demonstrates obedience to Jehovah

00:05:41.612 --> 00:05:43.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and affects our relationship with him.

00:05:44.823 --> 00:05:48.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While we are working
on theocratic building projects,

00:05:48.327 --> 00:05:52.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we cannot expect miraculous protection.

00:05:52.164 --> 00:05:54.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as Jehovah wants us to exert ourselves

00:05:54.791 --> 00:05:58.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in preaching to others to help save lives,

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he requires us to work obediently

00:06:00.172 --> 00:06:03.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to protect our fellow volunteers.

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:06.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah tells us in Proverbs:

00:06:06.094 --> 00:06:09.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Safeguard practical wisdom
and thinking ability;

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they will give you life
and be an adornment for your neck;

00:06:13.435 --> 00:06:16.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then you will walk on your way in safety.”

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:23.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us all act wisely
and walk safely

00:06:23.904 --> 00:06:25.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we work together

00:06:25.948 --> 00:06:28.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Kingdom Hall projects and maintenance

00:06:28.533 --> 00:06:31.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and construction projects.

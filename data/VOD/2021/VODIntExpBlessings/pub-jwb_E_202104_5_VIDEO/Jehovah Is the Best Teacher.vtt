00:00:07.444 --> 00:00:10.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was born to two Christian parents;

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:15.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they always tried to instill in us
a love for Jehovah.

00:00:15.077 --> 00:00:17.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I felt quite lonely growing up,

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I felt like I didn’t have people
who wanted to do the same things

00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:26.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the lifestyle, the way they spoke,
the music they were listening to—

00:00:26.046 --> 00:00:30.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so for me, the real struggle was
where do I stand?

00:00:30.092 --> 00:00:32.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where are my boundaries going to be set?

00:00:32.261 --> 00:00:34.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s really hard because it could mean

00:00:34.263 --> 00:00:36.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the difference between having a friend
and not having a friend.

00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:39.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over the years, I have talked to several

00:00:39.727 --> 00:00:43.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who’ve perhaps drifted a little bit
in the truth.

00:00:43.063 --> 00:00:47.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that unfortunately happened
to some of my friends.

00:00:47.693 --> 00:00:51.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nobody is immune
to the pressures of the world.

00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:54.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was born and raised by Christian parents,

00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:57.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so all through my childhood
and teenage years,

00:00:57.578 --> 00:01:01.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was happy serving Jehovah,

00:01:01.832 --> 00:01:05.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it got a little bit harder
when I started to work.

00:01:05.085 --> 00:01:07.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People at work would ask me

00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:10.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do social activities with them,
go for a drink and things,

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:15.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there were men who would ask me
to go out with them.

00:01:15.012 --> 00:01:19.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s flattering when someone
shows interest in you, so it was nice,

00:01:19.683 --> 00:01:23.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it was hard to have to
constantly remind myself,

00:01:23.896 --> 00:01:26.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, you know that this
is not going to be successful;

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know this person doesn’t love Jehovah.’

00:01:29.944 --> 00:01:33.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember one day
I drove into a parking lot,

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I just prayed to Jehovah
with tears in my eyes, and I said:

00:01:35.908 --> 00:01:38.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is too hard. This is just too hard.

00:01:38.827 --> 00:01:42.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The people that are my friends
are starting to leave the truth.

00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:45.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel quite lonely,
but I want to serve you.”

00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:48.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that prayer I went home,
I spoke to my mom,

00:01:48.045 --> 00:01:51.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she got really quiet,
and she just looked at me and said,

00:01:51.298 --> 00:01:54.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Anything Jehovah tells you
is to benefit yourself.”

00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:58.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it clicked in that moment
that Jehovah was saying to me: “I love you.

00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:02.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will carry you through this time,
and you’ll see

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:04.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that there will be all these blessings
that’ll open up to you,

00:02:04.103 --> 00:02:06.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and you’ll have
a really wonderful, colorful life,

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you have to hang in there.”

00:02:09.358 --> 00:02:13.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though it was hard,
I resisted the temptation,

00:02:13.195 --> 00:02:16.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but someone close to me
who faced the same pressure

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gave in and ended up leaving Jehovah.

00:02:19.618 --> 00:02:21.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I heard

00:02:21.745 --> 00:02:25.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she was disfellowshipped,

00:02:28.377 --> 00:02:32.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it just completely hit me so hard

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:35.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you really are just worried

00:02:35.342 --> 00:02:38.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what is going to happen
with their future.

00:02:38.262 --> 00:02:42.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After a while, she did come back to Jehovah.

00:02:42.182 --> 00:02:45.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s raising a child on her own.

00:02:45.394 --> 00:02:47.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day we were having a video chat

00:02:47.521 --> 00:02:49.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the little one
just playing in the background,

00:02:49.982 --> 00:02:53.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she suddenly turned around and said,

00:02:53.944 --> 00:02:58.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Mummy, why did you marry someone
who doesn’t love Jehovah?”

00:02:58.032 --> 00:03:02.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She understood that we need to live
according to Jehovah’s standards.

00:03:02.786 --> 00:03:07.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As elders, we can help people to get up
and get back on the path to life,

00:03:07.666 --> 00:03:09.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s a real pleasure.

00:03:09.668 --> 00:03:11.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m reminded about the account of David.

00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:16.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually he was forgiven by Jehovah
because he had a good heart;

00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:20.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
however, there were consequences
all through his life.

00:03:22.306 --> 00:03:25.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve received so many blessings
for sticking to Jehovah.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found a lovely brother to marry
in the Christian congregation,

00:03:29.063 --> 00:03:31.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re very happy together.

00:03:31.065 --> 00:03:33.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The thing to do
is to just stick with Jehovah.

00:03:33.108 --> 00:03:35.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Taste and see that Jehovah is good,”

00:03:35.444 --> 00:03:38.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when you do that, you will appreciate

00:03:38.155 --> 00:03:40.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there is absolutely no need

00:03:40.407 --> 00:03:42.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go anywhere else.

00:03:42.743 --> 00:03:47.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having observed what has happened
to people who have left the truth

00:03:47.164 --> 00:03:50.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the baggage they sometimes
end up carrying

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they come back in the truth
makes me feel that it’s just not worth it.

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really, Jehovah is like a parent;
he wants to protect us and care for us.

00:03:58.342 --> 00:04:02.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Things will always work out for the best
if you do things Jehovah’s way.

00:04:02.054 --> 00:04:04.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel my family has had many blessings.

00:04:04.681 --> 00:04:07.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a husband and a father,

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:09.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve got four children
who have all grown up in the truth.

00:04:09.895 --> 00:04:12.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve all gone on to have
good theocratic lives,

00:04:12.856 --> 00:04:15.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where they’ve enjoyed
many privileges of service.

00:04:15.484 --> 00:04:19.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for me, it’s been a real blessing
to do things Jehovah’s way.

00:04:19.738 --> 00:04:22.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think when you test out the world,

00:04:22.157 --> 00:04:25.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan will give you immediate satisfaction,

00:04:25.452 --> 00:04:29.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but when you serve no purpose
to him anymore, that’s it.

00:04:29.832 --> 00:04:32.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the most beautiful blessings
I’ve received is people

00:04:32.709 --> 00:04:35.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—people around you who love Jehovah

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who want to serve him the way you do.

00:04:38.757 --> 00:04:41.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really strongly believe that Jehovah

00:04:41.426 --> 00:04:44.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only gives us a lot of blessings

00:04:44.179 --> 00:04:47.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but gives us blessings
that he’s handpicked for us.

00:04:49.476 --> 00:04:51.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My observation would be

00:04:51.478 --> 00:04:55.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that experience is not the best teacher;
Jehovah is the best Teacher.

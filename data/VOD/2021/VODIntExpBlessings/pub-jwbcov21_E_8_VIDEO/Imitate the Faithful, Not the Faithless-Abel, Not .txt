00:00:03 I arrived in a new city during the rainy season.
00:00:06 It rained all day every day for a whole month.
00:00:09 At that time, there were only three publishers there.
00:00:12 The first sister I met was my new pioneer partner.
00:00:15 At first, I felt as if the people in this territory
00:00:19 spoke a different language.
00:00:21 When I tried to talk to some people about the Bible, they did not like it
00:00:25 and some were even afraid of these new ideas.
00:00:29 When government officials
00:00:31 noticed that we had shared some tracts with the people,
00:00:34 they began to watch us and followed us for about three months.
00:00:38 I felt overwhelmed by all of this and became very anxious.
00:00:43 I had few return visits or opportunities to speak about Jehovah.
00:00:47 I felt lost.
00:00:49 I didn’t know what to do or where to go.
00:00:51 I often wondered, ‘Father, why did you send me here?’
00:00:56 It was like I had gone from being on a mountain peak
00:00:59 to the bottom of a deep valley.
00:01:05 I studied the Bible
00:01:07 to see how Jehovah cared for his servants in the past.
00:01:09 For example,
00:01:11 I read how Jehovah told Jacob throughout his life:
00:01:14 ‘I will be with you wherever you go.’
00:01:17 I pictured Jehovah telling me the same thing:
00:01:21 ‘Don’t worry.
00:01:22 Just go, and I will always be there to help you.’
00:01:25 I begged him to help me
00:01:27 to be balanced, to feel peace, and to have courage
00:01:31 to go out in the ministry.
00:01:34 One day, Jehovah helped me  to find a very good Bible student.
00:01:38 It was an absolutely wonderful and unexpected gift from Jehovah.
00:01:42 Our small group joins congregation meetings through the Internet.
00:01:45 This arrangement is a valuable source of spiritual food for me.
00:01:50 We get together for meals and association as well.
00:01:53 The experiences on JW Broadcasting®
00:01:57 make me feel that I am not alone.
00:01:59 And I always smile and wave goodbye at the end.
00:02:02 It’s wonderful to be here.

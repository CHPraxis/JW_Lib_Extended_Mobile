00:00:01 I started pioneering in 1978, straight out of school.
00:00:06 And then after 17 years,
00:00:08 I had to stop because I could no longer meet the hour requirement.
00:00:12 At one of the conventions, I saw
00:00:15 some sisters interpreting the program into sign language.
00:00:19 And so I thought that even if I couldn’t continue pioneering,
00:00:23 I could do something more in Jehovah’s service
00:00:26 by learning sign language, and so I started to do that.
00:00:30 Because I was deeply grateful to Jehovah
00:00:32 for all he had done for me,
00:00:34 I resumed pioneering again
00:00:37 in September 2009.
00:00:39 And then I had the added blessing
00:00:42 of now pioneering in the sign-language field.
00:00:45 One day I met Cecilia.
00:00:48 She suffers from a genetic syndrome called
00:00:52 Usher Syndrome, which causes deafness
00:00:55 coupled with tunnel vision
00:00:58 that can, over time, lead to blindness.
00:01:02 Because of that disability,
00:01:04 it made her extremely shy.
00:01:07 So it was very difficult to communicate with her.
00:01:10 I started studying with her
00:01:12 in October 2009,
00:01:15 and very quickly she started attending meetings.
00:01:19 I would fetch her for the meetings and then drop her off at home afterward.
00:01:23 I lived about five minutes from the Kingdom Hall,
00:01:26 but she was thirty minutes away.
00:01:29 And I quickly realized
00:01:31 that she would also need to put in effort
00:01:35 to get to the meetings in order to make progress.
00:01:38 Cecilia lived close
00:01:40 to where she could catch a taxi
00:01:43 up to the train line,
00:01:45 and then it would be two train journeys
00:01:47 to get to the Kingdom Hall.
00:01:49 So it would take her, each way,
00:01:51 an hour and a half to two hours.
00:01:54 She also lived in a notoriously unsafe area
00:01:59 because of gang violence.
00:02:01 But I knew that Cecilia was
00:02:04 strong-willed enough and independent enough,
00:02:07 in spite of her timidity and reticence,
00:02:12 to be able to get herself to the meetings.
00:02:15 Cecilia was attending meetings regularly.
00:02:18 But instead of a skirt,
00:02:20 she wore pants to the meetings.
00:02:23 So I chatted to Nancy,
00:02:25 a sister who at the time was accompanying me
00:02:28 to her study most weeks,
00:02:30 so that we could try and figure out a way of helping her
00:02:33 to make the change she needed to make.
00:02:35 It took about a year
00:02:37 of gently showing pictures
00:02:41 and reviewing the Bible principles,
00:02:43 but eventually she did get the point.
00:02:45 One of the weekends that she was staying over,
00:02:48 I went into her room,
00:02:50 and on her bed, neatly laid out,
00:02:52 was a skirt and top
00:02:54 ready for the meeting.
00:02:56 I thanked Jehovah at that point
00:02:59 because, finally, our patience had been rewarded.
00:03:03 We had all of our meetings on a Saturday
00:03:06 with a lunch break in between when we would associate,
00:03:10 but we noticed that Cecilia was isolating herself.
00:03:14 To reinforce for Cecilia
00:03:17 the principle at Acts 20:35,
00:03:20 a friend came up with the good idea of helping her
00:03:24 to bake cookies the day before the meeting.
00:03:27 Cecilia shyly offered the cookies to each person there
00:03:31 during the lunch break,
00:03:33 and it elicited such a warm response
00:03:35 from the brothers and sisters and friends there.
00:03:38 It really drove home the point for Cecilia,
00:03:41 and it was beautiful to see her, after that, come out of her shell.
00:03:46 In July 2014,
00:03:49 Cecilia gave her first student talk,
00:03:53 and in that month she also started publishing.
00:03:57 There have been challenges, particularly
00:04:00 with learning sign language but even more so
00:04:03 in getting to understand the deaf culture
00:04:08 —the way that they think— and also financial hardships.
00:04:11 But the challenges and the sacrifices
00:04:16 were far outweighed by the blessings.
00:04:20 A day that’s etched in my memory
00:04:23 is the day that she told me she wanted to get baptized.
00:04:27 Cecilia has really become like a daughter to me,
00:04:31 and I’m so proud of the enormous strides that she made in the truth.
00:04:36 In October 2015, she was baptized,
00:04:40 and I cried with joy that day.
00:04:43 I’ve been pioneering now for 28 years.
00:04:46 And over that time, particularly since I started again
00:04:50 (and with Cecilia),
00:04:52 many, many, many brothers and sisters in the congregation helped me.
00:04:57 They accompanied me to her study;
00:05:00 they became friends with her;
00:05:02 they took over when I went away.
00:05:04 I could never have done it on my own.
00:05:07 Above all,
00:05:09 Jehovah has helped me to cultivate qualities
00:05:12 like patience, self-control,
00:05:16 humility, compassion.
00:05:18 It was really wonderful to play a small part
00:05:22 —such a privilege— to help Cecilia
00:05:25 to become part of Jehovah’s family.

00:00:01 My theme is “‘The King of the North’ in the Time of the End.”
00:00:05 In recent years, the Russian government
00:00:09 has persecuted our brothers and sisters
00:00:11 who live in that country.
00:00:13 You’ve heard reports about the police invading Kingdom Halls
00:00:17 and breaking up meetings.
00:00:19 The government has labeled Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:00:22 as an “extremist group.”
00:00:25 It has seized our properties and imprisoned our brothers.
00:00:29 Please watch a brief video
00:00:31 that reviews some of the trials
00:00:33 Jehovah’s people in Russia have faced.
00:00:38 On April 20, 2017,
00:00:40 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation criminalized
00:00:44 the activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:00:49 As of July 4, 2019,
00:00:52 authorities have progressively seized 131 of the properties
00:00:55 owned by Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:00:58 with an additional 60 properties subject to confiscation.
00:01:01 One of the seized properties
00:01:03 was the former Russia branch complex in Solnechnoye.
00:01:07 At the time of filming, the Russian authorities continue
00:01:10 their aggressive attack on Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:01:13 As of August 17, 2020,
00:01:16 there were 42 Witnesses who were in pretrial detention
00:01:19 or sentenced to prison,
00:01:21 32 who were under house arrest,
00:01:24 and 169 who were not allowed to leave their hometown.
00:01:28 All have been charged with organizing,
00:01:30 participating in, or financing the activity
00:01:33 of a so-called “extremist” organization.
00:01:37 At least 380 Witnesses were, at the time, under investigation
00:01:41 —ranging in age from 19 to 89 years old.
00:01:46 What has this meant for the individuals affected?
00:01:48 As an example,
00:01:50 on June 3, 2018,
00:01:52 Brother Sergey Klimov was arrested.
00:01:56 Local authorities initiated
00:01:58 criminal charges against him,
00:02:00 placing him in pretrial detention for two months.
00:02:03 This detention was extended seven times,
00:02:06 separating him from his wife and family
00:02:08 for a year and five months,
00:02:10 before he was finally tried and sentenced.
00:02:14 On November 5, 2019,
00:02:16 he was sentenced to six years in prison.
00:02:24 Two of our dear young people in Russia,
00:02:26 Brother Yegor Baranov and Sister Darya Dulova,
00:02:29 are courageously facing criminal conviction
00:02:32 and potential long-term imprisonment.
00:02:35 Brother Baranov is only 19 years old.
00:02:38 When the authorities raided her home, Sister Dulova was only 18 years old.
00:02:45 By means of the Newsroom on jw.org,
00:02:47 we are informed of updated news events.
00:02:50 This page includes links to name lists
00:02:52 of Witnesses currently imprisoned for their faith,
00:02:54 which can help us include them specifically in our prayers.
00:02:58 Our brothers and sisters in Russia are resolved to remain loyal to Jehovah
00:03:02 despite any opposition,
00:03:04 and they put their confidence in him in the assurance
00:03:07 that Jehovah is on their side!
00:03:22 It shouldn’t surprise us
00:03:24 that this powerful government has been persecuting
00:03:28 our peaceful, law-abiding brothers and sisters.
00:03:32 Why not?
00:03:33 Because that government is fulfilling Bible prophecy!
00:03:38 Please find Daniel chapter 11.
00:03:42 In verse 40, it refers to what the Bible calls
00:03:46 “the king of the north.”
00:03:48 Of that “king,” Daniel 11:41 says:
00:03:52 “He will also enter into the land of the Decoration,
00:03:57 and many lands will be made to stumble.”
00:04:02 Today, Russia and its allies
00:04:05 are filling the role of the king of the north.
00:04:09 Daniel foretold that this king would enter
00:04:12 “the land of the Decoration,”
00:04:14 meaning that he would interfere in a significant way
00:04:18 with the activities of God’s people.
00:04:21 As discussed in the May 2020 Watchtower,
00:04:25 Russia and its allies are not the first political power
00:04:28 to act as the king of the north,
00:04:31 but they may well be the last.
00:04:35 In this program, we will do three things:
00:04:38 First,
00:04:39 we’ll briefly trace the fulfillment of the prophecy
00:04:42 recorded in Daniel chapter 11.
00:04:46 Second, we’ll look at how that prophecy
00:04:49 is being fulfilled today.
00:04:52 And third, we’ll discuss how knowing this information
00:04:56 should affect the decisions that we make.
00:05:00 Brother Herman van Selm, a helper to the Writing Committee,
00:05:04 will help us review some of the key points of the prophecy
00:05:08 recorded in Daniel chapter 11.
00:05:12 Thank you, Herman, for helping me with this presentation.
00:05:16 It’s a pleasure to be with you, Ken.
00:05:19 Thank you for inviting me.
00:05:22 First, let’s briefly trace
00:05:25 how the prophecy has been fulfilled so far.
00:05:29 The prophecy in Daniel chapter 11 mentions
00:05:32 “the king of the north” and “the king of the south.”
00:05:35 Now, why are they described like that?
00:05:37 Well, initially,
00:05:39 these powers were located north and south
00:05:43 of the literal land of Israel,
00:05:46 thus the names king of the north
00:05:48 and king of the south.
00:05:50 These powers could be viewed as two thrones.
00:05:54 Over time, those thrones have been occupied
00:05:57 by various political powers
00:05:59 and these rival kings compete for world domination.
00:06:04 And what about Jehovah’s people?
00:06:06 They are right at the center of this conflict.
00:06:11 But let’s start at the beginning.
00:06:14 Ken,
00:06:15 what is the origin of the kings of the north and of the south?
00:06:21 The kings of the north and of the south
00:06:23 both rose from the empire
00:06:26 established by Alexander the Great.
00:06:29 One line of kings ruled over Egypt,
00:06:31 which is south of Israel.
00:06:33 And that dynasty was the first
00:06:36 to fill the role of king of the south.
00:06:39 During this period, another line of kings
00:06:42 ruled an area north of Israel
00:06:45 and those kings filled the role
00:06:47 of king of the north.
00:06:49 Then the Roman Empire took over
00:06:52 as king of the north.
00:06:56 As discussed in the May 2020 Watchtower,
00:06:59 God’s people are the focal point
00:07:01 of the prophecy recorded in Daniel chapter 11.
00:07:06 The angel who spoke with Daniel said that the prophecy
00:07:09 would help him “understand what will befall your people”
00:07:14 —that is, the nation of Israel.
00:07:19 And what, in fact, happened?
00:07:21 Well, the Jewish nation was God’s people until 33 C.E.
00:07:26 But after that, a change occurred.
00:07:29 Jehovah poured out his holy spirit
00:07:31 on Christ’s followers.
00:07:33 And from then on,
00:07:34 the congregation of true Christians
00:07:37 became God’s people.
00:07:40 Galatians 6:16 refers to them
00:07:43 as “the Israel of God.”
00:07:47 That point is significant
00:07:50 because the kings of the north and south can only be identified
00:07:54 when there is a clearly defined group of God’s people on earth.
00:07:59 Why is that the case?
00:08:02 Because, as we just considered,
00:08:04 the angel had told Daniel
00:08:06 that the prophecy centers on God’s people.
00:08:11 In the second century C.E.,
00:08:13 true Christians were overgrown
00:08:16 by weedlike false Christians.
00:08:19 In his illustration of the wheat and the weeds,
00:08:22 Jesus foretold that this would happen.
00:08:25 That illustration is recorded
00:08:27 at Matthew 13:36-43.
00:08:31 So from the second century onward,
00:08:35 we can no longer identify an organized group of true Christians.
00:08:39 And, as we considered, for that same reason,
00:08:42 we also cannot identify
00:08:44 the king of the north and the king of the south.
00:08:48 But in the 1870’s, a group of Bible students
00:08:52 began to separate itself from false Christians.
00:08:55 This group,
00:08:57 which included Charles T. Russell,
00:08:59 rejected teachings
00:09:01 that were not based on the Bible.
00:09:03 And like the first-century Christians,
00:09:06 they promoted the truths
00:09:08 taught in God’s Word.
00:09:10 Now this group underwent a development
00:09:13 that is foretold at Malachi 3:1.
00:09:18 They were the “messenger”
00:09:20 who would “clear up a way” before Jehovah.
00:09:24 And as events that followed prove,
00:09:27 this group clearly had God’s backing.
00:09:30 So from the 1870’s onward,
00:09:33 when true Christians began to organize themselves as a group,
00:09:37 we can again identify the political powers
00:09:40 that fill the roles of the king of the north
00:09:43 and king of the south.
00:09:45 At that time in history,
00:09:49 Britain was the dominant political force
00:09:52 and it filled the role
00:09:53 of the king of the south.
00:09:56 Amazingly, it was also in the 1870’s
00:10:00 that the German Empire emerged
00:10:02 and soon began to challenge Britain
00:10:04 for world domination.
00:10:06 This political power now filled the role
00:10:10 of the king of the north.
00:10:12 Daniel 11:25, 26 indicate
00:10:17 that the two kings would clash
00:10:19 and that the king of the north would lose many soldiers in the battle.
00:10:23 And that is exactly what happened
00:10:27 during World War I.
00:10:29 And it was during that war
00:10:31 that Britain and its close ally,
00:10:34 the United States,
00:10:35 forged a special bond.
00:10:38 So from this point on,
00:10:40 during these last days,
00:10:42 the Anglo-American power
00:10:44 has been the king of the south.
00:10:48 That brings us to our second point:
00:10:50 How has Daniel chapter 11 been fulfilled
00:10:55 from that time onward
00:10:57 until recent times?
00:10:59 During World War I,
00:11:01 the king of the north and the king of the south
00:11:05 persecuted those of God’s people who refused to fight in the war.
00:11:10 The king of the south even threw into jail
00:11:13 those who were taking the lead in the preaching work.
00:11:16 But let’s take a closer look at the king of the north.
00:11:20 Has the political power filling that role
00:11:22 changed during the last days?
00:11:25 And how has it treated God’s people?
00:11:29 The identity of the king of the north
00:11:31 has changed three times during the last days.
00:11:35 Starting in the 1870’s through to the end of the second world war,
00:11:40 the German Empire
00:11:42 filled the role of the king of the north.
00:11:45 In the period leading up to and including World War II,
00:11:49 it persecuted God’s people without mercy,
00:11:53 imprisoning thousands of our brothers
00:11:56 and killing hundreds of them.
00:11:59 Who replaced the German Empire as the king of the north?
00:12:03 That’s an important question, Herman.
00:12:06 After World War II,
00:12:07 the Soviet Union took on that role.
00:12:10 It also attacked God’s people,
00:12:12 imprisoning them or sending them into exile.
00:12:17 But, Ken, Daniel 11:34 says
00:12:21 that they—that is, God’s people—
00:12:24 would be “given a little help.”
00:12:27 What’s the significance of that statement?
00:12:29 This passage points forward to the time
00:12:32 when the Soviet Union collapsed.
00:12:35 Although God’s people suffered terribly under that government,
00:12:39 they were “given a little help.”
00:12:42 In what way?
00:12:44 After the USSR collapsed,
00:12:46 God’s people there could worship freely for a number of years.
00:12:51 In time, though, Russia and its allies
00:12:54 took on the role of the king of the north.
00:12:58 And like the other powers that filled the role of king of the north,
00:13:02 this government has continued to oppress God’s people.
00:13:07 How are our brothers and sisters coping with the current persecution?
00:13:11 Let’s take a look.
00:13:13 And what you’re going to see will break your heart
00:13:18 but also strengthen your faith.
00:13:22 At 6:00 a.m.,
00:13:24 my husband and I were woken up
00:13:26 by a loud bang on the door.
00:13:29 As soon as my husband had opened the door,
00:13:31 people burst in shouting,
00:13:33 “Everyone on the floor!”
00:13:35 I saw them taking my husband into the kitchen
00:13:37 and heard them
00:13:39 very aggressively ordering him to do something.
00:13:41 Then I heard some noise, and I realized
00:13:43 that he was being beaten.
00:13:46 My husband, Feliks, and I
00:13:48 were on our way back from the shopping mall
00:13:51 to the car park.
00:13:52 A jeep with tinted windows
00:13:54 blocked our path, and people
00:13:56 with weapons jumped out, shouting:
00:13:58 “On the ground! Don’t move!”
00:14:01 We were thrown against the vehicle.
00:14:03 Feliks was sent to a pretrial detention facility,
00:14:06 where he spent a year.
00:14:10 From the very first bang on the door,
00:14:13 I began praying to Jehovah for wisdom, calmness,
00:14:17 and for holy spirit so that I could make the right decisions
00:14:20 and act in the right way.
00:14:21 And for the whole day, I was praying.
00:14:23 Jehovah answered all my prayers,
00:14:25 and I felt that he was close at my side.
00:14:32 Before each court hearing when I was very afraid
00:14:35 and felt overwhelmed by emotion and couldn’t calm myself down,
00:14:38 it was prayer
00:14:40 that helped me to settle down.
00:14:44 When they took us for interrogation,
00:14:47 I started panicking and, at that moment,
00:14:50 I realized that I needed to meditate on something positive.
00:14:53 So I thought,
00:14:55 ‘I need to sing our songs.’
00:14:57 And just one song came into my mind:
00:15:00 “He Will Make You Strong.”
00:15:02 It really strengthened me.
00:15:05 Those words about how Jehovah gave his Son for us
00:15:07 show he loves us and will never leave us.
00:15:12 Brothers and sisters
00:15:14 pray and tell me
00:15:17 that they are praying for me.
00:15:19 It gives me the feeling that I am part
00:15:21 of a large family.
00:15:25 After the interrogation,
00:15:28 he was sent home.
00:15:29 My husband and I
00:15:31 continue to stick to our spiritual routine.
00:15:35 We continue to conduct family worship, and we are always in the ministry.
00:15:40 Our brothers and sisters constantly support us.
00:15:43 They write kind words;
00:15:45 they commend us;
00:15:48 they send us encouraging scriptures from the Bible.
00:15:52 In September 2019, Feliks was found guilty
00:15:57 and sentenced to three years in a general regime colony.
00:16:02 When he and the other brothers arrived there,
00:16:05 they were beaten up by officers from the colony.
00:16:10 Feliks told me
00:16:11 that he prayed while he was being beaten,
00:16:15 and he noticed that at that moment, he stopped feeling the pain.
00:16:22 While he is behind bars,
00:16:24 Feliks tries to conduct family worship with me by letters.
00:16:29 He picks certain themes and some specific questions.
00:16:33 Then I do research
00:16:35 in the publications and send back what I find.
00:16:40 The scripture at Isaiah chapter 30 really strengthens me,
00:16:43 where it says that “your strength will be
00:16:47 in keeping calm and showing trust.”
00:16:50 Although I tend to worry,
00:16:53 I understand that calmness is expressed
00:16:56 by fully trusting in Jehovah.
00:17:00 I have become stronger because thanks to Jehovah,
00:17:03 in a way, I have developed almost a shell
00:17:07 against the difficulties
00:17:09 that used to scare me.
00:17:10 That confidence and faith help me.
00:17:12 Jehovah was with me,
00:17:14 and he will remain
00:17:16 close by me,
00:17:17 and we will be made stronger thanks to him,
00:17:19 and we will get through these trials.
00:17:26 How can we develop courage
00:17:29 like our brothers and sisters in Russia?
00:17:32 Well, we must be convinced
00:17:35 that the prophecies in the Bible are trustworthy.
00:17:42 As we’ve discussed,
00:17:44 each detail of the prophecy recorded at Daniel chapter 11
00:17:48 has come true so far.
00:17:50 We must have confidence
00:17:52 that the remaining events described in that prophecy
00:17:55 will also come true.
00:17:58 We are living in the last days of the time of the end.
00:18:02 Soon, the nations will fulfill the prophecy
00:18:06 at 1 Thessalonians 5:3:
00:18:09 “Whenever it is that they are saying,
00:18:13 “‘Peace and security!’
00:18:15 “then sudden destruction is to be instantly on them,
00:18:19 “just like birth pains on a pregnant woman,
00:18:23 and they will by no means escape.”
00:18:27 Then “sudden destruction”
00:18:29 comes upon all parts of Satan’s system.
00:18:33 As you can see on the screen,
00:18:35 Daniel 12:1 says:
00:18:38 “During that time Michael will stand up,
00:18:41 “the great prince who is standing in behalf of your people.
00:18:45 “And there will occur a time of distress such as has not occurred
00:18:50 “since there came to be a nation until that time.
00:18:54 “And during that time your people will escape,
00:18:58 everyone who is found written down in the book.”
00:19:03 That leads us into our third point:
00:19:07 How should knowing the information
00:19:09 that we have just discussed
00:19:11 affect the decisions that we make?
00:19:15 Well, what we have reviewed is not just interesting history;
00:19:19 it’s a dramatic prelude
00:19:21 to what will soon happen here on earth.
00:19:25 Jehovah has given his people this knowledge
00:19:28 so that we can act on it.
00:19:30 It should influence the choices we make.

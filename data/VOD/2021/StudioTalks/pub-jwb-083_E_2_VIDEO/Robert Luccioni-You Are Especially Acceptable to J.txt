00:00:01 Our theme for this month is
00:00:03 “You Are ‘Especially Acceptable’ to Jehovah.”
00:00:08 We love Jehovah,
00:00:10 and we want to give him our best.
00:00:12 But we want our sacrifices
00:00:14 to be acceptable to him.
00:00:17 So we may strive to be involved as much as possible
00:00:21 in all the exciting things going on in the organization.
00:00:26 But do you ever feel discouraged, perhaps even guilty or frustrated
00:00:31 regarding your sacrifices to Jehovah?
00:00:35 In some cases, it may be that you’re so involved
00:00:38 in so many different aspects of the work
00:00:41 that perhaps you’re not giving adequate attention
00:00:44 to your spiritual, personal, or family needs.
00:00:48 Or, on the other hand, it may be the opposite situation.
00:00:53 You may have those feelings because you cannot do
00:00:56 as much as you’d like to
00:00:58 or as much as others are doing.
00:01:01 For example, you may have been very involved in the work,
00:01:05 but unexpectedly your circumstances changed because of your health
00:01:10 or some other calamity that came along and shut things down.
00:01:16 Such feelings may cause us to ask ourselves,
00:01:19 ‘What does Jehovah really expect of us?’
00:01:24 Well, we’re going to consider three points in our discussion.
00:01:28 The first is this,
00:01:30 we need to set the right priorities.
00:01:32 Second,
00:01:34 do not compare yourselves unfavorably
00:01:37 with others.
00:01:38 And third,
00:01:40 remember what is important to Jehovah.
00:01:44 Let’s start with our first point:
00:01:46 Jehovah expects us to set
00:01:48 the right priorities.
00:01:51 But how can we do that?
00:01:53 Well, a scripture that’s helped me is found
00:01:55 at 2 Corinthians 8:12.
00:02:00 Now, at the time of this letter,
00:02:02 the Christians in Judea were facing many trials.
00:02:05 And these trials included famine, persecution,
00:02:09 and the plundering of their belongings.
00:02:11 They needed relief.
00:02:13 Now, previously, in his first letter,
00:02:16 Paul had encouraged the Corinthians to set aside funds
00:02:20 to help the brothers in Judea.
00:02:23 Shortly thereafter, when Paul wrote
00:02:25 the second inspired letter to the Corinthians,
00:02:28 he urged them to get their gifts ready.
00:02:32 So now, with this context of giving,
00:02:34 sacrificing, and helping others in mind,
00:02:38 let’s read 2 Corinthians 8:12:
00:02:42 “For if the readiness is there first,
00:02:46 “it is especially acceptable
00:02:48 “according to what a person has,
00:02:50 “not according to what a person
00:02:52 does not have.”
00:02:54 Paul here is discussing sacrifices that are acceptable
00:02:59 and sacrifices that are unacceptable to Jehovah.
00:03:03 What’s the difference?
00:03:05 Well, picture it this way.
00:03:07 Picture a young family in Corinth
00:03:10 —a father, mother, and children.
00:03:13 The father hears the letter from Paul being read to the congregation,
00:03:18 and the father is very excited.
00:03:20 He wants to help his brothers in Judea.
00:03:24 Now, when the family gets home, he discusses the matter with his wife.
00:03:28 He says: “We have a little money
00:03:30 “that we’ve set aside to do some work on the house,
00:03:34 “and we were saving to purchase another donkey.
00:03:38 “However, I’d like to take that money
00:03:40 and contribute it to our needy brothers in Jerusalem.”
00:03:44 What do you think?
00:03:46 Would you say that is an acceptable sacrifice?
00:03:51 Yes.
00:03:52 It’s a sacrifice
00:03:53 —he and his family are donating money to help others—
00:03:57 but it’s according to what the family has.
00:04:01 That sacrifice would no doubt be very precious to Jehovah.
00:04:05 You can picture how excited the family would be
00:04:08 to support that decision.
00:04:11 But now let’s imagine a different family in the same congregation.
00:04:16 This time, the husband comes home and says,
00:04:20 “I know we do not have any extra money,
00:04:22 “but I’d like to use the money that we’ve set aside
00:04:25 “to feed our family for the next two weeks
00:04:29 and donate it to the brothers that are in need in Jerusalem.”
00:04:33 What do you think now?
00:04:35 Would you say that is an acceptable sacrifice?
00:04:40 It’s the same good motive, the same good cause,
00:04:43 and it may even be the same amount of money.
00:04:46 But is it acceptable?
00:04:47 No.
00:04:49 Why?
00:04:51 It’s not according to what he has.
00:04:54 Jehovah does not want him to take food away from his children.
00:04:57 Can you imagine him explaining that decision to his family?
00:05:02 The father has a God-given responsibility to feed his family.
00:05:06 Paul says, ‘Just give according to what you have.’
00:05:12 What’s the lesson for us?
00:05:15 How can this help us to maintain balance
00:05:18 and set the right priorities?
00:05:22 Well, our sacrifices are acceptable to Jehovah
00:05:26 if we give according to what we have.
00:05:28 But our sacrifice would be unacceptable
00:05:32 if we try to give beyond what we have.
00:05:36 How can we apply that?
00:05:38 Well, there are certain areas that Jehovah says are nonnegotiable.
00:05:43 What are some of those areas?
00:05:46 One is our relationship with Jehovah.
00:05:50 He expects us to keep that relationship strong
00:05:53 by making time for such important activities
00:05:57 as lingering in prayer, reading and meditating on God’s Word,
00:06:00 attending and participating in our meetings,
00:06:04 and having a meaningful share in the ministry.
00:06:07 So, what we do in the way of work for the organization
00:06:12 must never crowd out the spiritual activities
00:06:15 that keep us close to God.
00:06:18 You see, that would be unacceptable to Jehovah.
00:06:22 Another example is our family responsibilities.
00:06:26 Jehovah expects us to care for our family,
00:06:29 not only materially and physically
00:06:32 but also spiritually and emotionally.
00:06:35 So we must spend time together
00:06:38 in family worship, in the field ministry,
00:06:40 and in recreation.
00:06:43 That means that we must not allow our work for the organization
00:06:48 to interfere with the necessary time we need
00:06:51 to care for our family.
00:06:53 That would be unacceptable to Jehovah.
00:06:58 Another example is our health.
00:07:01 Jehovah expects us to serve him whole-souled.
00:07:04 That involves doing all
00:07:06 that our health allows us to do.
00:07:08 So we do all that we can to maintain our health
00:07:11 by eating well, getting enough sleep,
00:07:14 and exercising regularly.
00:07:17 Well, again, we must not allow our work for the organization
00:07:22 to cause us to neglect our health.
00:07:24 That would be unacceptable to Jehovah.
00:07:29 So do you see the point?
00:07:31 What can help us to set the right priorities?
00:07:34 Well, again, remember the principle here at 2 Corinthians 8:12.
00:07:39 Jehovah, in effect, says:
00:07:42 ‘Give to me according to what you have,
00:07:45 ‘not according to what you do not have.
00:07:48 And that will be especially acceptable to me.’
00:07:53 And we know that even though we have set the right priorities,
00:07:57 it’s still a challenge to maintain balance.
00:08:00 Balance is not something that once you have it
00:08:03 you can just lock it in.
00:08:05 No, it’s like a tightrope walker
00:08:07 who must constantly recalibrate and adjust
00:08:11 to maintain balance.
00:08:13 The same is true with maintaining balance in our lives.
00:08:17 I know it’s a constant process for me,
00:08:20 and I’d guess it’s just as challenging for you as well.
00:08:24 We’ve had excellent articles in our publications
00:08:27 that help with managing our time.
00:08:30 Here are two of them:
00:08:33 The April 2010 Awake!, page 7,
00:08:37 has an article entitled
00:08:39 “20 Ways to Create More Time,”
00:08:44 and the February 2014 Awake!, page 6,
00:08:47 “How to Invest Your Time Wisely.”
00:08:51 You may find these helpful to do further research
00:08:54 on how to set the right priorities and maintain balance.
00:09:00 A second point to help us maintain balance
00:09:03 is this: Do not compare yourselves
00:09:07 unfavorably with others.
00:09:10 There will always be ones
00:09:12 doing more in their service to Jehovah than we are.
00:09:16 And if we start comparing ourselves to them
00:09:19 or feel that they are more acceptable to Jehovah,
00:09:23 this can cause us to lose not just our balance
00:09:27 but our joy as well.
00:09:29 When considering this aspect of not comparing,
00:09:33 I think of the prophets Daniel, Ezekiel, and Jeremiah.
00:09:37 As you remember, these men were contemporaries of one another,
00:09:42 but each had very different circumstances.
00:09:45 Daniel was in the court of the king in Babylon.
00:09:50 Yes, he had times of persecution
00:09:53 and challenges.
00:09:55 But overall, he was an official for the king.
00:09:58 He received special training for his position.
00:10:01 So he may have had it relatively easy.
00:10:06 Ezekiel was living among his fellow exiles
00:10:09 in a community “by the river Chebar.”
00:10:13 Overall, things were fairly stable there.
00:10:17 Remember, the Jews in exile had a measure of freedom.
00:10:19 They built houses, they had children, they settled down,
00:10:23 and they developed skills in various trades.
00:10:26 So it seems that perhaps they had a relatively stable life.
00:10:32 Then you have Jeremiah.
00:10:34 He was in Jerusalem.
00:10:35 It seems that somebody was always trying to kill him.
00:10:38 Much of the time, he was either hiding or in confinement.
00:10:43 So here’s the question, Did the differing circumstances
00:10:46 of their assignments
00:10:48 mean that Jehovah loved or favored one more than the other?
00:10:53 Not at all.
00:10:55 It was just an assignment.
00:10:57 Jehovah wanted a prophet in Jerusalem.
00:11:00 He wanted one with the exiles in Babylon,
00:11:03 and he wanted another in the court of the king.
00:11:06 It was just the way the assignments fell.
00:11:10 Now, you can imagine how counterproductive it would’ve been
00:11:14 for each of these three men to judge his value
00:11:18 based on his assignment
00:11:20 or to compare himself to the other two.
00:11:24 It could happen.
00:11:25 Think about it.
00:11:26 Ezekiel and Jeremiah
00:11:29 could have looked at Daniel and thought:
00:11:32 ‘Ah, he has direct access to the king.
00:11:35 ‘He’s living where all the big decisions are being made.
00:11:38 ‘He’s right in the center of it all.
00:11:40 ‘He can use his influence to help Jehovah’s people.
00:11:44 ‘What a privilege that would be!
00:11:46 I wish I was there!’
00:11:48 Or Daniel and Jeremiah
00:11:52 could’ve looked at Ezekiel
00:11:54 and felt that’s where they wished they were:
00:11:57 ‘We would have at least relative freedom with the exiles.
00:12:01 ‘We’d be able to encourage our fellow worshippers of Jehovah.
00:12:05 We could help others learn about Jehovah.’
00:12:09 Or, believe it or not, Daniel and Ezekiel
00:12:12 could’ve looked at Jeremiah and thought:
00:12:15 ‘We know things are tough, but that’s where we want to be.
00:12:19 ‘He’s on the front lines, risking his life for Jehovah and the nation.
00:12:24 That’s where the action is.’
00:12:27 Different assignments, different circumstances,
00:12:31 different locations
00:12:33 —but they were all special to Jehovah.
00:12:37 What’s the lesson?
00:12:39 The lesson is
00:12:41 that we must be careful
00:12:43 that we do not compare ourselves unfavorably with others.
00:12:47 It is good to see if we can imitate and benefit
00:12:51 from the example of others,
00:12:53 but we need to be careful
00:12:55 that we do not begin determining the value
00:12:58 of what we’re doing for Jehovah
00:13:00 based on what others are doing.
00:13:02 That could cause us to lose our joy,
00:13:05 lose our balance,
00:13:07 and fall into the trap of doing things for the wrong reasons.
00:13:12 That brings us to our last point:
00:13:14 Remember what is important to Jehovah.
00:13:18 Circumstances change in life.
00:13:22 As mentioned, in the past we may have been
00:13:25 extremely busy in Jehovah’s service.
00:13:27 But because of the world’s situation, that may have changed.
00:13:32 Or other circumstances in our life may have changed.
00:13:36 Does that somehow change how Jehovah feels about us?
00:13:40 No.
00:13:41 How do we know?
00:13:43 What is important to Jehovah?
00:13:45 What makes you “especially acceptable” to Jehovah?
00:13:50 Well, let’s read together
00:13:52 Acts 10:34, 35:
00:13:56 “At this Peter began to speak, and he said:
00:14:01 “‘Now I truly understand
00:14:03 “‘that God is not partial,
00:14:05 “‘but in every nation the man who fears him
00:14:08 “‘and does what is right
00:14:10 is acceptable to him.’”
00:14:12 Fear Jehovah.
00:14:14 Do what is right.
00:14:15 Obey his commandments.
00:14:17 That’s it.
00:14:19 That’s what makes us acceptable to Jehovah.
00:14:23 We complicate things at times and equate our responsibilities
00:14:28 —how we’re used, where we’re asked to serve—
00:14:31 as things that define our value.
00:14:34 That’s not how Jehovah sees things.
00:14:38 A scripture that has helped me
00:14:40 is found at Ecclesiastes 3:10:
00:14:45 “I have seen the occupation
00:14:49 “that God has given to the sons of men
00:14:52 to keep them occupied.”
00:14:55 “The occupation” refers to our activities, the things we do.
00:15:00 And Jehovah has given us work to keep us occupied.
00:15:04 Whenever I read that, I think of parents with their children.
00:15:07 Perhaps they take them to the beach for the afternoon, and what do they do?
00:15:12 They give them some toys, and they let them play.
00:15:14 Why?
00:15:16 To keep them occupied.
00:15:19 And that, in a way, is what Jehovah does with us.
00:15:22 If you think about it, Jehovah does not need us to do the work.
00:15:27 Jehovah can accomplish his work without us,
00:15:30 but he dignifies us and allows us to have a share.
00:15:34 He provides us with meaningful work.
00:15:37 Note what it goes on to say in verse 13
00:15:40 of Ecclesiastes chapter 3:
00:15:43 “Also that everyone should eat and drink
00:15:46 “and find enjoyment for all his hard work.
00:15:50 It is the gift of God.”
00:15:53 Work is a gift from Jehovah.
00:15:56 Is it reasonable to think that Jehovah would give a gift
00:16:00 that stresses us out or creates hardship for us?
00:16:04 No.
00:16:05 He wants us to find enjoyment in our work.
00:16:08 We are the ones that may get too concerned with assigning rank and priority
00:16:13 to various privileges and locations of service
00:16:17 —where we are in the sand and what toys we have to play with.
00:16:22 What is important to Jehovah?
00:16:26 Notice our final scripture
00:16:28 at Ecclesiastes 12:13:
00:16:32 “The conclusion of the matter,
00:16:35 “everything having been heard, is:
00:16:38 “Fear the true God
00:16:40 “and keep his commandments,
00:16:42 for this is the whole obligation of man.”
00:16:46 Fear Jehovah.
00:16:48 Keep his commandments.
00:16:50 Just serve Jehovah.
00:16:53 Do the best that you can.
00:16:55 Stay balanced.
00:16:57 Give according to what you have.
00:17:00 Those are the important things.
00:17:02 And if you do them, no matter what your personal circumstances,
00:17:07 you will remain “especially acceptable” to Jehovah.

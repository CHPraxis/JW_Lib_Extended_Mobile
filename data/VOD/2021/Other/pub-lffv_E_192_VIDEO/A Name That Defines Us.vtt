We were always just called
the Bible Students,

00:00:11.528 --> 00:00:16.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Brother Russell kind of encouraged that.

00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:20.036 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He said we didn’t want to be known

00:00:20.036 --> 00:00:21.638 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by any distinctive name

00:00:21.638 --> 00:00:23.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but just Bible Students,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I appreciated his viewpoint on that.

00:00:26.543 --> 00:00:28.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the trouble was that people

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:32.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
began to call us Russellites and Rutherfordites,

00:00:32.015 --> 00:00:35.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not only that but the term “Christian” itself

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:36.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
became a misnomer.

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:39.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many people said they were Christians,

00:00:39.422 --> 00:00:42.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they didn’t have any idea
as to what being a Christian meant.

00:00:42.892 --> 00:00:45.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their identity would be considered

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:47.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at a seven-day convention

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:50.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
held in Columbus, Ohio, in 1931.

00:00:51.935 --> 00:00:54.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Attendees received programs

00:00:54.037 --> 00:00:56.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the puzzling letters “JW” on the cover.

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:01.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Speaking on Isaiah 43:10,

00:01:01.211 --> 00:01:04.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
J.F. Rutherford presented a resolution.

00:01:08.284 --> 00:01:11.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have great love
for Brother Charles T. Russell,

00:01:11.788 --> 00:01:15.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we gladly acknowledge
that the Lord used him

00:01:15.058 --> 00:01:17.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and greatly blessed his work,

00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:20.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yet we cannot consent

00:01:20.363 --> 00:01:23.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be called by the name “Russellites.”

00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:26.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society

00:01:26.402 --> 00:01:29.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the International Bible Students Association

00:01:29.606 --> 00:01:32.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are merely names of corporations.

00:01:33.576 --> 00:01:36.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are servants of Jehovah God

00:01:36.946 --> 00:01:40.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
commissioned
to do a work in his name.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Henceforth,
may it be known that we

00:01:44.087 --> 00:01:46.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:01:59.402 --> 00:02:01.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Early editions of <i>Zion’s Watch Tower </i>

00:02:01.805 --> 00:02:03.907 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
reveal that the Bible Students

00:02:03.907 --> 00:02:06.176 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
had already known God’s name.

00:02:07.677 --> 00:02:09.679 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But now,

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their new designation
would remind these Christians

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:16.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that knowledge
brings responsibility to bear witness.

00:02:18.588 --> 00:02:20.456 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It just identified us.

00:02:20.456 --> 00:02:22.592 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But it was far more than a label though.

00:02:22.592 --> 00:02:25.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You represent the Most High God, Jehovah.

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:27.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you have to get out
in this preaching work,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you also have to have conduct

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:33.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that supports the fact
that you do worship this true God.

00:02:33.436 --> 00:02:35.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So at that particular time,

00:02:35.438 --> 00:02:39.175 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we went from being a vague group of persons

00:02:39.175 --> 00:02:41.611 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
who were joined together

00:02:41.611 --> 00:02:45.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by a common interest
in studying the Scriptures to being

00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:49.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a Scriptural identity
that we could stand up and be proud of.

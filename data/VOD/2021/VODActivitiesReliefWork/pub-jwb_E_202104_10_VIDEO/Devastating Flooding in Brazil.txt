00:00:16 The city is in devastation.
00:00:18 It’s in chaos.
00:00:20 Bridges have collapsed.
00:00:22 Many houses on the edge of the river
00:00:24 were swept away.
00:00:26 Our main concern
00:00:28 was the health of our brothers
00:00:30 and their well-being.
00:00:32 We got in contact with some of the local elders,
00:00:34 who reassured us  that everyone was safe.
00:00:38 So immediately we started getting in contact
00:00:41 with brothers from the circuit,
00:00:43 and in a few hours, almost one and a half tons of food
00:00:46 was received at the support center.
00:00:58 We had an experience with an older lady.
00:01:00 Because she had seen so many people
00:01:02 at our house cleaning up, she asked us:
00:01:05 “Why are there so many people at your house?
00:01:07 Do they all live in your house?”
00:01:09 “No, they’re brothers and sisters from our congregation.
00:01:12 We’re Jehovah’s Witnesses.”
00:01:14 “Ah, but nobody came from my church to help me,
00:01:17 “not even to assist me to get out of the house
00:01:19 and certainly not to clean up my house.”
00:01:22 So we really see what a privilege it is to have our brotherhood.
00:01:26 Even though our city is in this state,
00:01:28 we as Jehovah’s people
00:01:30 are together and united, and we’re all right.
00:01:33 Without a doubt, Jehovah is helping us and he’s with us.

The city is in devastation.

00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:20.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s in chaos.

00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:22.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bridges have collapsed.

00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:24.169 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Many houses on the edge of the river

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:25.796 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were swept away.

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:28.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our main concern

00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:30.175 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was the health of our brothers

00:00:30.175 --> 00:00:31.719 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and their well-being.

00:00:32.428 --> 00:00:34.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We got in contact
with some of the local elders,

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who reassured us 
that everyone was safe.

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So immediately we started getting in contact

00:00:41.437 --> 00:00:43.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with brothers from the circuit,

00:00:43.147 --> 00:00:46.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in a few hours,
almost one and a half tons of food

00:00:46.734 --> 00:00:49.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was received at the support center.

00:00:58.287 --> 00:01:00.831 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We had an experience with an older lady.

00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:02.833 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Because she had seen so many people

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:05.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at our house cleaning up, she asked us:

00:01:05.085 --> 00:01:07.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why are there so many people at your house?

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:09.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do they all live in your house?”

00:01:09.798 --> 00:01:12.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No, they’re brothers and sisters
from our congregation.

00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:14.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re Jehovah’s Witnesses.”

00:01:14.511 --> 00:01:17.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Ah, but nobody came
from my church to help me,

00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:19.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not even to assist me
to get out of the house

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and certainly not to clean up my house.”

00:01:22.144 --> 00:01:25.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we really see what a privilege it is
to have our brotherhood.

00:01:26.523 --> 00:01:28.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though our city is in this state,

00:01:28.567 --> 00:01:30.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we as Jehovah’s people

00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:33.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are together and united, and we’re all right.

00:01:33.405 --> 00:01:37.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without a doubt,
Jehovah is helping us and he’s with us.

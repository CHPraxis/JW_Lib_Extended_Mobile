Danny is going to look after the business

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while we’re away.

00:00:16.787 --> 00:00:19.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I only scheduled a few small jobs.

00:00:20.624 --> 00:00:23.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure he can handle it.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s our assigned convention,

00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:35.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I planned as best I could
for us to go together.

00:00:39.101 --> 00:00:41.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But some things

00:00:41.312 --> 00:00:43.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you just can’t see coming.

00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:45.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello.

00:00:45.232 --> 00:00:47.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Danny was in a panic.

00:00:47.234 --> 00:00:50.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He got trouble calls
from my two biggest accounts.

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:55.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was bad.

00:00:58.787 --> 00:01:01.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t lose their business.

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:08.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, just find the parts,

00:01:08.213 --> 00:01:10.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ll call you back.

00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:13.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This will take all weekend.

00:01:13.636 --> 00:01:15.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You want us to go?

00:01:15.095 --> 00:01:17.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will you get the program later?

00:01:17.723 --> 00:01:21.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, and I’ll have to text John
that I can’t be an attendant.

00:01:21.518 --> 00:01:24.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what will I miss that I can’t get later?

00:01:36.575 --> 00:01:39.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Hebrews 11:26 it says

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses “considered the reproach of the Christ

00:01:44.124 --> 00:01:48.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to be riches greater
than the treasure of Egypt,

00:01:48.462 --> 00:01:52.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for he looked intently
toward the payment of the reward.”

00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:55.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of what value is being a prince of Egypt
compared with being . . .

00:01:55.761 --> 00:01:57.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Honey?

00:02:00.224 --> 00:02:03.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Honey, what do you think?

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Danny?

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:16.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s what I want you to do for now,

00:02:16.407 --> 00:02:18.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll pick up the pieces when I get back.

00:00:01 There are many people who love to boast.
00:00:06 Politicians frequently boast about what they have done
00:00:11 and what they have promised to do for their constituents.
00:00:14 And businessmen,
00:00:16 they love to boast about how successful they are
00:00:20 and how much money they are making.
00:00:22 And athletes, you know, athletes are prideful, many of them.
00:00:27 And they boast about the events
00:00:30 that they’ve been great in and that they’ve won.
00:00:32 In fact, you know, it’s interesting to note
00:00:35 that in the highly competitive sports world,
00:00:39 there is an expression for great achievers.
00:00:42 The expression is GOAT
00:00:45 —G-O-A-T—
00:00:48 greatest of all time.
00:00:51 Can you imagine people thinking
00:00:54 that somehow they have been the greatest of all time?
00:00:58 When we hear the words “greatest of all time,”
00:01:02 only one person comes to mind.
00:01:05 He was the greatest man who ever lived
00:01:07 —truly the greatest of all time, Jesus Christ.
00:01:11 And his greatness had nothing to do
00:01:14 with politics, business,
00:01:17 or playing games.
00:01:20 But it had everything to do
00:01:22 with praising Jehovah and boasting
00:01:27 in Jehovah God.
00:01:29 Jesus knew the counsel that’s recorded
00:01:31 at Jeremiah chapter 9,
00:01:35 verses 23, 24.
00:01:38 And this scripture, this text, is beautiful.
00:01:41 Jeremiah 9:23, 24
00:01:43 —it says:
00:01:46 “This is what Jehovah says:
00:01:49 “‘Let not the wise man boast about his wisdom;
00:01:53 “‘let not the mighty man boast about his mightiness;
00:01:58 “‘and let not the rich man boast about his riches.
00:02:03 “‘But let the one boasting
00:02:06 “‘boast about this:
00:02:08 “‘That he has insight and knowledge of me,
00:02:12 “‘that I am Jehovah,
00:02:15 “‘the One showing loyal love,
00:02:18 “‘justice, and righteousness in the earth,
00:02:22 “‘for in these things
00:02:24 I take delight,’ declares Jehovah.”
00:02:27 Isn’t that beautiful?
00:02:29 So to boast in Jehovah really means
00:02:32 that we take pride in our God, Jehovah.
00:02:35 We’re proud to bear his name.
00:02:37 We rejoice in his reputation.
00:02:40 We’ve got it in the Scriptures, and we can see it
00:02:43 in the organization today.
00:02:46 And Jehovah takes delight when we boast in him
00:02:50 —in his provisions, in his justice,
00:02:54 in his promises, and in his loyal love.
00:02:58 So you students of the 150th class of Gilead
00:03:03 (students, soon-to-be graduates, I should add),
00:03:06 you’ve got a lot of reasons to boast in Jehovah God.
00:03:10 And you know that throughout his ministry, Jesus boasted in Jehovah.
00:03:15 If you examine closely the Scriptures and things that Jesus said,
00:03:19 you’ll be able to see on many occasions
00:03:21 how he boasted in Jehovah.
00:03:24 Just to give you one example,
00:03:26 remember when the rich young ruler approached Jesus and he said:
00:03:29 “[Oh,] Good Teacher” to the Lord Jesus Christ?
00:03:33 And what did Jesus say?
00:03:35 “Why do you call me good?
00:03:38 Nobody is good except one, God.”
00:03:43 That was a wonderful boast
00:03:45 in Jehovah God, glorifying him.
00:03:49 So you students can boast in Jehovah
00:03:51 (you’ve been doing it for a long time)
00:03:53 because now you have
00:03:55 the privilege of going out, fulfilling an assignment,
00:03:59 and showing how much you really do rely on Jehovah God.
00:04:04 You can boast because you’ve experienced what Jesus declared
00:04:07 at John 8:32.
00:04:11 Jesus said: “And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”
00:04:15 Well, that’s something we all know.
00:04:17 But don’t minimize it.
00:04:19 Appreciate the freedom you have right now
00:04:23 because you know the truth.
00:04:25 You’ve been set free from the lies of this world
00:04:29 that hold people in bondage about false beliefs in life and death.
00:04:34 You’re free from human thinking that man
00:04:36 is going to remedy the problems of this old world,
00:04:39 and we know they can’t do it.
00:04:41 They haven’t got the wherewithal to do it.
00:04:43 No man can really “direct his [own steps],” not even a perfect man.
00:04:48 Jehovah can deliver his people too.
00:04:52 Even where we’re under severe persecution,
00:04:56 Jehovah can intervene whenever he sees fit to do so.
00:05:01 You can boast also in another thing —that you are slaves of Jehovah.
00:05:05 Now, you’re in a unique position because very few slaves
00:05:08 are allowed to choose their master,
00:05:10 but you’ve done it.
00:05:12 You’ve chosen Jehovah God
00:05:15 to be your Master and to be a slave to him.
00:05:18 And you know that Jehovah is with you.
00:05:21 And you’re happy, and you’re willing slaves of Jehovah and of Jesus Christ.
00:05:25 And it’s a remarkable slavery, really,
00:05:28 because no one has the freedom
00:05:32 that we enjoy in our slavery to Jehovah God.
00:05:35 We’re so free and able to do so many things
00:05:39 serving Jehovah but all the while
00:05:42 enjoying the good life that God has given to us.
00:05:46 You can boast also in the brotherhood,
00:05:49 that you can gather together in assemblies to praise Jehovah God.
00:05:53 And you know Jesus’ words are true:
00:05:55 ‘Two or three are gathered in his name.
00:05:57 There he is in our midst.’
00:05:59 So whether it’s tens of thousands gathered together at a big convention
00:06:03 or two or three gathering together secretly,
00:06:07 you know that Jesus Christ is there with you.
00:06:11 You can also boast in the great privilege you have through prayer.
00:06:15 Just think about it for a moment.
00:06:17 You can talk to the almighty Creator of the universe personally.
00:06:22 That is really something quite remarkable.
00:06:25 But that is a privilege we have,
00:06:27 and we boast in the privilege we have
00:06:29 of addressing Jehovah and asking him for his help,
00:06:33 for his spirit to guide us, for his strength and protection.
00:06:37 And there’s something else too that I find fascinating
00:06:39 that you can boast in.
00:06:41 You can boast because you bear
00:06:44 the fear-inspiring name Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:06:48 Think about that.
00:06:50 You’re carrying Jehovah’s name.
00:06:53 And how grateful, really, we are that back in 1931
00:06:57 the visible part of Jehovah’s organization
00:07:00 adopted the name Jehovah’s Witnesses!
00:07:03 And it’s not just the name of a religion.
00:07:07 It’s a description of what people do.
00:07:10 They live their lives to honor Jehovah God.
00:07:13 They are living Witnesses of the Creator.
00:07:17 That is a privilege that we have,
00:07:19 and that separates us from all religion on the earth.
00:07:22 And there’s no other religion that wants that name anyhow.
00:07:25 But we’re delighted that we have it.
00:07:28 And they regret, perhaps a few, that they didn’t listen to or adopt it.
00:07:35 We are God’s name people, and at 1 Chronicles 16:10,
00:07:39 it says this: “Boast about his holy name.
00:07:44 Let the hearts of those seeking Jehovah rejoice.”
00:07:48 And if you examine synonyms,
00:07:51 “rejoice” is a synonym in certain cases
00:07:54 for “boast”—to boast in Jehovah.
00:07:58 And you can boast over the fact that Jehovah
00:08:01 has allowed you a very special privilege.
00:08:04 You can see the unseen.
00:08:08 Not all people can do that.
00:08:10 The vision of many people in this world
00:08:12 is limited to just the physical that they see before them,
00:08:16 but they can’t see the unseen.
00:08:18 I remember a man who said,
00:08:21 “What has God ever done for me?”
00:08:24 That poor man.
00:08:25 He was blind—totally blind spiritually.
00:08:29 He enjoyed food, drink, the things the earth provides,
00:08:32 but he couldn’t see behind those physical things.
00:08:36 He couldn’t see that there had to be a wonderful Creator
00:08:40 who provided all of these things for him.
00:08:45 You can see the unseen.
00:08:48 You see Jesus Christ ruling as King in the heavens.
00:08:51 You see the new world that’s coming.
00:08:54 You see the resurrection of the dead.
00:08:56 You see the functioning of Jehovah God’s holy spirit
00:09:00 on his people today.
00:09:03 Finally, you know very well
00:09:05 that we’ve only touched on a few things that you can boast in,
00:09:09 but you’ll want to continue doing that —boasting in Jehovah.
00:09:14 And right now, I know (all of you students) you feel great.
00:09:17 You’ve completed your course. You’ve done it.
00:09:19 You’re graduating from Gilead School,
00:09:22 and now the doors of future activity
00:09:25 are swinging open to you.
00:09:28 So as you undertake your assignments,
00:09:31 whatever and wherever they may be,
00:09:35 do these things, please:
00:09:38 Stay humble,
00:09:40 be happy,
00:09:42 and work hard.
00:09:44 And always esteem highly
00:09:47 the great honor and privilege you have
00:09:50 to “boast in Jehovah.”

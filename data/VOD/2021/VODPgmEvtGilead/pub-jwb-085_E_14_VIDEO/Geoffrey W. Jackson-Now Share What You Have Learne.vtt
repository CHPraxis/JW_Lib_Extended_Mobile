00:00:01.117 --> 00:00:06.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The graduation of the 150th class of Gilead:

00:00:06.122 --> 00:00:08.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who would have thought that we would have

00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:12.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
150 classes of Gilead?

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:15.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And probably, for you students,
you were wondering if you would survive 

00:00:15.365 --> 00:00:19.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the 150th graduation.

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:21.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over the years,

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:25.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
graduations of Gilead
have taken various forms.

00:00:25.308 --> 00:00:27.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you look at this photograph,

00:00:27.477 --> 00:00:30.847 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
you’ll notice that for the 7th class,

00:00:30.847 --> 00:00:33.817 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the graduation was in 1946.

00:00:33.817 --> 00:00:35.819 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And what do you notice?

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:38.655 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The guests who came along were

00:00:38.655 --> 00:00:41.825 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in the open air, hoping for good weather.

00:00:41.825 --> 00:00:44.060 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And I’m told there was no—

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.062 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t a ticketed event.

00:00:46.062 --> 00:00:47.897 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So just those that wanted to come along

00:00:47.897 --> 00:00:49.199 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
came along.

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:50.834 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And then notice in the next one here

00:00:50.834 --> 00:00:52.702 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we’ve got the president

00:00:52.702 --> 00:00:54.704 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
giving one of the talks

00:00:54.704 --> 00:00:57.307 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on the stairs leading up to Gilead.

00:00:57.307 --> 00:00:59.542 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, things have changed.

00:00:59.542 --> 00:01:03.213 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In 1953, the 21st class

00:01:03.213 --> 00:01:07.150 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
graduated at Yankee Stadium,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.886 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and you’d imagine that was a huge event.

00:01:09.886 --> 00:01:11.888 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And in fact, it commemorated

00:01:11.888 --> 00:01:14.057 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the tenth anniversary of Gilead

00:01:14.057 --> 00:01:16.359 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and was very appropriate because that was

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:19.295 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a very special year, 1953.

00:01:19.295 --> 00:01:21.865 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That was the year that the U.S. government

00:01:21.865 --> 00:01:23.867 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
granted us legal status

00:01:23.867 --> 00:01:25.869 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so that we could have foreign students

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.937 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
come and join the school.

00:01:27.937 --> 00:01:29.272 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And then, of course,

00:01:29.272 --> 00:01:31.107 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
no matter what graduation we’ve had,

00:01:31.107 --> 00:01:33.476 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
there’s always the joyous look

00:01:33.476 --> 00:01:35.345 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on the faces of those graduating.

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:37.347 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That’s the common denominator.

00:01:38.414 --> 00:01:42.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, in recent years, we’ve had some
very different graduations as well

00:01:42.285 --> 00:01:45.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—haven’t we?—with no live audience.

00:01:45.755 --> 00:01:48.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But aren’t you happy
that we’ve got a live audience today?

00:01:55.431 --> 00:01:57.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, after the last few months,

00:01:57.433 --> 00:02:01.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ve been through so many lessons

00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:03.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and written exams and so on.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s been a lot of training.

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what has been the purpose of all of that?

00:02:08.945 --> 00:02:13.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when we think
of worldly institutions and education,

00:02:13.583 --> 00:02:17.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
usually it’s all
about the students, isn’t it?

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all about the dreams,
as Brother Morris mentioned.

00:02:21.291 --> 00:02:24.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all about their ambitions

00:02:24.127 --> 00:02:26.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their success
that they’re looking forward to.

00:02:26.963 --> 00:02:29.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about Gilead?

00:02:29.365 --> 00:02:34.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you’ve learned very clearly,
I’m sure, that it’s not about you.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you haven’t, maybe we need
to enroll you in the next class as well.

00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:42.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, as dedicated servants of Jehovah,

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:45.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see that nothing is about us.

00:02:45.882 --> 00:02:47.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not all about us.

00:02:47.717 --> 00:02:50.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s about what we can accomplish

00:02:50.153 --> 00:02:53.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in praising our heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:58.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now you’re at this point
where you’re about to graduate.

00:02:58.161 --> 00:03:00.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now what?

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now is the time for you
to share what you’ve learned with others.

00:03:05.335 --> 00:03:07.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what does that involve?

00:03:07.337 --> 00:03:10.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does this mean
you’re going to go to different assignments

00:03:10.006 --> 00:03:13.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and start up little Gilead classes
(you know, informally)

00:03:13.776 --> 00:03:16.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the back rooms of Kingdom Halls?

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wouldn’t advise that.

00:03:20.917 --> 00:03:25.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what does it mean to share
what you’ve learned with others?

00:03:25.688 --> 00:03:29.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as has already
been highlighted in this program,

00:03:29.893 --> 00:03:34.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your example
—working hard—is going to help others

00:03:34.664 --> 00:03:39.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see in action what you learned at Gilead.

00:03:39.002 --> 00:03:42.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But also we see a very interesting scripture

00:03:42.005 --> 00:03:44.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the second book of Timothy,

00:03:44.007 --> 00:03:47.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so please turn with me to 2 Timothy chapter 2

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 2.

00:03:49.612 --> 00:03:52.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here Paul is speaking to Timothy,

00:03:52.548 --> 00:03:56.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he captures the thought
of what else we need to do.

00:03:56.052 --> 00:03:58.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 2, it says:

00:03:58.054 --> 00:04:02.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The things you heard from me
that were supported by many witnesses,

00:04:02.258 --> 00:04:06.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“these things entrust
to faithful men, who, in turn,

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:10.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be adequately qualified
to teach others.”

00:04:11.901 --> 00:04:15.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we see from this particular verse?

00:04:15.538 --> 00:04:19.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, yes, you will teach
by your example by doing the hard work,

00:04:19.442 --> 00:04:22.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also you need
to take an interest in others

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, perhaps in a more informal setting,

00:04:25.982 --> 00:04:29.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help them to see the principles
and the lessons that you’ve learned

00:04:29.886 --> 00:04:32.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from your Gilead training.

00:04:32.088 --> 00:04:35.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s a very important thing.

00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:38.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can take the example
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:04:38.761 --> 00:04:41.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, Jesus’ main focus

00:04:41.564 --> 00:04:44.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the preaching
of the good news of the Kingdom, wasn’t it?

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:46.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s not all he did.

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:50.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we turn to Mark chapter 9,

00:04:50.106 --> 00:04:53.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice in Jesus’ busy schedule

00:04:53.476 --> 00:04:55.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what he made time for.

00:04:55.945 --> 00:05:00.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Mark 9:30, 31:

00:05:01.517 --> 00:05:04.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They departed from there
and went through Galilee,

00:05:04.954 --> 00:05:08.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he did not want anyone
to get to know about it.”

00:05:08.658 --> 00:05:12.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this was a time
when he wanted some peace and quiet.

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:13.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, verse 31 says

00:05:15.832 --> 00:05:20.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for he was teaching his disciples.”

00:05:20.103 --> 00:05:24.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jesus took time
from his busy schedule to show interest

00:05:24.841 --> 00:05:29.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in those who he was training to help them
to be prepared for the future.

00:05:29.846 --> 00:05:33.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s a wonderful example for us.

00:05:33.182 --> 00:05:36.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we look through the Scriptures,
we see many examples,

00:05:36.185 --> 00:05:41.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but for the next few minutes,
we’re going to think about Barnabas

00:05:41.024 --> 00:05:43.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how Barnabas

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:47.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was able to share what he learned with Paul.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we think about what happened

00:05:49.665 --> 00:05:52.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in that interaction
between Barnabas and Paul,

00:05:52.935 --> 00:05:55.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to learn five lessons

00:05:55.872 --> 00:05:57.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—five lessons that teach us

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to handle training others
and passing on what we’ve learned.

00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:07.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the first lesson: If you turn with me,
please, to the book of Acts

00:06:07.517 --> 00:06:09.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Acts chapter 9—

00:06:09.952 --> 00:06:14.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this takes us to around the year 36 C.E.

00:06:14.057 --> 00:06:18.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Saul has already become a Christian.

00:06:18.094 --> 00:06:21.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, after a while, he arrives in Jerusalem.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what happens?

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:25.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 26 of chapter 9, it says:

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:28.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On arriving in Jerusalem, he [that’s Paul]

00:06:28.771 --> 00:06:31.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“made efforts to join the disciples,

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:35.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but they were
all afraid of him [I wonder why],

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:39.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they did not believe
he was a disciple.”

00:06:39.148 --> 00:06:43.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were thinking,
‘This is going to be a very dangerous thing.’

00:06:43.686 --> 00:06:46.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, what happened in verse 27?

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:49.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So Barnabas came to his aid

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:52.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and led him to the apostles.”

00:06:53.096 --> 00:06:56.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we see, as pictured here,

00:06:56.165 --> 00:07:00.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Barnabas saw the potential in Saul

00:07:00.636 --> 00:07:03.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and believed that, really,

00:07:03.272 --> 00:07:05.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he could be useful
in Jehovah’s service.

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:08.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he risked his reputation, you might say,

00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:11.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by supporting, or sponsoring,

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saul and taking him to the apostles.

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:18.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the lesson
that we learn from this?

00:07:18.988 --> 00:07:23.559 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Try to see the potential in others.

00:07:23.559 --> 00:07:26.028 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And don’t worry about if you

00:07:26.028 --> 00:07:27.363 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
perhaps encourage them

00:07:27.363 --> 00:07:28.731 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and if you give them support

00:07:28.731 --> 00:07:30.733 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—you sponsor them, you might say—

00:07:30.733 --> 00:07:32.735 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and then they don’t really turn out well

00:07:32.735 --> 00:07:34.537 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and that now all of a sudden your reputation

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:36.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is going to be tarnished.

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:39.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, it’s not all about you.

00:07:39.142 --> 00:07:41.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s what is good for the work.

00:07:41.611 --> 00:07:43.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s the first lesson.

00:07:43.613 --> 00:07:46.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try to see the potential in others.

00:07:46.816 --> 00:07:50.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if we turn across to Acts chapter 11,

00:07:50.853 --> 00:07:53.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is about nine years later,

00:07:53.923 --> 00:07:56.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
around the year 45 C.E.

00:07:56.859 --> 00:07:59.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in chapter 11 of Acts,

00:07:59.695 --> 00:08:03.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the work is going ahead in the Gentile field

00:08:03.332 --> 00:08:06.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and particularly in the city of Antioch.

00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:10.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Barnabas was assigned by the brothers

00:08:10.606 --> 00:08:14.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go and help the congregation in Antioch.

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:18.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s look down in verses 25 and 26,

00:08:18.147 --> 00:08:20.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because as soon as Barnabas arrived there,

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:24.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he realized he needed help.

00:08:24.387 --> 00:08:26.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what did he do?

00:08:26.489 --> 00:08:29.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in verse 25, it says:

00:08:29.025 --> 00:08:31.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He [that’s Barnabas]

00:08:31.027 --> 00:08:35.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
went to Tarsus
to make a thorough search for Saul.”

00:08:36.632 --> 00:08:39.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he went to find Saul.

00:08:39.168 --> 00:08:41.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He remembered that this was a man

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:45.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who could speak Greek and was well-educated.

00:08:45.107 --> 00:08:48.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’d be able to help him
with the Gentile field.

00:08:48.177 --> 00:08:51.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s interesting that when you
look at a map, you’ll notice

00:08:52.215 --> 00:08:55.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it’s about 120 miles

00:08:55.218 --> 00:09:00.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Antioch to Tarsus,
or about 200 kilometers.

00:09:00.223 --> 00:09:04.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It mentions here in verse 25
that he made “a thorough search for Saul.”

00:09:04.126 --> 00:09:05.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:09:05.127 --> 00:09:09.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if we compare 1 Corinthians,
where Paul lists all the things he did,

00:09:09.732 --> 00:09:14.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many of those, it appears,
happened in those nine years.

00:09:14.604 --> 00:09:18.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was shipwrecked several times,
put into prison, and so on.

00:09:18.241 --> 00:09:20.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he was very busy.

00:09:20.309 --> 00:09:23.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Barnabas sought him out,
and then what did he have to do?

00:09:23.879 --> 00:09:27.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in verse 26, it says:
“After he found him,

00:09:27.483 --> 00:09:29.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he brought him to Antioch.”

00:09:29.552 --> 00:09:31.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what did he have to do?

00:09:31.554 --> 00:09:33.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had to convince Saul.

00:09:33.956 --> 00:09:36.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can imagine
that may have been a little difficult

00:09:36.259 --> 00:09:39.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Saul was having
a productive ministry.

00:09:39.228 --> 00:09:41.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he brought him to Antioch.

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then verse 26 says:

00:09:43.532 --> 00:09:47.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For a whole year they assembled
with him in the congregation

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and taught quite a crowd.”

00:09:49.972 --> 00:09:54.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Barnabas didn’t take Paul and say,
“Now I’m going to teach you.”

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:57.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He just had him work along with him.

00:09:57.446 --> 00:10:02.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as they worked together,
that would have given Saul some training.

00:10:02.451 --> 00:10:04.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the lesson

00:10:04.186 --> 00:10:06.122 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we learn?

00:10:06.122 --> 00:10:08.124 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Be willing to make the effort.

00:10:08.124 --> 00:10:10.126 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You see, Barnabas not only

00:10:10.126 --> 00:10:11.861 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
saw the potential

00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:14.764 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but was willing to go and find Saul

00:10:14.764 --> 00:10:16.265 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and then convince him to come

00:10:16.265 --> 00:10:17.566 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and work with him,

00:10:17.566 --> 00:10:19.001 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and then they worked together.

00:10:19.001 --> 00:10:21.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s the second lesson.

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:25.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The third lesson is in Acts 13.

00:10:25.241 --> 00:10:30.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So after Barnabas and Saul
were in Antioch for some time,

00:10:30.246 --> 00:10:33.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what happened in verse 2?

00:10:33.082 --> 00:10:36.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “As they were ministering
to Jehovah and fasting,

00:10:36.652 --> 00:10:38.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the holy spirit said:

00:10:38.921 --> 00:10:42.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Set aside for me Barnabas and Saul

00:10:42.358 --> 00:10:45.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the work to which I have called them.’”

00:10:45.528 --> 00:10:50.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, this is a time when they’re
going out in the missionary field,

00:10:50.966 --> 00:10:55.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but notice that the holy spirit
mentions “Barnabas and Saul.”

00:10:55.504 --> 00:10:59.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in this illustration,
we see who is taking the lead—Barnabas.

00:10:59.675 --> 00:11:01.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saul is following along.

00:11:01.977 --> 00:11:05.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we look down further
in verse 13 of the same chapter,

00:11:06.716 --> 00:11:08.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see there’s a little change.

00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:13.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saul starts to use a name
that is more common in that area—Paul.

00:11:13.122 --> 00:11:15.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what does it say now?

00:11:15.124 --> 00:11:18.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Paul and his companions put out to sea.”

00:11:18.394 --> 00:11:23.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And from here on,
it seems that Paul took the lead.

00:11:23.399 --> 00:11:27.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s just imagine
for a little bit that you were Barnabas.

00:11:27.603 --> 00:11:32.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, maybe we could imagine
ourselves saying quietly to Saul, or Paul,

00:11:32.375 --> 00:11:34.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or whatever he was calling
himself at that time:

00:11:34.977 --> 00:11:37.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Can I just have a few words with you?

00:11:37.446 --> 00:11:41.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is not a big issue, but do you remember

00:11:41.083 --> 00:11:43.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when holy spirit said we were going out?

00:11:43.285 --> 00:11:46.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It was ‘Barnabas and Saul.’

00:11:47.456 --> 00:11:50.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now, now, I don’t have
a big problem with this.

00:11:50.092 --> 00:11:53.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But, you know, I appreciate your enthusiasm.

00:11:53.462 --> 00:11:57.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, really, I was the one designated
to take the lead here.”

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, he didn’t say that, did he?

00:11:59.435 --> 00:12:04.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The <i>Bearing Witness </i> book
mentions that he wasn’t envious at all.

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the lesson?

00:12:07.243 --> 00:12:11.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if we’re working along
with someone and training them,

00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:13.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the lesson is:

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:17.686 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Don’t be envious if they start to excel.

00:12:17.686 --> 00:12:19.822 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And actually, what we’re helping them

00:12:19.822 --> 00:12:21.490 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to do is to blossom.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:23.426 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And they will get some of the privileges

00:12:23.426 --> 00:12:24.827 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that perhaps we would have liked

00:12:24.827 --> 00:12:26.562 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
along the way.

00:12:26.562 --> 00:12:29.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we won’t be saying,
“Well, uhm, excuse me, uhm,

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:32.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I’m the one who went through Gilead.”

00:12:32.435 --> 00:12:35.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, we won’t be envious.

00:12:35.771 --> 00:12:39.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fourth lesson takes us
to the book of Galatians.

00:12:39.842 --> 00:12:44.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you turn with me
to Galatians chapter 2,

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:48.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is around the year 49 C.E.

00:12:48.317 --> 00:12:52.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Already, Peter and Paul and Barnabas

00:12:52.521 --> 00:12:55.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Titus had all been to Jerusalem,

00:12:55.024 --> 00:12:59.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’d had the big discussion
with the governing body about circumcision.

00:12:59.962 --> 00:13:02.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, when they
arrived in Jerusalem,

00:13:02.932 --> 00:13:06.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the account says that Barnabas
and Paul were there.

00:13:06.068 --> 00:13:07.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interesting.

00:13:07.403 --> 00:13:11.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe Barnabas took note of that,
that he was mentioned first again,

00:13:11.474 --> 00:13:14.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
probably because the governing body
remembered that was actually

00:13:14.944 --> 00:13:17.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the role originally.

00:13:17.112 --> 00:13:21.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we find
that Peter, Paul, and Barnabas

00:13:21.183 --> 00:13:23.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some others were back in Antioch.

00:13:23.786 --> 00:13:27.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what happened just a few months
after that special meeting?

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:32.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Paul had to tell Peter
that he was doing something wrong.

00:13:32.995 --> 00:13:35.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But notice, please, what verse 13 says:

00:13:37.533 --> 00:13:41.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The rest of the Jews also joined him
in putting on this pretense,

00:13:41.637 --> 00:13:45.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that even Barnabas was led along
with them in their pretense.”

00:13:45.975 --> 00:13:48.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I just love this picture.

00:13:48.043 --> 00:13:51.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see Paul telling Peter he’s wrong,

00:13:51.413 --> 00:13:55.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have a look at Barnabas’ face.

00:13:55.885 --> 00:13:57.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He looks guilty.

00:13:57.887 --> 00:13:59.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Awkward!

00:14:01.757 --> 00:14:02.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see?

00:14:02.791 --> 00:14:05.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was caught in the crossfire.

00:14:05.294 --> 00:14:09.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He likewise was getting counsel
because he was involved with this.

00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:12.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what lesson

00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:13.736 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
do we gain from this?

00:14:13.736 --> 00:14:15.738 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Accept counsel

00:14:15.738 --> 00:14:17.806 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
even from those whom we are viewing

00:14:17.806 --> 00:14:19.975 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
as the ones whom we’re training.

00:14:19.975 --> 00:14:21.577 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Don’t feel that we’re 

00:14:21.577 --> 00:14:24.113 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
above accepting counsel.

00:14:24.813 --> 00:14:29.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the final lesson is the one
probably you thought about immediately

00:14:29.184 --> 00:14:31.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we mentioned Paul and Barnabas.

00:14:31.186 --> 00:14:33.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know what you were thinking—Acts 15.

00:14:33.522 --> 00:14:35.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s turn there

00:14:35.157 --> 00:14:40.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Acts 15:37-39.

00:14:42.398 --> 00:14:46.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is after the incident in Antioch.

00:14:46.001 --> 00:14:50.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it says: “Barnabas was determined
to take along John,

00:14:50.472 --> 00:14:52.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who was called Mark.

00:14:52.675 --> 00:14:56.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Paul, however, was not in favor
of taking him along with them,

00:14:56.912 --> 00:15:00.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“seeing that he had departed
from them in Pamphylia

00:15:00.015 --> 00:15:02.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and had not gone with them to the work.

00:15:02.751 --> 00:15:06.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At this there was a sharp burst of anger,

00:15:06.355 --> 00:15:10.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they separated from each other.”

00:15:10.292 --> 00:15:13.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is the instance
that we usually remember

00:15:13.262 --> 00:15:16.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we think of Paul and Barnabas.

00:15:16.432 --> 00:15:18.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What led to this problem?

00:15:18.467 --> 00:15:20.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever thought about that?

00:15:20.536 --> 00:15:23.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It mentions that Paul was very hesitant

00:15:23.439 --> 00:15:26.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about taking John Mark along with them.

00:15:26.475 --> 00:15:30.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps he remembered
on that first missionary tour

00:15:30.145 --> 00:15:32.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when John Mark had gone back,

00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:35.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he and Barnabas continued on into Galatia.

00:15:35.584 --> 00:15:38.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And reading what Paul said to the Galatians,

00:15:38.187 --> 00:15:42.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it seems obvious that Paul
had problems with his eyes

00:15:42.191 --> 00:15:44.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he was very sick at that point.

00:15:44.893 --> 00:15:49.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, no doubt, you know,
he missed having a young man available

00:15:49.298 --> 00:15:53.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to carry the luggage and to do
all the things that needed to be done.

00:15:53.502 --> 00:15:58.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Barnabas could understand
why Paul was hesitant.

00:15:58.507 --> 00:16:01.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t want to lose the help again.

00:16:01.377 --> 00:16:03.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then, on the other hand,
what about Barnabas?

00:16:03.679 --> 00:16:08.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do you think he was
so determined to take John Mark?

00:16:08.017 --> 00:16:11.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it could be the fact
that he was a relative

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(that sometimes comes into a factor),

00:16:14.156 --> 00:16:16.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or it could be the fact

00:16:16.892 --> 00:16:20.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Barnabas saw the potential in Saul

00:16:20.129 --> 00:16:22.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the same thing he saw in John Mark.

00:16:22.765 --> 00:16:24.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is a good young man.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to give him a chance.”

00:16:27.636 --> 00:16:31.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or could it be that he was
still stinging a little bit

00:16:31.473 --> 00:16:34.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after the rebuke in Antioch?

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:39.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or could it be that he was still viewing

00:16:39.281 --> 00:16:42.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saul, or Paul, as a student,

00:16:42.084 --> 00:16:45.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
someone newer in the truth
than him and someone from whom

00:16:45.554 --> 00:16:49.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he just found it hard to accept his opinion?

00:16:49.324 --> 00:16:53.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we’re not going to play
the “blame game.”

00:16:53.662 --> 00:16:56.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of us will be working
with these brothers later.

00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:07.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I feel safe in saying this:

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure that Paul and Barnabas

00:17:10.713 --> 00:17:13.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they think back to that day

00:17:13.248 --> 00:17:15.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would agree that they
could have done things better.

00:17:15.417 --> 00:17:17.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that a safe comment?

00:17:17.419 --> 00:17:21.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think all of us have times
when we felt maybe we were right,

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we could have handled it better.

00:17:24.026 --> 00:17:26.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the lesson?

00:17:26.795 --> 00:17:29.565 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Try to respect different opinions;

00:17:29.565 --> 00:17:31.600 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
don’t overreact.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.302 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Don’t get upset.

00:17:33.302 --> 00:17:34.903 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Try to work through things

00:17:34.903 --> 00:17:36.605 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so that it doesn’t affect

00:17:36.605 --> 00:17:38.640 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
our working relationship.

00:17:39.341 --> 00:17:43.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when we’ve thought
about Barnabas and Paul,

00:17:43.045 --> 00:17:45.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it really gives us
a lot of food for thought, doesn’t it?

00:17:45.914 --> 00:17:48.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember those five lessons?

00:17:48.117 --> 00:17:51.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try to see the potential in others.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:56.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then be willing to put forward
the effort that’s required to train them.

00:17:56.425 --> 00:17:59.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t be envious if they get privileges.

00:17:59.862 --> 00:18:02.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Accept counsel if they offer you counsel,

00:18:02.498 --> 00:18:05.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and respect their opinions as well.

00:18:05.534 --> 00:18:10.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that you’ll try
to implement those suggestions.

00:18:10.105 --> 00:18:13.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, as you go to your assignments,

00:18:13.642 --> 00:18:16.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may Jehovah be with you and bless you.

00:18:16.779 --> 00:18:21.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May you try to help others
by sharing what you’ve learned at Gilead.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:25.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in that way, you will fulfill
the purpose of Gilead

00:18:25.721 --> 00:18:29.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to stabilize and strengthen others.

Have you ever had to sue for peace?

00:00:05.722 --> 00:00:07.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While you’re thinking of that question,

00:00:07.724 --> 00:00:10.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would you please turn with me
to Luke chapter 14?

00:00:12.028 --> 00:00:14.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to put you and me

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the middle of one of Jesus’ illustrations.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus has been talking about what it costs

00:00:20.637 --> 00:00:23.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to become one of his disciples.

00:00:23.139 --> 00:00:26.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in verse 31, he says:

00:00:26.976 --> 00:00:29.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Or what king

00:00:29.145 --> 00:00:32.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[this is where we come in, what king]

00:00:32.315 --> 00:00:34.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“marching out against another king in war

00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:39.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“does not first sit down and take counsel
whether he is able with 10,000 troops

00:00:39.355 --> 00:00:44.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to stand up to the one who comes
against him with 20,000?

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:46.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If, in fact, he cannot do so,

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:50.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“then while that one is yet far away,

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:54.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he sends out a body of ambassadors
and sues for peace.”

00:00:56.473 --> 00:01:00.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you think that conversation goes?

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I want peace, and these are my terms.”

00:01:04.948 --> 00:01:06.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hardly!

00:01:07.016 --> 00:01:10.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s more like:
“I don’t want to be your enemy.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please tell me what to do
so that I can have peace with you.”

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:21.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, with that in mind,
Jesus gives the application, verse 33:

00:01:21.297 --> 00:01:25.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the same way, you may be sure
that not one of you

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:29.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who does not say good-bye
to all his belongings

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be my disciple.”

00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:34.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is you and me.

00:01:34.944 --> 00:01:37.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We got to the point where we realized

00:01:37.247 --> 00:01:39.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we did not want to be an enemy of Jehovah.

00:01:39.949 --> 00:01:43.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we were willing
to sacrifice everything

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—belongings, career, status, everything—

00:01:47.557 --> 00:01:50.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the privilege of being
at peace with Jehovah

00:01:50.894 --> 00:01:52.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and being a disciple of his Son.

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:56.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now for you students of class 150,

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:59.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your pursuit of peace with Jehovah

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:02.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has led you
into the special full-time service.

00:02:02.172 --> 00:02:06.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a beautiful record
every one of you has set!

00:02:07.644 --> 00:02:10.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You remind me in many ways

00:02:10.313 --> 00:02:12.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a group in the Bible

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:15.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that literally sued for peace.

00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:19.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their story is told
in the book of Joshua chapter 9.

00:02:19.823 --> 00:02:23.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right;
we’re talking about the Gibeonites.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have Joshua chapter 9?

00:02:26.462 --> 00:02:30.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, they had heard of all the things
that Jehovah had done

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for his people, Israel, and to his enemies.

00:02:34.337 --> 00:02:36.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They did not want to be Jehovah’s enemy.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so they did exactly
what the king in Jesus’ illustration did.

00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:44.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They sent a body of ambassadors.

00:02:44.447 --> 00:02:47.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Joshua chapter 9

00:02:47.383 --> 00:02:51.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and this is the opening overture

00:02:51.354 --> 00:02:54.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in verse 6:

00:02:54.357 --> 00:02:57.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We have come from a distant land.

00:02:57.227 --> 00:03:00.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now make a covenant with us.”

00:03:01.197 --> 00:03:06.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they didn’t get a very warm
initial reception, they persisted.

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:09.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 8: “We are your servants.”

00:03:09.906 --> 00:03:14.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words,
“Set the terms; we want peace.”

00:03:14.344 --> 00:03:18.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were willing to sacrifice everything

00:03:18.414 --> 00:03:22.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to enjoy peace
with Israel and with Israel’s God.

00:03:23.653 --> 00:03:27.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Joshua and the chieftains
didn’t see it exactly the same way,

00:03:27.056 --> 00:03:29.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
particularly when they found out

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they were not from a distant land
as they had claimed.

00:03:32.762 --> 00:03:34.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nobody likes to be fooled.

00:03:34.764 --> 00:03:37.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the tone got a little sterner.

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:41.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So turn and look at verse 23.

00:03:41.204 --> 00:03:44.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what they said:
“From now on you are cursed,

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and you will always occupy
a slave’s position

00:03:47.877 --> 00:03:52.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as gatherers of wood and drawers of water
for the house of my God.”

00:03:53.716 --> 00:03:55.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will the Gibeonites say to that?

00:03:56.886 --> 00:04:00.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 25: “We are at your mercy.

00:04:00.857 --> 00:04:05.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do to us whatever you think
is good and right.”

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just so, the terms of peace were set.

00:04:10.133 --> 00:04:14.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 27: “That day Joshua made them

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“gatherers of wood and drawers of water

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:19.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for the assembly and for Jehovah’s altar

00:04:19.309 --> 00:04:21.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“at the place that He should choose,

00:04:21.577 --> 00:04:23.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they remain so to this day.”

00:04:25.381 --> 00:04:28.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now a few questions, a few lessons.

00:04:28.418 --> 00:04:32.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think
of the Gibeonites’ assignment?

00:04:33.056 --> 00:04:35.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was presented to them as a punishment.

00:04:35.658 --> 00:04:37.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But just think,

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they weren’t being sold off
as household slaves.

00:04:41.064 --> 00:04:44.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their humble service
would directly contribute

00:04:44.634 --> 00:04:49.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pure worship and support Jehovah’s people.

00:04:50.073 --> 00:04:52.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a privilege, isn’t it?

00:04:52.075 --> 00:04:56.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the kind of service
we reach out for as a privilege.

00:04:59.148 --> 00:05:01.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the kind of service—

00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:04.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was it because they were lowly people,

00:05:04.854 --> 00:05:09.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no skills to do anything else,
that they were given this kind of job?

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:12.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, look at chapter 10

00:05:12.795 --> 00:05:14.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 2

00:05:16.332 --> 00:05:18.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see the kind of people
the Gibeonites were:

00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:22.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Gibeon was a great city,
like one of the royal cities.

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:27.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It was greater than Ai,
and all its men were warriors

00:05:29.112 --> 00:05:31.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[capable, skilled people].”

00:05:31.914 --> 00:05:34.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However,

00:05:34.083 --> 00:05:36.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
clearly the Gibeonites realized

00:05:36.552 --> 00:05:40.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if their army was no match for Israel,

00:05:40.156 --> 00:05:42.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then Jehovah didn’t need them

00:05:42.859 --> 00:05:45.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to bolster his army
in order to complete the conquest.

00:05:45.895 --> 00:05:48.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was better for them

00:05:48.064 --> 00:05:52.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to ask Jehovah what he wanted them to do
and to do that.

00:05:52.702 --> 00:05:57.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the sacrifice was definitely worth it.

00:05:57.673 --> 00:06:02.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does that mean, though,
that their skills were irrelevant,

00:06:02.412 --> 00:06:04.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
never even considered?

00:06:05.081 --> 00:06:06.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, no.

00:06:06.315 --> 00:06:09.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, a few hundred years later,

00:06:09.352 --> 00:06:11.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ishmaiah the Gibeonite

00:06:11.387 --> 00:06:15.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is listed among David’s 30 mighty men.

00:06:15.158 --> 00:06:18.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Different needs call for different skills.

00:06:18.928 --> 00:06:22.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did Ishmaiah do with his skill?

00:06:22.832 --> 00:06:27.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he humbly defended pure worship
and Jehovah’s people.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the details of the assignment
were different,

00:06:30.973 --> 00:06:33.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the focus was about the same.

00:06:36.145 --> 00:06:39.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another question: Was this just

00:06:39.082 --> 00:06:41.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a short-term starter assignment?

00:06:41.984 --> 00:06:45.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Yes, we will do this for now,
but once the campaign is over,

00:06:45.788 --> 00:06:50.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll be able to resume
our regular place in society.”

00:06:51.794 --> 00:06:55.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go back to verse 27 of chapter 9.

00:06:55.198 --> 00:06:58.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember what Joshua said at this point

00:06:58.134 --> 00:06:59.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he gave them their assignment?

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:03.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They remain so to this day.”

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:07.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only to the day
that Joshua wrote these words

00:07:08.945 --> 00:07:11.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but about 900 years later

00:07:11.914 --> 00:07:16.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
among the exiles that returned
from Babylon to Jerusalem

00:07:16.085 --> 00:07:20.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to restore pure worship
there were temple servants,

00:07:20.323 --> 00:07:22.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and likely

00:07:22.458 --> 00:07:25.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this included descendants of the Gibeonites.

00:07:25.628 --> 00:07:29.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just think, these temple servants

00:07:29.098 --> 00:07:33.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
once again were willing to leave behind
the life that they’d built up

00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:37.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make the trek in behalf of pure worship

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take up their duties.

00:07:39.342 --> 00:07:42.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They must have really cherished
their assignment

00:07:42.645 --> 00:07:44.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to stick to it that way.

00:07:47.383 --> 00:07:49.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as we’ve talked about them,

00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:52.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have you been noting some personal lessons?

00:07:52.021 --> 00:07:54.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are the four that come to my mind.

00:07:55.992 --> 00:07:58.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number one, as with the king

00:07:58.694 --> 00:08:02.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jesus’ illustration and the Gibeonites,

00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:05.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
peace with Jehovah is such a treasure.

00:08:05.668 --> 00:08:09.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re willing to sacrifice
anything to enjoy it.

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:14.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number two, Jehovah’s terms for us

00:08:14.076 --> 00:08:16.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
include humble service

00:08:16.946 --> 00:08:21.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on behalf of pure worship
and in support of his people,

00:08:21.217 --> 00:08:23.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that kind of humble service

00:08:23.619 --> 00:08:26.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we view as the greatest privilege.

00:08:26.656 --> 00:08:31.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number three, different needs
call for different skills,

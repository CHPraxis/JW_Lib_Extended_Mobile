00:00:01.397 --> 00:00:04.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over the past few years,
we have all looked forward

00:00:04.692 --> 00:00:07.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to what has affectionately been called

00:00:07.653 --> 00:00:10.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:15.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time it will be conducted
by another one of the Gilead instructors,

00:00:15.161 --> 00:00:17.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Richard Chilton.

00:00:17.538 --> 00:00:19.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take it away, Brother Chilton!

00:00:45.692 --> 00:00:50.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome to this edition of <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:00:50.572 --> 00:00:53.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Joshua 24:15,

00:00:53.992 --> 00:00:56.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the tribes of Israel were instructed

00:00:56.703 --> 00:01:01.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “choose for [themselves] . . .
whom [they would] serve.”

00:01:01.208 --> 00:01:03.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, our four guests today

00:01:03.627 --> 00:01:06.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have had to make some choices of their own

00:01:06.588 --> 00:01:09.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—choices that no doubt contributed

00:01:09.383 --> 00:01:14.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to their qualifying to attend
the 149th class of Gilead.

00:01:14.388 --> 00:01:17.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s learn more about the choices they made

00:01:17.933 --> 00:01:20.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who helped them to do so

00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:22.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we meet our first guest,

00:01:22.896 --> 00:01:26.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Sung-hee Lee from South Korea.

00:01:32.865 --> 00:01:33.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome, Sung-hee.

00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:34.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:01:34.617 --> 00:01:36.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please have a seat.

00:01:37.244 --> 00:01:40.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Sung-hee, you come
from a family of worshippers

00:01:40.706 --> 00:01:44.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have been faithfully serving Jehovah
for three generations.

00:01:44.168 --> 00:01:45.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell us about them.

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:46.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:48.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It began with my grandmother.

00:01:48.631 --> 00:01:52.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was the first to become a Witness
back in 1970.

00:01:52.593 --> 00:01:55.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m so grateful to Jehovah
that all in my family

00:01:55.888 --> 00:01:59.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—my parents, my sister and her husband,

00:01:59.267 --> 00:02:03.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my brothers and their wives—
are all faithfully serving Jehovah

00:02:03.146 --> 00:02:05.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to this day.

00:02:05.481 --> 00:02:08.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s certainly a wonderful heritage
to be a part of.

00:02:08.693 --> 00:02:12.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, your current assignment
is at the branch office in Korea.

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How long have you been serving there?

00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:19.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if you count the first one
and a half years I served at Bethel,

00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:22.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would be nine and a half years.

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:26.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I say that because I was reassigned.

00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:29.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I actually left Bethel to go to prison.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, that’s not something
we typically hear

00:02:32.467 --> 00:02:34.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a reason for leaving Bethel, is it?

00:02:34.886 --> 00:02:36.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What happened?

00:02:36.972 --> 00:02:39.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, in South Korea,
all males become eligible

00:02:39.892 --> 00:02:43.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for military conscription when they turn 19,

00:02:43.228 --> 00:02:46.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a draft notice comes sometime after that.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As for us, Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:02:48.484 --> 00:02:50.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we refuse military service,

00:02:50.986 --> 00:02:54.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the result would be
a year and a half sentence in prison.

00:02:54.698 --> 00:02:56.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you may not go right away.

00:02:56.992 --> 00:02:58.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s interesting.

00:02:58.786 --> 00:03:01.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would be the factors
that would determine

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when your prison sentence
would actually begin?

00:03:05.292 --> 00:03:09.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the time you receive a draft notice
until you actually go to prison,

00:03:09.505 --> 00:03:11.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially in recent times,

00:03:11.716 --> 00:03:16.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that time period was unknown
and different for each brother.

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:19.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A lot depended on the judge you got.

00:03:19.223 --> 00:03:22.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As for me, I had to wait five years

00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:25.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the time I first appeared in the court

00:03:25.688 --> 00:03:28.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until I finally went to prison.

00:03:29.067 --> 00:03:32.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, was that frustrating
for you to, in effect,

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have your life be placed on hold
for five years?

00:03:36.407 --> 00:03:38.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Honestly, yes.

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:43.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But understanding that I could go to prison
at any moment,

00:03:43.373 --> 00:03:45.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to make a choice

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:50.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a choice as to how I was going
to spend my time.

00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:52.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do I use that time

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just staying at home doing nothing
and planning nothing,

00:03:55.552 --> 00:03:59.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since I could go into prison at any moment?

00:03:59.097 --> 00:04:02.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or do I use that time to earn some money

00:04:02.017 --> 00:04:05.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the time when I’m finally released
from prison?

00:04:05.103 --> 00:04:06.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or

00:04:06.772 --> 00:04:10.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do I use my life to the full,
pursuing spiritual things first

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while I could do so freely?

00:04:13.445 --> 00:04:15.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s quite the situation to be in.

00:04:15.864 --> 00:04:18.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was your thought process through that?

00:04:18.242 --> 00:04:22.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did you decide to do
given those circumstances?

00:04:22.329 --> 00:04:26.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the first thing I did was pray.

00:04:26.041 --> 00:04:28.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed and prayed.

00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:32.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And while doing research,
I came across an article

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a December 1, 2004,
issue of <i>The Watchtower,</i>

00:04:37.094 --> 00:04:41.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which was entitled
“Trusting in Jehovah’s Loving Care.”

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In that article, there was a quote that said:

00:04:44.477 --> 00:04:47.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We should plan ahead as if Armageddon

00:04:47.146 --> 00:04:49.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“would not come in our lifetime

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but [live] our life
as if it would come tomorrow.”

00:04:53.653 --> 00:04:56.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that was the answer I needed.

00:04:56.072 --> 00:05:00.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I decided to plan ahead

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as if my prison term wasn’t coming tomorrow.

00:05:04.873 --> 00:05:05.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So given those options

00:05:08.501 --> 00:05:10.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you mentioned to us a minute ago,

00:05:10.962 --> 00:05:14.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what did you decide to do?

00:05:14.132 --> 00:05:17.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I decided to pioneer.

00:05:17.093 --> 00:05:19.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also volunteered

00:05:19.095 --> 00:05:21.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the international convention.

00:05:21.306 --> 00:05:25.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here I’m welcoming the delegates
as they arrive to their hotel.

00:05:25.727 --> 00:05:29.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also even got accepted to Bethel.

00:05:29.398 --> 00:05:32.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here I’m working in my assignment.

00:05:32.859 --> 00:05:35.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here are the brothers and sisters
working in the Computer Department,

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:37.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where I work.

00:05:37.114 --> 00:05:38.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How nice!

00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:43.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let me ask you, how do you feel,
Sung-hee, that you benefited

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by choosing to pursue spiritual pursuits

00:05:46.373 --> 00:05:48.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while you were waiting for those five years?

00:05:48.542 --> 00:05:51.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pioneering and Bethel service

00:05:51.253 --> 00:05:54.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really helped me to prepare my heart
for the time

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the call finally came to go to prison.

00:05:57.593 --> 00:06:02.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was during this period
that I really grew spiritually.

00:06:02.264 --> 00:06:04.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I guess pioneering and Bethel

00:06:04.642 --> 00:06:08.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can have that positive effect
on a person, can’t it?

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the day did finally arrive
—didn’t it?—

00:06:12.316 --> 00:06:15.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you had to leave
and begin your prison sentence.

00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:17.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can only imagine what

00:06:17.113 --> 00:06:19.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a sobering moment that was for you.

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:21.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you mind telling us about it?

00:06:21.451 --> 00:06:22.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:06:22.452 --> 00:06:24.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the day came,

00:06:24.912 --> 00:06:27.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many in the Bethel family came outside

00:06:27.248 --> 00:06:30.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to wave me off and to cheer me on.

00:06:30.418 --> 00:06:33.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a moment that I’ll never forget.

00:06:33.505 --> 00:06:37.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One brother, he even said
he would always remember me in his heart,

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:41.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I really cherish what he said to me.

00:06:42.806 --> 00:06:45.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that was very encouraging, no doubt.

00:06:45.183 --> 00:06:48.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you mind talking about how life was

00:06:48.645 --> 00:06:51.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you in prison?

00:06:51.064 --> 00:06:55.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were definitely moments
when I felt anxious.

00:06:55.152 --> 00:07:00.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But my three fleshly brothers
and many other Korean brothers

00:07:00.157 --> 00:07:03.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also served their time in prison.

00:07:03.744 --> 00:07:06.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And their choices and experiences

00:07:06.997 --> 00:07:11.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped me decide how I was going to spend
my time in prison.

00:07:11.502 --> 00:07:13.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I decided to make a list right away

00:07:13.921 --> 00:07:17.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what to do while in prison.

00:07:17.049 --> 00:07:21.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I made some spiritual goals
such as reading the <i>Proclaimers </i> book

00:07:21.136 --> 00:07:23.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reading other publications.

00:07:23.514 --> 00:07:28.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And a group of about seven to eight brothers
in the same prison cell,

00:07:28.227 --> 00:07:31.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we discussed the daily text together

00:07:31.021 --> 00:07:34.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every day in the evening.

00:07:34.024 --> 00:07:38.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We called it evening worship,
similar to morning worship in Bethel.

00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:42.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that was certainly
a wise use of the time that you had there.

00:07:42.909 --> 00:07:47.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can you tell us
about the current situation in South Korea

00:07:47.497 --> 00:07:50.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our brothers
in connection with military service?

00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:56.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just a few months ago,
the authorities adopted alternative service

00:07:56.255 --> 00:07:59.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for proven conscientious objectors.

00:07:59.509 --> 00:08:03.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Under this arrangement,
you are not labeled as a convicted criminal.

00:08:03.805 --> 00:08:05.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you don’t live in a prison cell

00:08:05.932 --> 00:08:09.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but live in a more communal
living arrangement.

00:08:09.394 --> 00:08:12.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there is one thing
about this alternative service:

00:08:12.522 --> 00:08:15.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of your prison sentence
being a year and a half,

00:08:15.734 --> 00:08:19.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have to do alternative service
for three years.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!
OK, double the time.

00:08:23.074 --> 00:08:27.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, our hearts really go out
to our brothers and our sisters

00:08:27.996 --> 00:08:32.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have served time in prison
“for righteousness’ sake.”

00:08:33.001 --> 00:08:36.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you were able to complete
your prison sentence.

00:08:36.755 --> 00:08:39.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was next for you
once you were a free man?

00:08:39.967 --> 00:08:42.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without hesitation, I immediately filled out

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:45.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
another application to return to Bethel,

00:08:45.889 --> 00:08:49.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I was accepted to return to Bethel.

00:08:49.727 --> 00:08:50.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, good for you.

00:08:50.894 --> 00:08:52.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re glad that worked out.

00:08:52.896 --> 00:08:55.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we could just circle back
for just one moment.

00:08:55.858 --> 00:08:58.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You had mentioned

00:08:58.777 --> 00:09:03.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there was one thing in particular
that was especially helpful to you

00:09:03.157 --> 00:09:07.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that helped you endure
that difficult time in prison.

00:09:07.328 --> 00:09:09.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you mind telling us about it?

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course.

00:09:11.332 --> 00:09:14.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many brothers and sisters around the world

00:09:14.502 --> 00:09:18.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wrote to us brothers in prison.

00:09:18.422 --> 00:09:22.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I personally received a number of them.

00:09:22.844 --> 00:09:27.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, I brought some of them here,

00:09:27.682 --> 00:09:30.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right here, with me.

00:09:35.148 --> 00:09:37.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That someone

00:09:37.859 --> 00:09:40.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who never met me, who never knew me,

00:09:40.653 --> 00:09:42.697 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
wrote such encouraging,

00:09:42.697 --> 00:09:44.199 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
comforting letters, . . .

00:09:44.199 --> 00:09:44.741 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:09:44.741 --> 00:09:46.493 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
. . . it really warmed my heart

00:09:46.493 --> 00:09:48.245 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and really comforted me.

00:09:48.245 --> 00:09:50.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It made me feel that I’m never alone

00:09:50.664 --> 00:09:54.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wherever I am in the world

00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:56.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that I was part of a very special,

00:09:56.878 --> 00:10:00.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
close, loving, international brotherhood.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I read them over and over again,

00:10:03.802 --> 00:10:06.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I saved all of these letters.

00:10:07.347 --> 00:10:09.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, that is so encouraging, Sung-hee.

00:10:09.933 --> 00:10:14.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I have to ask you, why did you bring
these letters with you to New York?

00:10:16.106 --> 00:10:20.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, some of these letters came

00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:21.737 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from Bethelites right here

00:10:21.737 --> 00:10:23.781 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
at world headquarters.

00:10:23.781 --> 00:10:26.158 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to meet them in person

00:10:26.158 --> 00:10:28.369 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and tell them how much I appreciated

00:10:28.369 --> 00:10:30.454 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
all those letters and prayers

00:10:31.163 --> 00:10:34.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how they really helped me
to get through my time in prison.

00:10:35.251 --> 00:10:37.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could certainly understand
if those would have been

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:40.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some tearful reunions for you.

00:10:41.549 --> 00:10:46.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in conclusion, Sung-hee,
I just have one last question for you.

00:10:46.095 --> 00:10:49.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You had mentioned earlier
that when you were deciding

00:10:49.265 --> 00:10:52.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what you were going to do with the time
you had before going to prison,

00:10:52.852 --> 00:10:56.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you said that the first thing that you did
was pray.

00:10:56.689 --> 00:11:00.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why was prayer so important to you?

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through these experiences,
I’m absolutely confident

00:11:04.447 --> 00:11:08.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah both hears and answers
our prayers

00:11:08.576 --> 00:11:11.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we are faced with choices.

00:11:11.788 --> 00:11:15.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also I am confident
that by means of the prayers

00:11:15.166 --> 00:11:17.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were offered in my behalf,

00:11:17.335 --> 00:11:22.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah helped me to stick
to the choices that I had made

00:11:22.048 --> 00:11:24.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to stay loyal to him.

00:11:24.176 --> 00:11:27.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So please keep praying
for our brothers in prison

00:11:27.429 --> 00:11:29.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wherever they are in the world.

00:11:29.598 --> 00:11:32.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And please keep writing them letters.

00:11:33.602 --> 00:11:35.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I can assure you, Sung-hee,

00:11:35.938 --> 00:11:38.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll continue to do just that.

00:11:38.106 --> 00:11:42.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you so much for sharing
your encouraging experience with us.

00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:44.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really touched our hearts.

00:11:45.823 --> 00:11:48.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, next on our program,

00:11:48.158 --> 00:11:51.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to go all the way to West Africa,

00:11:51.495 --> 00:11:55.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where our next guests will be coming from,
the country of Senegal.

00:11:55.541 --> 00:11:58.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll meet Alain and Achaïe Tendeng.

00:12:05.676 --> 00:12:08.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Alain and Achaïe, welcome.

00:12:08.179 --> 00:12:10.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nice to have you with us on <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:12:10.681 --> 00:12:12.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:12:12.058 --> 00:12:13.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a pleasure to have you.

00:12:13.768 --> 00:12:16.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I understand
that your current assignment

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:21.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has you serving at the branch office
in Senegal, West Africa.

00:12:21.025 --> 00:12:24.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Alain, Senegal is your home,

00:12:24.112 --> 00:12:25.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
born and raised.

00:12:25.863 --> 00:12:28.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, Achaïe, I understand that you come

00:12:28.741 --> 00:12:31.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the neighboring country of Mali.

00:12:31.744 --> 00:12:34.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, I was told that your mother

00:12:34.247 --> 00:12:38.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comes from a very interesting part
of the country of Mali.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you tell us about it?

00:12:40.295 --> 00:12:41.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:12:41.254 --> 00:12:43.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mother is from Timbuktu.

00:12:43.506 --> 00:12:45.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, when I was young,

00:12:45.967 --> 00:12:48.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she took me there to visit her family.

00:12:49.554 --> 00:12:53.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Achaïe, you are probably
the first person that we have ever met

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that has actually been to Timbuktu.

00:12:56.812 --> 00:12:58.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is it like?

00:12:58.814 --> 00:12:59.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well,

00:12:59.856 --> 00:13:01.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you can see on the screen,

00:13:01.858 --> 00:13:04.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is what the region of Timbuktu
looks like.

00:13:04.444 --> 00:13:06.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is in the Sahara Desert,

00:13:06.697 --> 00:13:10.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which stretches on
for thousands of kilometers.

00:13:10.909 --> 00:13:12.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s obviously a very vast territory.

00:13:12.953 --> 00:13:17.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what can you tell us
about the people of the Timbuktu region?

00:13:17.916 --> 00:13:20.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people there live a nomadic lifestyle

00:13:20.961 --> 00:13:23.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and are nearly all Muslims.

00:13:23.797 --> 00:13:28.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, both my two parents
are from a Muslim background.

00:13:28.469 --> 00:13:30.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s quite interesting.

00:13:30.471 --> 00:13:34.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Given that background,
what were some of the challenges

00:13:34.141 --> 00:13:37.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you had to face
in becoming one of Jehovah’s Witnesses?

00:13:38.229 --> 00:13:42.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although I got baptized at 15 years of age,

00:13:42.191 --> 00:13:46.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t always make the best choices
in my teen years,

00:13:46.571 --> 00:13:50.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I had to suffer the consequences
of those choices.

00:13:50.575 --> 00:13:53.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, in my early 20’s,

00:13:53.077 --> 00:13:55.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I decided to build a strong

00:13:55.371 --> 00:13:58.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:13:58.917 --> 00:14:01.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To be able to do so, I received help

00:14:01.836 --> 00:14:05.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from spiritually mature brothers and sisters,

00:14:05.799 --> 00:14:09.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as pioneers, elders,

00:14:09.135 --> 00:14:11.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
missionaries.

00:14:11.179 --> 00:14:16.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, this is my spiritual mother
on the left side of the screen

00:14:16.184 --> 00:14:20.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, on the right side of the screen,
her missionary companion,

00:14:20.438 --> 00:14:23.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is still serving in Mali faithfully

00:14:23.066 --> 00:14:25.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for 45 years now.

00:14:26.319 --> 00:14:29.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of these mature persons helped me

00:14:29.156 --> 00:14:32.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see the value of personal study

00:14:32.701 --> 00:14:35.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “thinking ability.”

00:14:35.245 --> 00:14:40.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once I got this good habit
of reasoning on Bible principles,

00:14:40.167 --> 00:14:44.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could make good choices
that pleased Jehovah,

00:14:44.254 --> 00:14:47.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as leaving my well-paying job

00:14:47.174 --> 00:14:49.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and starting pioneering.

00:14:49.051 --> 00:14:51.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was not easy, however,

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:55.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because there was still this family pressure

00:14:55.558 --> 00:15:00.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for me to get a good job
and earn a good living.

00:15:00.271 --> 00:15:03.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I’m still striving to try to make
good decisions

00:15:03.733 --> 00:15:05.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that please Jehovah.

00:15:06.485 --> 00:15:07.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s encouraging.

00:15:07.528 --> 00:15:11.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In spite of the pressures
that you had to face,

00:15:11.199 --> 00:15:13.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you obviously continued making
good decisions,

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:16.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you were eventually appointed
to serve

00:15:16.204 --> 00:15:19.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a special pioneer—weren’t you?—
in the southern part of Mali

00:15:19.999 --> 00:15:23.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a region called Sikasso.

00:15:23.127 --> 00:15:25.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tell us about that, please.

00:15:25.421 --> 00:15:27.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, I was so happy there.

00:15:27.674 --> 00:15:30.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The preaching work was wonderful.

00:15:30.009 --> 00:15:32.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really enjoyed it.

00:15:32.637 --> 00:15:36.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is the Kingdom Hall where I served.

00:15:37.308 --> 00:15:40.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one day, we received a visit
from a circuit overseer

00:15:40.812 --> 00:15:43.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a single circuit overseer.

00:15:43.023 --> 00:15:43.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:15:43.898 --> 00:15:48.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I could see when you made that comment,
you looked over at Alain.

00:15:48.612 --> 00:15:51.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we can only assume that, Alain,

00:15:51.198 --> 00:15:54.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you were this young, handsome,

00:15:54.117 --> 00:15:56.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
single circuit overseer

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:59.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who visited Achaïe’s congregation in Sikasso.

00:15:59.623 --> 00:16:00.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that right?

00:16:00.582 --> 00:16:03.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I visited the congregation.

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:07.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we had already met previously
at a circuit assembly.

00:16:07.965 --> 00:16:10.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we knew each other.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:14.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at the time,
there was nothing special going on.

00:16:14.054 --> 00:16:14.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:16:14.847 --> 00:16:17.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, thank you for the clarification.

00:16:17.391 --> 00:16:19.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We appreciate that.

00:16:19.393 --> 00:16:22.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But since we’re now talking to you, Alain,

00:16:22.271 --> 00:16:25.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe we can hear
a little bit about your story.

00:16:25.232 --> 00:16:28.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you always want to be a circuit overseer?

00:16:28.736 --> 00:16:30.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, no.

00:16:30.738 --> 00:16:33.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, when I was a boy,

00:16:33.115 --> 00:16:35.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to become a Catholic priest.

00:16:35.701 --> 00:16:36.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, really?

00:16:36.994 --> 00:16:38.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:16:38.079 --> 00:16:41.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being raised in a Catholic family,

00:16:41.833 --> 00:16:46.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 13, I went to get training

00:16:46.796 --> 00:16:49.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by one of the Catholic religious orders.

00:16:49.841 --> 00:16:54.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But after just the one year of training,
I chose to leave.

00:16:56.681 --> 00:16:58.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although I left,

00:16:58.683 --> 00:17:01.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still had a love for the Bible.

00:17:01.769 --> 00:17:05.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, I went to one of my friends

00:17:05.732 --> 00:17:09.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see if he would like
to play soccer with me.

00:17:09.235 --> 00:17:11.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he was about to have a Bible study

00:17:11.655 --> 00:17:15.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with one of Jehovah’s Witnesses
who was a missionary.

00:17:15.575 --> 00:17:18.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I decided

00:17:18.078 --> 00:17:20.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to stay and listen.

00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:23.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over time, I came to really love

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:27.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what I was studying in the Bible.

00:17:27.504 --> 00:17:29.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And eventually

00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:34.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got baptized at the age of 17,
as shown here.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!

00:17:36.096 --> 00:17:37.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s quite interesting.

00:17:37.598 --> 00:17:39.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You had mentioned to me before

00:17:39.475 --> 00:17:42.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that your parents
are not Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:17:42.686 --> 00:17:47.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did they respond
to your becoming baptized as one?

00:17:48.525 --> 00:17:51.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it was not easy for them to accept.

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:54.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had an expectation of me

00:17:54.782 --> 00:17:58.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helping support the family financially.

00:17:58.536 --> 00:18:02.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the same time, I really wanted to pioneer.

00:18:02.873 --> 00:18:06.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it took several years and much struggling,

00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:11.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but eventually I was able
to enter into the pioneer service.

00:18:12.842 --> 00:18:16.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was there anyone in your life at that time

00:18:16.846 --> 00:18:19.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who helped you to stay spiritually focused

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you were trying to achieve
these spiritual goals?

00:18:22.644 --> 00:18:23.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, yes.

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:26.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Achaïe, while working

00:18:26.856 --> 00:18:29.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
toward entering into the pioneer service,

00:18:29.609 --> 00:18:33.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I too chose to associate

00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:37.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with spiritually strong ones
in the congregation.

00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:42.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Missionaries, like this couple,

00:18:42.289 --> 00:18:47.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped me to see the importance

00:18:47.294 --> 00:18:50.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of putting and keeping

00:18:50.213 --> 00:18:52.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spiritual things first in life.

00:18:52.257 --> 00:18:55.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this helped me to remain focused.

00:18:55.344 --> 00:18:59.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, I was able to serve
in unassigned territory.

00:18:59.139 --> 00:19:02.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Going throughout the territory
with my motorbike

00:19:02.351 --> 00:19:05.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a really good time

00:19:05.771 --> 00:19:07.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I enjoyed there.

00:19:07.898 --> 00:19:09.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, you know,
I’ve always wanted one of those.

00:19:09.525 --> 00:19:10.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:19:10.275 --> 00:19:15.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And later I was invited to attend
the School for Single Brothers.

00:19:15.239 --> 00:19:19.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after that,
I was trained in the circuit work.

00:19:20.286 --> 00:19:24.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this couple shown here
is the missionary couple

00:19:24.498 --> 00:19:28.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who first started my Bible study.

00:19:28.127 --> 00:19:32.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s the one who provided
the training for the circuit work.

00:19:33.132 --> 00:19:35.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, we can only imagine that they
must have been so proud of you,

00:19:35.968 --> 00:19:38.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see the spiritual progress
that you had made.

00:19:39.555 --> 00:19:44.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s fast forward
just a little bit in the story.

00:19:44.227 --> 00:19:47.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At this point, now,
you’re serving as a circuit overseer.

00:19:47.897 --> 00:19:52.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Achaïe is serving as a special pioneer
in Sikasso.

00:19:52.735 --> 00:19:57.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, Achaïe, you’ve been sitting there
so patiently waiting.

00:19:57.073 --> 00:19:58.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, by the way.

00:19:58.408 --> 00:19:59.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to continue the story?

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:01.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:04.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we got to know each other better,

00:20:04.831 --> 00:20:06.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we decided to get married.

00:20:06.833 --> 00:20:10.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, we were married
in Senegal on a Tuesday,

00:20:10.003 --> 00:20:14.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and later that same week, we had to be

00:20:14.049 --> 00:20:17.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Guinea-Bissau for the circuit assembly.

00:20:17.844 --> 00:20:20.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, if we could just pause
for just a moment here.

00:20:20.722 --> 00:20:23.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if we’re understanding this,

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:26.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Alain, please, please tell us

00:20:26.311 --> 00:20:30.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there were no circuit overseers
or substitute circuit overseers

00:20:30.649 --> 00:20:33.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
available in all of West Africa

00:20:33.151 --> 00:20:35.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who could cover
that circuit assembly for you.

00:20:35.821 --> 00:20:40.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were married four days and had to be
in another country for an assembly?

00:20:40.409 --> 00:20:42.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was no one 

00:20:42.286 --> 00:20:44.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who could take care
of that assembly for you?

00:20:44.788 --> 00:20:45.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really?

00:20:45.831 --> 00:20:48.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Chilton, that was fine.

00:20:48.042 --> 00:20:51.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you already know, the blessings of Jehovah

00:20:51.086 --> 00:20:54.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are far beyond any sacrifices
we can make in his service.

00:20:54.715 --> 00:20:57.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really loved that work.

00:20:57.635 --> 00:21:00.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We loved being with our brothers and sisters.

00:21:00.971 --> 00:21:04.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, yes, we really loved to preach with them.

00:21:04.308 --> 00:21:06.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can see in this picture—

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:09.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Preaching with them
—it’s really so special to us.

00:21:09.772 --> 00:21:13.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeing them in this picture
even brings very nice memories.

00:21:13.776 --> 00:21:14.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:21:14.777 --> 00:21:18.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We enjoyed also being with them
in their homes,

00:21:18.781 --> 00:21:22.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seeing their strong faith,
and seeing their love for Jehovah

00:21:22.785 --> 00:21:25.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite the challenges they were facing.

00:21:25.246 --> 00:21:28.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really came to love them very much.

00:21:28.833 --> 00:21:33.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, just taking a look at your happy smiles
in that picture there,

00:21:33.171 --> 00:21:36.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can see that you not only loved the work

00:21:36.841 --> 00:21:39.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that you loved the people
that you were serving.

00:21:40.845 --> 00:21:45.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as we know, changes come, don’t they?

00:21:45.225 --> 00:21:49.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you received the change of assignment
from the circuit work

00:21:49.521 --> 00:21:52.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into Bethel in Senegal.

00:21:52.149 --> 00:21:54.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, I understand this picture

00:21:54.401 --> 00:21:57.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was taken just two months
before you came to New York

00:21:57.613 --> 00:21:59.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to begin your Gilead training.

00:21:59.698 --> 00:22:04.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s with Brother Splane providing
a shepherding visit to your Bethel family

00:22:04.703 --> 00:22:07.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—beautiful family, by the way.

00:22:08.332 --> 00:22:12.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, from our previous discussions,
it became very clear to me

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:17.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how much you both love and appreciate
the young people

00:22:17.258 --> 00:22:19.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are in our organization.

00:22:19.969 --> 00:22:23.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From your personal observations,

00:22:23.931 --> 00:22:28.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what would you say were the things
that you saw as key elements

00:22:28.936 --> 00:22:31.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to their achieving spiritual success,

00:22:31.856 --> 00:22:34.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from your own observations?

00:22:34.942 --> 00:22:37.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What I have observed

00:22:37.194 --> 00:22:41.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that young ones
who make the truth their own

00:22:41.491 --> 00:22:43.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who keep their spiritual routines

00:22:43.993 --> 00:22:46.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to continue building

00:22:46.537 --> 00:22:50.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a spiritual, personal relationship
with Jehovah

00:22:50.333 --> 00:22:53.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who continue to associate

00:22:53.044 --> 00:22:55.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with spiritually mature brothers

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who can help them keep their focus

00:22:58.633 --> 00:23:01.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are those who are more successful

00:23:01.761 --> 00:23:04.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their Christian course of life.

00:23:04.806 --> 00:23:08.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really pray to Jehovah
that all our young ones

00:23:08.476 --> 00:23:11.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may have this same experience

00:23:11.855 --> 00:23:15.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that they may “taste and see
that Jehovah is good,”

00:23:15.567 --> 00:23:19.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as mentioned at Psalm 34:8.

00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:22.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they do, they can see that Jehovah is able

00:23:22.532 --> 00:23:27.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to open doors for them where they think
that there is no door to be opened.

00:23:27.287 --> 00:23:31.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that will lead them
to a long and satisfying life

00:23:31.291 --> 00:23:33.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without any regrets.

00:23:34.294 --> 00:23:36.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, those are some beautiful comments.

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:38.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much for that, Achaïe.

00:23:38.215 --> 00:23:39.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about you, Alain?

00:23:39.925 --> 00:23:41.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, looking back,

00:23:41.969 --> 00:23:46.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can see that Jehovah
has really been kind and good to us.

00:23:46.974 --> 00:23:51.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has provided brothers and sisters,
mature ones,

00:23:51.979 --> 00:23:55.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who helped us to have the courage

00:23:55.733 --> 00:23:58.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to put him first in our lives.

00:23:58.235 --> 00:24:01.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their choices encouraged us

00:24:01.781 --> 00:24:03.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make good choices.

00:24:03.824 --> 00:24:07.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah has blessed us in ways

00:24:07.078 --> 00:24:09.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could never foresee.

00:24:10.039 --> 00:24:12.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we are confident that he will do

00:24:12.542 --> 00:24:16.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the same with all our brothers and sisters,

00:24:16.254 --> 00:24:18.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including young ones

00:24:18.256 --> 00:24:23.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who courageously put Jehovah first
in their lives.

00:24:24.012 --> 00:24:27.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we thank you both so much

00:24:27.348 --> 00:24:29.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your encouraging comments.

00:24:29.851 --> 00:24:34.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our prayer will be that Jehovah
continues to bless you both

00:24:34.773 --> 00:24:38.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you both keep making
wise decisions in his service.

00:24:38.568 --> 00:24:40.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you so much for joining us today.

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:41.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:24:42.739 --> 00:24:46.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, last but certainly not least,

00:24:46.618 --> 00:24:50.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we go all the way to the country of Ukraine

00:24:50.038 --> 00:24:53.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to meet our next, final guest on our program.

00:24:53.792 --> 00:24:58.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s give our attention
as we meet Brother Anzhel Tkachuk.

00:25:05.721 --> 00:25:07.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome, Anzhel.

00:25:07.264 --> 00:25:07.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:25:07.931 --> 00:25:11.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a pleasure to have you with us
on <i>The Inside Story</i>  today.

00:25:12.186 --> 00:25:15.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Anzhel, it’s often been said

00:25:15.606 --> 00:25:18.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a person’s story

00:25:18.108 --> 00:25:21.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
takes us on a journey of a lifetime.

00:25:21.362 --> 00:25:23.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your story, however, my friend,

00:25:23.864 --> 00:25:27.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
takes us on a journey of several lifetimes.

00:25:27.159 --> 00:25:28.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that true?

00:25:28.494 --> 00:25:29.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:31.872 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You know, my great-great-grandfather

00:25:31.872 --> 00:25:32.581 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and great-great-grandmother

00:25:32.581 --> 00:25:34.125 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were the first Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:25:34.125 --> 00:25:35.418 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in my family.

00:25:35.418 --> 00:25:36.878 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And here you can see them

00:25:36.878 --> 00:25:39.088 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in the 1940’s in Ukraine.

00:25:39.881 --> 00:25:41.340 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, that is definitely

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:44.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a wonderful heritage to be a part of.

00:25:44.635 --> 00:25:47.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you say, Anzhel, that the choices

00:25:47.221 --> 00:25:50.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that members of your family made
over the years

00:25:50.266 --> 00:25:53.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had a direct bearing on your being here

00:25:53.102 --> 00:25:56.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
attending the 149th class of Gilead?

00:25:56.231 --> 00:25:57.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Definitely yes.

00:25:57.774 --> 00:26:01.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, they were serving Jehovah
for many, many years.

00:26:01.694 --> 00:26:04.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had a very hard but interesting life,

00:26:04.989 --> 00:26:07.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a life full of many different stories.

00:26:07.492 --> 00:26:12.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, when my great-grandfather
was exiled to Siberia

00:26:12.289 --> 00:26:14.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of being one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:26:14.457 --> 00:26:18.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my great-grandmother
would send him magazines

00:26:18.754 --> 00:26:21.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hidden in bottles of pork fat.

00:26:22.174 --> 00:26:24.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You said pork fat.

00:26:25.552 --> 00:26:27.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, now, that sounds pretty interesting.

00:26:27.554 --> 00:26:31.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you tell us more
about this “secret pork fat recipe”

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of your great-grandmother?

00:26:32.976 --> 00:26:36.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, so my mom took some photos

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:39.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sent them to me
to explain how it was done.

00:26:39.983 --> 00:26:44.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as you can see here,
first this fat was melted

00:26:44.613 --> 00:26:47.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that you could have liquid fat;

00:26:47.825 --> 00:26:52.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we needed to wait so that this fat
would become hard and thick.

00:26:52.663 --> 00:26:55.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then a magazine was wrapped in linen

00:26:55.499 --> 00:26:59.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a hole was made into the fat.

00:26:59.086 --> 00:27:02.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then this wrapped magazine
was put in the hole,

00:27:02.632 --> 00:27:05.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and more fat was put on top

00:27:05.426 --> 00:27:09.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to hide this magazine, and now it’s done.

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:13.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now you have both physical
and spiritual food in one bottle.

00:27:13.726 --> 00:27:18.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there it is, everything you need
to survive in Siberia, right?

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:22.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let me ask you,
did the guards in Siberia

00:27:22.694 --> 00:27:25.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ever find those magazines
hidden in pork fat?

00:27:25.446 --> 00:27:27.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, yes.

00:27:27.866 --> 00:27:32.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s why they added
an additional five and a half years

00:27:32.162 --> 00:27:35.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to my great-grandfather’s exile time
in Siberia.

00:27:35.498 --> 00:27:38.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But soon, his son, my grandfather

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was exiled to Siberia too.

00:27:41.213 --> 00:27:45.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here you can see
my great-grandfather on the left

00:27:45.592 --> 00:27:47.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my grandfather on the right.

00:27:47.761 --> 00:27:51.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now you shared with us
some details about your great-grandfather.

00:27:51.932 --> 00:27:55.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can you tell us about your grandfather,
depicted on the right?

00:27:55.936 --> 00:28:00.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, he was so zealous for Jehovah.

00:28:00.148 --> 00:28:03.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While in Siberia, he was helping
in supplying Bible literature

00:28:03.569 --> 00:28:06.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for local brothers and sisters

00:28:06.071 --> 00:28:09.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
though it was not always safe to do it.

00:28:09.324 --> 00:28:12.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, clearly they were both courageous men.

00:28:12.578 --> 00:28:16.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When were your family members
allowed to leave Siberia

00:28:16.707 --> 00:28:18.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and return to Ukraine?

00:28:18.542 --> 00:28:21.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was in 1967/1968.

00:28:21.837 --> 00:28:25.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was then when my grandfather started

00:28:25.466 --> 00:28:28.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reproduce Bible magazines and books,

00:28:28.928 --> 00:28:30.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the whole family helped.

00:28:30.972 --> 00:28:33.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s amazing!

00:28:33.015 --> 00:28:35.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were there any particular methods

00:28:35.893 --> 00:28:38.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they used to accomplish this?

00:28:38.354 --> 00:28:40.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They used several different methods.

00:28:40.606 --> 00:28:41.858 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
For example, they used

00:28:41.858 --> 00:28:44.944 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a special photo machine like you see here

00:28:44.944 --> 00:28:47.864 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to make photos of the magazines.

00:28:47.864 --> 00:28:50.783 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This and machines similar to these machines

00:28:50.783 --> 00:28:52.076 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were used to make,

00:28:52.076 --> 00:28:54.954 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so to say, “handmade” literature.

00:28:55.747 --> 00:28:57.749 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, just looking at those photos,

00:28:57.749 --> 00:28:59.125 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we could see

00:28:59.125 --> 00:29:03.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the men in your family
were both courageous and zealous.

00:29:04.589 --> 00:29:05.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they were.

00:29:05.548 --> 00:29:08.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But so were the women in our family.

00:29:08.009 --> 00:29:12.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here in this photo, you can see
my great-grandmother with her daughter,

00:29:12.973 --> 00:29:15.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was she who sent

00:29:15.267 --> 00:29:19.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these magazines hidden
in the bottles of pork fat.

00:29:19.396 --> 00:29:23.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here you can see
my grandmother on my mother’s side.

00:29:23.442 --> 00:29:25.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was a Witness too.

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:28.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here you can see her with her children.

00:29:28.447 --> 00:29:33.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this little girl with a guitar is my mom.

00:29:33.452 --> 00:29:35.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, you know, once the government

00:29:35.829 --> 00:29:38.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wanted to separate them.

00:29:38.248 --> 00:29:40.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They wanted to have a public hearing

00:29:40.292 --> 00:29:42.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take all her children away.

00:29:43.504 --> 00:29:48.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why they wanted to do it was
because it was when in the Soviet Union

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:53.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all children were forced to support
political ideas of the government.

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:57.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But my grandmother’s children
chose not to do it.

00:29:57.810 --> 00:29:59.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s interesting;

00:29:59.812 --> 00:30:02.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the children made this choice.

00:30:02.023 --> 00:30:05.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about your grandmother
when she was forced to make this choice

00:30:05.484 --> 00:30:09.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between what the Communist Party
was dictating

00:30:09.197 --> 00:30:12.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what Jehovah said, what did she do?

00:30:13.367 --> 00:30:17.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She wanted to prove and to show
that she was a good mother

00:30:17.538 --> 00:30:21.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that she was a good mother
because she was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:30:21.501 --> 00:30:24.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because she believed in God.

00:30:24.128 --> 00:30:26.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, you know, even during this hearing,

00:30:26.631 --> 00:30:29.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one woman stood up and screamed,

00:30:29.509 --> 00:30:33.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Don’t listen to her, as you will become
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses too!”

00:30:33.555 --> 00:30:37.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But people said, “No, we want to hear more.”

00:30:37.976 --> 00:30:39.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So she kept going.

00:30:39.311 --> 00:30:41.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when she finished,

00:30:41.396 --> 00:30:44.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the people voted in her favor

00:30:44.316 --> 00:30:47.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she could keep
all her children with her.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:51.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here you can see
my grandmother years later

00:30:51.865 --> 00:30:55.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with her family—children and grandchildren.

00:30:55.827 --> 00:31:00.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!
That is an absolutely incredible story!

00:31:00.165 --> 00:31:04.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, Jehovah blessed her
for her loyal efforts there.

00:31:04.711 --> 00:31:05.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, now, Anzhel,

00:31:05.754 --> 00:31:09.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you reflect upon the decisions

00:31:09.299 --> 00:31:12.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that members of your family have made,

00:31:12.052 --> 00:31:14.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how have their decisions affected you?

00:31:15.472 --> 00:31:20.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, they helped me
to love Jehovah with all my heart

00:31:20.186 --> 00:31:24.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to put him always first in my life.

00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:28.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you provide us an example of that?

00:31:28.361 --> 00:31:31.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, for example, in Ukraine

00:31:31.155 --> 00:31:35.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all young men are required
to do military service.

00:31:35.243 --> 00:31:38.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I, like many other brothers,
chose not to do it.

00:31:38.746 --> 00:31:42.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I chose civilian,
or alternative, service instead.

00:31:42.709 --> 00:31:44.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I was still living at home.

00:31:44.752 --> 00:31:49.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the government gives you
any work that they want,

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:51.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you need to do it for two years.

00:31:52.844 --> 00:31:56.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you don’t mind my asking,
what job did they give you?

00:31:57.307 --> 00:32:00.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, OK, they sent me to clean sewers

00:32:00.435 --> 00:32:02.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and water systems.

00:32:02.687 --> 00:32:07.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I needed to go inside these tanks,
which were so filthy,

00:32:07.609 --> 00:32:09.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I needed to clean them out.

00:32:09.736 --> 00:32:13.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for me, it was really very hard work.

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:17.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And sometimes I felt very sad
about my situation.

00:32:17.953 --> 00:32:19.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:32:19.413 --> 00:32:22.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re so sorry, Anzhel,
that you had to go through that.

00:32:22.666 --> 00:32:27.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we certainly appreciate your loyalty
to Jehovah at the same time.

00:32:27.629 --> 00:32:30.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped you to get through

00:32:30.424 --> 00:32:32.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that difficult period in your life?

00:32:32.885 --> 00:32:35.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For me, it was my family.

00:32:35.804 --> 00:32:39.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would think about my grandfather,
grandmother,

00:32:39.808 --> 00:32:41.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
great-grandfather and great-grandmother.

00:32:41.852 --> 00:32:45.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I thought: ‘They showed me how to do it.

00:32:45.981 --> 00:32:48.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘They showed me how to go through it.

00:32:48.859 --> 00:32:53.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They showed me that with Jehovah’s help,
I can do it.’

00:32:54.115 --> 00:32:59.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you have learned
some very powerful lessons from your family.

00:32:59.704 --> 00:33:03.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now here you are at Gilead.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve completed your Gilead training.

00:33:05.293 --> 00:33:10.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can only imagine how proud
and happy your family must be for you.

00:33:10.298 --> 00:33:14.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you tell us, though, what has been
the highlight for you

00:33:14.927 --> 00:33:16.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from your Gilead training?

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:22.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Gilead has helped me to see more,

00:33:22.268 --> 00:33:26.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to understand more, and to feel more

00:33:26.314 --> 00:33:30.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to see more this wonderful history
of Jehovah’s people

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:34.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(this wonderful heritage that we all have),

00:33:34.572 --> 00:33:39.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to understand more
these wonderful, deep Bible gems

00:33:39.578 --> 00:33:42.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(Bible lessons for my life),

00:33:42.122 --> 00:33:45.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to feel more of Jehovah’s love

00:33:45.167 --> 00:33:49.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the love of the brothers and sisters,
especially here.

00:33:49.212 --> 00:33:53.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, my family, they had
just a few magazines,

00:33:53.592 --> 00:33:56.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a few books, and a songbook,

00:33:56.678 --> 00:33:59.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it was enough for them

00:33:59.097 --> 00:34:02.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build strong faith in Jehovah.

00:34:02.059 --> 00:34:04.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in the new world,

00:34:04.061 --> 00:34:07.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to see all of my big, big family.

00:34:07.356 --> 00:34:10.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I want to share with them
these wonderful gems

00:34:10.526 --> 00:34:14.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned here in Gilead
while they were sleeping.

00:34:14.655 --> 00:34:17.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I want to say to them, “Thank you

00:34:17.116 --> 00:34:20.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for setting such a good example
of faith for me.”

00:34:21.454 --> 00:34:25.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anzhel, you have certainly touched our hearts

00:34:25.541 --> 00:34:28.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of that beautiful story.

00:34:28.586 --> 00:34:33.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for sharing
your family legacy with all of us.

00:34:33.466 --> 00:34:35.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really appreciated that.

00:34:35.468 --> 00:34:36.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:34:37.553 --> 00:34:41.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as we mentioned
in our opening comments,

00:34:41.474 --> 00:34:44.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the tribes of Israel were instructed

00:34:44.394 --> 00:34:48.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to choose for themselves
whom they would serve,

00:34:48.106 --> 00:34:53.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their response is recorded at Joshua 24:18,

00:34:53.111 --> 00:34:58.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where they said:
“We too will serve Jehovah,

00:34:58.116 --> 00:35:01.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he is our God”

00:35:01.077 --> 00:35:03.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a wise choice, indeed!

00:35:04.289 --> 00:35:06.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we’ve learned from the experiences

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:09.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shared by our four guests today,

00:35:09.669 --> 00:35:13.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the choices that we make do matter.

00:35:13.924 --> 00:35:16.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They matter to us,

00:35:16.343 --> 00:35:18.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our family members,

00:35:18.345 --> 00:35:21.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our worldwide brotherhood,

00:35:21.181 --> 00:35:24.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and especially to our loving God, Jehovah.

00:35:24.685 --> 00:35:28.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hope that you have been
both encouraged and motivated

00:35:28.772 --> 00:35:31.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the experiences you’ve heard today.

00:35:31.608 --> 00:35:36.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Until we meet again on our future edition
of <i>The Inside Story,</i>

00:35:36.613 --> 00:35:40.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please enjoy this brief, little snapshot

00:35:40.117 --> 00:35:42.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Class 149.

00:36:06.519 --> 00:36:08.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were not disappointed.

00:36:08.229 --> 00:36:12.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Chilton,
along with the students who assisted you.

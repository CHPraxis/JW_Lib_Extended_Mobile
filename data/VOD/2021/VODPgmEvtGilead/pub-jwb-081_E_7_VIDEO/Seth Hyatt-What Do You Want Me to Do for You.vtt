00:00:01.551 --> 00:00:03.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know you agree.

00:00:03.687 --> 00:00:07.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your Gilead training has been a gift

00:00:07.724 --> 00:00:11.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a gift from Jehovah, Jesus Christ,

00:00:11.594 --> 00:00:15.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “the faithful and discreet slave.”

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:20.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you thought about how
you’re going to share your gift

00:00:20.036 --> 00:00:24.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and allow others
to benefit from your training

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:26.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you return to your assignment?

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a good question.

00:00:29.312 --> 00:00:32.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we get back
to the busyness of a routine,

00:00:32.682 --> 00:00:35.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps the stress and anxieties

00:00:35.485 --> 00:00:37.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of increased responsibility,

00:00:37.854 --> 00:00:42.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sharing a gift may be
the last thing on your mind.

00:00:42.492 --> 00:00:45.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s good to think about it now.

00:00:45.562 --> 00:00:49.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will help you to strengthen,

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
encourage, motivate,

00:00:53.169 --> 00:00:57.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and instruct those who you oversee

00:00:57.507 --> 00:01:02.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—your workmates, your brothers
and sisters in the congregation?

00:01:02.412 --> 00:01:07.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can learn much from the way
Jesus dealt with people.

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:10.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like you, Jesus was entrusted

00:01:10.353 --> 00:01:12.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a beautiful gift.

00:01:12.422 --> 00:01:15.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unlike you and me,

00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:19.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus had some amazing abilities.

00:01:19.095 --> 00:01:22.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, he could read hearts.

00:01:22.732 --> 00:01:25.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Scriptures describe an occasion

00:01:25.668 --> 00:01:29.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jesus responded to a man’s thoughts,

00:01:29.272 --> 00:01:31.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than to his words.

00:01:31.775 --> 00:01:34.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think Jesus’ ability

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to know what his audience was thinking

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:40.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and feeling enhanced his effectiveness

00:01:40.717 --> 00:01:43.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he shared his gift?

00:01:43.486 --> 00:01:45.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course.

00:01:45.855 --> 00:01:49.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But interestingly, the Scriptures reveal

00:01:49.058 --> 00:01:51.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus dignified people

00:01:51.461 --> 00:01:54.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the way he communicated with them.

00:01:54.063 --> 00:01:57.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He often asked meaningful questions

00:01:57.934 --> 00:02:02.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and listened attentively to the answers

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:06.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before he shared his gift.

00:02:06.743 --> 00:02:09.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a few minutes this morning,

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s consider two occasions
when Jesus did just that.

00:02:14.083 --> 00:02:18.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In doing so, we’ll get some pointers

00:02:18.621 --> 00:02:20.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will assist you

00:02:20.957 --> 00:02:25.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be effective in sharing
your gift of Gilead training.

00:02:25.528 --> 00:02:30.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first account is found
in the Bible book of Mark chapter 10.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn there together.

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:36.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mark chapter 10, beginning in verse 35:

00:02:38.975 --> 00:02:42.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“James and John, the sons of Zebedee,

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:44.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“approached him and said to him:

00:02:44.647 --> 00:02:48.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Teacher, we want you to do for us

00:02:48.351 --> 00:02:51.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever we ask of you.’

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He said to them:

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘What do you want me to do for you?’

00:02:57.927 --> 00:03:01.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They replied: ‘Grant us to sit down,

00:03:01.764 --> 00:03:06.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one at your right hand
and one at your left, in your glory.’”

00:03:08.137 --> 00:03:10.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The parallel account in Matthew

00:03:10.807 --> 00:03:13.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reveals that James and John

00:03:13.476 --> 00:03:17.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did not approach Jesus on their own.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had their mother do it for them.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think,

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as this woman approached Jesus,

00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:28.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he knew what she wanted?

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:32.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Probably.

00:03:32.328 --> 00:03:34.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did he deal with her?

00:03:34.864 --> 00:03:38.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he interrupt her? reprimand her?

00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:40.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:03:40.503 --> 00:03:43.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, he asked a question:

00:03:43.873 --> 00:03:47.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What do you want me to do for you?”

00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:52.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second account is just a few verses down

00:03:52.882 --> 00:03:57.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Mark chapter 10, beginning in verse 46.

00:03:57.453 --> 00:04:00.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here we learn about a blind beggar

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
named Bartimaeus.

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:07.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He sat by the road, and when he heard
that Jesus was passing by,

00:04:07.363 --> 00:04:11.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he called out: “Son of David, Jesus,

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have mercy on me!”

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The crowd tried to quiet him,

00:04:16.272 --> 00:04:20.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Bartimaeus called out even more loudly.

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jesus stopped

00:04:22.812 --> 00:04:25.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and said: ‘[Bring] him to me.’”

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now Bartimaeus had an audience

00:04:30.653 --> 00:04:32.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Son of God.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did Jesus address Bartimaeus?

00:04:38.161 --> 00:04:42.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 51: “Jesus said to him:

00:04:42.231 --> 00:04:46.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘What do you want me to do for you?’

00:04:46.436 --> 00:04:50.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The blind man said to him: <i>‘Rabboni,</i>

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“let me recover my sight.’

00:04:53.343 --> 00:04:56.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And Jesus said to him: ‘Go.

00:04:56.813 --> 00:04:59.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Your faith has made you well.’

00:04:59.415 --> 00:05:02.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And immediately he recovered his sight,

00:05:02.785 --> 00:05:06.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he began to follow Jesus on the road.”

00:05:08.257 --> 00:05:11.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What do you want me to do for you?”

00:05:11.894 --> 00:05:14.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same question is in both accounts

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:17.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but very different situations.

00:05:19.002 --> 00:05:22.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do you think Jesus asked this question?

00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:25.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he accomplished

00:05:25.775 --> 00:05:28.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at least four things.

00:05:28.111 --> 00:05:30.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What were they?

00:05:30.146 --> 00:05:32.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, first of all,

00:05:32.548 --> 00:05:35.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he dignified his audience

00:05:35.051 --> 00:05:38.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by encouraging communication.

00:05:40.223 --> 00:05:42.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number two,

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:45.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he allowed his audience to reveal

00:05:45.294 --> 00:05:49.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what was in his or her heart

00:05:49.198 --> 00:05:52.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to put it on the table, as it were.

00:05:55.538 --> 00:05:57.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In his dealings with James and John,

00:05:57.974 --> 00:06:02.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the question actually protected Jesus

00:06:02.111 --> 00:06:05.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gave him an opportunity

00:06:05.114 --> 00:06:07.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give those two apostles

00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:11.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a valuable lesson in modesty:

00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:14.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘This matter of giving
the right and left places

00:06:14.424 --> 00:06:17.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Kingdom is not mine to give.’

00:06:18.895 --> 00:06:22.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, in the case of Bartimaeus,

00:06:22.765 --> 00:06:25.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would you agree that the question

00:06:25.268 --> 00:06:29.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provided an opportunity
to strengthen Bartimaeus’ faith

00:06:29.138 --> 00:06:33.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to give him effective assistance,

00:06:33.276 --> 00:06:38.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allowing Bartimaeus to articulate his desire?

00:06:38.047 --> 00:06:40.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What do you want?”

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:44.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then to experience
the immediate realization

00:06:44.787 --> 00:06:47.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would have left no doubt in Bartimaeus’ mind

00:06:47.557 --> 00:06:49.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he had been considered.

00:06:49.692 --> 00:06:51.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how did it affect him?

00:06:51.928 --> 00:06:56.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the account says:
“He began to follow [Jesus]

00:06:56.265 --> 00:06:58.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the road.”

00:06:58.734 --> 00:07:01.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a beautiful example

00:07:01.304 --> 00:07:03.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of asking a question

00:07:03.873 --> 00:07:08.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that helps you to share your gift.

00:07:10.546 --> 00:07:13.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was
a newly appointed circuit overseer,

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:16.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the elders in a congregation
that I was serving

00:07:16.385 --> 00:07:18.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
expressed concern about a sister

00:07:18.955 --> 00:07:21.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was missing meetings.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They asked me if I would be willing
to make a shepherding visit.

00:07:24.727 --> 00:07:27.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, I was happy to do that.

00:07:27.396 --> 00:07:29.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The arrangements were made.

00:07:29.432 --> 00:07:32.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another elder accompanied me,

00:07:32.335 --> 00:07:36.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I shared all of the appropriate verses

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:38.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about meeting attendance.

00:07:38.641 --> 00:07:41.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The sister listened,

00:07:41.077 --> 00:07:44.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as we were leaving,
she looked me in the eye,

00:07:44.747 --> 00:07:48.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she said, “You don’t have a clue.”

00:07:50.486 --> 00:07:54.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the time,
I thought she was being disrespectful.

00:07:54.423 --> 00:07:57.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as I thought about it,

00:07:57.193 --> 00:08:00.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I came to wish
that instead of showing up

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all the appropriate verses,

00:08:03.432 --> 00:08:08.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had showed up
with all of the appropriate questions.

00:08:08.171 --> 00:08:12.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What do you want me to do for you?”

00:08:12.108 --> 00:08:14.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How may I help?”

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:17.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What’s been happening in your life?”

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:21.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those kinds of questions

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:25.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allow you to render meaningful assistance.

00:08:25.788 --> 00:08:28.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned from that experience.

00:08:28.824 --> 00:08:32.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hope you can learn from my mistake.

00:08:32.028 --> 00:08:34.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t make the mistake of thinking

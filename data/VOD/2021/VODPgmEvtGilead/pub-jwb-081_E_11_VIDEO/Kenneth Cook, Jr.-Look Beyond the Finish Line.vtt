You have completed your Gilead schooling.

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:08.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve done well,
and we warmly commend you.

00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:11.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve reached
the finish line for this school.

00:00:11.407 --> 00:00:14.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the program concludes,
you will be a graduate.

00:00:14.952 --> 00:00:17.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve run this course, so to speak,

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with that goal in mind, haven’t you?

00:00:19.582 --> 00:00:22.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, through it all,
you’ve also kept in mind that,

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:26.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you, this experience
is a part of a bigger race

00:00:26.756 --> 00:00:28.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the race for life.

00:00:28.758 --> 00:00:30.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like determined runners,

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:33.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
loyal servants of God keep moving forward

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:36.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after each goal in their service to him.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such goals are like stages in a race.

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:43.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of our goals and our pace may vary

00:00:43.983 --> 00:00:47.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from person to person based on circumstances.

00:00:47.153 --> 00:00:49.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For you, Gilead School

00:00:49.905 --> 00:00:53.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a goal, or stage,
that you have now completed.

00:00:53.284 --> 00:00:55.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But keep running!

00:00:55.703 --> 00:00:59.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, we run until we reach
what our faith shows us,

00:00:59.374 --> 00:01:03.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the prize waiting
beyond the ultimate finish line

00:01:03.294 --> 00:01:07.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—everlasting life in the service of Jehovah.

00:01:07.507 --> 00:01:10.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The promises found in God’s Word

00:01:10.427 --> 00:01:14.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
move us to keep reaching out for that prize.

00:01:14.014 --> 00:01:18.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider the apostle Paul,
who was reaching out for the heavenly hope.

00:01:18.477 --> 00:01:21.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 2 Timothy 4:7, 8,

00:01:21.021 --> 00:01:23.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he indicated
that he had reached the finish line.

00:01:23.732 --> 00:01:27.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His prize was in sight,
and it was reserved for him.

00:01:27.528 --> 00:01:30.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “I have fought the fine fight,

00:01:30.364 --> 00:01:35.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have run the race to the finish,
I have observed the faith.

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:38.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“From this time on, there is reserved for me

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the crown of righteousness.”

00:01:40.875 --> 00:01:45.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With strong faith,
Paul could see beyond the finish line

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he yearned for the reward
that he would receive.

00:01:50.134 --> 00:01:53.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then there is Jesus’ example.

00:01:53.221 --> 00:01:55.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just before breathing his last,

00:01:55.807 --> 00:01:59.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he cried out: “It has been accomplished!”

00:01:59.644 --> 00:02:01.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout his earthly ministry,

00:02:01.897 --> 00:02:05.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that goal to accomplish
Jehovah’s will for him

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
never left his sight.

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter how painful
his life course proved to be,

00:02:11.323 --> 00:02:15.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus kept his integrity
and finished that course,

00:02:15.744 --> 00:02:18.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like the true Son of God that he is.

00:02:18.622 --> 00:02:23.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In all of this, Jesus saw
more than just the finish line.

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:27.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He saw the endless joy
that was waiting for him.

00:02:27.465 --> 00:02:30.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So powerful is Jesus’ example

00:02:30.218 --> 00:02:33.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Hebrews 12:2 urges us

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:36.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep it centered in our sight.

00:02:36.558 --> 00:02:41.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We invite you to follow along there
with Hebrews 12:2.

00:02:41.396 --> 00:02:45.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “. . . as we look intently

00:02:45.317 --> 00:02:49.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“at the Chief Agent
and Perfecter of our faith, Jesus.

00:02:49.905 --> 00:02:54.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the joy that was set before him
he endured a torture stake,

00:02:54.284 --> 00:02:57.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“despising shame, and has sat down

00:02:57.246 --> 00:03:00.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the right hand of the throne of God.”

00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who are we urged to look at intently?

00:03:03.961 --> 00:03:07.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The “Perfecter of our faith, Jesus.”

00:03:07.048 --> 00:03:08.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what did Jesus look at?

00:03:08.758 --> 00:03:10.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did he see?

00:03:10.551 --> 00:03:15.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He saw the joy that his faith
placed directly in front of him.

00:03:15.556 --> 00:03:19.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus focused on the joy that would result

00:03:19.143 --> 00:03:22.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from his life course of perfect integrity,

00:03:22.522 --> 00:03:25.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from providing the ransom for us,

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and from being back alongside
his heavenly Father.

00:03:29.863 --> 00:03:34.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus never took his eyes off the prize
waiting beyond the finish line,

00:03:34.618 --> 00:03:36.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and neither should we.

00:03:36.995 --> 00:03:39.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at some important lessons

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:42.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will help all of us
to complete the race for life.

00:03:42.501 --> 00:03:45.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will consider two main points:

00:03:45.045 --> 00:03:49.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
first, how should you run
each stage of the race?

00:03:49.425 --> 00:03:52.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, second, qualities that will help you

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to run like a true Christian and win.

00:03:56.974 --> 00:04:01.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, for the first point:
How should you run each stage of the race?

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The race for life is a race of endurance,

00:04:03.773 --> 00:04:07.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as mentioned, it includes stages,
or successive goals.

00:04:07.861 --> 00:04:11.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We strive for each goal
at our individual best pace

00:04:11.865 --> 00:04:16.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with a clear focus
on the ultimate goal, or prize.

00:04:16.411 --> 00:04:18.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Timothy 6:19

00:04:18.997 --> 00:04:22.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
calls that prize “the real life”

00:04:22.167 --> 00:04:25.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is, everlasting life in perfection,

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
either in heaven or on earth.

00:04:28.132 --> 00:04:30.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As mentioned, your Gilead training

00:04:30.467 --> 00:04:33.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is now a completed stage of the race for you.

00:04:33.387 --> 00:04:37.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With humility, apply all
that you have learned

00:04:37.058 --> 00:04:41.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and remain focused
on the endless joy ahead of you.

00:04:41.354 --> 00:04:44.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When hardships and difficulties come

00:04:44.106 --> 00:04:47.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and they will—
keep moving forward.

00:04:47.652 --> 00:04:50.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you are knocked down by anything,

00:04:50.071 --> 00:04:53.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
get back up and run with determination,

00:04:53.283 --> 00:04:56.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with everything that you’ve got.

00:04:56.119 --> 00:05:00.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be like the marathon runner
from the country of Tanzania

00:05:00.415 --> 00:05:05.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who ran in the 1968 Olympics
held in Mexico City.

00:05:05.003 --> 00:05:09.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At one point during that race,
he was bumped by other runners,

00:05:09.466 --> 00:05:11.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he fell to the ground so hard

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he gashed his knee and dislocated it.

00:05:14.513 --> 00:05:18.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also smashed his shoulder
against the pavement.

00:05:18.392 --> 00:05:21.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, after receiving some medical attention,

00:05:21.187 --> 00:05:23.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he refused to stop running.

00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:26.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He continued in the race.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His pace was slower,
but he moved forward toward his goal.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was no longer running
for a mere material prize.

00:05:34.075 --> 00:05:36.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was running to complete the race

00:05:36.077 --> 00:05:39.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with his honor intact
and that of the land he represented.

00:05:39.873 --> 00:05:42.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He finished the race.

00:05:42.333 --> 00:05:44.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the race for life,

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you may experience times
when you feel as if someone or something

00:05:48.006 --> 00:05:50.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is trying to knock you down.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will you do?

00:05:52.135 --> 00:05:55.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Learn from what happened to the Galatians.

00:05:55.973 --> 00:06:00.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When some in the first century
allowed the speech and actions of others

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to knock them out of the race,
notice what Paul said to them

00:06:03.731 --> 00:06:08.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Galatians 5:7, 8.

00:06:08.527 --> 00:06:11.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine that he has an incredulous tone

00:06:11.697 --> 00:06:16.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he speaks to them and states in verse 7:

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:18.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You were running well.

00:06:18.371 --> 00:06:22.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who hindered you
from continuing to obey the truth?

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This sort of persuasion
does not come from the One calling you.”

00:06:27.505 --> 00:06:29.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was the problem?

00:06:29.591 --> 00:06:32.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some in Galatia had allowed themselves

00:06:32.385 --> 00:06:34.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be persuaded by false teachings,

00:06:34.971 --> 00:06:38.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were no longer obeying the truth.

00:06:38.016 --> 00:06:40.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They gave in to pressure.

00:06:40.435 --> 00:06:42.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, in verse 13,

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul refers to the danger
of “fleshly desires.”

00:06:47.067 --> 00:06:49.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever happened to them,

00:06:49.028 --> 00:06:51.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those Christian runners were “hindered,”

00:06:51.697 --> 00:06:55.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he said, because they
took their eyes off of the prize.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of us must keep
that lesson in front of us.

00:06:59.247 --> 00:07:03.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we do, we will never be hindered
or thrown off course

00:07:03.584 --> 00:07:06.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our pursuit of the real life.

00:07:06.587 --> 00:07:10.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will be rock solid in our focus.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When others see that you are looking
straight ahead toward the prize,

00:07:14.846 --> 00:07:18.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re helped to look in the same direction.

00:07:18.058 --> 00:07:21.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Continue to be a real stabilizing influence

00:07:21.645 --> 00:07:24.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the branches where you will serve.

00:07:24.398 --> 00:07:29.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for our first point,
how should you run each stage of the race?

00:07:29.027 --> 00:07:31.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Run at your very best pace

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with a clear focus on your ultimate goal

00:07:34.533 --> 00:07:36.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the real life.

00:07:36.577 --> 00:07:39.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, for our second main point:

00:07:39.038 --> 00:07:41.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
qualities that will help you

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:45.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to run like a true Christian and win.

00:07:45.211 --> 00:07:47.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We run as true Christians

00:07:47.755 --> 00:07:50.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we follow the example of Christ.

00:07:50.883 --> 00:07:54.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus’ example
of doing all things for Jehovah’s glory,

00:07:54.596 --> 00:07:57.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite the suffering that he endured,

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:59.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is one that we must follow.

00:07:59.851 --> 00:08:02.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 2:21 reminds us

00:08:02.604 --> 00:08:04.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “Christ suffered for you,

00:08:04.815 --> 00:08:09.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
leaving a model for you
to follow his steps closely.”

00:08:09.653 --> 00:08:11.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider two qualities

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:16.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus had in abundance
and that we must imitate closely

00:08:16.618 --> 00:08:19.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—faith and courage.

00:08:19.622 --> 00:08:24.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For each quality,
we will look at why we need it to win.

00:08:24.293 --> 00:08:26.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we begin with faith.

00:08:26.587 --> 00:08:29.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you do not need
to be told what faith is.

00:08:29.924 --> 00:08:34.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have it, and you’ve learned much
about examples of faith in your studies.

00:08:34.637 --> 00:08:38.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need faith
because faith helps us to endure,

00:08:38.099 --> 00:08:40.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and faith helps us to remember

00:08:40.101 --> 00:08:43.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our trials in life are temporary.

00:08:43.605 --> 00:08:45.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We look ahead with confidence,

00:08:45.607 --> 00:08:48.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see beyond the troubles of today,

00:08:48.568 --> 00:08:52.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we trust Jehovah every step of the way.

00:08:52.114 --> 00:08:56.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You needed to have faith
after you arrived for this school

00:08:56.326 --> 00:09:00.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then had to wait patiently
for some months for your classes to begin.

00:09:00.956 --> 00:09:02.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True?

00:09:02.291 --> 00:09:05.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You no doubt wondered:
‘When will the classes start?

00:09:05.377 --> 00:09:08.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How will they be carried out in a pandemic?’

00:09:08.339 --> 00:09:12.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You waited, and in due time
your faith was rewarded.

00:09:12.593 --> 00:09:15.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah saw to it
that things worked out, didn’t he?

00:09:15.471 --> 00:09:19.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your instructors
and so many others working with them

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ensured that the school moved forward safely

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:26.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that you received
the full benefit from the classes.

00:09:26.774 --> 00:09:29.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That experience highlights the kind of faith

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:32.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that all of us will need in the days ahead

00:09:32.614 --> 00:09:35.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whenever new challenges arise.

00:09:35.408 --> 00:09:38.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could say
that 20/20 vision will be necessary

00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:41.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for each of us to keep running successfully.

00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:44.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I don’t mean the year 2020.

00:09:44.084 --> 00:09:47.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True Christians look far ahead
with clear,

00:09:47.129 --> 00:09:49.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spiritual vision
—that’s the point—

00:09:49.923 --> 00:09:54.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and remain focused
on the prize beyond the finish line.

00:09:54.178 --> 00:09:57.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those without faith cannot see it.

00:09:57.181 --> 00:10:00.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They cannot focus on things unseen.

00:10:00.309 --> 00:10:03.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But those with faith can see it.

00:10:03.646 --> 00:10:06.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is why they
—why you—

00:10:06.023 --> 00:10:09.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remain focused on Jehovah’s promises.

00:10:09.944 --> 00:10:13.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Scriptures urge us to keep looking ahead.

00:10:13.198 --> 00:10:15.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An example of this is found

00:10:15.241 --> 00:10:20.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 2 Corinthians 4:17, 18

00:10:21.456 --> 00:10:24.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—2 Corinthians 4:17, 18.

00:10:24.251 --> 00:10:26.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when writing these inspired words,

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul was encouraging the brothers

00:10:28.672 --> 00:10:32.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to allow problems,
difficulties, and persecutions

00:10:32.885 --> 00:10:35.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to cloud or block their view

00:10:35.387 --> 00:10:38.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the glorious reward
that was set before them.

00:10:38.182 --> 00:10:42.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please look at what is said
starting in verse 17:

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:46.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For though the tribulation
is momentary and light,

00:10:46.607 --> 00:10:48.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it works out for us a glory

00:10:48.734 --> 00:10:53.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that is of more and more
surpassing greatness and is everlasting;

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“while we keep our eyes,

00:10:55.992 --> 00:11:00.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not on the things seen,
but on the things unseen.

00:11:00.038 --> 00:11:02.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the things seen are temporary,

00:11:02.749 --> 00:11:07.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the things unseen are everlasting.”

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, these inspired words

00:11:10.549 --> 00:11:14.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should move us
to look beyond the trials we face

00:11:14.136 --> 00:11:17.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to remain focused on what is ahead of us.

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:21.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul was speaking
to those with the heavenly hope.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:25.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the encouragement
and meaning behind these words

00:11:25.022 --> 00:11:29.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
apply to all
who are running for the real life,

00:11:29.151 --> 00:11:32.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is, for the things “everlasting,”

00:11:32.029 --> 00:11:34.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it says here.

00:11:34.198 --> 00:11:36.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we are determined and focused,

00:11:36.743 --> 00:11:39.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are helped to press on each day.

00:11:39.996 --> 00:11:43.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 4:25 tells us
to “look straight ahead . . . ,

00:11:43.875 --> 00:11:47.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fix [your eyes or] your gaze
straight ahead of you.”

00:11:47.962 --> 00:11:51.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To keep doing that, we need faith.

00:11:51.716 --> 00:11:54.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need good spiritual eyesight to see

00:11:54.136 --> 00:11:57.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what is otherwise “unseen,” as Paul said.

00:11:57.597 --> 00:12:00.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep in mind
that the objective of your Gilead training

00:12:00.893 --> 00:12:05.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to strengthen and stabilize
the field and branch organization.

00:12:05.522 --> 00:12:07.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether a brother or sister,

00:12:07.691 --> 00:12:11.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your example of faith
goes a long way in doing that.

00:12:11.779 --> 00:12:16.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others will imitate the faith
and example of a determined runner.

00:12:16.784 --> 00:12:19.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you are settled in your assignments,

00:12:19.745 --> 00:12:24.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keep your eyes of faith
set on doing God’s will.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Danger can come when you start to feel

00:12:27.086 --> 00:12:30.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’ve achieved
most or even all of your goals.

00:12:30.465 --> 00:12:32.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What could be the result?

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:36.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we lose sight
of the race and of its prize,

00:12:36.429 --> 00:12:39.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our interests will focus
on other things,

00:12:39.724 --> 00:12:41.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps material things.

00:12:41.852 --> 00:12:44.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t let this happen to you.

00:12:44.021 --> 00:12:48.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never allow distractions
to pull you off of the Christian course,

00:12:48.567 --> 00:12:51.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and avoid ever becoming self-satisfied

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of privileges
that you may come to enjoy.

00:12:54.657 --> 00:12:59.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Focus on the real life, and remain humble.

00:12:59.662 --> 00:13:03.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Appreciate your privileges
in Jehovah’s service,

00:13:03.291 --> 00:13:06.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but remain focused on what you desire most

00:13:06.711 --> 00:13:10.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—pleasing Jehovah and doing his will forever.

00:13:10.548 --> 00:13:13.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we read earlier in Hebrews chapter 12,

00:13:13.801 --> 00:13:17.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jesus suffered unjustly
to the point of death,

00:13:17.514 --> 00:13:21.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he endured “for the joy
that was set before him.”

00:13:21.768 --> 00:13:24.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He always looked at what was ahead of him.

00:13:24.396 --> 00:13:28.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The reward that he longed for
was clear to him.

00:13:28.316 --> 00:13:30.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was that real to him.

00:13:30.652 --> 00:13:35.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must always remember Jesus’ example
as we keep looking ahead.

00:13:35.616 --> 00:13:39.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maintain your strong faith
by reading God’s Word every day

00:13:39.828 --> 00:13:43.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and applying its counsel
in everything that you do.

00:13:43.457 --> 00:13:45.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We endure in the race with courage

00:13:45.543 --> 00:13:48.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when our faith is strong.

00:13:48.879 --> 00:13:52.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is the second quality
we will now look at

00:13:52.508 --> 00:13:56.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—courage, why we need courage to win.

00:13:56.429 --> 00:14:00.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True Christians have courage
that stems from their faith.

00:14:00.767 --> 00:14:03.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We live with hope, with expectation

00:14:03.478 --> 00:14:05.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and not just any expectation

00:14:05.897 --> 00:14:09.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but “assured expectation,”
as the Scriptures call it.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:14.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When your rescue is assured,
it gives you courage, doesn’t it?

00:14:14.114 --> 00:14:17.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine how Jeremiah felt when Ebed-melech

00:14:17.409 --> 00:14:21.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 30 other men arrived
to pull him up out of a deep cistern.

00:14:21.872 --> 00:14:26.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What could have seemed hopeless
was now a moment filled with hope,

00:14:26.919 --> 00:14:30.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he continued on with courage.

00:14:30.339 --> 00:14:33.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Courage moves us
to look beyond any obstacles

00:14:33.551 --> 00:14:37.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that may stand
between us and the finish line.

00:14:37.054 --> 00:14:42.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact is that nothing promised
in God’s Word will fail to come true.

00:14:42.018 --> 00:14:43.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So take courage.

00:14:43.686 --> 00:14:46.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep in mind
that your determination to do God’s will

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:50.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means that for you the prize will be waiting.

00:14:50.402 --> 00:14:52.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah cannot lie.

00:14:52.737 --> 00:14:55.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, as you go to your assignments,

00:14:55.115 --> 00:14:59.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remain calm and assured of Jehovah’s help.

00:14:59.119 --> 00:15:02.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True, great changes
have taken place in the world

00:15:02.414 --> 00:15:05.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since you arrived for Gilead School.

00:15:05.125 --> 00:15:07.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But though the world is changing around us

00:15:07.461 --> 00:15:09.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and certainly not for the better),

00:15:09.797 --> 00:15:12.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember Jehovah’s promises.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we see happening is temporary.

00:15:15.261 --> 00:15:17.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A pandemic—nothing new!

00:15:17.805 --> 00:15:20.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus foretold it
—didn’t he?—

00:15:20.099 --> 00:15:24.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“pestilences,” he called it,
“in one place after another.”

00:15:24.771 --> 00:15:26.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re not shaken by this.

00:15:26.981 --> 00:15:31.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have faith and courage,
and we keep going, don’t we?

00:15:31.194 --> 00:15:33.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think back to the Olympic marathon runner

00:15:33.947 --> 00:15:37.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Tanzania whom we mentioned earlier.

00:15:37.075 --> 00:15:42.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After being injured,
he was bandaged and then continued to run.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It took courage and determination to run,

00:15:45.042 --> 00:15:47.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sometimes walk, through the pain.

00:15:47.461 --> 00:15:49.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he eventually crossed the finish line,

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was cheered by the small crowd
remaining in the stadium.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, try to imagine:

00:15:55.386 --> 00:15:59.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was limping
with his bandages blowing in the wind,

00:15:59.849 --> 00:16:03.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he moved forward toward his goal.

00:16:03.436 --> 00:16:06.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For many, the race would have been long over.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that man was running
for something more than a material prize.

00:16:10.526 --> 00:16:13.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He saw something greater
beyond that finish line.

00:16:13.905 --> 00:16:15.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was it?

00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:19.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We find it in what he said afterward.

00:16:19.744 --> 00:16:24.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he was asked
why he continued on in the race, he replied:

00:16:24.124 --> 00:16:28.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My country did not send me
5,000 miles to start the race.

00:16:28.837 --> 00:16:33.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They sent me 5,000 miles to finish the race.”

00:16:33.884 --> 00:16:36.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That sense of responsibility

00:16:36.178 --> 00:16:39.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gave him the courage
to go on despite the pain.

00:16:39.932 --> 00:16:44.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He saw a greater purpose,
and he returned home with honor.

00:16:44.353 --> 00:16:47.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We too have a greater responsibility

00:16:47.189 --> 00:16:50.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a far more important race.

00:16:50.318 --> 00:16:54.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We owe it to Jehovah
to keep running the Christian course.

00:16:54.697 --> 00:16:57.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He and his Son gave everything,

00:16:57.742 --> 00:17:01.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you could say, so that we can keep running.

00:17:01.162 --> 00:17:05.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also owe it to others
to set a good example for them

00:17:05.667 --> 00:17:08.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will motivate them never to give up.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:12.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we owe it to ourselves
to use what we have been given

00:17:12.883 --> 00:17:17.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so as to run in a way
that we gain the real life.

00:17:17.763 --> 00:17:22.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are certain
that you have both the faith and the courage

00:17:22.434 --> 00:17:24.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to run with the eyes of your heart

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:29.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looking intently at Jesus’ example
and at the prize.

00:17:29.775 --> 00:17:33.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in review, what is the overall lesson

00:17:33.028 --> 00:17:36.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you Gilead graduates and, really,
for every Christian runner?

00:17:36.824 --> 00:17:41.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is this: Run for the real life
at your very best pace

00:17:41.829 --> 00:17:43.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(Jehovah will help you),

00:17:43.915 --> 00:17:48.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
run with a clear focus on your ultimate goal,

00:17:48.336 --> 00:17:53.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and run the course
with faith and with courage.

00:17:53.091 --> 00:17:55.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When will the finish line be reached?

00:17:55.844 --> 00:17:58.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For those who will live forever on earth,

00:17:58.305 --> 00:18:02.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the <i>Revelation Climax</i>  book
states this in chapter 11:

00:18:02.059 --> 00:18:07.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By exercising faith
throughout Jesus’ Millennial Reign

00:18:07.064 --> 00:18:10.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and during the decisive test that follows,

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:14.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“these will be rewarded
with life everlasting in Paradise on earth.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Their names
will then remain indelibly written

00:18:18.492 --> 00:18:21.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the book of life.”

00:18:21.495 --> 00:18:26.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For true servants of God,
that “decisive test” will be nothing to fear.

00:18:26.209 --> 00:18:28.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will never drop out of the race.

00:18:28.503 --> 00:18:32.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For them, that test will be just another day
on the calendar, so to speak.

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:34.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will keep going

00:18:34.133 --> 00:18:37.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their eyes fixed
on what is ahead for them.

00:18:37.846 --> 00:18:42.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faith, courage, and all other godly qualities

00:18:42.225 --> 00:18:46.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will carry loyal ones into the real life.

00:18:46.104 --> 00:18:49.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Use your Gilead training
to run the race well.

00:18:49.775 --> 00:18:52.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Strengthen others to do the same.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See the prize ahead of you.

00:18:54.822 --> 00:18:57.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And follow Jesus’ steps closely.

00:18:57.908 --> 00:19:01.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Run the race
through the approaching great tribulation,

00:19:01.579 --> 00:19:05.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then keep running like a true Christian.

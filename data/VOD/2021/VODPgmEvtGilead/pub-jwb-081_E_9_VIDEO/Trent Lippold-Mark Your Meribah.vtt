He did not miss the sign the first time,

00:00:04.154 --> 00:00:07.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the second time, it meant his life.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was Moses.

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:12.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our lives are full of signposts

00:00:12.228 --> 00:00:14.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—figurative markers for lessons,

00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:16.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
memories, experiences.

00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:18.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some good, some bad.

00:00:18.902 --> 00:00:20.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some signposts we erect;

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
others are put up for us.

00:00:23.306 --> 00:00:26.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In either case, they should help us

00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:29.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to continue in life successfully.

00:00:29.345 --> 00:00:32.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, consider a lesson

00:00:32.348 --> 00:00:35.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a signpost—
in the life of Moses.

00:00:35.418 --> 00:00:38.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It happened
shortly after the crossing of the Red Sea,

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:40.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s recorded in Exodus chapter 17.

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:42.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At a place called Rephidim,

00:00:42.992 --> 00:00:46.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Israelites gathered and there was Moses

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by a crag with his staff

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:51.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with a quarreling nation.

00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:53.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The events there at Rephidim

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provided a significant lesson for Moses

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—something to remember
for future circumstances.

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so he marked that spot.

00:01:03.012 --> 00:01:05.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did he do it?

00:01:05.014 --> 00:01:07.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He changed the name from Rephidim,

00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:10.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which means “Refresh,”

00:01:10.286 --> 00:01:13.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Meribah,
which means “Quarreling.”

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Little did Moses know

00:01:15.925 --> 00:01:19.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that that name would ring in his ears.

00:01:19.062 --> 00:01:22.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thirty-nine years later,
at a place called Kadesh,

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:27.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses was again near a crag with his staff

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with a quarreling nation before him.

00:01:30.673 --> 00:01:34.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And based on the events that happened there,

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
look at what is recorded
at Numbers 20:12, 13.

00:01:40.583 --> 00:01:45.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Numbers 20:12, 13, we read:

00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:48.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah later said to Moses and Aaron:

00:01:48.224 --> 00:01:51.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Because you did not show faith in me

00:01:51.227 --> 00:01:55.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and sanctify me
before the eyes of the people of Israel,

00:01:55.298 --> 00:01:58.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘you will not bring this congregation

00:01:58.301 --> 00:02:01.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“into the land that I will give them.’

00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:04.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“These are the waters of Meribah,

00:02:04.307 --> 00:02:06.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“where the Israelites quarreled with Jehovah,

00:02:06.676 --> 00:02:09.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that he was sanctified among them.”

00:02:09.612 --> 00:02:12.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses is taught a lesson here.

00:02:12.348 --> 00:02:15.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s unclear who exactly
named the place Meribah,

00:02:15.852 --> 00:02:20.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Moses did record
that these were “the waters of Meribah”

00:02:20.657 --> 00:02:24.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—an unforgettable signpost in Moses’ life.

00:02:24.327 --> 00:02:27.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What it meant to Moses was very clear.

00:02:27.864 --> 00:02:29.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what now?

00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:32.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would Moses do following this?

00:02:32.468 --> 00:02:35.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, from verse 14 (if we were to read it),

00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:37.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would see that Moses
carried on with his assignment.

00:02:37.974 --> 00:02:40.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He continued to lead the Israelites.

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:42.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He led them against the Kings Sihon and Og.

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:45.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He began to see Jehovah’s mighty arm of power

00:02:45.348 --> 00:02:48.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they drew closer and closer
to the Promised Land.

00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:50.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in his enthusiasm,

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:53.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses makes one request of Jehovah.

00:02:53.623 --> 00:02:56.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He turns to him, and we can read his words

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Deuteronomy 3:25, 26.

00:03:01.364 --> 00:03:05.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses’ words in verse 25, he writes:

00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:08.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Please let me pass over
and see the good land

00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:13.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that is across the Jordan,
this good mountainous region and Lebanon.’

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:19.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But Jehovah was still furious
with me because of you,

00:03:19.983 --> 00:03:22.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he would not listen to me.

00:03:22.552 --> 00:03:26.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Rather, Jehovah said to me,
‘Enough from you!

00:03:26.856 --> 00:03:30.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never speak to me again about this matter.’”

00:03:32.195 --> 00:03:37.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah was still furious with me
because of you.”

00:03:37.233 --> 00:03:41.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meribah—that’s what Moses was referring to.

00:03:41.504 --> 00:03:44.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The signpost was clear for Moses.

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:48.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would Moses respond to this?

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:50.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would he do?

00:03:50.613 --> 00:03:53.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Moses carried on.

00:03:53.283 --> 00:03:55.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He got back to work, back to business.

00:03:55.785 --> 00:03:56.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wasn’t finished.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He continued to lead and shepherd the nation.

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:02.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He prepared Joshua to be his successor.

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:05.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he worked along until Jehovah 

00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:07.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came to Moses and said to him,

00:04:07.597 --> 00:04:10.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Moses, it’s time to go to the mountain.”

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, it was time for Moses’ death.

00:04:13.937 --> 00:04:16.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read, please, Jehovah’s words to Moses

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:21.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Deuteronomy 32:51, 52.

00:04:21.244 --> 00:04:25.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beginning in verse 51
of Deuteronomy chapter 32,

00:04:25.915 --> 00:04:27.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we read Jehovah’s words:

00:04:27.917 --> 00:04:32.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Because both of you
[that is, Moses and Aaron]

00:04:32.488 --> 00:04:36.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“were unfaithful to me among the Israelites

00:04:36.793 --> 00:04:40.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:42.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the wilderness of Zin,

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:46.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because you did not sanctify me
before the people of Israel.

00:04:46.336 --> 00:04:48.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You will see the land from a distance,

00:04:48.338 --> 00:04:52.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you will not enter the land
that I am giving to the people of Israel.”

00:04:53.977 --> 00:04:59.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah draws Moses’ attention
back to Meribah.

00:04:59.015 --> 00:05:02.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What effect did this have on Moses

00:05:02.518 --> 00:05:05.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah referred to Meribah again?

00:05:05.521 --> 00:05:07.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, think of this:

00:05:07.757 --> 00:05:10.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After Jehovah’s refusal

00:05:10.493 --> 00:05:13.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reconsider his judgment on Moses,

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:16.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses continued
fully dedicated to his assignment.

00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:19.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, the details make up
the book of Deuteronomy.

00:05:21.137 --> 00:05:23.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you look at what happened

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shortly before Jehovah’s words
here in chapter 32,

00:05:26.342 --> 00:05:31.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we find that Moses recited
a beautiful song of praise to Jehovah

00:05:31.347 --> 00:05:33.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
following Jehovah’s words.

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 33, we find Moses here

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:39.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
giving a blessing for the nation of Israel.

00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:41.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see what happened to Moses?

00:05:41.557 --> 00:05:45.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses marked the lessons
and experiences in his life,

00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:47.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Meribah.

00:05:47.397 --> 00:05:51.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was not paralyzed
or broken by disappointment.

00:05:51.367 --> 00:05:55.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, his resolve
to serve Jehovah faithfully

00:05:55.671 --> 00:05:57.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was strengthened.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped Moses?

00:06:00.476 --> 00:06:02.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did he do it?

00:06:02.478 --> 00:06:06.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider at least two things
that may have helped Moses.

00:06:06.082 --> 00:06:11.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number one:
Moses’ intimate friendship with Jehovah.

00:06:11.087 --> 00:06:14.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, why would Moses

00:06:14.724 --> 00:06:16.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even ask Jehovah

00:06:16.726 --> 00:06:19.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reconsider his judgment on him?

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:22.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Moses knew Jehovah intimately.

00:06:22.598 --> 00:06:26.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew him to be
“a God merciful and compassionate”

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:28.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “abundant in loving-kindness.”

00:06:28.838 --> 00:06:33.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when Jehovah refused to reconsider,

00:06:33.076 --> 00:06:35.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses did not say a word.

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:37.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:06:37.447 --> 00:06:39.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Moses knew that Jehovah

00:06:39.816 --> 00:06:43.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was also a God ‘perfect in his activity

00:06:43.186 --> 00:06:45.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that all his ways are justice.’

00:06:45.922 --> 00:06:48.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, from Moses’ example, we see

00:06:48.191 --> 00:06:51.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the more intimate
our friendship is with Jehovah,

00:06:51.294 --> 00:06:55.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more intimately
he can teach us and train us.

00:06:55.364 --> 00:06:59.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And thus, like Moses,
it will be easier to get past disappointment

00:06:59.869 --> 00:07:04.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and continue in our assignment
faithful and joyful.

00:07:04.807 --> 00:07:08.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider a second thing
that may have helped Moses,

00:07:08.177 --> 00:07:10.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that was Job.

00:07:10.346 --> 00:07:13.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, Moses wrote the book of Job

00:07:13.616 --> 00:07:17.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
around 1473 B.C.E.,
around the same time as the events

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that took place at Meribah of Kadesh.

00:07:21.157 --> 00:07:24.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The words are fresh in his mind.

00:07:24.727 --> 00:07:29.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses knew how Jehovah dealt with Job.

00:07:29.098 --> 00:07:33.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, at Job 38:3,
Jehovah said to Job:

00:07:33.503 --> 00:07:37.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Brace yourself, please, like a man;
I will question you.”

00:07:37.907 --> 00:07:42.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses knew how Job responded to his problems

00:07:42.311 --> 00:07:44.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to Jehovah’s correction.

00:07:44.247 --> 00:07:48.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, at Job 40:4,
Job said to Jehovah:

00:07:48.284 --> 00:07:50.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I put my hand over my mouth.”

And Moses also knew
the final outcome

00:07:54.223 --> 00:07:56.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the matters with Job.

00:07:56.859 --> 00:08:00.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, Moses was able to see

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:03.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his own difficulties
and his own disappointments

00:08:03.666 --> 00:08:06.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the prism of universal sovereignty,

00:08:06.636 --> 00:08:09.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that gave Moses perspective.

00:08:09.972 --> 00:08:14.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So take advantage
of the inspired words of God

00:08:14.277 --> 00:08:16.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at your disposal.

00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:18.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meditate deeply on the experiences

00:08:18.314 --> 00:08:20.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s faithful servants

00:08:20.283 --> 00:08:23.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—like Job and like Moses.

00:08:23.886 --> 00:08:27.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These examples will give you perspective

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:30.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and allow you to move on joyfully.

00:08:30.426 --> 00:08:33.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters,
the simple truth is that

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our life of service to God,

00:08:35.965 --> 00:08:38.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may be treated unfairly

00:08:38.734 --> 00:08:41.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will likely be disappointed at times.

00:08:41.871 --> 00:08:44.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our expectations may not be met,

00:08:44.707 --> 00:08:48.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will respond poorly at times.

00:08:48.277 --> 00:08:52.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mark the moment
as a lesson in life—a Meribah.

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:55.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if
—as was the case with Moses—

00:08:55.251 --> 00:08:58.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah marks it for you, be grateful.

00:08:58.521 --> 00:09:02.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not be paralyzed
or broken by disappointment.

00:09:02.825 --> 00:09:06.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Moses, fix in mind what you have to do.

00:09:06.929 --> 00:09:09.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Allow the experience or the lesson

00:09:09.398 --> 00:09:14.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to strengthen your resolve
to serve Jehovah faithfully and joyfully.

00:09:14.403 --> 00:09:19.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can—if you mark your Meribah.

00:00:01 Located in the western Pacific Ocean,
00:00:05 the Mariana Trench is the deepest known location on earth.
00:00:10 To help you get an idea of its depth,
00:00:14 imagine that you could stack
00:00:16 the Empire State Building
00:00:17 in the trench.
00:00:19 It would take 25 such buildings to go
00:00:23 from the bottom of the trench before you would reach sea level.
00:00:28 It is also one of the deadliest places on earth.
00:00:32 Why is that?
00:00:33 In a word—pressure.
00:00:36 The crushing pressure, water pressure,
00:00:38 on the floor of the trench is more than eight tons per square inch.
00:00:43 Now, to give you some idea,
00:00:45 that would be the equivalent
00:00:46 of having about 50 jumbo jets
00:00:50 on top of you.
00:00:53 Surely no life could live in that trench.
00:00:57 At least that’s what scientists thought.
00:01:00 But they were wrong.
00:01:02 When they finally developed a submersible
00:01:04 that would take them down into the trench,
00:01:07 they found life teeming
00:01:11 —and not just surviving but thriving.
00:01:15 Now, how is that possible?
00:01:18 It’s possible, friends, because Jehovah, our Creator,
00:01:23 knows how to deal with pressure.
00:01:26 Jehovah knows how to deal with pressure.
00:01:30 And this is a fact that should be comforting to all of us.
00:01:34 Why?
00:01:35 Because the pressure
00:01:37 in this system of things is increasing
00:01:40 —strain, stress, anxiety—
00:01:43 for all people at all levels.
00:01:45 And the Bible tells us
00:01:47 that these pressures are likely to increase in the near future.
00:01:50 But the good news is
00:01:52 that Jehovah does more than just equip his servants to survive.
00:01:57 He can actually make one thrive.
00:02:01 Here’s an example.
00:02:03 Try this on for pressure.
00:02:07 You’re surrounded by men who hate you.
00:02:10 In addition to hunting you down with a view to taking your life,
00:02:14 they’ve spread slander and lies about you everywhere.
00:02:18 Your name has become a reproach.
00:02:21 When people see you coming, they turn and run the other way
00:02:26 because they feel that your time is short
00:02:28 and they don’t want to be caught in the crosshairs.
00:02:33 Wherever you look, it seems like terror is waiting for you.
00:02:37 And as a result of these problems, you’re struggling with depression.
00:02:42 Your own sins are staring you in the face.
00:02:44 The whole experience has taken a toll on your health.
00:02:47 You can’t sleep.
00:02:48 Your stamina is shot.
00:02:50 Your body is wasting away.
00:02:54 Now, that was David’s situation,
00:02:57 and you can read about it at Psalm 31:10-13.
00:03:03 The pressure was real —no question about it.
00:03:06 David’s feelings were real —no question about that.
00:03:11 But something else was very real.
00:03:14 And that was Jehovah.
00:03:17 And so Jehovah was where David would turn to.
00:03:22 Let’s turn to his words in Psalm 31.
00:03:28 Psalm 31—and note his humble prayer
00:03:32 beginning in verse 14.
00:03:35 He said: “But I trust in you, O Jehovah,
00:03:38 “I declare: ‘You are my God.’
00:03:42 “My days are in your hand.
00:03:44 “Rescue me from the hand of my enemies and from those persecuting me.
00:03:48 “Make your face shine upon your servant.
00:03:51 Save me by your loyal love.”
00:03:56 David’s life experiences
00:03:58 had taught him the value of turning to God
00:04:01 and pouring out his heart in times of trial.
00:04:04 And he absolutely knew that prayer,
00:04:09 coupled with implicit trust and patience,
00:04:13 would always bring Jehovah’s blessing.
00:04:16 And you see, friends, the key to not just surviving
00:04:21 but thriving under extreme pressure
00:04:24 is to have the internal pressure
00:04:27 equal to the external.
00:04:30 And when this is true,
00:04:32 there is no amount of pressure that can crush you.
00:04:36 So in a spiritual sense,
00:04:39 David received the internal fortitude or, as some say,
00:04:43 “the intestinal fortitude,”
00:04:45 meaning “the courage and the strength
00:04:48 that would make him equal to the pressure weighing in on him.”
00:04:52 And how do we know that he received that?
00:04:55 Well, let’s go back to Psalm 31 for just a moment.
00:04:59 If you look in verse 21, notice now
00:05:03 the change.
00:05:05 He says: “May Jehovah be praised,
00:05:08 “for in a wonderful way, he has shown his loyal love to me
00:05:12 in a besieged city.”
00:05:15 And then in verse 23:
00:05:17 “Love Jehovah, all you who are loyal to him!
00:05:20 Jehovah protects the faithful.”
00:05:22 And finally in verse 24:
00:05:25 “Be courageous, and may your heart be strong,
00:05:28 all you who are waiting for Jehovah.”
00:05:34 So, you see, David
00:05:38 received an answer to his prayer
00:05:41 —his prayer coupled with his faith
00:05:45 and his patience.
00:05:47 He was waiting on Jehovah.
00:05:49 And Jehovah helped him not only to survive but to thrive.
00:05:54 And he added joy to David
00:05:57 because David went on to find joy and happiness
00:06:01 in his responsibilities and privileges.
00:06:05 So, what do we learn?
00:06:07 (1) David was able to face the pressure
00:06:11 because he had an unshakable faith in Jehovah,
00:06:15 (2) David’s relationship with Jehovah
00:06:19 brought him the patience to wait on God,
00:06:23 and (3) when a loyal servant of God
00:06:26 humbly turns to Jehovah for help,
00:06:29 it is Jehovah’s own loyal love
00:06:32 that has the effect of equalizing the pressure.
00:06:37 And, you know, there’s something else.
00:06:40 David’s experience in the trench  reached further than he ever knew.
00:06:46 Jonah, while in the belly of the great fish,
00:06:50 cited words from Psalm 31.
00:06:54 Jeremiah, who had many trialsome times in his life,
00:06:59 often echoed phrases from Psalm 31.
00:07:03 And Jesus Christ himself, the very Son of God—
00:07:08 His final words from the stake
00:07:10 were a quotation from Psalm 31:5.
00:07:14 So Jesus must have meditated on this many times.
00:07:17 And so, friends, like David, Jonah, Jeremiah,
00:07:21 Jesus, and many, many others
00:07:24 —they all trusted in Jehovah,
00:07:26 and Jehovah never failed to make them equal to the pressure.
00:07:31 He’ll do the same for you.
00:07:34 And so in conclusion,
00:07:36 you see, it really doesn’t matter
00:07:39 how great the pressure is.
00:07:42 It only matters where the pressure lies.
00:07:45 Do not let it come between you
00:07:49 and Jehovah and your worship and service.
00:07:53 Don’t let it come between you,
00:07:55 because then the external pressure
00:07:58 will only continue to move you closer
00:08:02 to your heavenly Father.
00:08:05 The life that flourishes in the Mariana Trench gives
00:08:09 a positive example, a beautiful example,
00:08:12 of Jehovah’s limitless ability to help his creation
00:08:15 deal with pressure.
00:08:17 Prayer, trust, and patience
00:08:19 will always be rewarded by Jehovah.
00:08:23 Relief will come.
00:08:26 So remain close to your heavenly Father,
00:08:28 and you will not just survive
00:08:32 the pressure in the trench
00:08:34 but you will thrive spiritually.

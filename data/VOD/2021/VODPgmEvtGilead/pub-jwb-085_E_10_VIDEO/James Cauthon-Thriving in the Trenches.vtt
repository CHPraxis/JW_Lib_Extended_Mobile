00:00:01.751 --> 00:00:05.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Located in the western Pacific Ocean,

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:10.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Mariana Trench
is the deepest known location on earth.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To help you get an idea of its depth,

00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:16.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imagine that you could stack

00:00:16.132 --> 00:00:17.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Empire State Building

00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:19.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the trench.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would take 25 such buildings to go

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the bottom of the trench
before you would reach sea level.

00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:32.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is also one of the deadliest places
on earth.

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:33.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is that?

00:00:33.717 --> 00:00:36.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a word—pressure.

00:00:36.386 --> 00:00:38.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The crushing pressure, water pressure,

00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:43.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the floor of the trench
is more than eight tons per square inch.

00:00:43.693 --> 00:00:45.195 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, to give you some idea,

00:00:45.195 --> 00:00:46.296 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that would be the equivalent

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:50.300 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of having about 50 jumbo jets

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.335 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on top of you.

00:00:53.169 --> 00:00:57.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Surely no life could live in that trench.

00:00:57.407 --> 00:00:59.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At least that’s what scientists thought.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they were wrong.

00:01:02.712 --> 00:01:04.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they finally developed a submersible

00:01:04.714 --> 00:01:07.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would take them down into the trench,

00:01:07.083 --> 00:01:11.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they found life teeming

00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:15.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and not just surviving but thriving.

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:18.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how is that possible?

00:01:18.928 --> 00:01:23.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s possible, friends,
because Jehovah, our Creator,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knows how to deal with pressure.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah knows how to deal with pressure.

00:01:30.874 --> 00:01:34.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is a fact
that should be comforting to all of us.

00:01:34.077 --> 00:01:35.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:01:35.745 --> 00:01:37.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because the pressure

00:01:37.914 --> 00:01:40.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this system of things is increasing

00:01:40.383 --> 00:01:43.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—strain, stress, anxiety—

00:01:43.153 --> 00:01:45.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all people at all levels.

00:01:45.755 --> 00:01:47.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Bible tells us

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that these pressures are likely
to increase in the near future.

00:01:50.894 --> 00:01:52.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the good news is

00:01:52.896 --> 00:01:57.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah does more than
just equip his servants to survive.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can actually make one thrive.

00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:03.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s an example.

00:02:03.473 --> 00:02:06.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try this on for pressure.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re surrounded by men who hate you.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition to hunting you down
with a view to taking your life,

00:02:14.184 --> 00:02:18.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’ve spread slander and lies
about you everywhere.

00:02:18.788 --> 00:02:21.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your name has become a reproach.

00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:26.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When people see you coming,
they turn and run the other way

00:02:26.296 --> 00:02:28.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they feel that your time is short

00:02:28.798 --> 00:02:33.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they don’t want to be caught
in the crosshairs.

00:02:33.102 --> 00:02:37.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wherever you look,
it seems like terror is waiting for you.

00:02:37.874 --> 00:02:42.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as a result of these problems,
you’re struggling with depression.

00:02:42.045 --> 00:02:44.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your own sins are staring you in the face.

00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:47.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The whole experience
has taken a toll on your health.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t sleep.

00:02:48.718 --> 00:02:50.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your stamina is shot.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your body is wasting away.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that was David’s situation,

00:02:57.827 --> 00:03:02.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you can read about it at Psalm 31:10-13.

00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:06.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The pressure was real
—no question about it.

00:03:06.135 --> 00:03:11.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David’s feelings were real
—no question about that.

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:14.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But something else was very real.

00:03:14.377 --> 00:03:17.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was Jehovah.

00:03:17.146 --> 00:03:22.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so Jehovah
was where David would turn to.

00:03:22.051 --> 00:03:26.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn to his words in Psalm 31.

00:03:28.324 --> 00:03:32.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 31—and note his humble prayer

00:03:32.161 --> 00:03:34.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beginning in verse 14.

00:03:35.365 --> 00:03:38.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “But I trust in you, O Jehovah,

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:42.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I declare: ‘You are my God.’

00:03:42.338 --> 00:03:44.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My days are in your hand.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Rescue me from the hand of my enemies
and from those persecuting me.

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:51.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Make your face shine upon your servant.

00:03:51.381 --> 00:03:54.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Save me by your loyal love.”

00:03:56.386 --> 00:03:58.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David’s life experiences

00:03:58.988 --> 00:04:01.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had taught him the value of turning to God

00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:04.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pouring out his heart in times of trial.

00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:09.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he absolutely knew that prayer,

00:04:09.465 --> 00:04:13.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
coupled with implicit trust and patience,

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:16.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would always bring Jehovah’s blessing.

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:21.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you see, friends,
the key to not just surviving

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but thriving under extreme pressure

00:04:24.113 --> 00:04:27.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to have the internal pressure

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
equal to the external.

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:32.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when this is true,

00:04:32.488 --> 00:04:36.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is no amount of pressure
that can crush you.

00:04:36.926 --> 00:04:39.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in a spiritual sense,

00:04:39.262 --> 00:04:43.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David received the internal fortitude
or, as some say,

00:04:43.566 --> 00:04:45.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the intestinal fortitude,”

00:04:45.935 --> 00:04:48.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meaning “the courage and the strength

00:04:48.304 --> 00:04:52.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would make him equal
to the pressure weighing in on him.”

00:04:52.342 --> 00:04:55.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how do we know that he received that?

00:04:55.345 --> 00:04:58.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s go back to Psalm 31
for just a moment.

00:04:59.482 --> 00:05:03.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you look in verse 21, notice now

00:05:03.152 --> 00:05:05.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the change.

00:05:05.488 --> 00:05:08.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “May Jehovah be praised,

00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:12.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for in a wonderful way,
he has shown his loyal love to me

00:05:12.996 --> 00:05:15.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a besieged city.”

00:05:15.098 --> 00:05:17.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in verse 23:

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Love Jehovah, all you who are loyal to him!

00:05:20.903 --> 00:05:22.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah protects the faithful.”

00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:25.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally in verse 24:

00:05:25.108 --> 00:05:28.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be courageous, and may your heart be strong,

00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:32.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all you who are waiting for Jehovah.”

00:05:34.117 --> 00:05:38.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, you see, David

00:05:38.554 --> 00:05:41.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
received an answer to his prayer

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:45.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his prayer coupled with his faith

00:05:45.561 --> 00:05:47.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his patience.

00:05:47.563 --> 00:05:49.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was waiting on Jehovah.

00:05:49.565 --> 00:05:54.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah helped him not only to survive
but to thrive.

00:05:54.303 --> 00:05:57.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he added joy to David

00:05:57.707 --> 00:06:01.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because David went on
to find joy and happiness

00:06:01.577 --> 00:06:05.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his responsibilities and privileges.

00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:07.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we learn?

00:06:07.283 --> 00:06:11.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) David was able to face the pressure

00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:15.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he had
an unshakable faith in Jehovah,

00:06:15.558 --> 00:06:19.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) David’s relationship with Jehovah

00:06:19.062 --> 00:06:23.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brought him the patience to wait on God,

00:06:23.332 --> 00:06:26.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and (3) when a loyal servant of God

00:06:26.903 --> 00:06:29.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
humbly turns to Jehovah for help,

00:06:29.105 --> 00:06:32.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is Jehovah’s own loyal love

00:06:32.508 --> 00:06:36.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that has the effect
of equalizing the pressure.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, you know, there’s something else.

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:45.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David’s experience in the trench
 reached further than he ever knew.

00:06:46.722 --> 00:06:50.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jonah, while in the belly of the great fish,

00:06:50.426 --> 00:06:54.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cited words from Psalm 31.

00:06:54.397 --> 00:06:59.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah, who had
many trialsome times in his life,

00:06:59.402 --> 00:07:03.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
often echoed phrases from Psalm 31.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jesus Christ himself,
the very Son of God—

00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:10.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His final words from the stake

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:14.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were a quotation from Psalm 31:5.

00:07:14.083 --> 00:07:17.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jesus must have meditated
on this many times.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so, friends, like David, Jonah, Jeremiah,

00:07:21.157 --> 00:07:24.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus, and many, many others

00:07:24.327 --> 00:07:26.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they all trusted in Jehovah,

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:31.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah never failed
to make them equal to the pressure.

00:07:31.501 --> 00:07:34.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll do the same for you.

00:07:34.137 --> 00:07:36.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so in conclusion,

00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:39.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you see, it really doesn’t matter

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:42.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how great the pressure is.

00:07:42.044 --> 00:07:45.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It only matters where the pressure lies.

00:07:45.781 --> 00:07:49.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not let it come between you

00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:53.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah
and your worship and service.

00:07:53.055 --> 00:07:55.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t let it come between you,

00:07:55.658 --> 00:07:58.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because then the external pressure

00:07:58.828 --> 00:08:02.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will only continue to move you closer

00:08:02.298 --> 00:08:05.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to your heavenly Father.

00:08:05.268 --> 00:08:09.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The life that flourishes
in the Mariana Trench gives

00:08:09.238 --> 00:08:12.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a positive example, a beautiful example,

00:08:12.441 --> 00:08:15.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s limitless ability
to help his creation

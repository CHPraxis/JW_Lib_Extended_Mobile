In this talk, we want you to understand

00:00:06.456 --> 00:00:11.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the sustaining power of loyal love.

00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:14.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because it is this quality, loyal love,

00:00:14.197 --> 00:00:16.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its power

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:19.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will help you face future trials

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:24.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and challenges with confidence in Jehovah.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you perhaps remember the definition

00:00:27.377 --> 00:00:30.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of loyal love from a written review.

00:00:30.146 --> 00:00:34.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s this: It is love motivated

00:00:34.417 --> 00:00:38.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by a strong commitment and a deep attachment.

00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:40.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here’s how King David described

00:00:40.724 --> 00:00:44.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the loyal love that existed
between him and Jehovah.

00:00:44.994 --> 00:00:47.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said at Psalm 63:8:

00:00:47.897 --> 00:00:50.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I cling to you;

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:54.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your right hand keeps fast hold on me.”

00:00:54.237 --> 00:00:57.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is loyal love,

00:00:57.006 --> 00:00:59.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I cling to you.

00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:01.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You hold on to me.’

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:04.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in the first century
—a woman—

00:01:04.714 --> 00:01:07.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a woman who set an outstanding example

00:01:07.417 --> 00:01:11.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of clinging to Jehovah is Anna.

00:01:11.554 --> 00:01:14.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?
Let’s find out.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We open our Bibles to Luke chapter 2.

00:01:17.293 --> 00:01:20.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to read verses 36 and 37

00:01:20.463 --> 00:01:24.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see what lesson
we can learn and apply to you:

00:01:27.203 --> 00:01:29.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now there was a prophetess,

00:01:29.205 --> 00:01:32.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Anna the daughter
of Phanuel, of Asher’s tribe.

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:34.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This woman was well along in years

00:01:34.944 --> 00:01:39.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and had lived with her husband
for seven years after they were married,

00:01:39.282 --> 00:01:43.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and she was a widow now 84 years old.

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“She was never missing from the temple,

00:01:45.622 --> 00:01:48.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“rendering sacred service night and day

00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:51.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with fasting and supplications.”

00:01:51.327 --> 00:01:53.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, here we have it.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything we know about Anna is right here.

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:59.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Luke recorded it.

00:01:59.669 --> 00:02:02.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was 84 years old

00:02:02.272 --> 00:02:05.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Luke introduces her to us.

00:02:05.508 --> 00:02:10.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likely, she hadn’t lived long enough
to become a follower of Jesus,

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:12.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be anointed with holy spirit,

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:15.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to enjoy preaching
the good news of the Kingdom.

00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:17.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s it.

00:02:17.954 --> 00:02:21.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>If</i>  we stop right there.

00:02:21.624 --> 00:02:23.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if we don’t?

00:02:23.726 --> 00:02:25.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if we dig deeper?

00:02:25.995 --> 00:02:28.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will we learn that will help you?

00:02:28.765 --> 00:02:31.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s do that.

00:02:31.301 --> 00:02:35.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anna was born about 86 B.C.E.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When she was 23 years old,

00:02:39.776 --> 00:02:44.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jerusalem was filled
with violence and divisions.

00:02:44.514 --> 00:02:47.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jewish leaders
such as the Maccabees are at war.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Roman forces under the leadership
of a soldier named Pompey

00:02:50.954 --> 00:02:53.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came to restore order, and in the process,

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some 12,000 Jews reportedly died.

00:02:58.661 --> 00:03:02.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is possible that Anna’s husband

00:03:02.131 --> 00:03:04.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was one of these victims.

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:08.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then when Anna was 47 years old,

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:11.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Romans appointed Herod as king of Judea.

00:03:11.341 --> 00:03:13.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Herod?

00:03:13.042 --> 00:03:15.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This man was not a descendant of David.

00:03:15.211 --> 00:03:17.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was not even an Israelite.

00:03:17.213 --> 00:03:19.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was an Edomite.

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:23.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Edomites
were sworn enemies of true worship.

00:03:23.586 --> 00:03:28.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, on top of that,
the hypocritical Jewish religious leaders

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:33.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made life hard for people,
including widows like Anna.

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:37.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now Anna watches
as Jehovah’s “house of prayer,”

00:03:37.567 --> 00:03:42.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the place she cherished,
became “a cave of robbers.”

00:03:42.205 --> 00:03:46.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pure worship is withering on the vine.

00:03:46.276 --> 00:03:48.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will Anna do?

00:03:48.278 --> 00:03:50.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She could have been stumbled.

00:03:50.346 --> 00:03:55.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She could have reasoned:
‘I supported true worship all my life.

00:03:55.184 --> 00:03:59.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I believed the Messiah would come
and the prophecies would come.

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:01.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I go to the temple every day.

00:04:01.724 --> 00:04:05.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’ve done everything right,
but things have only gotten worse.

00:04:05.428 --> 00:04:09.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘God let my husband die;
an Edomite is rebuilding the temple.

00:04:09.732 --> 00:04:11.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What’s happening?

00:04:11.768 --> 00:04:14.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Has Jehovah left us?

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should I leave too?’

00:04:17.307 --> 00:04:20.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anna could have given up,
walked away, became bitter.

00:04:20.476 --> 00:04:22.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But she didn’t.

00:04:22.478 --> 00:04:25.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why? Why?

00:04:25.048 --> 00:04:28.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the roots of her loyal love,

00:04:28.384 --> 00:04:30.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that sustaining power of loyal love.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It went deep, and it wrapped around Jehovah.

00:04:33.856 --> 00:04:36.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she had the power to keep clinging to him

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:39.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under those circumstances.

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:43.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anna was determined to serve Jehovah
to the best of her ability.

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:45.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did she do?

00:04:45.401 --> 00:04:49.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, looking at verse 37:

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“She was never missing from the temple,

00:04:52.976 --> 00:04:55.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[She was in the right place.]

00:04:57.046 --> 00:05:00.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“rendering sacred service night and day

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:03.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[doing the right thing]

00:05:03.052 --> 00:05:05.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with fasting and supplications

00:05:05.588 --> 00:05:08.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[with the right attitude].”

00:05:08.324 --> 00:05:11.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was doing the right thing

00:05:11.461 --> 00:05:14.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the right place with the right attitude.

00:05:14.998 --> 00:05:19.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nothing could stop
this seemingly fragile servant of God

00:05:19.202 --> 00:05:23.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from clinging to her closest Friend, Jehovah.

00:05:23.473 --> 00:05:26.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In effect, Anna was saying,

00:05:26.175 --> 00:05:29.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I cling to you, Jehovah.”

00:05:29.912 --> 00:05:33.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And her loyal love was noticed.

00:05:34.517 --> 00:05:37.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chapter 2 and verse 38

00:05:37.153 --> 00:05:40.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reveals that Anna was present

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:44.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the baby Jesus
was brought to the temple.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when she saw that baby,
what did she begin to do in verse 38?

00:05:48.965 --> 00:05:53.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “She came near
and [she] began giving thanks to God

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:56.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and speaking about the child
to all who were waiting

00:05:56.239 --> 00:05:58.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Jerusalem’s deliverance.”

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:01.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you sense her joy?

00:06:01.677 --> 00:06:05.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you feel the joy she had
at seeing and, perhaps, even holding

00:06:05.148 --> 00:06:07.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that little baby, the future Messiah?

00:06:07.683 --> 00:06:10.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was something that this elderly woman

00:06:10.386 --> 00:06:13.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had never expected in her lifetime.

00:06:13.923 --> 00:06:17.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The child in front of her was proof

00:06:17.593 --> 00:06:20.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—tangible proof, concrete evidence—

00:06:20.696 --> 00:06:25.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah had not abandoned his people.

00:06:25.234 --> 00:06:28.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he did not abandon Anna.

00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:33.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So not only had Anna clung to Jehovah

00:06:33.042 --> 00:06:38.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah held on to her and

00:06:38.047 --> 00:06:42.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—<i>and</i>  rewarded her.

00:06:42.218 --> 00:06:45.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is loyal love.

00:06:46.722 --> 00:06:49.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anna’s faithful record

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:52.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is so well-known

00:06:52.195 --> 00:06:56.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that some 50 years later,
50 years later or so,

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:59.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Luke was compelled to write about her.

00:06:59.702 --> 00:07:01.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where did he get his information?

00:07:01.771 --> 00:07:03.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who did he talk to?

00:07:03.606 --> 00:07:07.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he talk to Mary or interview her
or some of the older ones?

00:07:07.076 --> 00:07:09.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘There was this woman, Anna.
She was at the temple.

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:11.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She would never leave.’

00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:13.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t know.

00:07:13.483 --> 00:07:18.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what we do know is
that Jehovah inspired Luke

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to record and to document
her life in His Word

00:07:22.391 --> 00:07:26.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we could be taught lessons.

00:07:26.028 --> 00:07:29.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here we are some 2,000 years later,

00:07:29.665 --> 00:07:32.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we are using her life as an example

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:36.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of commitment and unbreakable integrity

00:07:36.405 --> 00:07:38.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you students to imitate.

00:07:39.842 --> 00:07:43.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what can you learn from Anna’s example?

00:07:45.681 --> 00:07:49.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may suffer loss of one kind or another.

00:07:49.285 --> 00:07:53.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will come face-to-face
with the imperfections of others.

00:07:53.456 --> 00:07:55.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your feelings may get hurt,

00:07:55.992 --> 00:07:59.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might find yourself coping
with an unexpected change

00:07:59.262 --> 00:08:02.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your life that is not pleasant,

00:08:02.165 --> 00:08:05.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or you may feel that you’re a victim

00:08:05.034 --> 00:08:08.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of an injustice or a serious misunderstanding

00:08:08.137 --> 00:08:10.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from within the organization.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will you do?

00:08:13.142 --> 00:08:15.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what you will do.

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:18.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will cling to Jehovah,

00:08:18.147 --> 00:08:21.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will experience him
holding on to you.

00:08:21.083 --> 00:08:22.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You cling to him.

00:08:22.785 --> 00:08:25.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He holds on to you.

00:08:25.354 --> 00:08:27.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:31.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I recall a time when a brother
serving in a foreign field

00:08:31.127 --> 00:08:36.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of a misunderstanding
lost his privileges as an elder.

00:08:36.132 --> 00:08:38.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he felt the decision was unfair.

00:08:38.501 --> 00:08:40.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was deeply hurt.

00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:44.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But his wife— He and his wife
never stopped clinging to Jehovah

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:48.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their spiritual routine.

00:08:48.044 --> 00:08:50.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then at a regional convention,

00:08:50.046 --> 00:08:52.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a brother approached him
and thanked him for the talk

00:08:52.815 --> 00:08:55.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he gave on the program.

00:08:55.751 --> 00:08:58.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he volunteered
in the cleaning department,

00:08:58.654 --> 00:09:01.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he hadn’t given a talk.

00:09:01.357 --> 00:09:04.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then the brother
now said to this former elder:

00:09:04.694 --> 00:09:08.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When I see your smile and positive attitude,

00:09:08.297 --> 00:09:10.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“yes, you gave a talk.

00:09:10.766 --> 00:09:12.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And it was on loyalty,

00:09:12.835 --> 00:09:16.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was loud and clear.”

00:09:16.872 --> 00:09:19.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the former elder now relates this:

00:09:19.408 --> 00:09:22.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The experience taught me and my wife

00:09:22.478 --> 00:09:24.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that every challenge or misfortune

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“does not need to represent a threat

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:30.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to our spiritual well-being.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We’ve come to view rejection, failure,

00:09:33.155 --> 00:09:36.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or being misunderstood as normal episodes

00:09:36.726 --> 00:09:40.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the lives of competent, healthy people.

00:09:40.263 --> 00:09:44.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of being crushed, we grew.”

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:48.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, the couple looked
beyond their hardships,

00:09:48.738 --> 00:09:50.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they clung to Jehovah.

00:09:50.906 --> 00:09:52.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:09:52.942 --> 00:09:56.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By imitating Anna.

00:09:56.145 --> 00:10:00.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were ‘never missing from true worship

00:10:00.716 --> 00:10:03.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘[in the right place],

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:06.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘rendering sacred service day and night

00:10:06.789 --> 00:10:09.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘[doing the right thing]

00:10:09.492 --> 00:10:11.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with fasting and supplications.’

00:10:11.694 --> 00:10:15.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And sometimes
those supplications involve tears

00:10:15.831 --> 00:10:18.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but with the right attitude.

00:10:18.701 --> 00:10:23.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah held on to them and never let go.

00:10:23.673 --> 00:10:27.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brother is still serving
in the foreign field.

00:10:27.176 --> 00:10:29.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is an elder again

00:10:29.178 --> 00:10:32.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and giving memorable talks.

00:10:34.617 --> 00:10:38.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we want you
to remember from this talk?

00:10:40.356 --> 00:10:43.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want you to remember this:

00:10:43.292 --> 00:10:48.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you come face-to-face with future trials
(and you will)

00:10:48.197 --> 00:10:52.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or challenges in your life
(and you will, this is what happens in life),

00:10:56.539 --> 00:10:59.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be in the right place,

00:10:59.241 --> 00:11:01.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do the right thing

00:11:01.844 --> 00:11:04.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the right attitude.

00:11:04.313 --> 00:11:07.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By doing this, you declare:

00:11:07.249 --> 00:11:10.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah, I cling to you,

00:11:10.219 --> 00:11:13.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I trust you to hold on to me.”

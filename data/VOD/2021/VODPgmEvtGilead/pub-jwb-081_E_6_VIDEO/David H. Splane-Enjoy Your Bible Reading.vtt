00:00:01.451 --> 00:00:04.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible is a wonderful book.

00:00:04.888 --> 00:00:08.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a book
that we should just enjoy reading.

00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:12.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for this talk, I thought I’d give
a couple of suggestions

00:00:12.295 --> 00:00:14.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for adding to our reading pleasure.

00:00:14.864 --> 00:00:16.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s the first:

00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:20.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t pass quickly over the details.

00:00:20.737 --> 00:00:23.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stop and investigate,

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at times you’ll be very glad you did.

00:00:26.643 --> 00:00:28.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s take an example.

00:00:28.645 --> 00:00:30.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re reading in the book of 1 Chronicles.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there are
a lot of names in 1 Chronicles,

00:00:33.883 --> 00:00:36.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you come across the name Heman.

00:00:36.653 --> 00:00:39.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you are just interested
in covering material,

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’d probably pass over it
and go on to the next verse.

00:00:42.358 --> 00:00:44.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you’re not in a rush,

00:00:44.427 --> 00:00:47.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you notice
a cross reference beside the name.

00:00:47.063 --> 00:00:50.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It refers you to 1 Chronicles 6:33.

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:54.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you decide to investigate,
and in doing so,

00:00:54.337 --> 00:00:57.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you learn something
heartwarming about Jehovah.

00:00:57.173 --> 00:00:58.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s do that.

00:00:58.775 --> 00:01:03.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 Chronicles chapter 6
(I’ll give you a moment)

00:01:03.113 --> 00:01:05.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 33,

00:01:07.083 --> 00:01:09.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says:

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“These are the men
who served with their sons:

00:01:12.756 --> 00:01:16.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Of the Kohathites, Heman the singer,

00:01:16.626 --> 00:01:21.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
son of Joel son of Samuel.”

00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:26.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this Heman was Samuel’s grandson.

00:01:26.302 --> 00:01:29.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what do we know
about his family’s situation?

00:01:29.873 --> 00:01:34.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, his father, Joel,
and his uncle, Abijah, were judges.

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:36.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they had a terrible reputation.

00:01:36.746 --> 00:01:39.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’d rule in your favor
if you could pay enough.

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:41.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you were poor, forget it.

00:01:41.718 --> 00:01:44.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the whole country knew about it.

00:01:44.988 --> 00:01:47.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At one point, the Bible says

00:01:47.423 --> 00:01:50.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “all the elders
of Israel . . . came to Samuel”

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and said they didn’t want
Joel and Abijah as judges anymore.

00:01:55.398 --> 00:01:58.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They wanted a king;

00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:00.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was furious.

00:02:00.837 --> 00:02:05.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And He couldn’t have been too happy
with Joel and Abijah either.

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:09.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, can you imagine the effect
that this corruption had

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the reputation
of Heman’s family? the shame?

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But like Hezekiah,

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:20.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Heman didn’t allow
his father’s bad example to paralyze him.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Heman developed
his own personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:02:24.794 --> 00:02:26.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we know?

00:02:26.796 --> 00:02:28.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We followed a few clues.

00:02:28.932 --> 00:02:30.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We followed a few cross references,

00:02:30.934 --> 00:02:34.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we came to 1 Chronicles 25:5.

00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:36.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s do that.

00:02:36.272 --> 00:02:40.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Chronicles 25:5

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, again, we’re trying to find
something more about Heman.

00:02:44.914 --> 00:02:49.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “All of these were sons of Heman,

00:02:49.052 --> 00:02:54.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a visionary of the king in matters
pertaining to the true God to his glory;

00:02:54.057 --> 00:02:57.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“thus the true God gave Heman

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
14 sons and 3 daughters.”

00:03:00.396 --> 00:03:02.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see it?

00:03:02.398 --> 00:03:04.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A visionary of the king.”

00:03:04.634 --> 00:03:06.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was a visionary?

00:03:06.636 --> 00:03:08.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a kind of prophet.

00:03:08.338 --> 00:03:10.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s see.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Samuel was a prophet,
and now Heman was a prophet.

00:03:15.345 --> 00:03:17.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see what’s heartwarming?

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:21.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was dealing with Heman
in much the same way

00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:23.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he had dealt with his grandfather.

00:03:23.987 --> 00:03:26.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah does not hold the sins

00:03:26.823 --> 00:03:29.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the fathers against the sons.

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is something very,
very nice to remember.

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:37.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And can you see where this example
would help some people you know?

00:03:37.433 --> 00:03:41.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some even in full-time service
have a hard time with it

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:44.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they had a rough family background

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:47.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they may feel that they’re worthless.

00:03:47.377 --> 00:03:49.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mary is a case in point.

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m going to call her Mary.

00:03:51.114 --> 00:03:54.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Mary’s father was so violent

00:03:54.083 --> 00:03:57.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that at times Mary, her mom, and her siblings

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had to get up in the middle of the night
and run for their lives.

00:04:00.757 --> 00:04:04.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to the neighbors,
they were “that” family.

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:07.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To make it worse, they were poor.

00:04:07.397 --> 00:04:10.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So all this made Mary feel worthless

00:04:10.733 --> 00:04:12.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—until—

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:16.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until the day when she started studying
with the Witnesses.

00:04:16.806 --> 00:04:19.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She developed
her own relationship with Jehovah,

00:04:19.976 --> 00:04:23.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she accepted him as her Father.

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:26.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And today, Mary is a pioneer.

00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:28.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does she feel about her life?

00:04:28.017 --> 00:04:30.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s what she wrote:

00:04:30.053 --> 00:04:34.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah is constantly looking for those
who want a friendship with him.”

00:04:34.724 --> 00:04:36.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here’s a touching point:

00:04:36.726 --> 00:04:40.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He’s even looking
into the hearts of children.”

00:04:40.496 --> 00:04:42.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that nice?

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:44.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there are two lessons here.

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:46.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Heman’s example shows,

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:50.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our family background
doesn’t define who we are.

00:04:50.006 --> 00:04:53.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will deal with us as individuals.

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:57.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And a second example,
one for the elders, is be like Jehovah.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Treat each member
of the family as an individual.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t lump them all in together.

00:05:03.586 --> 00:05:05.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now to our second point:

00:05:05.855 --> 00:05:08.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can make our Bible reading more enjoyable

00:05:08.624 --> 00:05:10.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we try to fill in the blanks.

00:05:10.626 --> 00:05:12.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s something
that our Bible dramas do.

00:05:12.628 --> 00:05:14.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They fill in the blanks for us.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s illustrate:
Let’s consider the example

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Queen Esther and the king’s son.

00:05:21.371 --> 00:05:23.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you remember the story.

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:27.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King Ahasuerus,
who is understood to be Xerxes I,

00:05:27.477 --> 00:05:31.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was displeased with Queen Vashti,
and he decided he was going to replace her.

00:05:31.981 --> 00:05:36.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So a call went out
into the whole Persian Empire

00:05:36.552 --> 00:05:40.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the most beautiful women
to be brought to the palace,

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:42.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Esther was among them.

00:05:42.925 --> 00:05:46.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the women were placed
under the care of a man named Hegai,

00:05:46.863 --> 00:05:50.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his job was
to get them ready to meet the king.

00:05:50.666 --> 00:05:54.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when we read Esther 2:9,

00:05:54.937 --> 00:05:57.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we smell trouble.

00:05:57.106 --> 00:06:00.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read it,
and you see if you can figure out

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:03.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what trouble is looming here

00:06:03.246 --> 00:06:06.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Esther 2:9.

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:08.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, we’re trying to fill in the blanks.

00:06:08.951 --> 00:06:10.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re trying to imagine.

00:06:10.987 --> 00:06:13.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now the young woman [Esther]

00:06:13.156 --> 00:06:16.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“was pleasing to him [Hegai]

00:06:16.392 --> 00:06:19.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and won his favor.”

00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:22.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is a competition.

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:25.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep that in mind.
This is a competition.

00:06:25.134 --> 00:06:27.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So he promptly arranged

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for her beauty treatments
and her [her] diet.”

00:06:30.106 --> 00:06:31.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait a minute.

00:06:31.774 --> 00:06:34.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s another detail
we’ll have to pursue sometime.

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Esther was Jewish.

00:06:35.978 --> 00:06:38.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was trying to hide the fact
that she was Jewish,

00:06:38.448 --> 00:06:40.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there were so many things
the Jews couldn’t eat.

00:06:40.683 --> 00:06:42.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did she handle that?

00:06:42.018 --> 00:06:43.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s for another day.

00:06:43.352 --> 00:06:44.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s carry on.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And talking about Hegai, it says:

00:06:46.522 --> 00:06:51.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He assigned to her seven selected
young women from the king’s house.

00:06:51.427 --> 00:06:54.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He also transferred her

00:06:54.764 --> 00:06:59.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and her young attendants
to the best place in the house of the women.”

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:01.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you smell trouble?

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:03.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see the problem?

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:05.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Preferential treatment.

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:07.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a competition.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s probably a lot of jealousy
going on among the candidates.

00:07:11.147 --> 00:07:13.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now Hegai
is doing everything in his power

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:16.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help Esther to win the king’s heart.

00:07:16.752 --> 00:07:18.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you suppose that went down?

00:07:18.788 --> 00:07:21.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could have led to big trouble.

00:07:21.124 --> 00:07:23.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here’s another factor.

00:07:23.126 --> 00:07:25.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about the king’s wives?

00:07:25.128 --> 00:07:29.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there was only one queen,
but Ahasuerus had many wives.

00:07:29.198 --> 00:07:32.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some say he had 330 wives.

00:07:32.235 --> 00:07:35.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when Vashti was deposed,

00:07:35.438 --> 00:07:39.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who do you suppose
expected to become the queen?

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:41.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The number two wife.

00:07:41.911 --> 00:07:45.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, instead of going
into the harem and choosing someone,

00:07:45.248 --> 00:07:49.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they went outside the palace
—even to women who didn’t have royal blood.

00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:52.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you suppose that went down?

00:07:52.788 --> 00:07:55.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now think about this:

00:07:55.124 --> 00:07:58.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some scholars believe that although Vashti

00:07:58.694 --> 00:08:02.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was deposed as queen,
she didn’t leave the palace.

00:08:02.064 --> 00:08:04.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She just couldn’t ever see the king again.

00:08:04.967 --> 00:08:08.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If she was still there,
as some scholars believe,

00:08:08.371 --> 00:08:10.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was she plotting in the background?

00:08:10.973 --> 00:08:15.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This could have been
a very difficult situation.

00:08:15.278 --> 00:08:20.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Esther 2:15 tells us
something very interesting about Esther.

00:08:20.283 --> 00:08:23.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to read just the end of verse 15

00:08:23.819 --> 00:08:27.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Esther chapter 2, at the end of verse 15.

00:08:27.557 --> 00:08:29.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “All the while

00:08:29.559 --> 00:08:31.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Esther was winning the favor

00:08:31.961 --> 00:08:35.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of everyone who saw her.”

00:08:35.331 --> 00:08:38.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Esther avoided the land mines.

00:08:38.501 --> 00:08:39.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that tell us?

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:41.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was not only a very beautiful woman,

00:08:41.971 --> 00:08:44.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she had a beautiful godly personality

00:08:44.974 --> 00:08:47.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a winning personality.

00:08:47.443 --> 00:08:51.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we said this was
about Esther and the king’s son.

00:08:51.681 --> 00:08:55.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who is the king’s son—the heir?

00:08:55.051 --> 00:08:58.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we met him
at the convention this past summer.

00:08:58.187 --> 00:09:01.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was the man
who was so nice to Nehemiah

00:09:01.257 --> 00:09:03.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Artaxerxes.

00:09:03.292 --> 00:09:05.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if the historians
have their facts straight,

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:09.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Artaxerxes would have been
only three years old

00:09:09.131 --> 00:09:12.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Esther married his father.

00:09:12.535 --> 00:09:16.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, history tells us
that as kings of Persia go,

00:09:16.906 --> 00:09:19.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Artaxerxes had a very nice personality.

00:09:19.875 --> 00:09:22.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was mild, peaceable, kind

00:09:22.078 --> 00:09:25.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so unlike his father,
who had a terrible temper.

00:09:25.514 --> 00:09:29.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to ask,
Did Esther have anything to do

00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:32.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the pleasant disposition of Artaxerxes?

00:09:32.722 --> 00:09:34.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe she did.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:35.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who knows?

00:09:35.891 --> 00:09:37.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re using our imagination.

00:09:37.927 --> 00:09:40.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re trying to fill in the blanks.

00:09:40.463 --> 00:09:43.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we haven’t discussed
anything earthshaking here,

00:09:43.499 --> 00:09:45.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that isn’t the point of this talk.

00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:50.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you investigate the details
and fill in the blanks,

00:09:50.673 --> 00:09:54.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’ll contribute to the pleasure you derive
from reading the Bible.

00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:58.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if Bible reading
is a pleasant experience for you,

00:09:58.281 --> 00:10:01.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll have no trouble
to arrange a schedule

00:10:01.584 --> 00:10:04.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of daily Bible reading.

00:10:04.253 --> 00:10:06.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enjoy!

00:00:01 I’m going to go back many decades ago
00:00:06 —Monday, March 6, 1972.
00:00:11 Now, some of you in the class weren’t alive.
00:00:16 I think I know of one for sure who was alive.
00:00:20 That’s an inside joke, not Inside Story
00:00:26 —but anyway.
00:00:28 And along with my wife, we had the privilege
00:00:32 (and that was rare unless you were a Bethelite)
00:00:35 to attend the graduation
00:00:37 of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.
00:00:39 That was the 52nd class.
00:00:42 So we’re in the Assembly Hall
00:00:45 (jam packed there in New York City)
00:00:48 and just enjoying it.
00:00:51 What a privilege for us to sit there
00:00:55 and enjoy that program of the 52nd class!
00:00:58 Now here we are almost 100 (just two shy) classes later
00:01:03 —the 150th class.
00:01:06 And now we’re grateful
00:01:08 because many are tied in live as we speak.
00:01:13 But then the rest of the brotherhood
00:01:15 is going to have it available in a few months.
00:01:19 So boy, things have changed, and they enjoy that privilege.
00:01:22 But that was a rare privilege.
00:01:24 And I remember Brother Knorr was the chairman
00:01:28 of the program.
00:01:30 And certainly, he just loved Gilead.
00:01:34 I mean, that you’ve got to give him.
00:01:37 Of course, Jehovah used him mightily to get it all started there
00:01:41 —1943 was the first one.
00:01:43 But knowing that the beast was coming out,
00:01:48 Jehovah blessed them and said, ‘Yeah, we need a missionary school.’
00:01:52 There was a missionary school for years.
00:01:55 But anyway, the thing I wanted to mention is that I remember an outstanding talk.
00:01:59 I had heard Brother Fred Franz the summer before
00:02:03 at the Yankee Stadium convention,
00:02:06 but we were a little closer there in the Assembly Hall.
00:02:09 And I’ll tell you what; I was just glued to him.
00:02:12 If you had the privilege to hear him, Jehovah blessed—
00:02:15 He had a blessed, beautiful mind.
00:02:18 He could just quote these scriptures.
00:02:21 And I’ve told folks:
00:02:22 “Now, if you don’t pay attention and stay with him,
00:02:26 “you’re going to get lost.
00:02:28 He’s going to lose you.”
00:02:29 But if you paid attention, it was thrilling
00:02:32 just to hear him pour out his heart
00:02:34 because it was all written on his figurative heart.
00:02:37 But he discussed Ecclesiastes 5.
00:02:40 That’s why I was thinking of bringing it up for your class here.
00:02:44 Because this is really directed to you.
00:02:46 And he spoke there about vows.
00:02:49 In those first seven verses, dreams are mentioned.
00:02:53 And I appreciate it because it just struck me when he mentioned it.
00:02:58 The dreams don’t refer to dreams one has while they’re sleeping
00:03:03 because of the busy day.
00:03:05 Now, you can’t get that on your own
00:03:08 by just reading Ecclesiastes with whatever version you have.
00:03:12 It had to do with getting sidetracked
00:03:16 with personal pursuits.
00:03:18 These dreams —these are the things they’re doing.
00:03:21 And that would be “vanity” (as we’d said then).
00:03:26 So let’s just take a moment
00:03:28 (you here in the class and others who want to follow along in Ecclesiastes 5)
00:03:33 and just touch on some of the nice things.
00:03:35 And, of course, you could—
00:03:37 Now, don’t do it right now, but you can do it later.
00:03:40 You have access to the Research Guide
00:03:43 —an in-depth understanding
00:03:46 of this wisdom in Ecclesiastes.
00:03:49 And Brother Franz addressed it.
00:03:52 For example, verse 1 says: “Watch your step.”
00:03:56 So this is for you soon-to-be graduates.
00:04:00 Jehovah is saying: “Watch your step.”
00:04:02 Don’t stop doing that.
00:04:04 You have thus far, so continue to “watch your step.”
00:04:09 And he mentions those morally “stupid ones.”
00:04:13 That’s not you.
00:04:15 You can avoid that.
00:04:17 And then I love this in verse 2:
00:04:20 “Do not be quick with your mouth.”
00:04:24 Boy, there are a lot of people in the world who could benefit from that counsel.
00:04:28 Isn’t that true?
00:04:30 It’s like: ‘Does he or she ever shut up?
00:04:34 ‘I mean, they must— I bet you they talk in their sleep.
00:04:38 They just won’t shut up.’
00:04:40 Then, anyway, ‘don’t be quick with your mouth,’
00:04:42 particularly in context here
00:04:45 when you’re speaking to Jehovah.
00:04:48 Boy, those are some good things to keep in mind,
00:04:50 especially for you brothers who will speak in public.
00:04:52 But you sisters too, when it’s personal with your prayers to Jehovah,
00:04:57 don’t be quick with your mouth
00:04:59 when you approach the Sovereign of the universe.
00:05:02 Your words should be few.
00:05:04 You do not impress God with vocabulary.
00:05:09 He’s impressed with sincerity of heart.
00:05:13 He loves those who love him.
00:05:18 And in all different languages, he treasures those prayers.
00:05:22 And then he mentions this:
00:05:23 “A dream comes from too many preoccupations.”
00:05:27 In the revised Bible here, it says “too many cares.”
00:05:31 So this idea isn’t just dreams from a busy, busy day.
00:05:36 This preoccupation with self
00:05:39 is being warned against here.
00:05:42 Don’t do it. See, do not do it.
00:05:45 Don’t be preoccupied with yourself.
00:05:49 And for those who are, there are many words from them.
00:05:53 But be careful, you know.
00:05:56 You have the privilege now; you’ll be praying more in public
00:06:00 —probably more than you ever have before.
00:06:03 You get privileges, you know.
00:06:05 And when you’re praying to Jehovah, sometimes—
00:06:10 We don’t want to be counseling or criticizing prayers.
00:06:13 We try to be careful of that.
00:06:14 But sometimes you even hear a prayer at Bethel, and it’s like:
00:06:18 ‘OK. We’re trying to eat breakfast here.’
00:06:25 And I’ve told folks that it’s like, you know, I just can’t help but—
00:06:30 Jesus is there, the most eloquent person to walk the planet,
00:06:34 and the meal comes.
00:06:37 He ‘raised his eyes to heaven’ and “gave thanks.”
00:06:41 “Amen.
00:06:45 Let’s eat.”
00:06:47 I mean, there are other times you want to pour out your heart and all that,
00:06:50 but you’re not praying to the audience.
00:06:54 You’re talking to the Sovereign of the universe.
00:06:57 The counsel is, you know—
00:06:59 “Now I’m a Gilead graduate
00:07:01 (you brothers particularly), so I’m going to have longer prayers.”
00:07:04 I hope not.
00:07:07 I sure hope not unless they’re private.
00:07:10 But then he gets into something crucial,
00:07:14 and it’s just so important to keep in mind verse 4.
00:07:19 Let’s read verses 4 and 5:
00:07:22 “Whenever you make a vow to God,
00:07:25 “do not delay to pay it,
00:07:28 for he finds no pleasure in the stupid ones [morally stupid].”
00:07:32 Then it’s very clear:
00:07:34 “What you vow, pay.”
00:07:37 “What you vow, pay.”
00:07:39 And then: “[It’s] better for you not to vow
00:07:43 than to vow and not pay.”
00:07:46 So this is serious counsel,
00:07:48 and the warning is, Don’t allow your mouth to cause you to sin.
00:07:53 So when it comes to vows (and some of you are married),
00:07:58 well, you have the vow.
00:08:00 You always have to hold on to that.
00:08:03 It’s not a light matter with Jehovah God.
00:08:06 And any other vows—be careful.
00:08:09 If you’re going to make a vow, it’s between you and him.
00:08:12 But see, notice here:
00:08:15 “Do not allow [in verse 6] your mouth to cause you to sin,
00:08:19 “and do not say before the angel
00:08:22 “[see, think about this]
00:08:25 that it was a mistake.”
00:08:27 So Jehovah has the angels doing all sorts of things.
00:08:31 We don’t even begin to know the things
00:08:33 that are always going on all the time
00:08:35 with Jehovah’s servants and his holy angels.
00:08:39 It’s priceless.
00:08:40 But see, angels are, according to this,
00:08:44 assigned to check on these things.
00:08:46 So you don’t say to the angel:
00:08:49 “Why, look, I made a mistake. Forgive me.”
00:08:53 Uh-uh.
00:08:55 You made a vow.
00:08:57 But see, it shouldn’t be because an angel is going to check
00:09:01 that that’s Jehovah’s direction.
00:09:03 It should be because of our love for Jehovah.
00:09:09 When you make a vow (you know, whether it was marriage or whatever),
00:09:13 it’s your love for Jehovah —that’s what cements the vow.
00:09:18 It matters.
00:09:20 See, it matters to him.
00:09:24 So then finally, in verse 7:
00:09:28 “For just as many preoccupations lead to dreams,
00:09:32 so, too, many words lead to futility.”
00:09:36 So it’s good counsel.
00:09:38 You are so filled
00:09:42 with the Word of God.
00:09:44 This is a special class,
00:09:46 and Gilead is a special school.
00:09:50 We have other schools, SKE; I’ll mention something later about that.
00:09:55 But this is unique
00:09:57 —to have men whom Jehovah has appointed to instruct.
00:10:01 The Teaching Committee selects them
00:10:04 —totally whole-souled and devoted to Jehovah God—
00:10:09 to teach you during the class.
00:10:11 And you’re going over all these things in the Word of God.
00:10:14 And so it’s all in there,
00:10:17 and it’s just special.
00:10:20 So you thank Jehovah that you have this education,
00:10:24 and you’re going to move forward to glorify him.
00:10:30 And that’s pretty similar to what is mentioned here
00:10:35 in the last sentence in verse 7:
00:10:38 “But fear the true God.”
00:10:42 So you soon-to-be graduates,
00:10:44 keep those words in your heart.
00:10:48 Just “fear the true God” in the days ahead,
00:10:51 and stay away from these kind of dreams
00:10:56 about self-preoccupation, you know?
00:11:01 Mm-mm. No, not for you.
00:11:06 Otherwise, your education was futile,
00:11:10 not good.
00:11:12 And I don’t see that in any of you (and I’m not implying).
00:11:15 But it’s such wise counsel
00:11:18 from Jehovah God in his Word.
00:11:21 So there’s much, much more there.
00:11:23 Enjoy thinking about it
00:11:26 with a little tool we have there, the Research Guide.

At Luke 6:40, Jesus said:

00:00:07.057 --> 00:00:10.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A student is not above his teacher,

00:00:10.994 --> 00:00:14.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but everyone who is perfectly instructed

00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:18.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be like his teacher.”

00:00:18.201 --> 00:00:21.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, what comes to your mind
when you think about this verse?

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:24.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you tend to think of it in terms

00:00:24.374 --> 00:00:27.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of when you conduct
a Bible study with someone.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or you might think about it

00:00:29.012 --> 00:00:32.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you go to a program like Gilead

00:00:32.415 --> 00:00:34.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’re instructed there.

00:00:34.584 --> 00:00:36.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in reality,

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:41.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are all teachers every day

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:45.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the classroom of Christian living.

00:00:45.595 --> 00:00:48.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we have responsibilities,

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:51.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we enjoy certain privileges,

00:00:51.067 --> 00:00:55.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers and sisters will watch us.

00:00:55.705 --> 00:00:59.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And those who work closely with us

00:00:59.042 --> 00:01:01.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will learn from us.

00:01:01.077 --> 00:01:06.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they will become like us.

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take the example of the apostle Paul.

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:13.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we know Paul
was an outstanding teacher.

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:14.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine?

00:01:14.357 --> 00:01:19.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Under inspiration,
he had the privilege to write 14 books

00:01:19.062 --> 00:01:21.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:01:21.531 --> 00:01:25.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, that was not the only way

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:27.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the apostle Paul taught others.

00:01:27.704 --> 00:01:31.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His example in Christian living

00:01:31.274 --> 00:01:33.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was very powerful.

00:01:33.443 --> 00:01:37.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what could people learn
from the example of Paul?

00:01:37.313 --> 00:01:39.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider some examples.

00:01:39.315 --> 00:01:44.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go first to 1 Thessalonians chapter 2,

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
1 Thessalonians chapter 2,

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s look at verse 7:

00:01:50.426 --> 00:01:55.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On the contrary,
we became gentle in your midst,

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:59.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as when a nursing mother
tenderly cares for her own children.

00:01:59.402 --> 00:02:02.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So having tender affection for you,

00:02:02.806 --> 00:02:05.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we were determined to impart to you,

00:02:05.008 --> 00:02:07.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not only the good news of God

00:02:07.644 --> 00:02:11.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but also our very selves,

00:02:11.247 --> 00:02:16.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you became so beloved to us.”

00:02:16.252 --> 00:02:19.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul worked hard for the brothers.

00:02:19.823 --> 00:02:21.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was kind.

00:02:21.257 --> 00:02:22.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was gentle with them.

00:02:22.692 --> 00:02:27.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was willing to give
not just the message of the truth but,

00:02:27.363 --> 00:02:32.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he says in verse 8, “our very selves.”

00:02:32.202 --> 00:02:36.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And brothers, that was the truth.

00:02:36.973 --> 00:02:41.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul said he was willing to do “all things

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the sake of the good news.”

00:02:43.146 --> 00:02:45.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just consider
some of the things that he did.

00:02:45.782 --> 00:02:48.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go to 2 Corinthians chapter 11

00:02:48.952 --> 00:02:53.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just remind ourselves of some
of the things Paul went through.

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:58.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Corinthians 11:23

00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:01.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Paul says:
“Are they ministers of Christ?

00:03:01.231 --> 00:03:05.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I reply like a madman,
I am more outstandingly one:

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:08.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have done more work,
been imprisoned more often,

00:03:08.872 --> 00:03:13.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“suffered countless beatings,
and experienced many near-deaths.

00:03:13.142 --> 00:03:17.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Five times I received
40 strokes less one from the Jews,

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:20.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“three times I was beaten with rods,

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“once I was stoned,
three times I experienced shipwreck,

00:03:24.787 --> 00:03:28.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a night and a day
I have spent in the open sea.”

00:03:28.324 --> 00:03:32.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the list just goes on.

00:03:32.362 --> 00:03:36.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What could these ones

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who worked with Paul learn from him?

00:03:39.802 --> 00:03:43.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, how did
Paul’s powerful example

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of love for God,

00:03:45.241 --> 00:03:48.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of endurance, of hard work,

00:03:48.044 --> 00:03:50.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and of true unselfishness

00:03:50.413 --> 00:03:53.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
affect those around him?

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, consider Timothy,
who worked so closely with Paul.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did Paul say about him?

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:04.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go to Philippians chapter 2

00:04:04.427 --> 00:04:09.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Philippians 2:20.

00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:12.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul said: “For I have no one else

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:15.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of a disposition like his

00:04:15.038 --> 00:04:18.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who will genuinely care for your concerns.

00:04:18.474 --> 00:04:21.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For all the others
are seeking their own interests,

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not those of Jesus Christ.

00:04:23.813 --> 00:04:27.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But you know the proof he gave of himself,

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that like a child with a father

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:33.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he slaved with me
to advance the good news.”

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, here’s a question:

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:39.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why was Timothy that way?

00:04:39.062 --> 00:04:41.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why was Timothy so unselfish?

00:04:41.998 --> 00:04:46.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did he work so hard for other people?

00:04:46.102 --> 00:04:50.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, no doubt, he was “perfectly instructed”

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just by the words

00:04:52.742 --> 00:04:56.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but by the example of Paul.

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the same thing
could be true of Priscilla and Aquila.

00:04:59.615 --> 00:05:04.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul said about them
that they had risked their necks for him.

00:05:05.355 --> 00:05:08.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, where did they learn that from?

00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:10.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, we could go on
with other examples

00:05:10.827 --> 00:05:15.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of other close associates of Paul,
but what is the point?

00:05:15.131 --> 00:05:18.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul’s example in Christian living

00:05:18.334 --> 00:05:20.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
instructed those around him.

00:05:20.937 --> 00:05:23.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They became like Paul.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why is that important to you
who are graduating today

00:05:28.911 --> 00:05:32.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead?

00:05:32.281 --> 00:05:36.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, very soon you’re going to be graduates,

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:39.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your mandate is to go forth

00:05:39.122 --> 00:05:41.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and strengthen and stabilize

00:05:41.891 --> 00:05:44.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the field and branch territory.

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:47.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, that’s a big long term, isn’t it?

00:05:47.397 --> 00:05:51.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the field and branch territory?

00:05:51.234 --> 00:05:53.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s people.

00:05:53.236 --> 00:05:57.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s people
—spiritual men and women

00:05:57.006 --> 00:05:59.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who want to learn,

00:05:59.942 --> 00:06:02.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who want to be trained,

00:06:02.245 --> 00:06:06.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who want to reach the spiritual goals
that they’ve set for themselves,

00:06:06.883 --> 00:06:10.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who want to grow to Christian maturity.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because you are a Gilead graduate,

00:06:14.857 --> 00:06:19.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will watch you, they will listen to you,

00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:24.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will be instructed by your example.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I went to serve many years ago

00:06:27.003 --> 00:06:30.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the need was great
on the island of Newfoundland,

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were so blessed
to have in our congregation

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a graduate of the 7th class of Gilead,
Brother Fred Wiens.

00:06:38.881 --> 00:06:42.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Wiens was an anointed brother
who was baptized

00:06:42.685 --> 00:06:45.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 1928.

00:06:45.054 --> 00:06:47.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I’ll be honest with you;

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t remember even one talk
that Fred Wiens gave.

00:06:52.295 --> 00:06:56.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But his warmth, his sense of humor,

00:06:56.466 --> 00:07:00.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his zeal for the ministry,
and his love for people

00:07:00.303 --> 00:07:02.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the example that he set—

00:07:02.972 --> 00:07:05.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is truly unforgettable.

00:07:05.808 --> 00:07:07.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fred talked to everyone

00:07:07.777 --> 00:07:10.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and I mean everyone—
in the ministry.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One time we were out in service;
we pulled into the gas station.

00:07:15.384 --> 00:07:18.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As soon as we stopped the car,
Fred jumped out.

00:07:18.221 --> 00:07:20.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we were ready to leave,

00:07:20.356 --> 00:07:22.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we looked around to try to find Fred.

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:25.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wasn’t in the store;
he wasn’t in the bathroom.

00:07:25.962 --> 00:07:27.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was nowhere to be seen.

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:30.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, we thought
we’d check the other cars.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s exactly where Fred was.

00:07:33.636 --> 00:07:36.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fred had knocked on the window
and gotten in a car

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:41.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and started to preach
to all the people in that car.

00:07:41.511 --> 00:07:45.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fred has now gone on to his reward.

00:07:45.214 --> 00:07:48.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But his example of warmth, kindness,

00:07:48.985 --> 00:07:53.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
zeal, and love for people
continue to teach me

00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:58.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and many others who knew him well—
right down to this day.

00:07:58.161 --> 00:08:02.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here is the question
that rests before you:

00:08:02.832 --> 00:08:07.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will you teach others by your example?

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be like Paul.

00:08:09.705 --> 00:08:13.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Love your brothers and sisters
right from your heart.

00:08:13.609 --> 00:08:15.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through your example,

00:08:15.711 --> 00:08:19.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
create an atmosphere of warmth and love

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:23.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like a greenhouse
where young plants

00:08:23.186 --> 00:08:25.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can blossom and grow.

00:08:25.888 --> 00:08:30.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your fine example
can warm up a congregation,

00:08:30.226 --> 00:08:35.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a circuit, a Bethel department,
perhaps even a branch office.

00:08:35.231 --> 00:08:38.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never allow yourself

00:08:38.267 --> 00:08:41.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be a cold executive

00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:46.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who creates an atmosphere like a freezer,

00:08:46.676 --> 00:08:49.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because those little plants

00:08:49.712 --> 00:08:51.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will shrivel up

00:08:51.747 --> 00:08:55.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will stop growing
in that environment.

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:59.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, be willing to impart
not just the many wonderful truths

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:02.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of God’s Word that you learned at Gilead

00:09:02.425 --> 00:09:06.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also your own heart and your own soul.

00:09:06.362 --> 00:09:10.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then because those beautiful,
spiritual people you work with

00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:14.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be properly instructed,

00:09:14.203 --> 00:09:17.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what will they be like?

00:09:17.006 --> 00:09:20.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will be just like you.

00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:24.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And may the blessing
of our marvelous God, Jehovah,

00:09:24.046 --> 00:09:26.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
go with you wherever you go.

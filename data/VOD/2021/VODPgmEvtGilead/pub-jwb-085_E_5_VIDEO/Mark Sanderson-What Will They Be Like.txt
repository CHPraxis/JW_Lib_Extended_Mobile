00:00:02 At Luke 6:40, Jesus said:
00:00:07 “A student is not above his teacher,
00:00:10 “but everyone who is perfectly instructed
00:00:14 will be like his teacher.”
00:00:18 Well, now, what comes to your mind when you think about this verse?
00:00:21 Maybe you tend to think of it in terms
00:00:24 of when you conduct a Bible study with someone.
00:00:27 Or you might think about it
00:00:29 when you go to a program like Gilead
00:00:32 and you’re instructed there.
00:00:34 But in reality,
00:00:36 we are all teachers every day
00:00:41 in the classroom of Christian living.
00:00:45 If we have responsibilities,
00:00:48 if we enjoy certain privileges,
00:00:51 our brothers and sisters will watch us.
00:00:55 And those who work closely with us
00:00:59 will learn from us.
00:01:01 And they will become like us.
00:01:06 Take the example of the apostle Paul.
00:01:09 Now, we know Paul was an outstanding teacher.
00:01:13 Can you imagine?
00:01:14 Under inspiration, he had the privilege to write 14 books
00:01:19 of the Christian Greek Scriptures.
00:01:21 Yet, that was not the only way
00:01:25 that the apostle Paul taught others.
00:01:27 His example in Christian living
00:01:31 was very powerful.
00:01:33 Now, what could people learn from the example of Paul?
00:01:37 Let’s consider some examples.
00:01:39 Let’s go first to 1 Thessalonians chapter 2,
00:01:44 1 Thessalonians chapter 2,
00:01:47 and let’s look at verse 7:
00:01:50 “On the contrary, we became gentle in your midst,
00:01:55 “as when a nursing mother tenderly cares for her own children.
00:01:59 “So having tender affection for you,
00:02:02 “we were determined to impart to you,
00:02:05 “not only the good news of God
00:02:07 “but also our very selves,
00:02:11 because you became so beloved to us.”
00:02:16 Paul worked hard for the brothers.
00:02:19 He was kind.
00:02:21 He was gentle with them.
00:02:22 He was willing to give not just the message of the truth but,
00:02:27 as he says in verse 8, “our very selves.”
00:02:32 And brothers, that was the truth.
00:02:36 Paul said he was willing to do “all things
00:02:41 for the sake of the good news.”
00:02:43 And just consider some of the things that he did.
00:02:45 Let’s go to 2 Corinthians chapter 11
00:02:48 and just remind ourselves of some of the things Paul went through.
00:02:53 Second Corinthians 11:23
00:02:58 —Paul says: “Are they ministers of Christ?
00:03:01 “I reply like a madman, I am more outstandingly one:
00:03:05 “I have done more work, been imprisoned more often,
00:03:08 “suffered countless beatings, and experienced many near-deaths.
00:03:13 “Five times I received
40 strokes less one from the Jews,
00:03:17 “three times I was beaten with rods,
00:03:20 “once I was stoned, three times I experienced shipwreck,
00:03:24 a night and a day I have spent in the open sea.”
00:03:28 And the list just goes on.
00:03:32 What could these ones
00:03:36 who worked with Paul learn from him?
00:03:39 In other words, how did Paul’s powerful example
00:03:43 of love for God,
00:03:45 of endurance, of hard work,
00:03:48 and of true unselfishness
00:03:50 affect those around him?
00:03:53 Well, consider Timothy, who worked so closely with Paul.
00:03:57 What did Paul say about him?
00:03:59 Let’s go to Philippians chapter 2
00:04:04 —Philippians 2:20.
00:04:09 Paul said: “For I have no one else
00:04:12 “of a disposition like his
00:04:15 “who will genuinely care for your concerns.
00:04:18 “For all the others are seeking their own interests,
00:04:21 “not those of Jesus Christ.
00:04:23 “But you know the proof he gave of himself,
00:04:27 “that like a child with a father
00:04:29 he slaved with me to advance the good news.”
00:04:33 Well, now, here’s a question:
00:04:36 Why was Timothy that way?
00:04:39 Why was Timothy so unselfish?
00:04:41 Why did he work so hard for other people?
00:04:46 Well, no doubt, he was “perfectly instructed”
00:04:50 not just by the words
00:04:52 but by the example of Paul.
00:04:56 Well, the same thing could be true of Priscilla and Aquila.
00:04:59 Paul said about them that they had risked their necks for him.
00:05:05 Well, where did they learn that from?
00:05:08 You see, we could go on with other examples
00:05:10 of other close associates of Paul, but what is the point?
00:05:15 Paul’s example in Christian living
00:05:18 instructed those around him.
00:05:20 They became like Paul.
00:05:23 Now, why is that important to you who are graduating today
00:05:28 from the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead?
00:05:32 Well, very soon you’re going to be graduates,
00:05:36 and your mandate is to go forth
00:05:39 and strengthen and stabilize
00:05:41 the field and branch territory.
00:05:44 But now, that’s a big long term, isn’t it?
00:05:47 What is the field and branch territory?
00:05:51 It’s people.
00:05:53 It’s people —spiritual men and women
00:05:57 who want to learn,
00:05:59 who want to be trained,
00:06:02 who want to reach the spiritual goals that they’ve set for themselves,
00:06:06 and who want to grow to Christian maturity.
00:06:10 And because you are a Gilead graduate,
00:06:14 they will watch you, they will listen to you,
00:06:19 and they will be instructed by your example.
00:06:24 When I went to serve many years ago
00:06:27 where the need was great on the island of Newfoundland,
00:06:30 we were so blessed to have in our congregation
00:06:33 a graduate of the 7th class of Gilead, Brother Fred Wiens.
00:06:38 Brother Wiens was an anointed brother who was baptized
00:06:42 in 1928.
00:06:45 Now, I’ll be honest with you;
00:06:47 I don’t remember even one talk that Fred Wiens gave.
00:06:52 But his warmth, his sense of humor,
00:06:56 his zeal for the ministry, and his love for people
00:07:00 —the example that he set—
00:07:02 is truly unforgettable.
00:07:05 Fred talked to everyone
00:07:07 —and I mean everyone— in the ministry.
00:07:10 One time we were out in service; we pulled into the gas station.
00:07:15 As soon as we stopped the car, Fred jumped out.
00:07:18 And when we were ready to leave,
00:07:20 we looked around to try to find Fred.
00:07:22 He wasn’t in the store; he wasn’t in the bathroom.
00:07:25 He was nowhere to be seen.
00:07:27 Finally, we thought we’d check the other cars.
00:07:30 Well, that’s exactly where Fred was.
00:07:33 Fred had knocked on the window and gotten in a car
00:07:36 and started to preach to all the people in that car.
00:07:41 Fred has now gone on to his reward.
00:07:45 But his example of warmth, kindness,
00:07:48 zeal, and love for people continue to teach me
00:07:53 —and many others who knew him well— right down to this day.
00:07:58 So here is the question that rests before you:
00:08:02 What will you teach others by your example?
00:08:07 Be like Paul.
00:08:09 Love your brothers and sisters right from your heart.
00:08:13 Through your example,
00:08:15 create an atmosphere of warmth and love
00:08:19 like a greenhouse where young plants
00:08:23 can blossom and grow.
00:08:25 Your fine example can warm up a congregation,
00:08:30 a circuit, a Bethel department, perhaps even a branch office.
00:08:35 Never allow yourself
00:08:38 to be a cold executive
00:08:41 who creates an atmosphere like a freezer,
00:08:46 because those little plants
00:08:49 will shrivel up
00:08:51 and they will stop growing in that environment.
00:08:55 Yes, be willing to impart not just the many wonderful truths
00:08:59 of God’s Word that you learned at Gilead
00:09:02 but also your own heart and your own soul.
00:09:06 And then because those beautiful, spiritual people you work with
00:09:10 will be properly instructed,
00:09:14 what will they be like?
00:09:17 They will be just like you.
00:09:20 And may the blessing of our marvelous God, Jehovah,
00:09:24 go with you wherever you go.

Our bodies are made up of trillions of cells.

00:00:08.195 --> 00:00:11.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, each individual cell

00:00:11.031 --> 00:00:13.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a marvel of design and organization.

00:00:15.244 --> 00:00:17.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Inside our cells,

00:00:17.246 --> 00:00:21.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
biological processes signal specific proteins

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:23.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to assemble themselves into tracks

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
called microtubules.

00:00:27.464 --> 00:00:30.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tiny molecular machines called kinesins

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:32.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then transport various components

00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:34.972 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to different parts of the cell

00:00:34.972 --> 00:00:38.851 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by “walking” along the tracks.

00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:43.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From microscopic proteins

00:00:47.192 --> 00:00:49.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to enormous galaxies,

00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:53.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our organized universe abounds

00:00:53.782 --> 00:00:57.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with examples of elegant design.

00:01:03.417 --> 00:01:05.169 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
As a mechanical design educator,

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:06.795 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I view even natural things

00:01:06.795 --> 00:01:08.797 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from a design perspective.

00:01:08.797 --> 00:01:13.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mechanical design considers not only
the individual components of a machine

00:01:13.802 --> 00:01:16.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also how they interact.

00:01:16.513 --> 00:01:19.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From this viewpoint, human vision

00:01:19.183 --> 00:01:23.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a magnificent example of design.

00:01:24.188 --> 00:01:27.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a single eye,
the cornea, the iris, and the lens

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
interact to focus an image on the retina.

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:33.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The light-sensitive cells of the retina,
called photoreceptors,

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:35.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
produce nerve signals.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Signals from the rod and cone photoreceptors

00:01:38.744 --> 00:01:42.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are transmitted by the optic nerve
to the brain,

00:01:42.206 --> 00:01:45.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where they are processed
to produce a perceived image.

00:01:45.334 --> 00:01:47.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now just imagine

00:01:47.336 --> 00:01:49.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the multiplied complexity

00:01:49.713 --> 00:01:51.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when two eyes interact.

00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:55.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Particularly mind-boggling is

00:01:55.511 --> 00:02:00.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the amount of information
being constantly processed

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:03.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by more than 130 million retinal receptors

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:07.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then transmitted
through the 1.2 million nerve fibers

00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:09.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the optic nerve to the brain.

00:02:10.818 --> 00:02:13.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To me, the sheer complexity

00:02:13.195 --> 00:02:16.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how all these components
flawlessly interact

00:02:16.782 --> 00:02:19.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is evidence of a superior Designer.

00:02:20.828 --> 00:02:22.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some disagree.

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They propose that the eye evolved

00:02:24.957 --> 00:02:27.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a light-sensitive patch
in some ancestral creature

00:02:27.918 --> 00:02:30.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through small random changes.

00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:34.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I find the proposed process unrealistic.

00:02:34.675 --> 00:02:36.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unlike design,

00:02:36.677 --> 00:02:40.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is unplanned and without a goal.

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:43.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are asked to imagine that a complex system

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can develop without direction,

00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:50.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while in the natural world
things tend to become disorganized.

00:02:50.107 --> 00:02:53.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But consider something
even more mind-boggling:

00:02:53.318 --> 00:02:56.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The design of the eye,
the optic nerve, and the brain

00:02:56.905 --> 00:02:59.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how they function and interact

00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:02.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are completely documented in our DNA.

00:03:02.327 --> 00:03:06.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, our DNA
contains all the instructions

00:03:06.498 --> 00:03:09.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for building an entire human body.

00:03:09.543 --> 00:03:11.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While science relies

00:03:11.086 --> 00:03:14.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only on physical explanations,

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:16.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many individual scientists reason

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that highly ordered natural systems

00:03:19.053 --> 00:03:21.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are evidence of a Designer.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My personal conclusion is

00:03:24.224 --> 00:03:26.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there is a God who is revealed

00:03:26.643 --> 00:03:30.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the magnificent designs of nature.

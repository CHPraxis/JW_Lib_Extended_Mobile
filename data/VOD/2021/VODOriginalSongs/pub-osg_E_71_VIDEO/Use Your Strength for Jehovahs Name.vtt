When you were younger,
life seemed so simple.

00:00:06.735 --> 00:00:11.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You did your best
to do what’s right—

00:00:11.448 --> 00:00:16.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Giving answers
and preaching the good news;

00:00:16.453 --> 00:00:21.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You would pray each
and ev’ry night.

00:00:21.125 --> 00:00:26.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as you got older,
with this world trying to mold you,

00:00:26.046 --> 00:00:30.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Suddenly it was not so easy
to be knocking on those doors.

00:00:30.968 --> 00:00:35.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as you get taller,
smarter, trying to work harder,

Never let go of Jehovah.

Now you are older
and dealing with changes,

00:01:16.388 --> 00:01:21.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like all the trials
have just begun.

00:01:21.018 --> 00:01:25.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Growing anxious
from all of your fears—

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talk to God;
he always listens.

00:01:30.778 --> 00:01:35.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as you get wiser,
find the ways you can apply

00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:40.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The truth in your life
and feel the joy of sacrifice.

And as you get taller,

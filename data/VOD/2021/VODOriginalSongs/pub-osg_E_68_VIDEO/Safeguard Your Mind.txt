00:00:20 I really want to do what’s right, But there’s a war inside my mind—
00:00:29 Doubting if I measure up, Wond’ring if I do enough.
00:00:39 I lie awake and pray to you, Because you told me that’s what I should do.
00:00:48 When anxious thoughts surround me, Jehovah, Father, you tell me
00:00:57 To safeguard my heart and safeguard my mind,
00:01:02 Stay focused on good things in life. I won’t give in to what gets me down.
00:01:11 I’ll safeguard my mind, and peace will be found.
00:01:26 I really long to do your will, But I get tired from how I feel,
00:01:35 Thinking life is just too tough And I don’t deserve your love.
00:01:44 But I get up and out the door And share my hope for the future in store.
00:01:53 I won’t let sadness drown me. Jehovah, Father, you ground me.
00:02:02 I’ll safeguard my heart and safeguard my mind,
00:02:08 Stay focused on good things in life. I won’t give in to what gets me down.
00:02:17 I’ll safeguard my mind, and peace will be found.
00:02:25 Peace will be found.
00:02:31 I won’t give up pushing away
00:02:36 Harmful thoughts that come through the day.
00:02:41 No need to stress and no need to doubt—
00:02:45 Jehovah, I’m glad you gave me a way out. You gave me a way out.
00:02:59 I’ll safeguard my heart and safeguard my mind,
00:03:04 Stay focused on good things in life. I won’t give in to what gets me down.
00:03:13 I’ll safeguard my mind, and peace will be found.

00:00:20 We watch the storm clouds gather. We’ve seen the signs before.
00:00:34 The wind of persecution Is no stranger to our door.
00:00:47 We will face each test with courage, With Jehovah standing near.
00:01:00 And ‘no weapon formed against us’ Will give any cause for fear.
00:01:13 We are one united people,
00:01:21 Though we come from ev’ry land.
00:01:26 We are standing firm together,
00:01:34 For Jehovah makes us stand,
00:01:39 For Jehovah makes us stand.
00:02:01 We wait with calm assurance For Jehovah, the Most High—
00:02:14 The God of our salvation Whose love will never die.
00:02:27 He will never leave his people, And his spirit makes us strong.
00:02:40 No, our enemies won’t break us. To Jehovah we belong!
00:02:55 We are one united people,
00:03:02 Though we come from ev’ry land.
00:03:08 We are standing firm together,
00:03:13 For Jehovah makes us stand.
00:03:21 We stand firm together; Unafraid we face the crowd.
00:03:28 And these hearts that beat within us We have given to our God.
00:03:43 We are one united people,
00:03:49 Though we come from ev’ry land.
00:03:56 We are standing firm together,
00:04:03 For Jehovah makes us stand,
00:04:09 For Jehovah makes us stand.

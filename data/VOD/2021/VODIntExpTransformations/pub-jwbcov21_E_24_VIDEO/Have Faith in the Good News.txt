00:00:07 Fear and war were normal in my home country.
00:00:10 I had many questions:
00:00:13 Why do young people have to die?
00:00:15 Why do my children have to go through this?
00:00:18 God did not create us to make war.
00:00:20 The priests in my church always said,
00:00:23 “It is God’s will.”
00:00:26 Being on the run was dreadful.
00:00:29 More than once, I thought we were going to die.
00:00:31 Eventually, we arrived in Germany,
00:00:33 and I was convinced that the priests there could give me some answers.
00:00:37 I went to several different churches
00:00:41 —but no answers.
00:00:43 I kept telling them: “I’m looking for something.
00:00:46 I don’t know what it is, but I didn’t find it here with you.”
00:00:50 Sometimes I thought I was searching for something
00:00:53 that no one could give me.
00:00:57 One day,
00:00:59 a German woman approached me, speaking in Arabic.
00:01:02 That was amazing for me.
00:01:04 I never had a good opinion of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:01:07 I didn’t think I could learn anything from her,
00:01:10 but I gave her a chance.
00:01:13 She gave me logical answers to all of my questions.
00:01:20 In my home country, there are multiple religious groups and nationalities
00:01:25 who hate and fight each other.
00:01:28 But at the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:01:31 I have seen that all people can live in peace with each other
00:01:35 if they get to know our Father in heaven.
00:01:38 He gives love and peace.
00:01:41 At last, I found what I had been looking for.
00:01:52 I lived a life without rules.
00:01:55 I used to get drunk,
00:01:57 I smoked a lot, and I became a compulsive gambler.
00:02:01 My behavior was a complete disaster.
00:02:05 My wife wanted to separate from me.
00:02:10 It was a horrible time.
00:02:13 My wife started studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:02:17 I remember being doubtful
00:02:19 —very doubtful.
00:02:22 But there was one thing that started to make me think.
00:02:26 Both my wife and my children looked more peaceful,
00:02:31 more joyful, happier.
00:02:34 That’s why I even accepted a Bible study.
00:02:39 I came to realize that Jehovah loves each one of us as an individual.
00:02:44 That gave me real hope for the future.
00:02:47 Everything I was studying in the Bible
00:02:50 helped me to understand
00:02:52 that doing Jehovah’s will is in our best interests.
00:02:58 This really helped me to quit my bad habits,
00:03:01 treat my family better,
00:03:04 and show due respect to my wife.
00:03:08 If Jehovah hadn’t searched for me,
00:03:11 if I hadn’t come to know him,
00:03:13 we would no longer be a family.
00:03:18 Today we are, indeed, a happy family,
00:03:21 a united family
00:03:24 —united more than ever.
00:03:28 Only Jehovah could perform such a miracle.

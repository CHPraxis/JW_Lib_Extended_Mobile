00:00:01 During my high-school years,
00:00:04 I would work at a shipyard
00:00:06 as a third-class welder.
00:00:08 It was difficult.
00:00:10 In the summertime, it was real hot on the water.
00:00:14 And I just said: “Wow!
00:00:15 “If I’m going to have to do this for 30 or 40 years,
00:00:18 I’ve got to find something better.”
00:00:21 In that period of time, “successful” meant
00:00:23 “a good job, a lot of money, comfort.”
00:00:27 And so I went through college in four years
00:00:30 and got an accounting degree.
00:00:32 Every time I would get a transfer, I would get promoted.
00:00:35 So I went from Africa to Belgium,
00:00:38 from Belgium to Scotland,
00:00:40 from Scotland back to the U.S.,
00:00:43 and then from the U.S. to Singapore.
00:00:45 And that was really a big jump
00:00:47 —nice cars, a driver,
00:00:52 putting a whole lot of money in the bank.
00:00:55 And every time I would reach one of these goals,
00:00:58 my wife and I would sit at the table and say:
00:01:00 “Now—now we’re going to be happy.
00:01:03 Now we’re going to finally start to be able to enjoy this.”
00:01:06 But it was like something fleeting.
00:01:09 It just wasn’t there.
00:01:11 The emptiness was growing bigger.
00:01:13 It was getting—  The hole was getting larger.
00:01:16 We were just perplexed.
00:01:18 We didn’t know where to go to find any kind of joy or happiness.
00:01:22 Well, my daughter,
00:01:24 she had a baby shop.
00:01:27 It sold baby clothes and small baby furniture.
00:01:30 She and her husband ran the shop.
00:01:31 So they hired this young girl
00:01:34 to help with the store and to help with their children.
00:01:36 But when she wasn’t busy with the store and with the children,
00:01:40 she’d pull open her Bible and she would be reading her Bible.
00:01:43 So they asked this young girl,
00:01:46 “Do you know anybody
00:01:48 that could study with the two kids?”
00:01:51 She said, “I have the perfect people, the perfect couple.”
00:01:55 And so they set up a study
00:01:57 the following week on one night during the week.
00:01:59 And my daughter called me and said: “Dad, can you come to this Bible study?
00:02:04 “I don’t know these people.
00:02:06 And you just need to be there to make sure it’s on the up-and-up.”
00:02:10 And so I came to that first Bible study, and I watched it.
00:02:14 I just sat there amazed!
00:02:17 But when the study was over, I asked them, I said,
00:02:20 “Would y’all be interested in studying with me?”
00:02:25 You know, in the world, you may hit these goals,
00:02:29 but then very quickly after that,
00:02:31 you go way down and then you stay way down.
00:02:34 The truth brings you constant joy.
00:02:37 There’s nothing like it.
00:02:39 It’s just complete satisfaction,
00:02:42 and you just know now you’re doing the right thing.
00:02:45 And it’s just changed our whole life now and our whole attitude.
00:02:48 We are just so very content and happy.

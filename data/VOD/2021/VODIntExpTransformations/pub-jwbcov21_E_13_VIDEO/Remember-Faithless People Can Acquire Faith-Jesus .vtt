The truth came to our home
through my mother.

00:00:06.944 --> 00:00:10.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was never seriously interested
in the truth.

00:00:11.448 --> 00:00:14.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where we grew up,
education was very important.

00:00:14.285 --> 00:00:17.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A person needed to make money
and live a lavish life.

00:00:18.956 --> 00:00:21.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s the life I chose

00:00:21.083 --> 00:00:23.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to study, to get higher education—

00:00:23.586 --> 00:00:25.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I could have what others had.

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:29.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although they could see
that I wasn’t interested in the truth,

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:33.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my mother and brother did not give up on me.

00:00:33.304 --> 00:00:36.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I came back from school in January, 

00:00:36.432 --> 00:00:39.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my mother ordered the <i>Examining</i>
<i>the Scriptures Daily</i>  booklet for me.

00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:45.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Year after year, I always had
the <i>Examining the Scriptures Daily </i> booklet

00:00:45.608 --> 00:00:47.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a Bible.

00:00:47.693 --> 00:00:50.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She made sure
that although I wasn’t attending meetings,

00:00:50.988 --> 00:00:53.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at least I had literature.

00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:59.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides that, my younger brother,
the one I was close to,

00:00:59.663 --> 00:01:03.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
decided to take the truth seriously.

00:01:03.542 --> 00:01:05.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I came back from school,

00:01:05.836 --> 00:01:08.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw my brother
getting a Bible study of his own,

00:01:08.672 --> 00:01:10.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I was surprised to see him

00:01:10.674 --> 00:01:14.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
studying the Bible
and noticed that he had prepared.

00:01:14.136 --> 00:01:18.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He cared about
and loved what he was learning.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s when I understood
that the Bible changes lives.

00:01:22.603 --> 00:01:25.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A scripture that comes to mind

00:01:25.814 --> 00:01:29.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is Hosea 11:4.

00:01:29.902 --> 00:01:32.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There it shows that Jehovah

00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:36.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pulls us with “cords of love” and “kindness.”

00:01:36.116 --> 00:01:39.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my situation, Jehovah did this.

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I made the decision to be regular
at the congregation meetings,

00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:49.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I finally started studying
the Bible with someone in 2007

00:01:49.463 --> 00:01:51.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and got baptized in 2008.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My family really encouraged me;

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.221 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
they never gave up on me.

00:01:57.221 --> 00:01:59.223 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And I encourage parents

00:01:59.223 --> 00:02:01.266 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
not to give up on their children.

00:02:03.102 --> 00:02:06.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They must continue encouraging them
and have the hope

00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:10.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah God
will draw them to the organization

00:02:10.484 --> 00:02:13.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they have good hearts.

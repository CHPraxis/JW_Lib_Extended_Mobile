00:00:13 Friends give me help
00:00:15 when I need them the most.
00:00:18 They make me laugh; they give me
00:00:20 practical assistance whenever I need them.
00:00:23 They’re just a real source of joy in my life.
00:00:27 When I see my dear friends
00:00:29 going through difficult times
00:00:31 but still serving Jehovah
00:00:33 —that really encourages me with my trials.
00:00:37 Friendship—it just enhances
00:00:39 and enriches a person’s life.
00:00:41 I don’t think that friendship is
00:00:45 something that I find too natural.
00:00:47 I’m shy by nature; I’m hesitant by nature;
00:00:50 I feel inadequate by nature.
00:00:54 In my mind, Baruch was simply Jeremiah’s secretary.
00:00:59 I had never considered that after spending so much time together,
00:01:02 it would have allowed them to draw closer as friends.
00:01:06 When I studied the article about Jeremiah and Baruch,
00:01:11 it made me reflect on friendships that I have.
00:01:14 When you work together for Jehovah,
00:01:17 it takes your friendship to another level.
00:01:20 Jehovah’s people will have
00:01:22 a depth and a dimension to their friendships
00:01:25 that will not be shared by those who are not serving Jehovah.
00:01:31 In the article, I really loved the point about communication.
00:01:35 Being open with others
00:01:37 allows them to be open with you,
00:01:39 and that just allows
00:01:41 a friendship to flourish.
00:01:45 I can have a very bad view of myself.
00:01:49 I appreciated the reminder
00:01:52 that you will see the bad side of any friend —that’s just normal.
00:01:56 But good friends remind you of your good side.
00:02:00 That is like Jehovah talking and reminding me
00:02:03 how much I’m loved by him.
00:02:07 I’d heard that Keith, an older brother,
00:02:09 was returning to Britain for some medical treatment.
00:02:13 He was much loved—deeply respected.
00:02:17 You try to picture, to imagine
00:02:19 what’s going through his mind
00:02:21 —his fears and anxieties.
00:02:23 I felt very inadequate, but I realized
00:02:26 that it would be the loving and kind thing to do to speak to him.
00:02:31 So we spent some time together; we talked.
00:02:33 I felt honored just to say a prayer with someone like that.
00:02:37 I was really touched by Keith’s response.
00:02:41 He clearly and deeply appreciated that,
00:02:43 and I felt thrilled to have done just a little something
00:02:47 that helped and supported him.
00:02:51 I’ve worked with someone
00:02:53 that I never expected to become very close to.
00:02:58 Charlotte —she’s the opposite of me,
00:03:02 but I came to realize quite early on
00:03:05 that she’s an amazing listener.
00:03:09 Charlotte is more than a friend
00:03:11 —she’s now family.
00:03:15 I love my family very, very much.
00:03:18 At the moment, I’m the only one in my family
00:03:21 who is one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:03:25 but I’ve never felt that I was truly alone.
00:03:28 Jehovah has always provided brothers,
00:03:31 sisters, mothers (you know), uncles, aunties.
00:03:34 He’s always given me everyone that I needed.
00:03:37 I feel that I’ve had a lesson powerfully reinforced
00:03:40 of the blessings of genuine friendship.
00:03:44 When we make an effort
00:03:45 just to give Jehovah a little something,
00:03:47 he can add his blessing.
00:03:50 In my experience, the person you don’t expect
00:03:54 actually turns out to be
00:03:56 a very special friend.
00:03:58 When you work with different brothers and sisters,
00:04:01 you really appreciate that they are gifts from Jehovah.
00:04:04 “And he will give all of you into our hand.”
00:04:09 Working hard for Jehovah and being genuine
00:04:12 —that will attract other brothers and sisters.
00:04:15 We will never forget the friendships that we make right now.
00:04:19 Jehovah will use those friendships to help us through the great tribulation.

Friends give me help

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I need them the most.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They make me laugh; they give me

00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:23.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
practical assistance whenever I need them.

00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:27.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re just a real source of joy in my life.

00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:29.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I see my dear friends

00:00:29.758 --> 00:00:31.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
going through difficult times

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but still serving Jehovah

00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:37.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that really encourages me with my trials.

00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:39.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Friendship—it just enhances

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enriches a person’s life.

00:00:41.562 --> 00:00:45.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t think that friendship is

00:00:45.774 --> 00:00:47.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
something that I find too natural.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m shy by nature; I’m hesitant by nature;

00:00:50.654 --> 00:00:53.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel inadequate by nature.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my mind, Baruch was simply
Jeremiah’s secretary.

00:00:59.914 --> 00:01:02.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had never considered
that after spending so much time together,

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:05.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it would have allowed them
to draw closer as friends.

00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:11.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I studied the article
about Jeremiah and Baruch,

00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:14.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it made me reflect
on friendships that I have.

00:01:14.637 --> 00:01:17.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you work together for Jehovah,

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:20.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it takes your friendship to another level.

00:01:20.267 --> 00:01:22.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people will have

00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:25.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a depth and a dimension to their friendships

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:30.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will not be shared
by those who are not serving Jehovah.

00:01:31.153 --> 00:01:35.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the article, I really loved
the point about communication.

00:01:35.074 --> 00:01:37.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being open with others

00:01:37.368 --> 00:01:39.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allows them to be open with you,

00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:41.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that just allows

00:01:41.538 --> 00:01:43.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a friendship to flourish.

00:01:45.125 --> 00:01:49.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can have a very bad view of myself.

00:01:49.046 --> 00:01:52.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I appreciated the reminder

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you will see the bad side of any friend
—that’s just normal.

00:01:56.804 --> 00:02:00.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But good friends
remind you of your good side.

00:02:00.307 --> 00:02:03.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is like Jehovah talking and reminding me

00:02:03.477 --> 00:02:05.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how much I’m loved by him.

00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:09.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d heard that Keith, an older brother,

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:13.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was returning to Britain
for some medical treatment.

00:02:13.612 --> 00:02:17.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was much loved—deeply respected.

00:02:17.116 --> 00:02:19.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You try to picture, to imagine

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what’s going through his mind

00:02:21.662 --> 00:02:23.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his fears and anxieties.

00:02:23.956 --> 00:02:26.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt very inadequate, but I realized

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:31.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it would be the loving
and kind thing to do to speak to him.

00:02:31.046 --> 00:02:33.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we spent some time together; we talked.

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt honored just to say a prayer
with someone like that.

00:02:37.886 --> 00:02:41.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really touched by Keith’s response.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He clearly and deeply appreciated that,

00:02:43.892 --> 00:02:47.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I felt thrilled to have done
just a little something

00:02:47.563 --> 00:02:49.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that helped and supported him.

00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:53.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve worked with someone

00:02:53.736 --> 00:02:58.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I never expected
to become very close to.

00:02:58.574 --> 00:03:02.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Charlotte
—she’s the opposite of me,

00:03:02.244 --> 00:03:05.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I came to realize quite early on

00:03:05.205 --> 00:03:07.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she’s an amazing listener.

00:03:09.084 --> 00:03:11.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Charlotte is more than a friend

00:03:11.128 --> 00:03:13.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—she’s now family.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love my family very, very much.

00:03:18.343 --> 00:03:21.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the moment, I’m the only one in my family

00:03:21.388 --> 00:03:23.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I’ve never felt that I was truly alone.

00:03:28.562 --> 00:03:31.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has always provided brothers,

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sisters, mothers (you know), uncles, aunties.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s always given me everyone that I needed.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel that I’ve had a lesson
powerfully reinforced

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:44.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the blessings of genuine friendship.

00:03:44.161 --> 00:03:45.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we make an effort

00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:47.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just to give Jehovah a little something,

00:03:47.623 --> 00:03:49.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he can add his blessing.

00:03:50.542 --> 00:03:54.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my experience, the person you don’t expect

00:03:54.296 --> 00:03:56.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
actually turns out to be

00:03:56.298 --> 00:03:58.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a very special friend.

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:01.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you work
with different brothers and sisters,

00:04:01.053 --> 00:04:04.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you really appreciate
that they are gifts from Jehovah.

00:04:04.223 --> 00:04:08.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he will give all of you into our hand.”

00:04:09.228 --> 00:04:12.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Working hard for Jehovah and being genuine

00:04:12.481 --> 00:04:15.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that will attract
other brothers and sisters.

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will never forget the friendships
that we make right now.

00:04:19.947 --> 00:04:24.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will use those friendships
to help us through the great tribulation.

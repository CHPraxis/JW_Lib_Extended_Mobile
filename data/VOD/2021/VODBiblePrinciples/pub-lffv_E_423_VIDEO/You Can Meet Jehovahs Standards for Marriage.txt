00:00:06 I didn’t have a problem with polygamy
00:00:08 because I too was in a polygamous marriage.
00:00:11 And I viewed myself as a good wife;
00:00:13 I was the second wife.
00:00:16 I used to work at the mines in Carletonville, South Africa.
00:00:19 My family lived in Botswana, in Gaborone.
00:00:22 I had a girlfriend, and we had three children.
00:00:25 My church didn’t see anything wrong with what I was doing
00:00:28 because that was a common practice.
00:00:31 We were just married according to Cambodian tradition.
00:00:37 But we never legally registered our marriage.
00:00:43 I got a Bible.
00:00:46 What I learned from it really touched me.
00:00:51 I realized that I
00:00:53 was wrong to be in a polygamous marriage.
00:00:58 The brother who was studying the Bible with me
00:01:00 saw a picture of my family.
00:01:02 He asked me about the picture,
00:01:04 and I told him that it was my girlfriend and my kids.
00:01:07 We then studied the lesson which talks about family life,
00:01:11 and I realized that I had to make changes in my life.
00:01:18 When I wanted to start preaching,
00:01:21 I realized that Jehovah requires
00:01:25 that we legalize our marriage.
00:01:30 I had prayed,
00:01:33 “O Jehovah, if you really have drawn me
00:01:37 “and are pleased with me,
00:01:41 “please help me get the birth certificate
00:01:45 and the money needed to make the trip.”
00:01:52 This really troubled me
00:01:54 for a very long time.
00:01:56 Another thing that made it difficult
00:01:58 to leave him was the fact
00:02:01 that I had ten children.
00:02:04 But I saw that loving this man shouldn’t prevent me
00:02:08 from becoming someone worthy to God.
00:02:11 So I said, “I’m leaving.”
00:02:15 As for the local community,
00:02:17 they would comment about me:
00:02:19 “This lady is a rebel. She stole a man’s children.”
00:02:22 But once I did leave, I felt as if something
00:02:26 was being lifted off of me.
00:02:28 I went back home
00:02:30 and got married to my wife.
00:02:33 This enabled me and my family to be together
00:02:36 in one place where we could serve Jehovah
00:02:39 as a family.
00:02:41 After I quit my job, I spent a whole year unemployed.
00:02:44 We planted some vegetables
00:02:46 in our yard, and that helped us
00:02:49 to get by.
00:02:51 To my surprise,
00:02:53 my Bible study conductor called me
00:02:56 and invited me to go to Takeo.
00:02:59 It’s very far away, really far!
00:03:03 When I mentioned the names of my parents,
00:03:05 extended family, and relatives,
00:03:08 I was able to get my birth certificate.
00:03:11 We submitted
00:03:13 an application for a marriage certificate
00:03:16 and received it two weeks later.
00:03:20 My previous husband eventually became
00:03:22 one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:03:27 My best friend now is the first wife from my polygamous marriage.
00:03:32 I’m so proud to see
00:03:34 my family serving Jehovah,
00:03:36 to see that they love Jehovah,
00:03:38 and to see them obeying Jehovah’s laws.
00:03:43 I eventually got baptized.
00:03:46 I also preached to my husband,
00:03:48 and he agreed to start studying the Bible.
00:03:51 I am really grateful to Jehovah.
00:03:55 He is merciful to the poor and to the lowliest
00:03:58 —like me.
00:04:00 I fully relied on Jehovah,
00:04:02 and he made everything happen.

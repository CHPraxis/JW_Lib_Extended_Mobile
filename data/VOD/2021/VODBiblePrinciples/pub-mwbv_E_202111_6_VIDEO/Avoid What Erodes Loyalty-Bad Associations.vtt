You know, we’ve been talking
about times when our loyalty

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been put to the test

00:00:06.986 --> 00:00:09.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not to put you on the spot,

00:00:09.446 --> 00:00:11.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but didn’t you have an experience?

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:13.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mhm.

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:16.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did, and I don’t mind sharing.

00:00:18.706 --> 00:00:21.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was when I was
at that office job in the city.

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:25.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just coffee as usual.

00:00:25.463 --> 00:00:27.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Karen, we’re making some coffee.

00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:28.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you want some?

00:00:28.883 --> 00:00:30.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, I’d love it.

00:00:30.134 --> 00:00:31.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The good stuff, right?

00:00:31.052 --> 00:00:31.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, yes!

00:00:31.886 --> 00:00:32.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks.

00:00:32.887 --> 00:00:35.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Boy, I can smell it.

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:37.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And somebody brought treats.

00:00:37.475 --> 00:00:39.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s wonderful, thank you.

00:00:39.477 --> 00:00:40.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:00:40.144 --> 00:00:41.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how are things going . . .

00:00:41.312 --> 00:00:43.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this time she started telling me
about her problems at home.

00:00:43.898 --> 00:00:46.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So John, he got a text message
from his ex-girlfriend.

00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:48.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No!
That must be very hard for you.

00:00:48.944 --> 00:00:50.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, it is.

00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:52.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, there are some things in the Bible

00:00:52.782 --> 00:00:55.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have helped me in my marriage
that I would love to show you.

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was excited about the chance
to give a witness.

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, good morning.

00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:01.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that for me?

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know how you like it.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From time to time, we talked;
we kept the conversations brief.

00:01:07.922 --> 00:01:09.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was it.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey!

00:01:10.758 --> 00:01:14.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But over time, the conversations grew.

00:01:14.136 --> 00:01:17.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And husbands and family
were often the hot topic.

00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:20.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And everyone had a viewpoint.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, if I may, there are some things
in the Scriptures that I think  . . .

00:01:24.814 --> 00:01:27.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still thought I could give a witness

00:01:27.024 --> 00:01:30.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and actually teach them something
about Jehovah.

00:01:30.152 --> 00:01:33.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, no, um, honey, it doesn’t work like that.

00:01:36.993 --> 00:01:39.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sorry, Karen.
Too much information, right?

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know . . .

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in reality, I was the one being taught.

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:48.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I was a quick learner.

00:01:49.881 --> 00:01:54.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was sure their thinking
wasn’t rubbing off on me

00:01:54.135 --> 00:01:56.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until one day when Robert called.

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:02.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The girls knew that Robert and I had
had a small disagreement that morning.

00:02:02.143 --> 00:02:04.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he was calling to apologize,

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
although some of it was my fault.

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Karen, did you want to get a little coffee?

00:02:09.776 --> 00:02:11.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, it’s him.

00:02:11.778 --> 00:02:14.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you don’t want to talk to him now,
then don’t.

00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:18.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides, it sounds like he could use
a little silent treatment.

00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:28.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t believe the effect
the association was having

00:02:28.544 --> 00:02:31.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on my attitude and my marriage.

00:02:31.381 --> 00:02:33.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what could you do?

00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:35.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You worked with them every day,

00:02:35.927 --> 00:02:38.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you were able to give
a witness sometimes.

00:02:39.973 --> 00:02:43.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I had let it turn into regular,
unnecessary association

00:02:43.768 --> 00:02:45.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was spoiling my useful habits.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that had to change.

00:02:51.234 --> 00:02:54.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started keeping things friendly
but professional.

00:02:54.445 --> 00:02:57.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was more cautious, as I would be

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they had invited me out
or if a male coworker

00:03:00.243 --> 00:03:02.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had invited me to join him for a break.

00:03:05.165 --> 00:03:07.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm.
So did that work?

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It did, and I was so relieved.

00:03:10.462 --> 00:03:12.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so was I.

00:03:12.464 --> 00:03:17.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gave us the good morals
and habits that we have.

00:03:18.678 --> 00:03:21.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exposing myself to bad association

00:03:21.848 --> 00:03:23.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was being disloyal to him.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I think how far
we are now into the  . . .

00:03:50.752 --> 00:03:53.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How is it out there?

00:03:53.046 --> 00:03:54.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not good.

00:03:54.547 --> 00:03:56.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It won’t be long—maybe an hour.

00:03:56.758 --> 00:03:59.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is Kevin with you?

00:04:00.887 --> 00:04:02.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that he’s not coming;

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:05.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he doesn’t want to have anything
to do with us anymore.

00:04:07.686 --> 00:04:09.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How sad.

00:04:09.688 --> 00:04:13.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this far into the great tribulation.

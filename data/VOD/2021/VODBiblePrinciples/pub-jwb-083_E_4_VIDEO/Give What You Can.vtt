Ms. Kwon?

00:00:06.485 --> 00:00:07.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ms. Kwon?

00:00:07.778 --> 00:00:08.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh!

00:00:11.365 --> 00:00:12.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sorry.

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:13.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ms. Kwon?

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:18.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m so slow today.

00:00:18.038 --> 00:00:19.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s OK.

00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:20.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take your time.

00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:24.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So can you pioneer next month?

00:00:24.461 --> 00:00:26.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt you will experience
greater joy . . .

00:00:29.258 --> 00:00:30.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Joo?

00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:31.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Joo? Over here.

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:32.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Sister Kwon.

00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:33.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can I have one too?

00:00:33.804 --> 00:00:36.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, of course.

00:00:36.098 --> 00:00:38.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just a moment, please.

00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:43.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Joo, I have
many doctors’ appointments next month,

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:44.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but maybe—

00:00:44.982 --> 00:00:45.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, OK.

00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:46.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:00:47.151 --> 00:00:49.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wrote a little something
that might help you when you fill it out.

00:00:49.862 --> 00:00:51.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, I see.

00:00:52.197 --> 00:00:53.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you go.

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:54.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:00:54.783 --> 00:00:57.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And remember, our circuit overseer’s visit
is in two months.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mm-hm.

00:00:58.412 --> 00:01:00.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And only 30 hours are required that month.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I see.

00:01:00.915 --> 00:01:01.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Joo?

00:01:01.832 --> 00:01:02.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes. Hello, Brother Lee.

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:03.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:04.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello, Sister Kwon.

00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:05.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello, Brother Lee.

00:01:05.336 --> 00:01:07.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nice job covering those parts
at the last minute.

00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:12.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anyway, it seems like everyone is away.

00:01:13.177 --> 00:01:14.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello, Sister Kwon.

00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:16.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can I ask you to do something?

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s what I need.

00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:20.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hello, Sister Joo.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you want to get something done,
give it to a busy man.

00:01:25.022 --> 00:01:26.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can always count on you.

00:01:26.774 --> 00:01:29.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hannah and I
were beginning to feel overwhelmed.

00:01:29.568 --> 00:01:31.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . in Jesus’ name we pray. Amen.

00:01:33.822 --> 00:01:35.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Joo, 

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:37.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may I have a moment?

00:01:37.451 --> 00:01:38.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need your help with something.

00:01:38.577 --> 00:01:40.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then Brother Kim needed help

00:01:40.663 --> 00:01:42.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the territories.

00:01:43.916 --> 00:01:47.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we loved being busy
with theocratic work.

00:01:56.845 --> 00:01:58.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Brother Kim?

00:01:59.264 --> 00:02:00.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just a second.

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:03.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Brother Kim
calling about the territories.

00:02:03.185 --> 00:02:04.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll only take a minute.

00:02:04.645 --> 00:02:06.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, uh-huh.

00:02:08.023 --> 00:02:09.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I see.

00:02:09.942 --> 00:02:11.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, I understand.

00:02:12.403 --> 00:02:16.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, sounds good.

00:02:16.782 --> 00:02:19.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Other more important things
were beginning to suffer.

00:02:24.957 --> 00:02:26.792 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s like doctors’ appointments

00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:29.294 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
are my whole life now.

00:02:29.294 --> 00:02:31.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have so many next month,

00:02:31.714 --> 00:02:34.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they take forever to reschedule.

00:02:34.883 --> 00:02:37.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could I possibly make my time?

00:02:39.304 --> 00:02:41.598 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
There’s something written here.

00:02:41.598 --> 00:02:46.311 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Prayerfully consider 2 Corinthians 8:12.”

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If the readiness is there . . .

00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:52.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[oh, I am ready],

00:02:53.986 --> 00:02:56.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . according to what a person has,

00:02:56.363 --> 00:02:59.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not according to what a person
does not have.”

00:02:59.742 --> 00:03:00.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm.

00:03:03.203 --> 00:03:07.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wanted the Israelites
to sacrifice their best,

00:03:07.124 --> 00:03:09.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but just imagine what would happen

00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:11.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they tried to do more than they could.

00:03:12.254 --> 00:03:14.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can almost hear the reaction.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dad!

00:03:17.092 --> 00:03:18.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where did all the sheep go?

00:03:18.552 --> 00:03:19.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of them?

00:03:19.845 --> 00:03:22.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are we supposed to live on?

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:03:24.516 --> 00:03:26.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t want them to sacrifice so much

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they couldn’t support their families.

00:03:29.646 --> 00:03:31.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need those appointments.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But maybe in two months
when I don’t have so many appointments

00:03:36.153 --> 00:03:39.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s the circuit overseer’s visit,
I could set a goal.

00:03:40.657 --> 00:03:42.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We knew we were taking on too much work.

00:03:42.951 --> 00:03:44.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But could we say no?

00:03:44.286 --> 00:03:46.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We wanted Jehovah’s view.

00:03:48.707 --> 00:03:50.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s so funny?

00:03:50.584 --> 00:03:51.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um.

00:03:52.002 --> 00:03:56.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s something I just shared
with Sister Kwon

00:03:56.048 --> 00:03:58.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is perfect for us too

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:01.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—2 Corinthians 8:12.

00:04:01.178 --> 00:04:03.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“According to what a person has”

00:04:03.972 --> 00:04:06.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it’s just like our financial contributions.

00:04:06.391 --> 00:04:07.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exactly.

00:04:08.102 --> 00:04:10.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Honey, would Jehovah
want us to get into debt

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:13.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make a huge contribution
we couldn’t afford?

00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:15.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amen.

00:04:16.485 --> 00:04:19.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, that scripture that we just read—

00:04:21.406 --> 00:04:22.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Kim Si-Young.

00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:24.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Territories again?

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:25.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:28.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I’ll tell him that I’ll call him
after family worship.

00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:32.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can’t give what’s not ours.

00:04:32.584 --> 00:04:36.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can’t let
our spiritual routine suffer,

00:04:36.713 --> 00:04:38.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even for theocratic privileges.

00:04:39.716 --> 00:04:41.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Note this promise in the Bible.

00:04:42.594 --> 00:04:43.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at this flower.

00:04:43.637 --> 00:04:45.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t it beautiful?

00:04:45.514 --> 00:04:48.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love this time of year.

00:04:49.143 --> 00:04:51.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you both so much

00:04:51.687 --> 00:04:53.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your help this month.

00:04:53.564 --> 00:04:55.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It felt good to find the right balance

00:04:55.858 --> 00:04:58.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to know we’re giving Jehovah all we can.

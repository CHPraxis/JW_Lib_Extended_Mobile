00:00:02 Everything happened so fast.
00:00:05 Everyone thought that because so much blood was lost,
00:00:07 my life was in danger and I would need a blood transfusion.
00:00:14 The medical professionals
00:00:16 were describing treatments
00:00:18 that I wasn’t familiar with.
00:00:19 I was (in my mind) trying to think: ‘Have I heard of this?
00:00:22 ‘Do I know what this is?
00:00:24 Have I read about it?’
00:00:26 She explained that it was
00:00:28 a complicated surgery
00:00:31 and that because I didn’t take blood,
00:00:33 it would be obviously more serious.
00:00:36 We love life, and in any medical situation,
00:00:40 we want treatments that preserve or restore our health.
00:00:44 But more important, we want to respect the Creator of life and his law on blood.
00:00:50 God first spoke that law to Noah’s family.
00:00:53 After the Flood, God told them
00:00:55 that the animals could serve as food, but he added:
00:00:59 “Only flesh with its life —its blood—you must not eat.”
00:01:04 Blood represents the life of a creature and should not be misused.
00:01:08 God repeated this law to ancient Israel with clear instructions:
00:01:12 “You must not eat it.
00:01:14 You should pour it out on the ground like water.”
00:01:17 It was the same for early Christians.
00:01:19 They received written direction to
00:01:22 “keep abstaining . .. from blood.”
00:01:25 Jehovah’s Witnesses still obey that command today,
00:01:27 even though it can be a challenge to understand
00:01:29 how that command should be applied
00:01:31 to the numerous medical treatments now available.
00:01:35 Donated whole blood is often separated
00:01:37 into its four main components
00:01:39 —red cells, white cells,
00:01:42 platelets, and plasma.
00:01:44 We abstain from blood by refusing to accept
00:01:46 a transfusion of whole blood
00:01:48 or of any of those four main components.
00:01:52 How did one brother demonstrate the strength necessary
00:01:54 to abstain from blood during an emergency?
00:01:57 When it comes to blood,
00:01:59 we have to be prepared.
00:02:02 So that’s what I did.
00:02:04 I researched it, and I prayed to Jehovah
00:02:07 so that I could understand his thoughts
00:02:09 and follow them.
00:02:11 And then I wrote down my wishes.
00:02:16 I never thought that I would have such an accident.
00:02:20 I am very thankful to Jehovah
00:02:23 that he helped me understand all of these things,
00:02:26 and because of that,
00:02:28 I was able to make and stick to a decision that pleases him.
00:02:35 Blood fractions are things  that are extracted from any one
00:02:38 of the four main blood components.
00:02:41 But the Bible does not provide
00:02:42 specific direction
00:02:43 about using these fractions.
00:02:45 So to accept them or not
00:02:47 is a personal decision.
00:02:49 Some believe that a small, isolated fraction is no longer blood.
00:02:53 Others feel they can’t use anything that came from blood.
00:02:56 How did one sister make an informed decision
00:02:59 about which medications containing blood fractions to accept?
00:03:02 When it came to fractions, for me, the challenge
00:03:07 was figuring out what I really felt about it and deciding for myself
00:03:10 what I would or wouldn’t accept and why.
00:03:15 At stake is our relationship with Jehovah
00:03:18 and having a clean conscience before him.
00:03:20 So it’s something that no one else could have done for me.
00:03:24 I had to make clear to my doctor
00:03:26 that I absolutely would not accept blood
00:03:29 or any of the four main components.
00:03:31 And I also explained to him
00:03:34 what medications and other treatments I was willing to accept.
00:03:38 What questions should Christians ask themselves
00:03:40 about medical procedures involving their own blood?
00:03:44 What if during the course
00:03:46 of a therapy or procedure
00:03:47 some of my blood will be diverted
00:03:49 outside my body
00:03:50 and the flow might be interrupted for a time?
00:03:53 Does my conscience allow me
00:03:55 to view this blood as still part of me,
00:03:57 thus not requiring
00:03:58 that it be poured “out on the ground”?
00:04:02 What if during a medical procedure
00:04:04 some of my own blood will be withdrawn,
00:04:06 modified, and directed back
00:04:07 into (or onto) my body?
00:04:09 Does it trouble my Bible-trained conscience?
00:04:12 Or could I accept such a procedure?
00:04:15 Am I aware that refusing
00:04:17 all medical procedures involving the use of my own blood
00:04:19 means that I would not accept a blood test,
00:04:22 hemodialysis, or the use of a heart-lung bypass machine?
00:04:27 What did one sister do to ensure she made a decision
00:04:30 that would not disturb her conscience?
00:04:32 So my doctor presented me with an effective, alternative procedure.
00:04:36 It was something that I knew about,
00:04:39 but I asked her to clarify the details to make sure
00:04:41 that what she was talking about was OK with my conscience.
00:04:46 So I made it a personal study project,
00:04:48 and I also asked a mature friend
00:04:50 to help me go through all the information.
00:04:53 I made my decision with a clean conscience,
00:04:56 and I knew it would make Jehovah’s heart glad.
00:05:00 How can you make informed decisions about the medical use of blood?
00:05:05 Pray for God’s wisdom and holy spirit.
00:05:08 Meditate on what the Bible teaches,
00:05:10 and learn about the medical treatments that may be offered to you.
00:05:14 If needed, ask for help to understand the options.
00:05:18 And finally, put your decisions in writing.
00:05:23 Jehovah God knows what is best for us.
00:05:25 And when our resolve to obey him is tested,
00:05:27 he doesn’t want us to feel alone.
00:05:30 He wants to help us.
00:05:32 When we accept this help and show respect for life that comes from him,
00:05:35 we can look forward to a paradise with perfect health and everlasting life.

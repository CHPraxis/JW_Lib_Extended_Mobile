Pioneering where the need is greater
wasn’t easy.

00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:40.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After a long day in service,
I had a part to work on.

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:45.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thankfully, Jess took care of everything,

00:00:45.024 --> 00:00:47.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I could focus on my part.

00:00:47.067 --> 00:00:48.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s the best!

00:01:09.048 --> 00:01:12.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Poor thing, she was exhausted.

00:01:13.552 --> 00:01:15.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good thing we were turning in early.

00:01:20.351 --> 00:01:24.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
William and I couldn’t agree on much lately.

00:01:25.731 --> 00:01:27.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We couldn’t afford this!

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:30.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There had to be something cheaper,

00:01:33.447 --> 00:01:35.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he wouldn’t listen.

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:53.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes, I feel that my husband
doesn’t make the best decisions.

00:02:00.683 --> 00:02:03.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just wish he’d value my suggestions.

00:02:04.687 --> 00:02:07.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Frankly, I’ve given up trying.

00:02:13.904 --> 00:02:16.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Just as Sarah obeyed Abraham,

00:02:16.198 --> 00:02:18.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
calling him lord.”

00:02:18.325 --> 00:02:21.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews chapter 11 and Isaiah chapter 51

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also cite Sarah as a fine example
for Christian wives.

00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:27.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Christian husbands

00:02:27.668 --> 00:02:31.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can also learn much
from carefully examining . . .

00:02:31.088 --> 00:02:32.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm.

00:02:32.423 --> 00:02:35.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sarah’s example: for me.

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:54.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Sarah was willing to move to parts unknown

00:03:05.205 --> 00:03:08.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A life fraught with danger and hardship.”

00:03:12.755 --> 00:03:14.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She unselfishly supported Abraham

00:03:14.757 --> 00:03:16.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter what

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—just like my Jessica.

00:03:34.693 --> 00:03:38.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She does without, never complains

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what a gem!

00:03:42.493 --> 00:03:45.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can do better letting her know

00:03:45.454 --> 00:03:47.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just how precious she is to me.

00:04:07.142 --> 00:04:10.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sarah submissively obeyed her husband,

00:04:11.605 --> 00:04:14.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she also spoke up.

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She loved her son,

00:04:47.391 --> 00:04:49.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she knew what was at stake

00:04:49.768 --> 00:04:52.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—God’s promises through Isaac.

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:58.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though she knew it would upset Abraham,

00:05:01.655 --> 00:05:03.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she spoke up.

00:05:15.085 --> 00:05:17.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She must have thought carefully

00:05:17.254 --> 00:05:19.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before speaking to him.

00:05:20.674 --> 00:05:23.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all, she called him “lord.”

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah blessed her

00:05:27.514 --> 00:05:30.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for her loyal support of Abraham,

00:05:30.934 --> 00:05:34.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even reminding him to listen to her.

00:05:37.232 --> 00:05:40.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew I couldn’t expect Jehovah

00:05:40.194 --> 00:05:42.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to whisper in my husband’s ear.

00:05:44.531 --> 00:05:48.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did my speech show respect like Sarah’s?

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed to tell him how I felt,

00:05:53.081 --> 00:05:55.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I needed to do it the right way.

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:01.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That night we spoke,

00:06:01.715 --> 00:06:05.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and little by little
things started to improve.

00:06:11.141 --> 00:06:15.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imitating Sarah really worked.

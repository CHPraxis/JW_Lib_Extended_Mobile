00:00:09 God is love, and he invites us: ‘Walk with me and love my way.’
00:00:19 When we love both God and neighbor, Gracious deeds will fill each day.
00:00:28 Therein lies the key to living; Therein lies the life we seek.
00:00:38 Christlike love will never fail us; Christlike love through us will speak.
00:00:52 Love of truth moves us to action; Love of God moves us to love.
00:01:01 When we fail he seeks to help us; By his strength we rise above.
00:01:10 Love is pure and never jealous; Love is kind and bears all things.
00:01:21 May we grow to love our brother; May we taste what true love brings.
00:01:34 Never let resentment lead you; May it never take your hand.
00:01:43 Look to God, and he will guide you; He will teach you these commands:
00:01:53 Love of God and love of neighbor, Ev’rything that love should be.
00:02:03 May we always show to others Godlike love, yes, tenderly.

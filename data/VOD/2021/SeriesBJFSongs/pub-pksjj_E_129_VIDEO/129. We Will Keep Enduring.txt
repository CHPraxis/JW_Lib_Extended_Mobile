00:00:05 How can we endure When trials come, as Jesus said?
00:00:14 Through his pain he saw The joy of better things ahead.
00:00:23 God’s promise, God’s justice, Were thoughts on which he fed.
00:00:32 We need to have endurance. Our faith we must defend.
00:00:42 His love is our assurance. So we will keep enduring to the end.
00:00:56 Though the passing years May bring us sorrow, bring us pain;
00:01:05 There beyond the tears, We see the life that we can gain.
00:01:14 To be there, feel free there, Determined we remain.
00:01:24 We need to have endurance. Our faith we must defend.
00:01:33 His love is our assurance. So we will keep enduring to the end.
00:01:47 We will not give up Nor see the need for doubt or fear.
00:01:56 Faithfully we’ll serve Until Jehovah’s day is here.
00:02:06 Let’s keep on enduring. That time is very near.
00:02:15 We need to have endurance. Our faith we must defend.
00:02:24 His love is our assurance. So we will keep enduring to the end.

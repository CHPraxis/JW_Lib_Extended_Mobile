00:00:08 There is a book that by its many pages,
00:00:13 Brings peace and joy and hope to humankind.
00:00:18 Its wondrous thoughts are charged with such great power;
00:00:23 It brings life to the “dead,” sight to the “blind.”
00:00:28 That precious book is God’s own Holy Bible.
00:00:32 Its words were penned by men whom God inspired,
00:00:37 By men who truly loved their God Jehovah,
00:00:42 And by his holy spirit they were fired.
00:00:48 They wrote a record true of God’s creations,
00:00:53 How by his might this universe appeared.
00:00:58 They also told how man at first was sinless
00:01:03 But how his Paradise then disappeared.
00:01:08 They further told about a certain angel
00:01:12 Who challenged God and spurned his sov’reignty.
00:01:17 That challenge led to sin and man’s great sorrow,
00:01:22 But soon will come Jehovah’s victory.
00:01:28 The time has come with reason for rejoicing:
00:01:33 Jehovah rules by his anointed King.
00:01:38 So now we preach the good news of the Kingdom
00:01:43 And share the hope of blessings it will bring.
00:01:47 Within his book are found these cheerful tidings;
00:01:53 A sacred banquet feast on which to feed.
00:01:57 It offers peace beyond all human thinking;
00:02:02 This Living Treasure beckons all to read.

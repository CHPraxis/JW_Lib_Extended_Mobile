00:00:01 During this COVID-19 pandemic,
00:00:04 it’s not hard for negative feelings
00:00:07 to begin to form in our minds.
00:00:09 We may begin to think a lot
00:00:12 about things that we were able
00:00:14 to do in the past.
00:00:16 For us at Bethel, maybe it’s thinking about some of the speaking assignments
00:00:20 that we had in various congregations,
00:00:23 being with different brothers and sisters and getting to meet different ones.
00:00:27 Maybe we even think about when we served as Bethel representatives
00:00:32 at circuit assemblies or regional conventions
00:00:35 with large, large crowds of our brothers and sisters.
00:00:39 Elders in the field may think about the work that they did
00:00:43 for many, many years on convention committees
00:00:46 or in organizing large departments,
00:00:49 either at conventions or at assemblies.
00:00:52 Pioneers might be thinking about what they did
00:00:55 during the special metropolitan public witnessing program
00:01:00 or just in public witnessing in general.
00:01:03 And then, there are all of the pioneers
00:01:05 that have commuted to Bethel,
00:01:08 some for many years, to support our work.
00:01:11 Well, all of these involve different assignments,
00:01:16 but there’s one thing that they all have in common.
00:01:20 We all have had to hit the “pause button”
00:01:24 on all of these assignments that we love so much.
00:01:29 Well, sometimes we may begin to ask ourselves,
00:01:33 ‘Does the fact that I no longer
00:01:35 ‘can do these assignments that I loved so much
00:01:38 ‘mean that somehow I’ve lost value,
00:01:41 that I’m not as precious to Jehovah anymore?’
00:01:46 Well, this is where our text can be so helpful to us.
00:01:49 Let’s read it again.
00:01:51 Let’s go in our Bibles to Philippians chapter 2,
00:01:56 and let’s read together verses 5 to 7.
00:02:00 Let’s read all three verses.
00:02:02 It says: “Keep this mental attitude in you
00:02:06 “that was also in Christ Jesus,
00:02:08 “who, although he was existing in God’s form,
00:02:12 “gave no consideration to a seizure,
00:02:15 “namely, that he should be equal to God.
00:02:18 “No, [but now let’s focus on this, No,]
00:02:22 “but he emptied himself
00:02:25 “and took a slave’s form
00:02:28 and became human.”
00:02:32 Well now, it’s just a few words there,
00:02:35 but can you imagine what was involved in that last expression:
00:02:39 “He emptied himself
00:02:42 and took a slave’s form”?
00:02:45 It’s really hard for us even to begin to imagine
00:02:49 the position that Jesus occupied
00:02:51 in the heavens before he came to earth.
00:02:53 Maybe we get a little glimpse of it if we go to our Bibles.
00:02:56 Let’s read together Colossians chapter 1,
00:03:03 and let’s look at verse 15.
00:03:06 Now speaking about Jesus, it says:
00:03:08 “He is the image of the invisible God,
00:03:12 “the firstborn of all creation;
00:03:15 “because by means of him
00:03:17 “all other things were created in the heavens and on the earth,
00:03:22 “the things visible and the things invisible,
00:03:25 “whether they are thrones or lordships or governments or authorities.
00:03:29 “All other things
00:03:31 “have been created through him and for him.
00:03:36 “Also, he is before all other things,
00:03:39 and by means of him all other things were made to exist.”
00:03:44 Well, yes, as the master worker,
00:03:47 Jesus was used by his Father
00:03:50 in the creation of the universe
00:03:53 and all of the things in it.
00:03:55 John 1:3 says:
00:03:58 “All things came into existence through him,
00:04:01 “and apart from him not even one thing
00:04:05 came into existence.”
00:04:07 What an amazing role Jesus played in heaven!
00:04:12 But Jesus was willing to give up that position in heaven
00:04:17 and accept the assignment
00:04:20 that Jehovah had for him here on the earth.
00:04:23 But now, what did accepting that assignment involve?
00:04:27 Now, let’s look at three different things.
00:04:31 We might be finding the lockdown challenging,
00:04:34 especially after seven months.
00:04:37 But consider this:
00:04:39 Jesus had to be in the womb of Mary
00:04:42 as a helpless embryo for nine months.
00:04:45 Can you imagine what a change that was for him?
00:04:49 Let’s consider a second thing:
00:04:51 Jesus had been the Spokesman for Jehovah in heaven,
00:04:55 but now Jesus would have to learn to speak
00:05:00 and be taught by imperfect humans.
00:05:03 Let’s consider a third one:
00:05:05 In heaven, his associates had been faithful,
00:05:09 powerful, heavenly spirit creatures.
00:05:12 But when on earth, who were his associates?
00:05:15 Fishermen, former prostitutes,
00:05:19 just the very common, simple, humble people
00:05:23 whom the Pharisees in John 7:49
00:05:28 called “accursed.”
00:05:30 Well, what do you think?
00:05:32 Was that a major change, for Jesus
00:05:35 to leave his heavenly position and come to the earth?
00:05:38 He truly “emptied himself,”
00:05:41 as Philippians 2:7 says.
00:05:44 But now, here’s the question,
00:05:46 Did Jesus feel that somehow he had lost value with Jehovah
00:05:51 because he had gone through such a huge change
00:05:54 in his assignment and now was a human on earth?
00:05:57 Not for a moment.
00:05:59 But why?
00:06:01 Well, will you open your Bibles?
00:06:03 Let’s read together this thought
00:06:05 in the book of John chapter 8,
00:06:11 and let’s look together here at verse 29.
00:06:16 Jesus said: “And the One who sent me
00:06:21 “is with me;
00:06:23 “he did not abandon me to myself,
00:06:27 because I always do the things pleasing to him.”
00:06:31 Isn’t that a beautiful verse?
00:06:33 You see, Jesus knew that the work that he was doing
00:06:37 was the work his Father had asked him to do.
00:06:41 It was not the same work that he had done when he was in heaven,
00:06:45 but he was still always doing
00:06:48 the things that were pleasing to his Father.
00:06:51 And for that reason, Jesus knew in his heart
00:06:55 that Jehovah God would certainly never abandon him.
00:07:00 He kept busy working hard
00:07:03 in his present assignment, not focusing
00:07:07 on what he had done in the past.
00:07:10 Well now, brothers and sisters, what do we learn from this?
00:07:14 We’ve all had some changes
00:07:17 (some of them even major changes)
00:07:19 in our assignments because of the pandemic.
00:07:22 But our primary goal has never changed.
00:07:25 Just like Jesus, we continually seek to do the things
00:07:30 pleasing to our heavenly Father, Jehovah.
00:07:33 Now, we can’t go from door to door right now.
00:07:36 And we can’t do public witnessing,
00:07:38 and we can’t meet at our Kingdom Halls or Assembly Halls, and so on.
00:07:43 But because we all love Jehovah,
00:07:47 we find ways, even in the midst of this pandemic,
00:07:51 to do things that please him.
00:07:53 Now, The Watchtower made an interesting comment.
00:07:56 The Watchtower  of August 2020,
00:07:58 page 25—here’s what it said:
00:08:01 “Do you get discouraged
00:08:03 “because you currently do not have the same privileges
00:08:06 “of service that you had in the past?
00:08:09 “If so, you will be happier
00:08:12 “if you change your focus and concentrate
00:08:15 “on what you can do right now
00:08:18 “to serve Jehovah and your brothers.
00:08:21 “Stay busy, using your gifts and abilities to help others,
00:08:25 and you will find joy as you build up the congregation.”
00:08:30 Well, that’s what we’re all trying to do.
00:08:33 And Jehovah loves us because we’re trying,
00:08:37 and he blesses our efforts.
00:08:40 Now, take this experience that one sister had in the United States.
00:08:44 She had sent out some letters as a part of her ministry,
00:08:48 and imagine how surprised this dear sister was
00:08:51 to receive a letter from a lady that we’re going to call Mary.
00:08:56 Here’s what this letter said:
00:08:58 “Hello, my name is Mary,
00:09:01 “and I want to thank you for sending me a beautiful letter.
00:09:04 “I was a Jehovah’s Witness between the ages of 9 and 12.
00:09:09 “My mother was a full-time pioneer.
00:09:12 “We would go door to door daily.
00:09:16 “But as young as I was and already having the taste
00:09:19 “of birthdays and holidays, I left my mom to live with my dad.
00:09:24 “My mom pioneered for over 25 years.
00:09:27 “She died in 2007.
00:09:30 “Though at my young age I was not close to her,
00:09:33 “in my adult years, we became best friends.
00:09:36 “To her dying day, she would tell me,
00:09:38 “‘Mary, return to Jehovah.’
00:09:41 “I just never felt I could live up to the standards.
00:09:45 “I didn’t want to be a hypocrite.
00:09:46 “That’s my big issue in not studying.
00:09:48 “You can’t keep one toe in.
00:09:50 “It’s all or nothing.
00:09:52 “After my mom died, at her memorial,
00:09:55 “she had a sister give me a Bible.
00:09:58 “And on the front of the Bible she inscribed:
00:10:00 “‘To Mary, from Mom.
00:10:03 “Return to me in Paradise.’
00:10:07 “I want to see her so bad,
00:10:09 “and I know the only way to do so is to return to Jehovah, but I get scared.
00:10:14 “What if I can’t do it right?
00:10:16 “I don’t want to mess up.
00:10:18 “Every night, I say my prayers to Jehovah as I have done.
00:10:22 “But on August 19, 2020, I said my prayers, but this time I asked Jehovah:
00:10:27 “‘Jehovah, you know how I feel, and you know my heart.
00:10:31 “I want to connect to a church, or a religion, to praise you.’
00:10:34 “I said: ‘Jehovah, you know me.
00:10:36 “It almost has to be a brick to hit me to understand what’s right.’
00:10:41 “On August 20th, the very next day,
00:10:45 “I went to get the mail, and I received your letter.
00:10:48 “I could not believe it.
00:10:50 “I was so shocked  that I actually sat down and thought:
00:10:53 “‘Wow! Now what do I do?’
00:10:55 “Jehovah answered; now I need to follow through, and I’m nervous.
00:11:00 “I hope that you can help me  take the steps I need to take.
00:11:04 “Again, I’m scared, but I hope that I can make the changes I need to make.
00:11:09 Sincerely, Mary.”
00:11:13 Well, that’s the power of one letter.
00:11:17 It’s true, we’ve had to press that “pause button”
00:11:21 on many of the assignments that we have just loved doing.
00:11:24 But does that mean that we’ve lost value with Jehovah?
00:11:28 Jehovah is still with us.
00:11:31 We have not lost any value with him,
00:11:34 and he is not going to abandon us.
00:11:37 So, what do we need to do?
00:11:39 Like Jesus, let’s not focus on what we used to do,
00:11:43 but instead, let’s do everything we can do right now
00:11:48 to do all the things pleasing
00:11:50 to our wonderful heavenly Father, Jehovah.

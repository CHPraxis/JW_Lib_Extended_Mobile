00:00:01.551 --> 00:00:06.289 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Be transformed by making your mind over”

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:10.727 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—what really is involved with this process?

00:00:10.727 --> 00:00:12.829 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, when we analyze this verse

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:15.331 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
at Romans 12:2,

00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:19.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps there are four things initially
that we need to remember.

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:24.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First of all, to whom was Paul writing
under inspiration?

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:28.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he was writing to Christians

00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:30.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were anointed, who were faithful,

00:00:30.747 --> 00:00:33.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet he used an imperative form,

00:00:33.316 --> 00:00:35.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
saying: “<i>Be </i> transformed.”

00:00:35.318 --> 00:00:39.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t say,
“You were already transformed.”

00:00:39.355 --> 00:00:43.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s an interesting point for us
because when we read these words,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s not just a matter of us remembering
what happened to us in the past

00:00:47.831 --> 00:00:49.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we became Christians,

00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:53.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s something
that we need to focus on now.

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:56.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s highlighted by the second point:

00:00:56.406 --> 00:00:59.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in the original language,
the verbs used here

00:00:59.843 --> 00:01:02.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
indicate a continual process,

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:06.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just something that happens once
and that’s it.

00:01:06.783 --> 00:01:08.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the third point:

00:01:08.785 --> 00:01:12.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it indicates a complete change.

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:15.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, many of us remember
that the Greek word here

00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:18.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
involves a complete change.

00:01:18.194 --> 00:01:21.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Metamorphosis” is the word
that comes from that.

00:01:21.064 --> 00:01:25.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that reminds us of a caterpillar
changing into a butterfly.

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, by this, we’re not inferring
that we all have to become butterflies.

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:33.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the point highlighted is
that it’s a complete change

00:01:33.543 --> 00:01:37.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from something that is one form to another.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in a similar way,

00:01:39.582 --> 00:01:41.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with regard to our personality,

00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:44.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is not just a superficial change,

00:01:44.921 --> 00:01:47.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as if we were changing our clothing

00:01:47.223 --> 00:01:51.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, rather, a deep-down change
that involves our personality.

00:01:51.795 --> 00:01:55.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we change from one person to another.

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, this takes time.

00:01:58.635 --> 00:02:01.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s the fourth point
we need to keep in mind:

00:02:01.437 --> 00:02:03.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a gradual process.

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not always is it just completely progressing
in a positive sense.

00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:10.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes, for many of us,

00:02:10.346 --> 00:02:13.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we make some progress
and then slip back a little,

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then we make some further progress.

00:02:15.752 --> 00:02:19.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the main thing is
that we’re making progress.

00:02:19.155 --> 00:02:23.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, this is not just something
that you do one time, and that’s it forever.

00:02:23.893 --> 00:02:26.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s highlighted by an experience

00:02:26.696 --> 00:02:30.433 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in <i>The Watchtower</i>  back in 1977

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:34.737 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of a brother, Harry Yoshikawa, from Hawaii.

00:02:34.737 --> 00:02:37.841 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He was a very large Japanese brother.

00:02:37.841 --> 00:02:41.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But before coming into the truth,
he was a street brawler.

00:02:41.611 --> 00:02:44.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, in fact, the article
(his life experience) was

00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:48.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“From Street Brawler to Christian Minister.”

00:02:48.952 --> 00:02:52.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Harry was trained in the martial arts.

00:02:52.288 --> 00:02:56.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was trained in boxing,
and he just enjoyed fighting other people.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But after serving in the military
for a while,

00:02:59.462 --> 00:03:02.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
eventually he came in contact with the truth,

00:03:02.298 --> 00:03:05.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he started to make changes.

00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:08.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And his life story
perhaps helps us to realize

00:03:08.004 --> 00:03:10.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what’s involved with these changes.

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:14.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, of course, he stopped drinking;
he stopped fighting.

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:18.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Harry goes on to tell us
about the first day that he went witnessing.

00:03:18.748 --> 00:03:22.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was in a market area,
holding up the <i>Awake!</i>  magazine.

00:03:22.752 --> 00:03:26.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he was calling out, “Read the <i>Awake!”</i>

00:03:26.556 --> 00:03:31.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, all of a sudden,
some smart person said to him:

00:03:31.427 --> 00:03:36.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’m wide awake so I don’t need
that trashy magazine.”

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:38.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Harry says that at that point,

00:03:38.601 --> 00:03:41.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his old personality returned to him.

00:03:41.804 --> 00:03:45.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He yelled out: “You’re wide awake, huh?

00:03:45.375 --> 00:03:47.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, you won’t be for long.

00:03:47.377 --> 00:03:50.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll be sleeping shortly.”

00:03:50.013 --> 00:03:55.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Harry took a blow at this man,

00:03:55.018 --> 00:03:57.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who promptly ran,

00:03:57.053 --> 00:04:00.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Harry chased him for two blocks.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the other brother who was with Harry
chased after him,

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:08.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fortunately the first man
was a fast runner.

00:04:08.865 --> 00:04:11.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when the other brother
caught up with Harry, he said,

00:04:11.534 --> 00:04:14.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Harry, what would you have done
if you caught the man?”

00:04:14.604 --> 00:04:16.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said, “I would have beat him up.”

00:04:16.606 --> 00:04:18.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the brother tried to reason with Harry,

00:04:18.708 --> 00:04:23.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, just imagine what a reproach
this would be on Jehovah’s name,

00:04:23.212 --> 00:04:25.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, if the police came.”

00:04:25.214 --> 00:04:26.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Harry said: “No, it wouldn’t be.

00:04:26.883 --> 00:04:28.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I wouldn’t tell him I was a Witness.

00:04:28.384 --> 00:04:30.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d say I was a Pentecostal.”

00:04:32.722 --> 00:04:35.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Harry hadn’t quite made

00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:37.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that complete change.

00:04:37.327 --> 00:04:41.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But later, you see in this picture,
as it appeared in <i>The Watchtower,</i>

00:04:41.264 --> 00:04:43.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here’s Harry working with his wife,

00:04:43.666 --> 00:04:47.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doing something that many Asian men
would find very hard to do,

00:04:47.637 --> 00:04:49.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helping her in the kitchen.

00:04:49.739 --> 00:04:54.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for many years, Harry and his wife
served very faithfully in the circuit work.

00:04:54.477 --> 00:04:56.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the change was so different

00:04:56.746 --> 00:05:00.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that many of the brothers and sisters
who heard this story about Harry

00:05:00.984 --> 00:05:04.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—who was called, by the way,
Tiny the Bruiser—

00:05:04.153 --> 00:05:08.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t really believe
that he was such a violent man previously.

00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we learn from this?

00:05:11.327 --> 00:05:14.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That this transformation process

00:05:14.497 --> 00:05:17.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may involve some drastic changes
in the beginning

00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:20.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that outwardly
appear to make someone different.

00:05:20.837 --> 00:05:23.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But gradually over the years,

00:05:23.506 --> 00:05:27.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to continue on making these changes,

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
transforming our thinking and our desires.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why is that such a challenge?

00:05:32.682 --> 00:05:34.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we know for a start

00:05:34.817 --> 00:05:39.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have a tendency
to do what’s wrong because we’re sinful.

00:05:39.188 --> 00:05:42.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are all sorts of wrong attitudes
and thoughts

00:05:42.792 --> 00:05:46.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are perhaps lying dormant
in our personality.

00:05:46.863 --> 00:05:48.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could be a matter of prejudice;

00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:50.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it could be a racial viewpoint,

00:05:50.933 --> 00:05:54.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hatred, pride, greed.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And these things we could liken
to weeds in a garden.

00:05:57.907 --> 00:06:00.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Any of us who have done gardening realize

00:06:00.843 --> 00:06:03.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that just because you took the weeds out
one time,

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t mean that’s a onetime effort,
does it?

00:06:07.183 --> 00:06:09.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They tend to grow back.

00:06:09.218 --> 00:06:12.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we constantly need to be on the watch
to make sure

00:06:12.688 --> 00:06:16.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that these weedlike tendencies, or traits,
that we may have

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:18.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t grow back.

00:06:18.995 --> 00:06:23.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, the other thing is
we’re surrounded by Satan and his world.

00:06:23.733 --> 00:06:27.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Satan’s world is always trying
to influence us.

00:06:27.503 --> 00:06:30.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take our Bibles
and turn together, please,

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the book of Ephesians

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:37.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Ephesians 4:18.

00:06:37.146 --> 00:06:41.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice here
how it describes Satan’s world.

00:06:41.317 --> 00:06:45.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the opposite to what we should be doing.

00:06:45.354 --> 00:06:48.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “They are in darkness mentally

00:06:48.391 --> 00:06:51.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and alienated from the life
that belongs to God,

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:54.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because of the ignorance that is in them,

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:59.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the insensitivity
[or, the “dulling,” ftn.] of their hearts.”

00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:04.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Satan is trying to muddy the waters,
we might say,

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:07.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trying to get us mentally to be dull

00:07:07.977 --> 00:07:11.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to not be receptive to God’s Word.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s why we need to continue

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “be transformed
by making [our] mind over.”

00:07:17.887 --> 00:07:20.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can we do that?

00:07:20.256 --> 00:07:24.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’re not going to discuss at depth

00:07:24.127 --> 00:07:28.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the physical explanation
with regard to neurons and synapses

00:07:28.631 --> 00:07:31.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(this is early in the morning for that),

00:07:31.134 --> 00:07:33.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we do need to understand

00:07:33.136 --> 00:07:35.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a little bit of how the mind works.

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:38.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, basically we can say

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that when we have new thoughts,

00:07:40.109 --> 00:07:43.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or new concepts,
that come into our mind,

00:07:43.579 --> 00:07:47.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s as if symbolically
there are little pathways

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:50.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are formed in our mind.

00:07:50.119 --> 00:07:53.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the more that we think
about certain things,

00:07:53.289 --> 00:07:56.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more solid, we might say,
or more permanent,

00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:58.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these pathways become.

00:07:58.761 --> 00:08:02.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So maybe we could illustrate it this way:

00:08:02.732 --> 00:08:06.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, as we’re starting
to learn new things,

00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:09.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s as if we’re going through the jungle.

00:08:09.939 --> 00:08:12.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we’re cutting our way
through the jungle,

00:08:12.742 --> 00:08:15.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at first, it is very difficult.

00:08:15.211 --> 00:08:19.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps, we could say,
it’s like learning a new language.

00:08:19.315 --> 00:08:24.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all know (if we’ve tried to do that)
that at first, it is very, very difficult.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like cutting your way
through a jungle path.

00:08:28.024 --> 00:08:32.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or if you’re trying to learn something new,
like driving an automobile,

00:08:32.395 --> 00:08:34.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it can seem very difficult.

00:08:34.397 --> 00:08:35.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what do we realize?

00:08:35.965 --> 00:08:39.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more often we do something,
then what happens?

00:08:39.302 --> 00:08:42.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These symbolic pathways in our minds

00:08:42.038 --> 00:08:45.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
become easier to walk along.

00:08:45.041 --> 00:08:49.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand, of course,
if we do something once

00:08:49.178 --> 00:08:52.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we don’t continue to do it, what happens?

00:08:52.582 --> 00:08:54.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s as if the jungle grows back,

00:08:54.984 --> 00:08:58.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it becomes difficult to do things again.

00:08:58.721 --> 00:09:02.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the point for us to get from this?

00:09:02.425 --> 00:09:05.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in our personal study, our meditation,

00:09:05.695 --> 00:09:08.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when we try to apply
the things that we learn,

00:09:08.898 --> 00:09:11.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we shouldn’t always look for new things.

00:09:11.601 --> 00:09:15.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, sometimes we might say:
“Well, I’ve read that publication already.

00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:17.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t need to reread it.”

00:09:17.273 --> 00:09:18.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, you do.

00:09:18.774 --> 00:09:19.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:09:19.942 --> 00:09:24.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because just because you cut
a path in your mind through the jungle

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t mean to say that that path

00:09:27.216 --> 00:09:30.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is always going to remain easy
to pass through.

00:09:30.753 --> 00:09:34.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, it’s good for us to go back again

00:09:34.156 --> 00:09:37.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and go over and over the same things.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what happens?

00:09:39.095 --> 00:09:41.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That symbolic pathway in our mind

00:09:41.731 --> 00:09:44.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
becomes easier for us to go along,

00:09:44.066 --> 00:09:46.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can truly say

00:09:46.168 --> 00:09:50.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have been “transformed
by making [our] mind over.”

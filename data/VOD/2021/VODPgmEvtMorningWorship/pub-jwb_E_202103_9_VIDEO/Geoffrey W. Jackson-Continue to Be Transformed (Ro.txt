00:00:01 “Be transformed by making your mind over”
00:00:06 —what really is involved with this process?
00:00:10 Well, when we analyze this verse
00:00:12 at Romans 12:2,
00:00:15 perhaps there are four things initially that we need to remember.
00:00:19 First of all, to whom was Paul writing under inspiration?
00:00:24 Well, he was writing to Christians
00:00:28 who were anointed, who were faithful,
00:00:30 and yet he used an imperative form,
00:00:33 saying: “Be  transformed.”
00:00:35 He didn’t say, “You were already transformed.”
00:00:39 So that’s an interesting point for us because when we read these words,
00:00:43 it’s not just a matter of us remembering what happened to us in the past
00:00:47 when we became Christians,
00:00:49 but it’s something that we need to focus on now.
00:00:53 And that’s highlighted by the second point:
00:00:56 that in the original language, the verbs used here
00:00:59 indicate a continual process,
00:01:02 not just something that happens once and that’s it.
00:01:06 And the third point:
00:01:08 that it indicates a complete change.
00:01:12 Now, many of us remember that the Greek word here
00:01:15 involves a complete change.
00:01:18 “Metamorphosis” is the word that comes from that.
00:01:21 And that reminds us of a caterpillar changing into a butterfly.
00:01:25 Now, by this, we’re not inferring that we all have to become butterflies.
00:01:29 But the point highlighted is that it’s a complete change
00:01:33 from something that is one form to another.
00:01:37 So in a similar way,
00:01:39 with regard to our personality,
00:01:41 this is not just a superficial change,
00:01:44 as if we were changing our clothing
00:01:47 but, rather, a deep-down change that involves our personality.
00:01:51 So we change from one person to another.
00:01:55 Of course, this takes time.
00:01:58 And that’s the fourth point we need to keep in mind:
00:02:01 It’s a gradual process.
00:02:03 Not always is it just completely progressing in a positive sense.
00:02:08 Sometimes, for many of us,
00:02:10 we make some progress and then slip back a little,
00:02:13 and then we make some further progress.
00:02:15 But the main thing is that we’re making progress.
00:02:19 Yes, this is not just something that you do one time, and that’s it forever.
00:02:23 That’s highlighted by an experience
00:02:26 in The Watchtower  back in 1977
00:02:30 of a brother, Harry Yoshikawa, from Hawaii.
00:02:34 He was a very large Japanese brother.
00:02:37 But before coming into the truth, he was a street brawler.
00:02:41 And, in fact, the article (his life experience) was
00:02:44 “From Street Brawler to Christian Minister.”
00:02:48 Now, Harry was trained in the martial arts.
00:02:52 He was trained in boxing, and he just enjoyed fighting other people.
00:02:56 But after serving in the military for a while,
00:02:59 eventually he came in contact with the truth,
00:03:02 and he started to make changes.
00:03:05 And his life story perhaps helps us to realize
00:03:08 what’s involved with these changes.
00:03:10 So, of course, he stopped drinking; he stopped fighting.
00:03:14 But Harry goes on to tell us about the first day that he went witnessing.
00:03:18 He was in a market area, holding up the Awake!  magazine.
00:03:22 And he was calling out, “Read the Awake!”
00:03:26 Well, all of a sudden, some smart person said to him:
00:03:31 “I’m wide awake so I don’t need that trashy magazine.”
00:03:36 Well, Harry says that at that point,
00:03:38 his old personality returned to him.
00:03:41 He yelled out: “You’re wide awake, huh?
00:03:45 “Well, you won’t be for long.
00:03:47 You’ll be sleeping shortly.”
00:03:50 So Harry took a blow at this man,
00:03:55 who promptly ran,
00:03:57 and Harry chased him for two blocks.
00:04:00 Now, the other brother who was with Harry chased after him,
00:04:05 and fortunately the first man was a fast runner.
00:04:08 And when the other brother caught up with Harry, he said,
00:04:11 “Harry, what would you have done if you caught the man?”
00:04:14 He said, “I would have beat him up.”
00:04:16 And the brother tried to reason with Harry,
00:04:18 “Well, just imagine what a reproach this would be on Jehovah’s name,
00:04:23 I mean, if the police came.”
00:04:25 And Harry said: “No, it wouldn’t be.
00:04:26 “I wouldn’t tell him I was a Witness.
00:04:28 I’d say I was a Pentecostal.”
00:04:32 Well, Harry hadn’t quite made
00:04:35 that complete change.
00:04:37 But later, you see in this picture, as it appeared in The Watchtower,
00:04:41 here’s Harry working with his wife,
00:04:43 doing something that many Asian men would find very hard to do,
00:04:47 helping her in the kitchen.
00:04:49 And for many years, Harry and his wife served very faithfully in the circuit work.
00:04:54 And the change was so different
00:04:56 that many of the brothers and sisters who heard this story about Harry
00:05:00 —who was called, by the way, Tiny the Bruiser—
00:05:04 didn’t really believe that he was such a violent man previously.
00:05:08 So, what do we learn from this?
00:05:11 That this transformation process
00:05:14 may involve some drastic changes in the beginning
00:05:17 that outwardly appear to make someone different.
00:05:20 But gradually over the years,
00:05:23 we have to continue on making these changes,
00:05:27 transforming our thinking and our desires.
00:05:30 Now, why is that such a challenge?
00:05:32 Well, we know for a start
00:05:34 that we have a tendency to do what’s wrong because we’re sinful.
00:05:39 There are all sorts of wrong attitudes and thoughts
00:05:42 that are perhaps lying dormant in our personality.
00:05:46 It could be a matter of prejudice;
00:05:48 it could be a racial viewpoint,
00:05:50 hatred, pride, greed.
00:05:54 And these things we could liken to weeds in a garden.
00:05:57 Any of us who have done gardening realize
00:06:00 that just because you took the weeds out one time,
00:06:03 doesn’t mean that’s a onetime effort, does it?
00:06:07 They tend to grow back.
00:06:09 So we constantly need to be on the watch to make sure
00:06:12 that these weedlike tendencies, or traits, that we may have
00:06:16 don’t grow back.
00:06:18 And, of course, the other thing is we’re surrounded by Satan and his world.
00:06:23 And Satan’s world is always trying to influence us.
00:06:27 Let’s take our Bibles and turn together, please,
00:06:30 to the book of Ephesians
00:06:32 —Ephesians 4:18.
00:06:37 And notice here how it describes Satan’s world.
00:06:41 It’s the opposite to what we should be doing.
00:06:45 It says: “They are in darkness mentally
00:06:48 “and alienated from the life that belongs to God,
00:06:51 “because of the ignorance that is in them,
00:06:54 because of the insensitivity [or, the “dulling,” ftn.] of their hearts.”
00:06:59 So Satan is trying to muddy the waters, we might say,
00:07:04 trying to get us mentally to be dull
00:07:07 —to not be receptive to God’s Word.
00:07:11 So that’s why we need to continue
00:07:13 to “be transformed by making [our] mind over.”
00:07:17 But how can we do that?
00:07:20 Well, we’re not going to discuss at depth
00:07:24 the physical explanation with regard to neurons and synapses
00:07:28 (this is early in the morning for that),
00:07:31 but we do need to understand
00:07:33 a little bit of how the mind works.
00:07:35 You see, basically we can say
00:07:38 that when we have new thoughts,
00:07:40 or new concepts, that come into our mind,
00:07:43 it’s as if symbolically there are little pathways
00:07:47 that are formed in our mind.
00:07:50 And the more that we think about certain things,
00:07:53 the more solid, we might say, or more permanent,
00:07:56 these pathways become.
00:07:58 So maybe we could illustrate it this way:
00:08:02 You see, as we’re starting to learn new things,
00:08:06 it’s as if we’re going through the jungle.
00:08:09 And as we’re cutting our way through the jungle,
00:08:12 at first, it is very difficult.
00:08:15 Perhaps, we could say, it’s like learning a new language.
00:08:19 We all know (if we’ve tried to do that) that at first, it is very, very difficult.
00:08:24 It’s like cutting your way through a jungle path.
00:08:28 Or if you’re trying to learn something new, like driving an automobile,
00:08:32 it can seem very difficult.
00:08:34 But what do we realize?
00:08:35 The more often we do something, then what happens?
00:08:39 These symbolic pathways in our minds
00:08:42 become easier to walk along.
00:08:45 On the other hand, of course, if we do something once
00:08:49 but we don’t continue to do it, what happens?
00:08:52 It’s as if the jungle grows back,
00:08:54 and it becomes difficult to do things again.
00:08:58 So, what’s the point for us to get from this?
00:09:02 Well, in our personal study, our meditation,
00:09:05 and when we try to apply the things that we learn,
00:09:08 we shouldn’t always look for new things.
00:09:11 You see, sometimes we might say: “Well, I’ve read that publication already.
00:09:15 I don’t need to reread it.”
00:09:17 Yes, you do.
00:09:18 Why?
00:09:19 Because just because you cut a path in your mind through the jungle
00:09:24 doesn’t mean to say that that path
00:09:27 is always going to remain easy to pass through.
00:09:30 No, it’s good for us to go back again
00:09:34 and go over and over the same things.
00:09:37 And what happens?
00:09:39 That symbolic pathway in our mind
00:09:41 becomes easier for us to go along,
00:09:44 and we can truly say
00:09:46 that we have been “transformed by making [our] mind over.”

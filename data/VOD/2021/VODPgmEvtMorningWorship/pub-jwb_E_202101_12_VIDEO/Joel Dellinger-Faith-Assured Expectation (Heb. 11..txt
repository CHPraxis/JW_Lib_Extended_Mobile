00:00:01 Our focus today is
00:00:02 on two beautiful Christian qualities
00:00:04 that are married to each other
00:00:06 —that go hand in hand—
00:00:08 faith and hope.
00:00:10 Why is it so important for you and me
00:00:12 to strengthen our faith in what we hope for?
00:00:17 Please open your Bible with me to Hebrews chapter 12,
00:00:21 and I’d like you to focus on verse 1.
00:00:24 Of course, we know in the context in the previous chapter, Hebrews chapter 11,
00:00:28 the apostle has just defined faith,
00:00:31 and then he went on to recount many examples of men and women
00:00:35 who exercised strong faith and kept their focus on their future hope.
00:00:39 And they did so throughout the course of their entire life,
00:00:43 even to death.
00:00:45 But now notice the exhortation that the apostle builds on,
00:00:49 as found at Hebrews 12:1,
00:00:51 and we’ll also read the first part of verse 2:
00:00:55 “So, then, because we have such a great cloud of witnesses surrounding us,
00:01:00 “let us also throw off every weight
00:01:03 “and the sin that easily entangles us,
00:01:07 “and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,
00:01:10 “as we look intently at the Chief Agent
00:01:13 and Perfecter of our faith, Jesus.”
00:01:17 Now, in verse 1, Paul mentions
00:01:19 “the sin that easily entangles us.”
00:01:23 What should we visualize?
00:01:25 Well, that Greek expression could help us to picture
00:01:28 a runner in a race who has too many clothes on.
00:01:33 I’m picturing a man who has on, instead of shorts,
00:01:38 oversized sweatpants
00:01:42 and tennis shoes with his shoes unlaced.
00:01:45 How easy it would be for him
00:01:48 to trip and fall, to be entangled
00:01:52 in his own clothing and attire!
00:01:56 Well, that’s the word picture that the apostle Paul used
00:01:58 to describe a danger that faces all of us,
00:02:01 including experienced Christians who have a record of faith.
00:02:06 That sin is a lack of faith.
00:02:10 For a newer Christian, it could be
00:02:12 not developing the faith
00:02:15 that we had at the beginning after baptism.
00:02:19 But for an experienced Christian,
00:02:21 that lack of faith could be a loss of once strong faith
00:02:26 that we had in the past.
00:02:29 To that latter point, you might notice in verse 1
00:02:32 that the apostle Paul
00:02:34 —a pillar in the congregation, a man of faith—
00:02:37 includes himself in the exhortation.
00:02:41 He says: “Let us also throw off every weight . . .
00:02:44 let us run with endurance.”
00:02:48 By including himself, Paul was likely admitting
00:02:51 his own inclination —his propensity—
00:02:53 to get easily entangled
00:02:55 in episodes of a momentary weakness of faith.
00:03:00 Well, that’s a powerful lesson for all of us, isn’t it?
00:03:02 All of us need to keep strengthening our faith.
00:03:07 What is more, the Bible makes it clear
00:03:09 that if we get entangled in a momentary loss of faith,
00:03:14 we can recover —and we can recover quickly.
00:03:18 Notice this in an experience that the apostle Peter had.
00:03:21 Open, please, with me to Matthew chapter 14,
00:03:26 and cast your eyes to verse 24.
00:03:31 Now, visualize the scene:
00:03:33 It’s early in the morning before dawn.
00:03:36 Peter and some of the disciples are struggling to row their boat
00:03:40 in the Sea of Galilee during a storm.
00:03:43 Suddenly, they see Jesus walking on the sea.
00:03:46 In verse 26, when they catch sight of him,
00:03:50 the Bible tells us “they cried out in their fear.”
00:03:54 Peter and those disciples —hardy fishermen, manly men—
00:03:59 “cried out in their fear.”
00:04:02 In verse 27, Jesus tells them: “Take courage!
00:04:06 It is I; do not be afraid.”
00:04:09 Then, what did Peter do?
00:04:11 Verse 28: “Lord, if it is you,
00:04:14 command me to come to you over the waters.”
00:04:18 Well, when Jesus told Peter to come, what did Peter do?
00:04:20 He got out of the boat, and he started walking on the water
00:04:23 toward Jesus.
00:04:25 Did that take faith?
00:04:27 Indeed!
00:04:28 But soon after, we know,
00:04:30 as the account goes on to say, Peter began to sink.
00:04:33 Why?
00:04:34 Notice the opening of verse 30:
00:04:37 “But looking at the windstorm,
00:04:40 he became afraid.”
00:04:42 When Peter lost his focus on Jesus, his faith wavered.
00:04:47 This was a momentary period of weak faith.
00:04:51 The same can happen to any of us, including experienced Christians.
00:04:54 A loss of focus can lead to a loss of faith.
00:04:59 Have you gone through or are you going through
00:05:02 some storms in your life?
00:05:04 The wind and the waves
00:05:06 that were surrounding Peter as he walked on the water
00:05:09 could be compared to the trials and the temptations that we face
00:05:12 in our dedicated service to Jehovah.
00:05:15 Thanks to our faith, you and I are doing something
00:05:18 that for the majority seems impossible
00:05:21 —serving Jehovah and having a clean standing
00:05:23 and a dedicated relationship
00:05:25 in the last days of this difficult system of things.
00:05:30 But winds and waves are coming our way.
00:05:32 Perhaps it’s an unexpected illness
00:05:34 for us or for a close family member or friend.
00:05:38 Maybe it’s the fear that comes from the economic pressures
00:05:42 that are upon many of our brothers and sisters
00:05:45 —not just in Venezuela, not just in Africa,
00:05:49 but in all parts of the earth
00:05:51 where there’s crisis in economies.
00:05:54 Or maybe it’s the waves of persecution
00:05:57 that come upon our brothers in all places
00:05:59 —not just in Russia but perhaps right within the family.
00:06:04 Or what about adjustments that might affect our privileges of service?
00:06:09 You know, a new work assignment here at Bethel
00:06:11 or in the field or in the congregation
00:06:13 or a change of assignment
00:06:15 that takes us out of the comfort zone of special full-time service
00:06:20 could prove to be a storm for us
00:06:23 that causes us to be afraid.
00:06:26 One brother who had his heart set on being a missionary
00:06:29 found that after many years in missionary service,
00:06:33 he and his wife had to go home.
00:06:36 “For the first time in my life,” he says,
00:06:39 “I lost all sense of direction.
00:06:42 “I had no goals.
00:06:43 Nothing seemed important anymore.”
00:06:47 Well, what happened?
00:06:48 A temporary, momentary weakness of faith.
00:06:53 But now, let’s dwell further on Peter’s experience
00:06:56 as you look back at verse 30.
00:06:59 What was it specifically that caused Peter to sink?
00:07:03 Was it a big gust or a big wave?
00:07:07 No.
00:07:09 It was his looking at the windstorm
00:07:13 that caused him to become afraid.
00:07:15 It was his change in focus.
00:07:19 Likewise, if we lose our focus
00:07:22 and dwell too much on our storms
00:07:24 —circumstances in our day-to-day living in this system of things—
00:07:29 and we look at how powerful those storms are,
00:07:33 we could begin doubting that Jehovah will support us.
00:07:37 But now notice what happens next in verse 30.
00:07:41 The Bible says: “And when he started to sink,
00:07:43 he cried out: ‘Lord, save me!’”
00:07:47 What Peter did next, after his momentary loss of faith,
00:07:52 is really a powerful lesson for all of us.
00:07:55 Peter quickly recovered.
00:07:57 Now, we know from what the Bible tells us that Peter was a capable swimmer.
00:08:02 His natural inclination could have been
00:08:04 to swim back to the boat because he was sinking,
00:08:07 but he didn’t do that.
00:08:08 He didn’t depend on himself.
00:08:10 He refocused on Jesus,
00:08:14 and he took Jesus’ outstretched hand.
00:08:18 Well, what’s the lesson for all of us?
00:08:20 If we sense that our faith is ever weakening
00:08:24 or we’re starting to give way to fear, we need to imitate Peter’s example.
00:08:28 We can recover quickly.
00:08:31 We might look back at Hebrews 12:2
00:08:36 —Hebrews 12:2,
00:08:38 and notice how the apostle Paul,
00:08:40 in encouraging us
00:08:42 not to get entangled in a lack of faith,
00:08:46 says that we need to “look intently at . . . Jesus”
00:08:49 and verse 3: “Consider closely
00:08:51 “the one who has endured such hostile speech from sinners . . . ,
00:08:55 so that you may not get tired and give up.”
00:09:00 ‘Looking intently’ and ‘considering closely’
00:09:03 remind us that we need to refocus on Jesus.
00:09:07 What was it that gave Jesus unbreakable faith?
00:09:11 Strong hope.
00:09:13 Well, that same account tells us
00:09:15 that he looked ahead at “the joy that was set before him.”
00:09:18 We need to focus on our future blessings.
00:09:22 One of our Watchtower  articles said this:
00:09:25 “Put yourself in the picture by writing down or making a drawing
00:09:28 “of what you hope to do once God has removed this . . . system [of things].
00:09:32 “Make a list of people whom you look forward to meeting when they are resurrected
00:09:36 “and what you would like to discuss with them.
00:09:38 “See these as God’s promises not just to mankind in general
00:09:42 but to you personally.”
00:09:46 Jesus, we know, was convinced that the Bible is God’s Word.
00:09:50 He diligently meditated on God’s words —His precious promises.
00:09:55 We need to do the same as well.
00:09:58 Jesus taught us to pray for holy spirit.
00:10:02 We can ask Jehovah for more faith.
00:10:05 Jehovah will readily respond to such prayers.

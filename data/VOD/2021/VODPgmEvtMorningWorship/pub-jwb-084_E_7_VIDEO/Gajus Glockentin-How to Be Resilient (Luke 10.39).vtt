Mary kept listening to what Jesus was saying.

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:07.524 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
How commendable!

00:00:07.524 --> 00:00:09.693 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
She set the right priorities

00:00:09.693 --> 00:00:12.128 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and is a good example for us.

00:00:12.128 --> 00:00:14.464 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Martha, her sister, however,

00:00:14.464 --> 00:00:16.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
received loving correction from Jesus,

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as our printed comment puts it.

00:00:19.402 --> 00:00:24.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let us, today, put ourselves
in the shoes of Martha for a moment.

00:00:24.407 --> 00:00:28.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She showed great interest in supporting Jesus

00:00:28.511 --> 00:00:32.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by providing him a base during his ministry

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:34.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the difficult area of Judea.

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:36.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now this time,

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:39.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mary and Martha
were probably working together

00:00:39.923 --> 00:00:42.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prepare things for Jesus.

00:00:42.325 --> 00:00:47.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But after Jesus arrived,
Mary stopped helping as our text indicates.

00:00:47.263 --> 00:00:50.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did Martha feel about it?

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now she had to care for everything herself.

00:00:54.037 --> 00:00:57.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we imagine the tension rising

00:00:57.373 --> 00:00:59.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
within Martha’s heart?

00:00:59.743 --> 00:01:02.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The stress level is increased,

00:01:02.746 --> 00:01:06.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and her dear sister
sits and listens to Jesus.

00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:11.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So she asked Jesus to correct Mary,

00:01:11.354 --> 00:01:14.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to order her back to work.

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:18.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to her surprise, she, Martha,
received counsel from Jesus.

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:22.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would we feel in such a situation?

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are doing something well-intentioned

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:29.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, yet, instead of commendation,
we receive counsel.

00:01:29.873 --> 00:01:33.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe our eyes filled with tears.

00:01:33.576 --> 00:01:35.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We feel the pain in our chest.

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might think we can’t breathe anymore.

00:01:39.783 --> 00:01:43.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did Martha think for a moment,
replying to Jesus, saying:

00:01:43.653 --> 00:01:45.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is not fair!

00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:47.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am doing everything to support you,
and now this.

00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:50.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You know, from now on,
I am listening too,

00:01:50.593 --> 00:01:54.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I am curious to find out
who prepares the meals for you.”

00:01:57.534 --> 00:02:02.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we don’t know
what Martha thought and said.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what we do know,
as our printed comment puts it,

00:02:06.342 --> 00:02:10.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she took to heart Jesus’ loving correction.

00:02:10.346 --> 00:02:14.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can help us
to overcome such a painful moment

00:02:14.083 --> 00:02:16.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to progress?

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:18.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The term often used in this connection

00:02:18.955 --> 00:02:21.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is “resilience.”

00:02:21.324 --> 00:02:25.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People who are resilient
are able to recover easily and quickly

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:29.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from unpleasant and damaging events.

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:33.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is like the ability of this piece of metal

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to tolerate pressure

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:38.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and go back to its original form.

00:02:40.143 --> 00:02:44.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us, therefore,
look at three factors that make us resilient

00:02:44.714 --> 00:02:48.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and different from those
who easily give up and surrender.

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:54.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the first factor is facing reality

00:02:54.724 --> 00:02:57.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—facing reality.

00:02:57.093 --> 00:03:00.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us, please,
open to Proverbs chapter 28.

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:05.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The question we are asking ourselves
in a difficult moment is this:

00:03:05.401 --> 00:03:10.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do I truly understand and accept
the reality of my situation?’

00:03:11.174 --> 00:03:14.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here, at Proverbs 28:26,

00:03:14.811 --> 00:03:17.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it starts by saying:

00:03:17.747 --> 00:03:21.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whoever trusts in his own heart

00:03:21.684 --> 00:03:24.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is stupid.”

00:03:24.053 --> 00:03:28.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might tend to put on emotional blinders

00:03:28.892 --> 00:03:30.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see only what we want to see.

00:03:30.894 --> 00:03:35.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many people slip into denial
as a coping mechanism.

00:03:35.698 --> 00:03:40.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the Proverb continues
in the second part, saying:

00:03:40.236 --> 00:03:44.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the one who walks in wisdom

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will escape.”

00:03:46.276 --> 00:03:51.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This means seeing things the way they are.

00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:54.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Facing reality

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—really facing reality is grueling work.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Indeed, it can be unpleasant

00:04:00.023 --> 00:04:03.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and often emotionally wrenching.

00:04:03.426 --> 00:04:06.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Peter had this experience

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:10.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jesus looked at him
after Peter had denied him three times.

00:04:10.934 --> 00:04:14.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter faced reality, went outside,

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
broke down, and wept bitterly.

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:21.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For sure, he was not looking for any excuses.

00:04:21.077 --> 00:04:25.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This experience, as well as other situations
where he received counsel,

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:30.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped him to make progress
and to fulfill his assignments even better.

00:04:31.554 --> 00:04:33.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what is the second factor?

00:04:33.957 --> 00:04:38.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We call it “meaning-making.”

00:04:38.328 --> 00:04:42.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might know people who
under pressure threw up their hands

00:04:42.732 --> 00:04:47.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cried and said,
“Why is this happening to me?”

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such people see themselves as victims,

00:04:50.273 --> 00:04:54.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and living through hardship
does not teach them any lessons.

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:57.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We, however,
based on our Bible knowledge,

00:04:57.947 --> 00:05:01.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
understand why difficulties
and challenging situations

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are sometimes unavoidable.

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:07.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeing the bigger picture adds meaning.

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:10.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This helps us, as a resilient person,

00:05:10.026 --> 00:05:14.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only to endure
an unpleasant situation or a new circumstance

00:05:14.364 --> 00:05:17.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also to look at seeming obstacles

00:05:17.934 --> 00:05:22.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see an opportunity in it.

00:05:22.105 --> 00:05:26.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all know that no one is perfect.

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:30.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone fails at something sometime.

00:05:30.446 --> 00:05:35.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our choice
is the manner in which we respond.

00:05:35.284 --> 00:05:39.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are actively trying
to make the best out of it,

00:05:39.722 --> 00:05:43.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looking ahead rather than behind,

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:46.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
setting goals
—maybe new goals.

00:05:46.696 --> 00:05:49.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might remember how Brother Harold King

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:52.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showed this resilient disposition

00:05:52.535 --> 00:05:54.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he was in solitary confinement.

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:58.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did he give meaning
to his difficult situation

00:05:58.341 --> 00:06:00.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by making the best out of it?

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said:

00:06:02.678 --> 00:06:06.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I arranged
for a program of ‘preaching’ activity.

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:11.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But to whom does one preach
when in solitary confinement?

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I decided that I would build up
some appropriate Bible sermons

00:06:15.258 --> 00:06:17.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from the things I could remember

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then preach to imaginary characters.”

00:06:22.965 --> 00:06:25.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in our context, we can say

00:06:25.435 --> 00:06:28.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meaning-making is like building a bridge

00:06:28.871 --> 00:06:32.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from present day hardships
to a better future.

00:06:32.108 --> 00:06:34.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By means of this bridge,

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we make a difficult situation manageable.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We remove the sense
that the present is overwhelming.

00:06:43.886 --> 00:06:46.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s look at the third factor:

00:06:46.722 --> 00:06:50.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a balanced view of ourselves.

00:06:50.726 --> 00:06:54.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we said at the beginning
that we have to face reality

00:06:54.197 --> 00:06:57.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which can go along with feelings
of sadness and disappointment.

00:06:57.533 --> 00:06:59.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As resilient people,

00:06:59.535 --> 00:07:01.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we don’t take a failure

00:07:01.604 --> 00:07:05.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a challenging situation personally.

00:07:06.476 --> 00:07:09.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us, please, open to Romans chapter 7,

00:07:09.312 --> 00:07:11.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we want to demonstrate this point

00:07:11.447 --> 00:07:15.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of the example of the apostle Paul.

00:07:15.618 --> 00:07:20.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times,
he felt discouraged over his weaknesses.

00:07:20.356 --> 00:07:22.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here in chapter 7,

00:07:22.558 --> 00:07:25.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he describes the pain of conscience

00:07:25.094 --> 00:07:30.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he suffered
because of feeling captive to sin.

00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:33.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then in verse 24,

00:07:33.436 --> 00:07:35.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he cries out, saying:

00:07:35.771 --> 00:07:38.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Miserable man that I am!”

00:07:41.177 --> 00:07:44.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Evidently, though, Paul realized

00:07:44.947 --> 00:07:48.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his imperfection did not define him.

00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:51.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nine years later,

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his second letter to his friend Timothy,

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:56.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shortly before his death,

00:07:56.726 --> 00:08:00.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he stated
his personal conclusion of the matter

00:08:00.096 --> 00:08:04.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here at 2 Timothy 4:7.

00:08:04.734 --> 00:08:07.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said:

00:08:07.303 --> 00:08:11.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have fought the fine fight,

00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:16.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have run the race to the finish,

00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:20.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have observed the faith.”

00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:26.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul’s problems and inner struggle
did not miraculously disappear.

00:08:26.789 --> 00:08:29.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, it did not prevent him

00:08:29.058 --> 00:08:33.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from accomplishing
remarkable things in Jehovah’s service.

00:08:33.663 --> 00:08:36.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, therefore, we do not berate ourselves

00:08:36.232 --> 00:08:38.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with self-defeating language,

00:08:38.234 --> 00:08:40.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as “I’m a failure”

00:08:40.903 --> 00:08:43.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

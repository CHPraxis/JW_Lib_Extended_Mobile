00:00:01 Now, in its entirety, Proverbs 21:5 says:
00:00:05 “The plans of the diligent
00:00:07 “surely lead to success,
00:00:09 “but all who are hasty
00:00:11 surely head for poverty.”
00:00:13 Now, that is not a Bible law;
00:00:16 it’s a Bible principle.
00:00:18 And before we discuss how Proverbs 21:5 might be applied,
00:00:23 let’s be reminded again of the difference between a law and a principle.
00:00:27 We’ve had articles on it.
00:00:28 We’ve had it discussed at our circuit assembly.
00:00:30 But still there are some in our congregations
00:00:32 who would have a hard time making the distinction between the two.
00:00:36 A principle, just one principle, can be broadly applied
00:00:40 to many different situations and decisions in life,
00:00:44 whereas a Bible law addresses
00:00:47 just one very precise, very specific, action.
00:00:50 You could turn to 1 Corinthians 6:9, 10
00:00:55 concerning some areas of life where Jehovah has explicit commands, or laws.
00:01:00 And here at 1 Corinthians 6:9, 10,
00:01:03 it reflects some of those laws of God:
00:01:08 “Or do you not know that unrighteous people
00:01:10 “will not inherit God’s Kingdom?
00:01:12 “Do not be misled.
00:01:14 “Those who are sexually immoral, idolaters,
00:01:17 “adulterers, men who submit to homosexual acts,
00:01:21 “men who practice homosexuality,
00:01:23 “thieves, greedy people, drunkards, revilers,
00:01:28 and extortioners will not inherit God’s Kingdom.”
00:01:31 These represent some laws of God.
00:01:35 “Do not commit adultery.” That’s a law.
00:01:37 “Do not steal.” Do not become a drunkard.
00:01:39 Those are laws—very clear.
00:01:41 There’s no interpretation necessary.
00:01:43 It’s a yes-or-no, do-or-don’t situation.
00:01:47 But what about principles?
00:01:48 How do they differ from laws?
00:01:50 Well, a principle is a basic truth in God’s Word
00:01:54 that can help us to make good decisions.
00:01:56 Now, as Christians, we all face situations in life
00:01:59 for which there is no regulation in the Bible.
00:02:03 We have to reason things out and make a decision.
00:02:07 Just to illustrate: Suppose you’re driving in the countryside
00:02:10 and there’s a herd of deer running toward the road.
00:02:14 What will you do?
00:02:16 Well, there’s no law that says you should speed up
00:02:19 and get there before they do.
00:02:22 There’s no law that says you should just continue
00:02:24 at 55 miles an hour (90 km/h) and see what happens.
00:02:26 But what would you likely do?
00:02:29 Well, you would slow down the car.
00:02:32 And how could you make that decision without a law?
00:02:35 You reasoned on the principle,
00:02:37 and the principle is safety, and you made a good decision.
00:02:41 Or there’s a sign—55 miles an hour (90 km/h).
00:02:44 Now, that is a law.
00:02:46 You’re not to go over 55 (90) on that section of the roadway.
00:02:50 But what if there’s a blinding rainstorm?
00:02:52 Would you insist on going 55 miles an hour (90 km/h) because it’s allowed?
00:02:56 No.
00:02:57 Again, using the very same principle of safety,
00:03:01 you would slow down and make a good decision.
00:03:04 So there were two situations with no law.
00:03:08 But by applying the same principle,
00:03:11 you made a good decision.
00:03:13 Well, do we have some examples of principles that could be applied
00:03:17 as we make decisions on life’s roadway?
00:03:20 How about Romans 15:3?
00:03:22 “The Christ did not please himself.”
00:03:25 Can you imagine how many situations in life
00:03:28 that this would instantly answer our question as to what we should do?
00:03:32 Or James 4:4:
00:03:35 “Friendship with the world is enmity with God.”
00:03:37 That could be applied to associations, to movies,
00:03:40 to music, to clothing styles, and so much more.
00:03:43 So when some issue or decision is about to jump out in front of us,
00:03:48 we need to slow down and search for a principle.
00:03:52 Please find Ephesians chapter 5.
00:03:55 It has a phrase that coincides with searching for a principle.
00:03:59 We’ll read verse 15 first of all.
00:04:02 It says: “So keep strict watch
00:04:04 that how you walk is not as unwise but as wise persons.”
00:04:07 Well, that could be by simply obeying a Bible law.
00:04:10 Do not commit adultery. Do not steal.
00:04:13 Keep strict watch that you act wisely.
00:04:16 But now notice verse 17; it’s worded differently.
00:04:20 It says: “On this account stop being unreasonable.”
00:04:23 So it’s alluding to the fact that we should reason on a matter.
00:04:27 And here’s what it says:
00:04:28 “But keep perceiving what the will of Jehovah is.”
00:04:32 So in this case, there’s no law spelling out
00:04:34 exactly what we do but we have to ‘perceive.’
00:04:37 That means we search for and apply a Bible principle.
00:04:41 Then we’re perceiving what God’s will is.
00:04:44 Now, I’m not trying to complicate matters,
00:04:47 but sometimes a specific law of God
00:04:50 is underpinned by a basic truth, or principle.
00:04:55 For example, Deuteronomy 22:8 was a law.
00:05:00 The Israelites had to build a parapet wall
00:05:02 around the flat roof of their home
00:05:05 to prevent people from falling and being injured or possibly killed.
00:05:08 That was a law.
00:05:09 But what was the underlying principle?
00:05:12 It was respect for human life.
00:05:14 And that principle can be applied to so many circumstances in life now.
00:05:18 Respect for human life.
00:05:20 For example, there is nothing in the Bible that talks about tobacco products.
00:05:24 But a person coming into the truth makes a good decision
00:05:27 by applying the principle of respect for life
00:05:30 —his own life and the health of others.
00:05:33 So our text at Proverbs 21:5 is a principle.
00:05:36 That means it can be applied to so many different situations in our life.
00:05:40 And again, it says:
00:05:41 “The plans of the diligent surely lead to success,
00:05:44 but all who are hasty surely head for poverty.”
00:05:48 So, what are some situations
00:05:50 that our publications have applied that principle to?
00:05:54 Well, one is commenting at meetings.
00:05:56 We have to plan ahead to have success.
00:05:59 Or maybe we’re in some form of full-time service
00:06:03 and our parents become seriously ill.
00:06:07 Well, Proverbs 21:5 says: ‘Do not be hasty.’
00:06:10 So we should not hastily conclude
00:06:13 that we have to give up our privilege of service.
00:06:15 Possibly by planning, we could ‘surely have success.’
00:06:21 Living within one’s means, financially.
00:06:24 At Proverbs 21:5, in this case, the plan has a name; it’s called a budget.
00:06:29 But then we have people making decisions on who they will marry.
00:06:33 Do not be hasty.
00:06:34 Or maybe a couple is deciding on whether to have children or not.
00:06:37 Don’t make a hasty decision.
00:06:39 Look beyond that cute, little, cooing baby face,
00:06:43 and consider the pros and cons.
00:06:45 Or brothers approaching retirement age
00:06:47 —Proverbs 21:5 will help them make a good decision.
00:06:51 So that’s just a sampling of the variety of situations
00:06:54 that this one verse can help us with to make good decisions.
00:06:58 We’re so thankful to Jehovah that he has provided specific laws
00:07:01 that we must obey,
00:07:03 but he’s also given us a host of principles that can help us make good decisions.
00:07:07 And by implementing both of those in our life,
00:07:10 we can maintain a clean conscience before our God.

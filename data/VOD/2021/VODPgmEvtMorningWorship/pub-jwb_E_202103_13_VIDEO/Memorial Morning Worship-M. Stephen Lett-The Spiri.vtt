Welcome to all!

00:00:04.521 --> 00:00:07.691 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We have with us Brother Robert Luccioni,

00:00:07.691 --> 00:00:09.926 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a helper to the Publishing Committee,

00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:12.228 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to read our scripture text for today.

00:00:14.297 --> 00:00:16.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today is Saturday, March 27.

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:21.304 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The text is taken from Romans 8:16:

00:00:21.304 --> 00:00:23.039 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“The spirit itself

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“bears witness with our spirit

00:00:25.075 --> 00:00:27.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we are God’s children.”

00:00:28.578 --> 00:00:30.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Rob.

00:00:32.082 --> 00:00:34.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is my great pleasure

00:00:34.484 --> 00:00:38.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to welcome all of you
in our worldwide brotherhood

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:41.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our Morning Worship program.

00:00:41.324 --> 00:00:45.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a very special day
this is for all of us!

00:00:45.428 --> 00:00:47.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After sundown tonight

00:00:47.664 --> 00:00:51.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be the equivalent of Nisan 14

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to the ancient Jewish calendar.

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:57.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On Nisan 14, 33 C.E.,

00:00:57.323 --> 00:00:59.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in harmony with Jehovah’s will,

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:04.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus willingly gave his perfect human life.

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:08.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did this to redeem mankind

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:12.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the sin of Adam, our first human father.

00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:14.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likely, all of us are familiar
with the account

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:18.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Adam and Eve,
our original earthly parents.

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:20.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Adam was created,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had the prospect of living forever.

00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:27.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was Jehovah’s original purpose.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, Jehovah made it very clear

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:32.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his enjoyment of everlasting life

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:36.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was dependent on his obedience.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A simple, noncomplicated,
easy-to-follow test of obedience

00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:43.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was established:

00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:47.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Don’t eat from one tree in the garden.’

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:51.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, we all know what happened.

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:54.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Under the influence
of a renegade spirit creature,

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:56.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan the Devil,

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eve partook of the fruit of that tree,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Adam
foolishly could not resist her offer,

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he did the same.

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:09.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By disobeying God,

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:14.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Adam lost the prospect of everlasting life.

00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:18.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, how did that affect us?

00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:22.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the answer, please go to Romans chapter 5

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:25.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read verse number 12:

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:29.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That is why, just as through one man [Adam]

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:34.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“sin entered into the world
and death through sin,

00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:37.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and so death spread to all men

00:02:37.624 --> 00:02:39.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they had all sinned—.”

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll notice
that death came from sinful Adam;

00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:46.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it didn’t come from Jehovah.

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:49.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as a serious genetic defect

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be passed on to one’s offspring,

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:54.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Adam and Eve had children,

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:57.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they passed on the death sentence.

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:00.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did you notice that long dash

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:03.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the end of verse 12 that we just read?

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:05.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is it there?

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:09.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s because in Greek,
Paul did not complete his thought.

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:11.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He left a cliff-hanger.

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:16.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Greek, whenever a sentence
starts with the words “just as,”

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:18.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it should conclude with a clause

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:22.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that includes the words “so also,”

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:25.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thus completing the thought.

00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:30.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in verse 12, Paul makes clear
who is responsible for death.

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:34.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Just as through one man . . . ,
death spread.”

00:03:34.113 --> 00:03:39.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he leaves the resolution
of the problem hanging.

00:03:39.118 --> 00:03:44.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, in verse 19,
using the same Greek grammar,

00:03:44.123 --> 00:03:48.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul now completes the thought
with “so also,”

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:51.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thereby completing
(we could say) the cliff-hanger.

00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:53.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read verse 19:

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For just as through the disobedience
of the one man

00:03:58.304 --> 00:04:00.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“many were made sinners,

00:04:00.306 --> 00:04:02.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so also

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:05.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“through the obedience
of the one person

00:04:05.845 --> 00:04:08.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many will be made righteous.”

00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:14.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jesus is identified as the solution.

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:19.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to Jesus
giving his life in our behalf,

00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:24.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now we have the hope of everlasting life.

00:04:25.064 --> 00:04:28.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some have the hope
of everlasting life in heaven,

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:30.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the vast majority

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:33.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have the hope
of living forever in perfection

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:36.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a beautifully restored earth.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:39.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all,
that was Jehovah’s original purpose

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:41.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the earth
—was it not?—

00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:45.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and whatever Jehovah starts,

00:04:45.218 --> 00:04:47.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he finishes.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, our text for today, Romans 8:16,

00:04:52.558 --> 00:04:57.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is referring to those who have the hope
of everlasting life in heaven,

00:04:57.497 --> 00:05:01.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
serving alongside Christ
in his Messianic Kingdom.

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:03.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read it again together.

00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:07.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 8:16:

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The spirit itself
bears witness with our spirit

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we are God’s children.”

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:19.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how does God’s spirit
‘bear witness’ with a person

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:22.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that he knows he has been anointed

00:05:22.088 --> 00:05:24.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a future role in heaven?

00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:28.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, to reason on this,
let’s go to the book of Acts.

00:05:28.027 --> 00:05:32.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And first, if you will,
just scan Acts 1:4, 5,

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:37.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which tell us about how Jesus
appeared to his followers

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:40.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a few days after he was resurrected

00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:43.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and instructed them to stay in Jerusalem

00:05:43.242 --> 00:05:45.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wait for a special gift

00:05:45.478 --> 00:05:47.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the holy spirit.

00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:50.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, true to Jesus’ words,

00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:52.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a few days later,
on the day of Pentecost,

00:05:52.985 --> 00:05:55.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
holy spirit was poured out.

00:05:55.755 --> 00:06:00.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
About 120 disciples
were assembled in an upper room,

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when that holy spirit filled them,

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was spectacular.

00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:10.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read about it in Acts chapter 2,

00:06:10.903 --> 00:06:13.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beginning in verse 2:

00:06:13.806 --> 00:06:17.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Suddenly there was a noise from heaven,

00:06:17.677 --> 00:06:21.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“just like that of a rushing, stiff breeze,

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:24.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and it filled the whole house
where they were sitting.

00:06:24.684 --> 00:06:27.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And tongues as if of fire

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“became visible to them

00:06:29.622 --> 00:06:31.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and were distributed,

00:06:31.624 --> 00:06:34.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and one came to rest on each one of them,

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they all became filled with holy spirit

00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:42.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and started to speak in different languages,

00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:46.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as the spirit enabled them to speak.”

00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:50.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These 120 disciples

00:06:50.343 --> 00:06:53.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
became the first ones
to be anointed by holy spirit

00:06:53.646 --> 00:06:57.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and given the hope of ruling
with Jesus in heaven.

00:06:57.183 --> 00:07:00.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously,
they would never forget that experience.

00:07:00.887 --> 00:07:05.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a certainty,
there was no question in their minds

00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:09.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God’s spirit
bore witness with their spirit.

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:13.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now,
what about after that momentous event?

00:07:13.633 --> 00:07:17.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would all of those chosen
to be with Christ in heaven

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:22.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have some miraculous display,
as did the 120?

00:07:22.141 --> 00:07:24.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer is no.

00:07:24.143 --> 00:07:26.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To reason on this point,

00:07:26.145 --> 00:07:29.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s go to verses 37 and 38

00:07:29.348 --> 00:07:31.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Acts chapter 2,

00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:34.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which talk about what happened to thousands

00:07:34.587 --> 00:07:37.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who became new anointed disciples later

00:07:37.557 --> 00:07:40.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on that very same day of Pentecost.

00:07:40.059 --> 00:07:42.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice, beginning in verse 37:

00:07:42.829 --> 00:07:47.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now when they heard this,
they were stabbed to the heart,

00:07:47.233 --> 00:07:50.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they said to Peter
and the rest of the apostles:

00:07:50.837 --> 00:07:54.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Men, brothers, what should we do?’

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Peter said to them: ‘Repent,

00:07:56.709 --> 00:08:00.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and let each one of you be baptized

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:04.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘in the name of Jesus Christ
for forgiveness of your sins,

00:08:04.517 --> 00:08:09.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will receive
the free gift of the holy spirit.’”

00:08:10.523 --> 00:08:12.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, verse 41 indicates

00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:16.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were about 3,000 who were baptized.

00:08:16.095 --> 00:08:19.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did you notice
that even though they were anointed

00:08:19.398 --> 00:08:21.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by holy spirit after their baptism,

00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:26.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they did not experience
any of the spectacular manifestations

00:08:26.472 --> 00:08:31.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the 120 had experienced
earlier that very same day?

00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:35.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now this raises another question:

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:38.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does this account mean
that newly anointed ones

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:41.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will have God’s spirit
bear witness with their spirit

00:08:41.787 --> 00:08:44.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the day of their baptism?

00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:47.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, the answer is no.

00:08:47.093 --> 00:08:52.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To reason on this,
please go to Acts chapter 8

00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:55.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and lets notice a very interesting account

00:08:55.668 --> 00:08:58.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that begins in verse 14:

00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:01.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When the apostles in Jerusalem heard

00:09:01.407 --> 00:09:05.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that Samaria had accepted the word of God,

00:09:05.144 --> 00:09:08.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they sent Peter and John to them;

00:09:08.114 --> 00:09:11.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and these went down
and prayed for them

00:09:11.517 --> 00:09:14.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to get holy spirit.

00:09:14.086 --> 00:09:17.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For it had not yet come
upon any one of them,

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:21.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but they had only been baptized
in the name of the Lord Jesus.

00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:24.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then they laid their hands on them,

00:09:24.697 --> 00:09:27.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they began to receive holy spirit.”

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:33.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, these verses describe
how the spirit bearing witness

00:09:33.372 --> 00:09:35.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with these anointed ones in Samaria

00:09:35.808 --> 00:09:40.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
occurred sometime after their baptism,

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:42.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that is what occurs in our time.

00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:45.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s spirit
bears witness with the person

00:09:45.851 --> 00:09:49.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometime after his baptism

00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:52.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and after he or she has had an opportunity

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:56.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to establish a course of faithfulness.

00:09:57.129 --> 00:10:01.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we ask:
How does a person know clearly

00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:05.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether he or she has the heavenly calling?

00:10:05.237 --> 00:10:08.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, please go to 1 John chapter 2,

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:11.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s get some help with that question.

00:10:11.544 --> 00:10:14.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First John 2:20:

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And you have an anointing from the holy one,

00:10:18.184 --> 00:10:21.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all of you have knowledge.”

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such ones “have knowledge”;

00:10:23.522 --> 00:10:26.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they know for a certainty
they’ve been anointed.

00:10:26.926 --> 00:10:29.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now look at verse 27:

00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:31.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And as for you,

00:10:31.831 --> 00:10:34.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the anointing that you received from him

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“remains in you,

00:10:36.902 --> 00:10:40.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and you do not need anyone
to be teaching you;

00:10:40.006 --> 00:10:42.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but the anointing from him is teaching you

00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:47.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about all things and is true and is no lie.”

00:10:47.747 --> 00:10:52.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So anointed ones don’t need
confirmation from anyone else;

00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:57.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their anointing is clear, true, affirmative.

00:10:58.157 --> 00:10:59.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it:

00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:04.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The holy spirit
is the most powerful force in the universe.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:09.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah used it to create
the sun, moon, stars.

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:13.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He used it to create
all life in heaven and earth.

00:11:13.572 --> 00:11:17.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also used it
to communicate his message

00:11:17.843 --> 00:11:20.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Bible writers.

00:11:20.012 --> 00:11:23.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact,
Jehovah is the greatest Communicator

00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:25.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the universe.

00:11:25.851 --> 00:11:30.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if his powerful holy spirit
bears witness with a person,

00:11:30.022 --> 00:11:32.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he is not going to communicate,

00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:36.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Maybe you have been called to heavenly life”

00:11:36.662 --> 00:11:41.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—leaving the person
in doubt, a dilemma, a quandary.

00:11:42.268 --> 00:11:44.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, it is going to be

00:11:44.637 --> 00:11:47.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an absolute, affirmative communication

00:11:47.506 --> 00:11:52.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—leaving the person
with no question in his mind or heart.

00:11:53.312 --> 00:11:55.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if a person is wondering

00:11:55.681 --> 00:11:59.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if he is anointed or not,

00:11:59.285 --> 00:12:01.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the answer is obvious, isn’t it?

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is not.

00:12:03.856 --> 00:12:06.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about the millions

00:12:06.192 --> 00:12:08.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who do not have this change of hope

00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:11.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
communicated to them by God’s spirit?

00:12:11.497 --> 00:12:13.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, they have the glorious hope

00:12:13.499 --> 00:12:16.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah originally purposed for mankind

00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:21.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—before there was any need
for humans to be adopted to the heavens—

00:12:21.173 --> 00:12:25.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everlasting life in a paradise earth.

00:12:25.845 --> 00:12:29.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact,
just a few verses after our text for today,

00:12:29.982 --> 00:12:32.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Romans 8:21,

00:12:32.384 --> 00:12:35.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says of human creation:

00:12:35.454 --> 00:12:37.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The creation itself

00:12:37.857 --> 00:12:41.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will also be set free
from enslavement to corruption

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:43.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and have the glorious freedom

00:12:43.729 --> 00:12:45.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the children of God.”

00:12:47.533 --> 00:12:52.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So whether our hope
is life in heaven or life on earth,

00:12:52.371 --> 00:12:57.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how all of us
as Jehovah’s people worldwide look forward

00:12:57.376 --> 00:13:02.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our marvelous hope of everlasting life!

00:13:02.815 --> 00:13:05.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And later today, after sundown,

00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:10.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we observe the memorial
of the Lord’s Evening Meal,

00:13:10.122 --> 00:13:12.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will commemorate (remember)

00:13:12.992 --> 00:13:17.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the two greatest acts of love
that have ever been shown

00:13:17.363 --> 00:13:21.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that make our wonderful hope possible.

00:13:22.134 --> 00:13:25.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s ask Brother Robert Luccioni

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:30.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to read the <i>Watchtower</i>  comments
on our scripture for today.

00:13:32.545 --> 00:13:37.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How does a person know
that he or she has the heavenly calling?

00:13:37.316 --> 00:13:41.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The answer is clearly seen
in the apostle Paul’s words to those in Rome

00:13:41.987 --> 00:13:44.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who were ‘called to be holy ones.’

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:48.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In addition to the words of today’s text,
he told them:

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:53.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘You did not receive
a spirit of slavery causing fear again,

00:13:53.032 --> 00:13:56.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘but you received
a spirit of adoption as sons,

00:13:56.702 --> 00:14:00.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by which spirit we cry out:
“<i>Abba</i>, Father!”’

00:14:00.739 --> 00:14:03.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So by means of his holy spirit,

00:14:03.309 --> 00:14:06.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God makes it clear to anointed ones

00:14:06.278 --> 00:14:08.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that they have this heavenly calling.

00:14:08.814 --> 00:14:12.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah leaves no doubt whatsoever
in the minds and hearts

00:14:12.885 --> 00:14:16.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of those who receive
his invitation to go to heaven.

00:14:16.989 --> 00:14:21.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anointed Christians do not need anyone
to confirm that they are anointed.″

00:14:23.429 --> 00:14:25.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much, Rob.

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:31.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we look forward
to our Memorial Bible reading for today.

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:35.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will have the daytime events
of Nisan 13 read

00:14:35.407 --> 00:14:38.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Luke chapter 22
and Mark chapter 14.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:40.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then the events after sundown,

00:14:40.479 --> 00:14:42.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which would have been Nisan 14,

00:14:42.982 --> 00:14:47.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be read from the latter part
of Luke chapter 22.

00:24:10.215 --> 00:24:12.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But Peter said:

00:24:12.217 --> 00:24:14.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Man, I am not.’

00:24:15.287 --> 00:24:17.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And after about an hour had passed,

00:24:17.689 --> 00:24:20.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“another man began insisting strongly:

00:24:20.992 --> 00:24:24.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Certainly this man was also with him,

00:24:24.396 --> 00:24:27.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for he is, in fact, a Gal·i·leʹan!’

00:24:27.933 --> 00:24:29.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But Peter said:

“‘Man, I do not know what you are saying.’

00:24:33.638 --> 00:24:35.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And instantly,

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:39.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“while he was still speaking,
a rooster crowed. 

00:24:40.779 --> 00:24:44.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At this the Lord turned
and looked straight at Peter,

00:24:44.049 --> 00:24:47.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and Peter recalled the statement of the Lord

00:24:47.118 --> 00:24:49.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when he had said to him:

00:24:49.221 --> 00:24:51.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Before a rooster crows today,

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you will disown me three times.’

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:58.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he went outside and wept bitterly.

00:25:00.265 --> 00:25:02.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now the men who held Jesus in custody

00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:04.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“began to mock him, hitting him;

00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:06.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and after covering his face,

00:25:06.838 --> 00:25:08.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they kept asking:

00:25:08.707 --> 00:25:12.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Prophesy!
Who is it that struck you?’

00:25:12.577 --> 00:25:16.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they said
many other blasphemous things against him.”

Well, it has truly been a delight
to speak today

00:25:23.421 --> 00:25:27.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with millions of you dear ones
around the world

—you precious sheep in Jehovah’s flock.

Be assured

And may Jehovah
be with all of us this evening

00:25:39.938 --> 00:25:44.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we gather together,
physically if possible,

00:25:44.209 --> 00:25:48.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but especially as we all
gather together in spirit

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:53.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to commemorate
the most important event of the year

—the Memorial of Christ’s death,

00:25:56.655 --> 00:25:59.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is an incomparable gift

00:25:59.925 --> 00:26:03.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from our Father, Jehovah.

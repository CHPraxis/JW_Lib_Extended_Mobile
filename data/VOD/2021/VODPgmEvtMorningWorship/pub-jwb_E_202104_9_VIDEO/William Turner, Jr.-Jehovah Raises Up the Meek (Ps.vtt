00:00:01.117 --> 00:00:03.319 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Our text for today deals with the quality

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:05.388 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of meekness.

00:00:05.388 --> 00:00:07.724 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, one <i>Watchtower </i> article stated

00:00:07.724 --> 00:00:10.093 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that “meekness is [actually]

00:00:10.093 --> 00:00:13.530 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a difficult quality to cultivate”

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.701 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—difficult but certainly not impossible.

00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:21.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can say this because just think
of the number of scriptures

00:00:21.805 --> 00:00:23.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that mention the quality of meekness

00:00:23.973 --> 00:00:27.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as being essential for salvation.

00:00:27.577 --> 00:00:30.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example: Psalm 37:11:

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:33.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The meek will possess the earth.”

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 76:9:

00:00:35.652 --> 00:00:39.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[God will] save all the meek of the earth.”

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 149:4:

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:46.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[Jehovah] adorns the meek with salvation.”

00:00:46.096 --> 00:00:49.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then our text comments
mention Zephaniah 2:3.

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I invite you to take out your Bibles.

00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:53.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read that from God’s Word.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Zephaniah chapter 2

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse 3 says:

00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:04.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Seek Jehovah,
all you meek ones of the earth,

00:01:04.748 --> 00:01:07.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who observe his righteous decrees.

00:01:07.183 --> 00:01:10.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Seek righteousness, seek meekness.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Probably you will be concealed

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the day of Jehovah’s anger.”

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:19.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So all these scriptures show the connection

00:01:19.896 --> 00:01:23.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between meekness and our salvation.

00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:26.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s take a moment then and examine

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:30.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how this quality relates to each of us.

00:01:31.674 --> 00:01:33.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The <i>Insight  </i>book defines meekness

00:01:33.743 --> 00:01:38.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “a mildness of temper,
without haughtiness or vanity.

00:01:38.481 --> 00:01:40.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[It is] the mental disposition
that enables one

00:01:40.984 --> 00:01:43.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to endure injury with patience

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:46.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and without irritation, resentment,

00:01:46.723 --> 00:01:49.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or vindictive retaliation.”

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:52.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as was mentioned earlier,
how well this is illustrated

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Bible example of Moses!

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:59.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go back to the Bible
—this time to Numbers chapter 12.

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:01.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll read a particular account and see

00:02:01.571 --> 00:02:05.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how the Bible describes the man Moses.

00:02:07.977 --> 00:02:10.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Numbers 12:1 says:

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now Miriam and Aaron
began to speak against Moses

00:02:13.783 --> 00:02:16.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because of the Cushite wife he had married,

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:18.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for he had taken a Cushite wife.

00:02:18.922 --> 00:02:23.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They were saying: ‘Is it only by Moses
that Jehovah has spoken?

00:02:23.927 --> 00:02:27.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Has he not also spoken through us?’

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And Jehovah was listening.

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:33.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now the man Moses was by far
the meekest of all the men

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:35.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the face of the earth.”

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:39.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we learn some interesting things
in these verses

00:02:39.275 --> 00:02:42.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help establish why Moses is described

00:02:42.745 --> 00:02:47.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “the meekest of all the men
on the face of the earth.”

00:02:47.517 --> 00:02:50.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice in verse 1 that Miriam and Aaron

00:02:50.987 --> 00:02:53.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Moses’ older brother and sister—

00:02:53.323 --> 00:02:58.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says they “began to speak against Moses.”

00:02:58.161 --> 00:03:00.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their speaking against him meant

00:03:00.296 --> 00:03:03.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were likely spreading
their complaints about Moses

00:03:03.566 --> 00:03:06.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
throughout the Israelite camp.

00:03:06.202 --> 00:03:09.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Miriam had
a measure of influence in the camp.

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was a prophetess.

00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:14.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible says that she led the women
in singing and dancing

00:03:14.143 --> 00:03:18.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah defeated Pharaoh
and the Egyptians at the Red Sea.

00:03:18.348 --> 00:03:20.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now that Moses’ wife, Zipporah,

00:03:20.917 --> 00:03:24.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was going to rejoin them in the wilderness,

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is it possible that Miriam may have feared

00:03:27.657 --> 00:03:31.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she would no longer be
the leading lady in the camp?

00:03:31.594 --> 00:03:36.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps she felt that she would lose
some of her prominence to Moses’ wife

00:03:36.232 --> 00:03:39.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a non-Israelite at that.

00:03:39.002 --> 00:03:42.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, although Zipporah was not an Israelite,
if we look in Exodus chapter 4,

00:03:42.972 --> 00:03:47.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it shows that she demonstrated
her willingness to adhere to God’s laws.

00:03:47.744 --> 00:03:51.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the root of Miriam’s complaints
and murmuring

00:03:51.848 --> 00:03:56.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had nothing to do with true worship
or the protection of God’s people.

00:03:57.253 --> 00:04:00.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, the root cause
appears to be jealousy

00:04:00.857 --> 00:04:04.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—an improper desire
for authority and recognition.

00:04:04.827 --> 00:04:06.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she, along with her brother Aaron,

00:04:06.863 --> 00:04:11.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
used this as an excuse
to murmur against Moses.

00:04:13.036 --> 00:04:14.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we look back in this account,

00:04:14.904 --> 00:04:19.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how is the meekness of Moses
made apparent?

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:24.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, despite the resentment and murmuring
on the part of Miriam and Aaron,

00:04:24.047 --> 00:04:27.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses patiently and quietly

00:04:27.216 --> 00:04:29.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
endured the abuse.

00:04:29.452 --> 00:04:34.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we look in verse 2,
Moses did not have to defend himself

00:04:34.457 --> 00:04:37.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because “Jehovah was listening,”

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and He took action.

00:04:39.162 --> 00:04:43.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you look in verses 6-8,
Jehovah rebukes Miriam and Aaron.

00:04:43.633 --> 00:04:48.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Miriam,
evidently the apparent instigator,

00:04:48.338 --> 00:04:50.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is stricken with leprosy.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when this happens, if you look
in verses 11 and 12 (how interesting),

00:04:54.877 --> 00:04:57.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aaron asks Moses

00:04:57.647 --> 00:05:00.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to intercede on her behalf.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now for just a moment,
let’s just put ourselves in Moses’ sandals.

00:05:05.655 --> 00:05:09.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could we blame Moses if he were upset?

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:13.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here it is, his older siblings
have disrespected Jehovah,

00:05:13.429 --> 00:05:17.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’ve disrespected Moses
as God’s representative,

00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:20.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now they’re talking about Moses’ wife,

00:05:20.036 --> 00:05:24.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when there was no just cause to do so.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So could Moses have now felt about Miriam:

00:05:29.345 --> 00:05:31.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You know what? You had this coming to you.

00:05:31.447 --> 00:05:33.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You brought this upon yourself.

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are getting exactly what you deserve’?

00:05:37.854 --> 00:05:41.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, even though Moses
could have been justified,

00:05:41.357 --> 00:05:43.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he was given the opportunity,

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:45.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice what he does in verse 13:

00:05:45.962 --> 00:05:48.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[He begins] to cry out to Jehovah, saying:

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:50.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘O God, please heal her!

00:05:50.833 --> 00:05:52.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please!’”

00:05:54.103 --> 00:05:59.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful example of meekness
displayed by Moses!

00:06:00.576 --> 00:06:04.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how can his example benefit us?

00:06:05.014 --> 00:06:08.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, think about this:
When is the next time you and I

00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:11.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might need to show meekness?

00:06:13.256 --> 00:06:17.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could it be later today
if we find that our work is being delayed

00:06:17.527 --> 00:06:20.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by someone else or another department?

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could it be at our meeting this week

00:06:23.232 --> 00:06:25.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we receive counsel on a meeting part?

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:31.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could it be if we find that we’ve lost
or that we’ve been passed over

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a privilege of service?

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:39.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, because of our imperfect state,
any number of circumstances could arise

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:43.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we might need to look back
on Moses’ example

00:06:43.019 --> 00:06:45.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of displaying meekness.

00:06:45.721 --> 00:06:50.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now for just a moment,
let’s go back to Zephaniah 2:3.

00:06:53.162 --> 00:06:56.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you notice in verse 3, we are told

00:06:56.065 --> 00:06:59.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “seek meekness.”

00:06:59.869 --> 00:07:03.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means that none of us
are born with this quality,

00:07:03.072 --> 00:07:05.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we have to seek it

00:07:05.374 --> 00:07:09.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by asking, by searching,
by praying for Jehovah’s help

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:13.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to exercise restraint
and represent him properly,

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:17.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even under difficult circumstances.

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:21.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps we’ve had the experience
in the ministry where we’ve been ridiculed

00:07:21.591 --> 00:07:24.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or we’ve encountered unreasonable individuals

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who state all sorts of misconceptions
about Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:07:26.996 --> 00:07:28.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ve heard them.

00:07:28.231 --> 00:07:31.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t believe in Jesus;
we break up families;

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we don’t believe in helping the community.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And maybe when we hear them,
it may bother us.

00:07:37.273 --> 00:07:39.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Frankly, it might even upset us

00:07:39.408 --> 00:07:42.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the point where we just feel
we need to give a reply.

00:07:42.912 --> 00:07:45.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must defend ourselves.

00:07:45.047 --> 00:07:48.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to get the last word in
in order to set the householder straight

00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:50.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on our beliefs.

00:07:50.987 --> 00:07:56.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But might that be the very time
to seek meekness

00:07:56.025 --> 00:08:00.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to pray to Jehovah to exercise restraint?

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or perhaps, on a more personal level,

00:08:03.499 --> 00:08:06.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it may be that we experience an injustice.

00:08:06.435 --> 00:08:09.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps we have a misunderstanding
with a member of our family here

00:08:09.805 --> 00:08:12.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or with a brother or sister
in the congregation.

00:08:12.475 --> 00:08:14.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And whatever the issue is,

00:08:14.944 --> 00:08:18.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may have a legitimate complaint.

00:08:19.348 --> 00:08:23.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But isn’t it true that if we’re not careful,

00:08:23.319 --> 00:08:26.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we don’t seek meekness,

00:08:26.122 --> 00:08:30.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we don’t seek to resolve the matter
in a spirit of meekness,

00:08:30.893 --> 00:08:35.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, wouldn’t you agree
that voicing our legitimate complaint

00:08:35.198 --> 00:08:39.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could very easily cross the line
into murmuring?

00:08:39.502 --> 00:08:41.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know how Jehovah feels about that.

00:08:41.504 --> 00:08:45.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So certainly, we would never want
to do anything to disappoint him.

00:08:46.676 --> 00:08:50.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses was meek
—the meekest man who ever lived.

00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:52.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But even he reached a point on one occasion

00:08:52.748 --> 00:08:56.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he did not show meekness
and exercise restraint,

00:08:56.419 --> 00:08:58.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he suffered the consequences.

00:08:58.854 --> 00:09:01.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you and I are to continue
to draw close to God

00:09:01.991 --> 00:09:04.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and remain acceptable to him,

00:09:04.026 --> 00:09:06.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we must strive to uproot any traces

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:11.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of pride, jealousy, ambition,
or vindictiveness

00:09:11.234 --> 00:09:14.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we may see in ourselves.

00:09:14.303 --> 00:09:18.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah loves those who are meek.

00:09:18.708 --> 00:09:23.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who are meek will inherit salvation.

00:09:23.312 --> 00:09:26.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So may each of us
continue to seek this quality

00:09:26.415 --> 00:09:29.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by asking, praying,

00:09:29.385 --> 00:09:33.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then cultivating a submissive attitude
that will allow us

00:09:33.422 --> 00:09:36.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be among the meek
who will inherit the earth.

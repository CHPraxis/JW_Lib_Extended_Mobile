00:00:01 Our text for today deals with the quality
00:00:03 of meekness.
00:00:05 Interestingly, one Watchtower  article stated
00:00:07 that “meekness is [actually]
00:00:10 a difficult quality to cultivate”
00:00:13 —difficult but certainly not impossible.
00:00:17 We can say this because just think of the number of scriptures
00:00:21 that mention the quality of meekness
00:00:23 as being essential for salvation.
00:00:27 For example: Psalm 37:11:
00:00:30 “The meek will possess the earth.”
00:00:33 Psalm 76:9:
00:00:35 “[God will] save all the meek of the earth.”
00:00:39 Psalm 149:4:
00:00:41 “[Jehovah] adorns the meek with salvation.”
00:00:46 And then our text comments mention Zephaniah 2:3.
00:00:49 I invite you to take out your Bibles.
00:00:51 Let’s read that from God’s Word.
00:00:53 Zephaniah chapter 2
00:00:59 verse 3 says:
00:01:01 “Seek Jehovah, all you meek ones of the earth,
00:01:04 “who observe his righteous decrees.
00:01:07 “Seek righteousness, seek meekness.
00:01:10 “Probably you will be concealed
00:01:13 on the day of Jehovah’s anger.”
00:01:16 So all these scriptures show the connection
00:01:19 between meekness and our salvation.
00:01:23 So let’s take a moment then and examine
00:01:26 how this quality relates to each of us.
00:01:31 The Insight  book defines meekness
00:01:33 as “a mildness of temper, without haughtiness or vanity.
00:01:38 “[It is] the mental disposition that enables one
00:01:40 “to endure injury with patience
00:01:43 “and without irritation, resentment,
00:01:46 or vindictive retaliation.”
00:01:49 And as was mentioned earlier, how well this is illustrated
00:01:52 in the Bible example of Moses!
00:01:55 Let’s go back to the Bible —this time to Numbers chapter 12.
00:01:59 We’ll read a particular account and see
00:02:01 how the Bible describes the man Moses.
00:02:07 Numbers 12:1 says:
00:02:10 “Now Miriam and Aaron began to speak against Moses
00:02:13 “because of the Cushite wife he had married,
00:02:16 “for he had taken a Cushite wife.
00:02:18 “They were saying: ‘Is it only by Moses that Jehovah has spoken?
00:02:23 “Has he not also spoken through us?’
00:02:27 “And Jehovah was listening.
00:02:29 “Now the man Moses was by far the meekest of all the men
00:02:33 on the face of the earth.”
00:02:36 Well, we learn some interesting things in these verses
00:02:39 to help establish why Moses is described
00:02:42 as “the meekest of all the men on the face of the earth.”
00:02:47 Notice in verse 1 that Miriam and Aaron
00:02:50 —Moses’ older brother and sister—
00:02:53 It says they “began to speak against Moses.”
00:02:58 Their speaking against him meant
00:03:00 they were likely spreading their complaints about Moses
00:03:03 throughout the Israelite camp.
00:03:06 Miriam had a measure of influence in the camp.
00:03:09 She was a prophetess.
00:03:11 The Bible says that she led the women in singing and dancing
00:03:14 when Jehovah defeated Pharaoh and the Egyptians at the Red Sea.
00:03:18 So now that Moses’ wife, Zipporah,
00:03:20 was going to rejoin them in the wilderness,
00:03:24 is it possible that Miriam may have feared
00:03:27 that she would no longer be the leading lady in the camp?
00:03:31 Perhaps she felt that she would lose some of her prominence to Moses’ wife
00:03:36 —a non-Israelite at that.
00:03:39 Now, although Zipporah was not an Israelite, if we look in Exodus chapter 4,
00:03:42 it shows that she demonstrated her willingness to adhere to God’s laws.
00:03:47 So the root of Miriam’s complaints and murmuring
00:03:51 had nothing to do with true worship or the protection of God’s people.
00:03:57 Instead, the root cause appears to be jealousy
00:04:00 —an improper desire for authority and recognition.
00:04:04 And she, along with her brother Aaron,
00:04:06 used this as an excuse to murmur against Moses.
00:04:13 But if we look back in this account,
00:04:14 how is the meekness of Moses made apparent?
00:04:19 Well, despite the resentment and murmuring on the part of Miriam and Aaron,
00:04:24 Moses patiently and quietly
00:04:27 endured the abuse.
00:04:29 And if we look in verse 2, Moses did not have to defend himself
00:04:34 because “Jehovah was listening,”
00:04:37 and He took action.
00:04:39 If you look in verses 6-8, Jehovah rebukes Miriam and Aaron.
00:04:43 And Miriam, evidently the apparent instigator,
00:04:48 is stricken with leprosy.
00:04:50 And when this happens, if you look in verses 11 and 12 (how interesting),
00:04:54 Aaron asks Moses
00:04:57 to intercede on her behalf.
00:05:00 Now for just a moment, let’s just put ourselves in Moses’ sandals.
00:05:05 Could we blame Moses if he were upset?
00:05:09 Here it is, his older siblings have disrespected Jehovah,
00:05:13 they’ve disrespected Moses as God’s representative,
00:05:17 and now they’re talking about Moses’ wife,
00:05:20 even when there was no just cause to do so.
00:05:24 So could Moses have now felt about Miriam:
00:05:29 ‘You know what? You had this coming to you.
00:05:31 ‘You brought this upon yourself.
00:05:33 You are getting exactly what you deserve’?
00:05:37 Well, even though Moses could have been justified,
00:05:41 when he was given the opportunity,
00:05:43 notice what he does in verse 13:
00:05:45 “[He begins] to cry out to Jehovah, saying:
00:05:48 “‘O God, please heal her!
00:05:50 Please!’”
00:05:54 What a beautiful example of meekness displayed by Moses!
00:06:00 Now, how can his example benefit us?
00:06:05 Well, think about this: When is the next time you and I
00:06:08 might need to show meekness?
00:06:13 Could it be later today if we find that our work is being delayed
00:06:17 by someone else or another department?
00:06:20 Could it be at our meeting this week
00:06:23 if we receive counsel on a meeting part?
00:06:26 Could it be if we find that we’ve lost or that we’ve been passed over
00:06:31 for a privilege of service?
00:06:34 You see, because of our imperfect state, any number of circumstances could arise
00:06:39 where we might need to look back on Moses’ example
00:06:43 of displaying meekness.
00:06:45 Now for just a moment, let’s go back to Zephaniah 2:3.
00:06:53 If you notice in verse 3, we are told
00:06:56 to “seek meekness.”
00:06:59 That means that none of us are born with this quality,
00:07:03 so we have to seek it
00:07:05 by asking, by searching, by praying for Jehovah’s help
00:07:09 to exercise restraint and represent him properly,
00:07:13 even under difficult circumstances.
00:07:17 Perhaps we’ve had the experience in the ministry where we’ve been ridiculed
00:07:21 or we’ve encountered unreasonable individuals
00:07:24 who state all sorts of misconceptions about Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:07:26 and we’ve heard them.
00:07:28 We don’t believe in Jesus; we break up families;
00:07:31 we don’t believe in helping the community.
00:07:33 And maybe when we hear them, it may bother us.
00:07:37 Frankly, it might even upset us
00:07:39 to the point where we just feel we need to give a reply.
00:07:42 We must defend ourselves.
00:07:45 We have to get the last word in in order to set the householder straight
00:07:48 on our beliefs.
00:07:50 But might that be the very time to seek meekness
00:07:56 —to pray to Jehovah to exercise restraint?
00:08:00 Or perhaps, on a more personal level,
00:08:03 it may be that we experience an injustice.
00:08:06 Perhaps we have a misunderstanding with a member of our family here
00:08:09 or with a brother or sister in the congregation.
00:08:12 And whatever the issue is,
00:08:14 we may have a legitimate complaint.
00:08:19 But isn’t it true that if we’re not careful,
00:08:23 if we don’t seek meekness,
00:08:26 if we don’t seek to resolve the matter in a spirit of meekness,
00:08:30 well, wouldn’t you agree that voicing our legitimate complaint
00:08:35 could very easily cross the line into murmuring?
00:08:39 And we know how Jehovah feels about that.
00:08:41 So certainly, we would never want to do anything to disappoint him.
00:08:46 Moses was meek —the meekest man who ever lived.
00:08:50 But even he reached a point on one occasion
00:08:52 where he did not show meekness and exercise restraint,
00:08:56 and he suffered the consequences.
00:08:58 So if you and I are to continue to draw close to God
00:09:01 and remain acceptable to him,
00:09:04 we must strive to uproot any traces
00:09:06 of pride, jealousy, ambition, or vindictiveness
00:09:11 that we may see in ourselves.
00:09:14 Yes, Jehovah loves those who are meek.
00:09:18 Those who are meek will inherit salvation.
00:09:23 So may each of us continue to seek this quality
00:09:26 by asking, praying,
00:09:29 and then cultivating a submissive attitude that will allow us
00:09:33 to be among the meek who will inherit the earth.

00:00:01.785 --> 00:00:03.386 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So our text for today is

00:00:03.386 --> 00:00:06.222 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Philippians 3:14,

00:00:06.222 --> 00:00:08.224 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and here the apostle Paul

00:00:08.224 --> 00:00:10.393 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
assures the Philippian congregation

00:00:10.393 --> 00:00:12.662 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that he has not lost sight of the goal.

00:00:12.662 --> 00:00:14.731 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In spite of all the distressing things

00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:18.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he’s dealing with,
he’s keeping his mind on the big picture

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:22.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the advancement of the good news
and the hope that he has for the future.

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how can this help us?

00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:27.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s consider three things

00:00:27.177 --> 00:00:29.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Paul was dealing with during the time

00:00:29.813 --> 00:00:31.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he was writing
his letter to the Philippians

00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:36.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could have diverted his focus
and see what we can learn.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first thing 
we’ll consider is discouragement.

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, why?

00:00:41.157 --> 00:00:44.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Paul, as we know,
was under house arrest at the time.

00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:48.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could not do
what he wanted to do for Jehovah.

00:00:48.264 --> 00:00:51.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s thought that when Paul
wrote his letter to the Philippians,

00:00:51.768 --> 00:00:55.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had been under house arrest
for a year or more.

00:00:55.505 --> 00:00:59.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How discouraging
this could have been for Paul!

00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:02.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, we remember that during this time
the Philippian congregation

00:01:02.846 --> 00:01:07.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had sent Epaphroditus to Paul
with a gift from the congregation.

00:01:07.283 --> 00:01:09.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what happened?

00:01:09.285 --> 00:01:11.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Epaphroditus was to go and encourage Paul,

00:01:11.921 --> 00:01:16.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he ended up getting sick
to the point of death and then got depressed.

00:01:16.893 --> 00:01:19.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, rather than receiving help,

00:01:19.362 --> 00:01:22.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul had to worry about and help
Epaphroditus to recover

00:01:22.932 --> 00:01:26.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then deal with his depression
and then eventually send him back home,

00:01:26.736 --> 00:01:29.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the while dealing with his own situation.

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:33.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally, who knows
the emotional ups and downs

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:36.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Paul dealt with during his imprisonment?

00:01:36.412 --> 00:01:38.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can imagine him getting reports of:

00:01:38.782 --> 00:01:41.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I think your case
is going to get heard soon.

00:01:41.484 --> 00:01:42.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you can leave soon.’

00:01:42.886 --> 00:01:44.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then: ‘No, sorry.

00:01:44.287 --> 00:01:45.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Nothing is happening.

00:01:45.688 --> 00:01:48.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re going to be here for a while.’

00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:50.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, can you relate to Paul?

00:01:50.994 --> 00:01:54.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of our brothers and sisters are getting

00:01:54.164 --> 00:01:57.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
emotionally and physically
distressed or fatigued

00:01:57.767 --> 00:01:59.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of this pandemic.

00:01:59.235 --> 00:02:01.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of them feel like they
are in house arrest.

00:02:01.971 --> 00:02:04.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There seems to be no end in sight.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes it’s like we
take one step forward and two steps back.

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:11.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We cannot do the things
that we want to do for Jehovah.

00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:13.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what do we learn from Paul?

00:02:13.583 --> 00:02:15.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did he do?

00:02:15.318 --> 00:02:18.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at Philippians 1:12.

00:02:19.622 --> 00:02:21.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where was his focus?

00:02:21.024 --> 00:02:22.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philippians 1:12—he says:

00:02:22.592 --> 00:02:24.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now I want you to know, brothers,

00:02:24.627 --> 00:02:26.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that my situation has actually

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:30.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
turned out for the advancement
of the good news.”

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:33.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He focused on advancing
the good news—the big picture.

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:36.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 13, he talks about how his situation

00:02:36.372 --> 00:02:38.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was giving a witness to the prison guards,

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:43.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how his endurance, in verse 14,
was encouraging the congregation.

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:46.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was not in the situation
he wanted to be in,

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:49.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he focused on the positive.

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:54.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, we need to do the same
—keep our focus on the big picture.

00:02:54.023 --> 00:02:57.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The increases that we
hear about and the incredible experiences

00:02:57.627 --> 00:03:00.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re hearing show that Jehovah’s people

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:03.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are continuing to advance Kingdom interests

00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:06.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even during these difficult times.

00:03:06.336 --> 00:03:10.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we have heard so many
encouraging reports that remind us

00:03:10.206 --> 00:03:14.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has been with his people
and with his organization

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during this last period of time
—during this pandemic—

00:03:18.381 --> 00:03:21.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that his organization not only continued

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
functioning but flourishing.

00:03:24.587 --> 00:03:27.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should we lose trust now

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will not carry us
the rest of the way?

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a good reminder from Paul.

00:03:32.528 --> 00:03:34.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What else was Paul dealing with?

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:38.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, our second point
is that he was dealing with pain of heart

00:03:38.368 --> 00:03:40.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of those who had left the truth.

00:03:40.703 --> 00:03:45.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at chapter 3 and verse 18
—Philippians 3:18.

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:48.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “For there are many

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:53.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“—I used to mention them often
but now I mention them also with weeping—

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:58.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are walking as enemies
of the torture stake of the Christ.”

00:03:58.087 --> 00:04:01.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, some who used to be close to Paul
had abandoned the truth.

00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:03.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This distressed him.

00:04:03.726 --> 00:04:05.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It made him weep.

00:04:05.728 --> 00:04:07.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, can we relate?

00:04:07.563 --> 00:04:08.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, yes.

00:04:08.865 --> 00:04:12.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some among us have
very close family members or friends

00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:16.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have left the truth and are
now disfellowshipped, and that’s painful.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when emotions are running high,

00:04:18.775 --> 00:04:22.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it can cause us to question
decisions made by the elders

00:04:22.946 --> 00:04:25.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or maybe to struggle with the direction

00:04:25.915 --> 00:04:28.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on how to deal with disfellowshipped ones.

00:04:28.117 --> 00:04:30.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It tests our faith.

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:35.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, when somebody is heading
into a wayward way, or course,

00:04:35.124 --> 00:04:39.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we all do what we can to help
—the friends, family, the elders, everybody.

00:04:39.662 --> 00:04:44.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when someone has reached the point
when he has to be disfellowshipped,

00:04:44.067 --> 00:04:46.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah now, in effect, says:

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:48.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I have this now.

00:04:48.471 --> 00:04:50.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Leave this to me.’

00:04:50.473 --> 00:04:52.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what do we have to do?

00:04:52.475 --> 00:04:57.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to back off
and trust Jehovah and his organization.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we can illustrate it this way:

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:03.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could picture (maybe) having
a nice family meal with your family.

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And during the evening,
suddenly your uncle

00:05:06.055 --> 00:05:09.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
grabs his chest
and falls over on the floor unconscious.

00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:10.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what happens?

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we all jump into action.

00:05:12.962 --> 00:05:14.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Somebody starts doing CPR;

00:05:14.698 --> 00:05:16.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
somebody calls the paramedics;

00:05:16.332 --> 00:05:18.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the rest of us try to do what we can.

00:05:18.634 --> 00:05:21.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what do we do when the paramedics arrive?

00:05:21.671 --> 00:05:23.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We step out of the way,

00:05:23.873 --> 00:05:26.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we leave our loved one
in the hands of those

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:28.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who’ve been trained
to handle medical emergencies.

00:05:28.978 --> 00:05:32.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, would we ever think
of pulling the paramedics off of our uncle

00:05:32.682 --> 00:05:35.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and insisting that no,
we’re going to care for him ourself?

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:36.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:41.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that by doing that, we will
greatly reduce the chances of him surviving.

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:44.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, we leave it to the paramedics,

00:05:44.627 --> 00:05:46.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we hope for the best.

00:05:46.863 --> 00:05:50.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, sometimes the patient recovers.

00:05:50.967 --> 00:05:55.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, sometimes
the patient does not recover.

00:05:55.238 --> 00:05:59.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, yet, we know that he has
a much better chance of recovering

00:05:59.709 --> 00:06:02.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the hands of the trained paramedics.

00:06:02.078 --> 00:06:06.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And see, the same is true
with our loved ones who leave Jehovah.

00:06:06.115 --> 00:06:08.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first, we try to do what we can,

00:06:08.184 --> 00:06:12.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then we step back and leave it
to the paramedics, if you will

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:16.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the spiritually qualified men
who are trained to offer

00:06:16.392 --> 00:06:18.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
necessary spiritual assistance.

00:06:18.928 --> 00:06:21.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Jehovah’s arrangement.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it doesn’t mean that it’s easy.

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:24.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s painful; it hurts.

00:06:24.867 --> 00:06:28.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s similar to watching
those events unfold with your uncle there

00:06:28.404 --> 00:06:31.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it’s emotional; it hurts.

00:06:31.074 --> 00:06:33.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what do we do to get through it?

00:06:33.076 --> 00:06:34.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the same thing that Paul did.

00:06:34.544 --> 00:06:37.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look back and notice there
in chapter 3 and verse 18.

00:06:37.947 --> 00:06:41.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says that this distressed him
so much that he wept.

00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:43.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But where was his focus?

00:06:43.453 --> 00:06:45.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at verse 20:

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:48.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But our citizenship exists in the heavens,

00:06:48.925 --> 00:06:53.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we are eagerly waiting for a savior
from there, the Lord Jesus Christ.”

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, he stayed focused
on his hope for the future.

00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:02.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The third thing we’ll discuss
that Paul was dealing with is concerns

00:07:02.572 --> 00:07:05.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about potential divisions
in the congregation.

00:07:05.608 --> 00:07:09.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what he says,
as recorded at Philippians 2:2.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “Make my joy full by being
of the same mind and having the same love,

00:07:15.985 --> 00:07:20.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being completely united,
having the one thought in mind.”

00:07:20.456 --> 00:07:22.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unity.

00:07:22.458 --> 00:07:26.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul was concerned with divisions
cropping up in the congregation.

00:07:26.996 --> 00:07:29.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unity was the theme
of his letter to the Ephesians,

00:07:29.799 --> 00:07:32.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was also featured
in his letter to the Colossians

00:07:32.268 --> 00:07:34.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all of which were written
around the same time

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the letter to the Philippian congregation.

00:07:37.974 --> 00:07:42.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why was Paul so concerned about unity?

00:07:42.578 --> 00:07:46.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, because highly charged issues
were circulating at that time.

00:07:46.816 --> 00:07:50.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One that wouldn’t go away
was the issue of circumcision.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some were insisting that everybody
must get circumcised.

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:58.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others would say, “No, it’s
a personal choice whether you do or not.”

00:07:58.027 --> 00:08:01.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
False teachers were using
this issue to discredit

00:08:01.497 --> 00:08:04.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul’s position as an apostle.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the governing body

00:08:06.502 --> 00:08:10.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had made their position
on this subject very clear.

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:12.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what did Paul do?

00:08:12.642 --> 00:08:16.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he trusted Jehovah
and Jehovah’s representatives,

00:08:16.712 --> 00:08:19.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he supported the decision.

00:08:19.315 --> 00:08:22.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, do we see similar situations today?

00:08:22.652 --> 00:08:26.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, there are many
highly charged issues that exist

00:08:26.556 --> 00:08:30.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have the potential
of creating divisions in the congregation.

00:08:30.793 --> 00:08:33.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must never let that happen.

00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:35.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a test of our faith.

00:08:35.531 --> 00:08:37.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what did Paul do?

00:08:37.533 --> 00:08:40.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, notice a few verses down in verse 5.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “Keep this mental attitude in you

00:08:43.739 --> 00:08:46.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was also in Christ Jesus.”

00:08:46.876 --> 00:08:50.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He focused on the Christ—on the big picture.

00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:52.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And see, we need to do the same:

00:08:52.481 --> 00:08:54.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Focus on Jesus;

00:08:54.684 --> 00:08:59.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trust that Christ
is leading this organization;

00:08:59.322 --> 00:09:04.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trust those whom Jehovah and Jesus
trust to take the lead;

00:09:04.327 --> 00:09:08.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keep our focus
on the goal and the big picture.

00:09:08.064 --> 00:09:11.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we think about it,
we appreciate so much

00:09:11.167 --> 00:09:14.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all that Jehovah and his organization
have done for us.

00:09:14.604 --> 00:09:15.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And isn’t it true?

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:18.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see clearly how the direction

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ve received over the years indicates

00:09:21.377 --> 00:09:24.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is clearly with his people,
with his organization,

00:09:24.847 --> 00:09:27.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Governing Body
(those who are taking the lead),

00:09:27.883 --> 00:09:30.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that Christ is firmly in control.

00:09:31.454 --> 00:09:35.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why would we question
the direction we’re getting now?

00:09:36.759 --> 00:09:40.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, our scripture text
provides very good lessons

00:09:40.162 --> 00:09:44.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us navigate
troubling and distressing times.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:49.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philippians 3:14: “I am pressing on toward
the goal for the prize.”

00:09:49.238 --> 00:09:51.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we need to have
the same attitude whether our prize

00:09:51.907 --> 00:09:55.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is everlasting life
in the heavens or here on earth.

00:09:55.811 --> 00:09:58.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like when Paul wrote to the Philippians,

00:09:58.147 --> 00:10:02.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are many things
that can divert our focus today.

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:05.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And focusing on these troublesome situations

00:10:05.187 --> 00:10:09.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can cause us to become anxious, bitter,

00:10:09.125 --> 00:10:13.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
depressed, angry, or distracted.

00:10:13.429 --> 00:10:15.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So may we follow Paul’s example

00:10:15.631 --> 00:10:18.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and keep our eyes
fixed firmly on the big picture

00:10:18.834 --> 00:10:20.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the goal that is set before us.

00:10:20.703 --> 00:10:24.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May we stay focused
on the incredible privilege that we have

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be a part of this organization
and what Jehovah is doing in these last days,

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:32.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the undeniable evidence
that Jehovah is blessing his people

00:10:32.948 --> 00:10:37.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and blessing those who are taking the lead,
and that Christ is firmly in control.

00:10:37.386 --> 00:10:40.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay focused on the unfolding
of Bible prophecy

00:10:40.256 --> 00:10:43.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our beautiful hope
that we have for the future.

00:10:43.125 --> 00:10:45.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we do, like Paul,

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:50.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one day we will not need
to ‘press on any longer to the goal’

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we will be living it.

00:00:01 So our text for today is
00:00:03 Philippians 3:14,
00:00:06 and here the apostle Paul
00:00:08 assures the Philippian congregation
00:00:10 that he has not lost sight of the goal.
00:00:12 In spite of all the distressing things
00:00:14 that he’s dealing with, he’s keeping his mind on the big picture
00:00:18 —the advancement of the good news and the hope that he has for the future.
00:00:22 Well, how can this help us?
00:00:25 Well, let’s consider three things
00:00:27 that Paul was dealing with during the time
00:00:29 that he was writing his letter to the Philippians
00:00:31 that could have diverted his focus and see what we can learn.
00:00:36 The first thing  we’ll consider is discouragement.
00:00:39 Well, why?
00:00:41 Well, Paul, as we know, was under house arrest at the time.
00:00:44 He could not do what he wanted to do for Jehovah.
00:00:48 It’s thought that when Paul wrote his letter to the Philippians,
00:00:51 he had been under house arrest for a year or more.
00:00:55 How discouraging this could have been for Paul!
00:00:59 Also, we remember that during this time the Philippian congregation
00:01:02 had sent Epaphroditus to Paul with a gift from the congregation.
00:01:07 Well, what happened?
00:01:09 Epaphroditus was to go and encourage Paul,
00:01:11 but he ended up getting sick to the point of death and then got depressed.
00:01:16 So now, rather than receiving help,
00:01:19 Paul had to worry about and help Epaphroditus to recover
00:01:22 and then deal with his depression and then eventually send him back home,
00:01:26 all the while dealing with his own situation.
00:01:29 And finally, who knows the emotional ups and downs
00:01:33 that Paul dealt with during his imprisonment?
00:01:36 We can imagine him getting reports of:
00:01:38 ‘I think your case is going to get heard soon.
00:01:41 Maybe you can leave soon.’
00:01:42 And then: ‘No, sorry.
00:01:44 ‘Nothing is happening.
00:01:45 You’re going to be here for a while.’
00:01:48 Well, can you relate to Paul?
00:01:50 Many of our brothers and sisters are getting
00:01:54 emotionally and physically distressed or fatigued
00:01:57 because of this pandemic.
00:01:59 Some of them feel like they are in house arrest.
00:02:01 There seems to be no end in sight.
00:02:04 Sometimes it’s like we take one step forward and two steps back.
00:02:08 We cannot do the things that we want to do for Jehovah.
00:02:11 Well, what do we learn from Paul?
00:02:13 What did he do?
00:02:15 Let’s look at Philippians 1:12.
00:02:19 Where was his focus?
00:02:21 Philippians 1:12—he says:
00:02:22 “Now I want you to know, brothers,
00:02:24 “that my situation has actually
00:02:26 turned out for the advancement of the good news.”
00:02:30 He focused on advancing the good news—the big picture.
00:02:33 In verse 13, he talks about how his situation
00:02:36 was giving a witness to the prison guards,
00:02:38 how his endurance, in verse 14, was encouraging the congregation.
00:02:43 He was not in the situation he wanted to be in,
00:02:46 but he focused on the positive.
00:02:49 See, we need to do the same —keep our focus on the big picture.
00:02:54 The increases that we hear about and the incredible experiences
00:02:57 that we’re hearing show that Jehovah’s people
00:03:00 are continuing to advance Kingdom interests
00:03:03 even during these difficult times.
00:03:06 Now, we have heard so many encouraging reports that remind us
00:03:10 that Jehovah has been with his people and with his organization
00:03:14 during this last period of time —during this pandemic—
00:03:18 so that his organization not only continued
00:03:21 functioning but flourishing.
00:03:24 Should we lose trust now
00:03:27 that Jehovah will not carry us the rest of the way?
00:03:30 This is a good reminder from Paul.
00:03:32 What else was Paul dealing with?
00:03:34 Well, our second point is that he was dealing with pain of heart
00:03:38 because of those who had left the truth.
00:03:40 Look at chapter 3 and verse 18 —Philippians 3:18.
00:03:46 He says: “For there are many
00:03:48 “—I used to mention them often but now I mention them also with weeping—
00:03:53 who are walking as enemies of the torture stake of the Christ.”
00:03:58 Yes, some who used to be close to Paul had abandoned the truth.
00:04:01 This distressed him.
00:04:03 It made him weep.
00:04:05 Well, can we relate?
00:04:07 Well, yes.
00:04:08 Some among us have very close family members or friends
00:04:12 who have left the truth and are now disfellowshipped, and that’s painful.
00:04:16 Now, when emotions are running high,
00:04:18 it can cause us to question decisions made by the elders
00:04:22 or maybe to struggle with the direction
00:04:25 on how to deal with disfellowshipped ones.
00:04:28 It tests our faith.
00:04:30 You see, when somebody is heading into a wayward way, or course,
00:04:35 we all do what we can to help —the friends, family, the elders, everybody.
00:04:39 But when someone has reached the point when he has to be disfellowshipped,
00:04:44 Jehovah now, in effect, says:
00:04:46 ‘I have this now.
00:04:48 Leave this to me.’
00:04:50 And what do we have to do?
00:04:52 We have to back off and trust Jehovah and his organization.
00:04:57 Now, we can illustrate it this way:
00:04:59 You could picture (maybe) having a nice family meal with your family.
00:05:03 And during the evening, suddenly your uncle
00:05:06 grabs his chest and falls over on the floor unconscious.
00:05:09 Well, what happens?
00:05:10 Well, we all jump into action.
00:05:12 Somebody starts doing CPR;
00:05:14 somebody calls the paramedics;
00:05:16 the rest of us try to do what we can.
00:05:18 But what do we do when the paramedics arrive?
00:05:21 We step out of the way,
00:05:23 and we leave our loved one in the hands of those
00:05:26 who’ve been trained to handle medical emergencies.
00:05:28 Now, would we ever think of pulling the paramedics off of our uncle
00:05:32 and insisting that no, we’re going to care for him ourself?
00:05:35 No.
00:05:36 We know that by doing that, we will greatly reduce the chances of him surviving.
00:05:41 See, we leave it to the paramedics,
00:05:44 and we hope for the best.
00:05:46 Now, sometimes the patient recovers.
00:05:50 Sadly, sometimes the patient does not recover.
00:05:55 But, yet, we know that he has a much better chance of recovering
00:05:59 at the hands of the trained paramedics.
00:06:02 And see, the same is true with our loved ones who leave Jehovah.
00:06:06 At first, we try to do what we can,
00:06:08 but then we step back and leave it to the paramedics, if you will
00:06:12 —the spiritually qualified men who are trained to offer
00:06:16 necessary spiritual assistance.
00:06:18 That’s Jehovah’s arrangement.
00:06:21 But it doesn’t mean that it’s easy.
00:06:23 It’s painful; it hurts.
00:06:24 It’s similar to watching those events unfold with your uncle there
00:06:28 —it’s emotional; it hurts.
00:06:31 Well, what do we do to get through it?
00:06:33 Well, the same thing that Paul did.
00:06:34 Look back and notice there in chapter 3 and verse 18.
00:06:37 It says that this distressed him so much that he wept.
00:06:41 But where was his focus?
00:06:43 Look at verse 20:
00:06:45 “But our citizenship exists in the heavens,
00:06:48 and we are eagerly waiting for a savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ.”
00:06:53 Yes, he stayed focused on his hope for the future.
00:06:58 The third thing we’ll discuss that Paul was dealing with is concerns
00:07:02 about potential divisions in the congregation.
00:07:05 Notice what he says, as recorded at Philippians 2:2.
00:07:10 He says: “Make my joy full by being of the same mind and having the same love,
00:07:15 being completely united, having the one thought in mind.”
00:07:20 Unity.
00:07:22 Paul was concerned with divisions cropping up in the congregation.
00:07:26 Unity was the theme of his letter to the Ephesians,
00:07:29 and it was also featured in his letter to the Colossians
00:07:32 —all of which were written around the same time
00:07:34 as the letter to the Philippian congregation.
00:07:37 Why was Paul so concerned about unity?
00:07:42 Well, because highly charged issues were circulating at that time.
00:07:46 One that wouldn’t go away was the issue of circumcision.
00:07:50 Some were insisting that everybody must get circumcised.
00:07:54 Others would say, “No, it’s a personal choice whether you do or not.”
00:07:58 False teachers were using this issue to discredit
00:08:01 Paul’s position as an apostle.
00:08:04 Now, the governing body
00:08:06 had made their position on this subject very clear.
00:08:10 Well, what did Paul do?
00:08:12 Well, he trusted Jehovah and Jehovah’s representatives,
00:08:16 and he supported the decision.
00:08:19 Well, do we see similar situations today?
00:08:22 Yes, there are many highly charged issues that exist
00:08:26 that have the potential of creating divisions in the congregation.
00:08:30 We must never let that happen.
00:08:33 It’s a test of our faith.
00:08:35 Well, what did Paul do?
00:08:37 Well, notice a few verses down in verse 5.
00:08:40 He says: “Keep this mental attitude in you
00:08:43 that was also in Christ Jesus.”
00:08:46 He focused on the Christ—on the big picture.
00:08:50 And see, we need to do the same:
00:08:52 Focus on Jesus;
00:08:54 trust that Christ is leading this organization;
00:08:59 trust those whom Jehovah and Jesus trust to take the lead;
00:09:04 keep our focus on the goal and the big picture.
00:09:08 And when we think about it, we appreciate so much
00:09:11 all that Jehovah and his organization have done for us.
00:09:14 And isn’t it true?
00:09:15 We see clearly how the direction
00:09:18 that we’ve received over the years indicates
00:09:21 that Jehovah is clearly with his people, with his organization,
00:09:24 with the Governing Body (those who are taking the lead),
00:09:27 and that Christ is firmly in control.
00:09:31 Why would we question the direction we’re getting now?
00:09:36 Yes, our scripture text provides very good lessons
00:09:40 to help us navigate troubling and distressing times.
00:09:44 Philippians 3:14: “I am pressing on toward the goal for the prize.”
00:09:49 And we need to have the same attitude whether our prize
00:09:51 is everlasting life in the heavens or here on earth.
00:09:55 And like when Paul wrote to the Philippians,
00:09:58 there are many things that can divert our focus today.
00:10:02 And focusing on these troublesome situations
00:10:05 can cause us to become anxious, bitter,
00:10:09 depressed, angry, or distracted.
00:10:13 So may we follow Paul’s example
00:10:15 and keep our eyes fixed firmly on the big picture
00:10:18 —the goal that is set before us.
00:10:20 May we stay focused on the incredible privilege that we have
00:10:24 to be a part of this organization and what Jehovah is doing in these last days,
00:10:29 on the undeniable evidence that Jehovah is blessing his people
00:10:32 and blessing those who are taking the lead, and that Christ is firmly in control.
00:10:37 Stay focused on the unfolding of Bible prophecy
00:10:40 and our beautiful hope that we have for the future.
00:10:43 And if we do, like Paul,
00:10:45 one day we will not need to ‘press on any longer to the goal’
00:10:50 because we will be living it.

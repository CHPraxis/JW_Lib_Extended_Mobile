What made Ezra such a sterling example

00:00:03.987 --> 00:00:06.556 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of faith and trust in God?

00:00:06.556 --> 00:00:09.125 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And more important, how can you and I

00:00:09.125 --> 00:00:09.959 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—how can we—

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:12.228 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
imitate the total reliance

00:00:12.228 --> 00:00:14.864 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that Ezra put on Jehovah God

00:00:14.864 --> 00:00:16.166 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and in His Word?

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:17.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s find out.

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:20.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s examine Ezra chapter 7.

00:00:20.036 --> 00:00:23.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s open our Bibles to Ezra chapter 7,

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to look at verses 6 and 7.

00:00:27.577 --> 00:00:30.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, verse 6, it says:

00:00:30.547 --> 00:00:33.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Ezra came up from Babylon.”

00:00:33.516 --> 00:00:35.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s where he lived.

00:00:35.018 --> 00:00:38.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, he was
under the Medo-Persian Empire at the time,

00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:39.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he lived there.

00:00:39.823 --> 00:00:43.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he was “well-versed in the Law”
and “a skilled copyist.”

00:00:43.593 --> 00:00:45.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But verse 7, it says

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:49.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he “went up to Jerusalem

00:00:49.365 --> 00:00:54.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes.”

00:00:55.038 --> 00:00:57.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the seventh year of King Artaxerxes

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be the year 468 B.C.E.

00:01:01.878 --> 00:01:03.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as a reference point,

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have 607 B.C.E.,
when Jerusalem was destroyed;

00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:13.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
537 B.C.E., when the Jews returned
to their homeland in Jerusalem;

00:01:13.423 --> 00:01:16.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 515 B.C.E., when,
under the encouragement

00:01:16.092 --> 00:01:18.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Haggai and Zechariah,

00:01:18.294 --> 00:01:21.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Jews rebuilt the temple of Jehovah.

00:01:21.231 --> 00:01:25.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, at that time,
Ezra probably wasn’t even born yet.

00:01:25.135 --> 00:01:27.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he enters into the picture here

00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:32.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the year 468 B.C.E.

00:01:32.475 --> 00:01:35.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the question is,
What would have moved Ezra

00:01:35.578 --> 00:01:38.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to want to move to Jerusalem?

00:01:38.548 --> 00:01:43.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was probably around 30 years old
when he made this move.

00:01:43.086 --> 00:01:45.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he wanted to advance pure worship,

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:49.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even that, as it mentions in verse 10,

00:01:49.225 --> 00:01:52.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he wanted “to teach [the] regulations
and judgments in Israel.”

00:01:52.595 --> 00:01:55.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what would have moved him to do that?

00:01:55.398 --> 00:01:57.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Ezra would have lived
during the time period

00:01:57.567 --> 00:02:00.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Esther and Mordecai.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was the time period
when Haman tried to exterminate the Jews.

00:02:05.408 --> 00:02:09.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that was in the year 484 B.C.E.,

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:12.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Ezra was a teenager at that time.

00:02:12.348 --> 00:02:14.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he would have seen firsthand

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how Jehovah defended his people

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:19.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how Jehovah strengthened
and cared for his people.

00:02:19.923 --> 00:02:22.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This event
—this national crisis—

00:02:22.592 --> 00:02:25.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would have made an indelible impression,
an imprint,

00:02:25.428 --> 00:02:27.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on that young man’s mind and heart.

00:02:27.463 --> 00:02:30.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And no doubt he said to himself:
‘When I get of age,

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:31.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I want to go to Jerusalem.

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:36.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to be there to help
and advance pure worship.’

00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:38.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s what he decides to do.

00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:43.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, it wasn’t easy for Ezra
to make this move to Jerusalem,

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:46.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s where we come to verse 10:

00:02:48.051 --> 00:02:51.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Ezra had prepared his heart

00:02:51.387 --> 00:02:53.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to consult the Law of Jehovah.”

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:57.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So to prepare his heart,
what did Ezra have to do?

00:02:57.093 --> 00:02:59.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did he prepare his heart?

00:02:59.495 --> 00:03:03.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He must have asked himself questions:

00:03:03.032 --> 00:03:05.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why do I want to go to Jerusalem?

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:09.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Is it just to make a name for myself,
or is it to honor Jehovah?

00:03:09.772 --> 00:03:11.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How do I feel about going there?

00:03:11.808 --> 00:03:15.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How do I feel about leaving
my family and my friends

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:18.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and this comfortable way of life
that I have here in Babylon

00:03:18.715 --> 00:03:22.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘—I’m going to leave it all behind;
I’m going to move to this distant land

00:03:22.518 --> 00:03:26.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to live under circumstances
that would be difficult?’

00:03:26.322 --> 00:03:31.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he’s preparing his heart
by asking himself these questions.

00:03:31.227 --> 00:03:33.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he was desirous

00:03:33.396 --> 00:03:36.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of putting Jehovah’s work first.

00:03:36.566 --> 00:03:38.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, notice here in verse 10, it says

00:03:38.935 --> 00:03:41.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that then he wanted “to consult

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:45.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Law of Jehovah.”

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:47.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why we love Ezra.

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:49.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He consults the Law of Jehovah.

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:52.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was his love;
that was his first priority.

00:03:52.916 --> 00:03:56.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t consult the arithmetic,
the astronomy,

00:03:56.786 --> 00:03:59.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the history, the chronology,
and the geography of Babylon.

00:03:59.923 --> 00:04:03.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, it was the Law of Jehovah.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, Ezra had deep respect
for that Law of Jehovah.

00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:09.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is the one who wrote
First and Second Chronicles.

00:04:09.766 --> 00:04:13.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It shows that he was
a deep student of God’s Word

00:04:13.436 --> 00:04:16.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and familiar with Psalm 119:18.

00:04:16.306 --> 00:04:18.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can imagine him saying before studying:

00:04:18.975 --> 00:04:21.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Open my eyes so that I may see clearly

00:04:21.544 --> 00:04:24.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the wonderful things of your law.”

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:26.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Ezra.

00:04:26.115 --> 00:04:28.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we think about him

00:04:28.284 --> 00:04:32.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how he meditated deeply
on the information that he gathered—

00:04:32.221 --> 00:04:35.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gathered information about the kings
of Judah and about the priesthood.

00:04:35.992 --> 00:04:39.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was his interest
—to track the line leading to the Messiah.

00:04:39.963 --> 00:04:42.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he did more than just gather facts,

00:04:42.865 --> 00:04:44.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he applied what he learned.

00:04:44.867 --> 00:04:46.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It touched his heart.

00:04:46.636 --> 00:04:48.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we know?

00:04:48.137 --> 00:04:51.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice in verse 10, it said,

00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:53.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after “consult[ing] the Law of Jehovah,”

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and to practice it.”

00:04:56.813 --> 00:05:01.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To practice it”
—Ezra was ready to act upon what he studied.

00:05:01.017 --> 00:05:04.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What he learned stirred his feelings,
touched his emotions,

00:05:04.253 --> 00:05:07.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and moved him to draw closer to Jehovah God.

00:05:07.423 --> 00:05:09.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was his whole goal of studying.

00:05:09.926 --> 00:05:11.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then he acted to help his brothers.

00:05:11.928 --> 00:05:13.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did move to Jerusalem; he acted.

00:05:13.796 --> 00:05:16.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did it in spite of the inconveniences

00:05:16.632 --> 00:05:19.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the problems that he would be facing.

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:22.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s look at chapter 8,

00:05:22.638 --> 00:05:24.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse 22,

00:05:24.974 --> 00:05:28.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just to highlight again
how he was moved by what he read.

00:05:28.378 --> 00:05:31.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just not a fact-finding mission.

00:05:31.614 --> 00:05:34.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 8, verse 22,

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says here that as he was ready
to leave Babylon

00:05:38.121 --> 00:05:40.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and move to Jerusalem,

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in speaking to the king,
he said: “I was ashamed

00:05:42.558 --> 00:05:45.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen

00:05:45.428 --> 00:05:47.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to protect us
against the enemies along the way,

00:05:47.797 --> 00:05:50.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[I’m ashamed to do that]

00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:52.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because we had said to the king:
‘The good hand of our God

00:05:52.835 --> 00:05:55.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘is over all those seeking him, . . .

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:58.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his strength . . . [is] against all those
[who are against] him.’”

00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:00.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I was ashamed.”

00:06:00.343 --> 00:06:01.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the point?

00:06:01.577 --> 00:06:05.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as he again tracked those Judean kings

00:06:05.815 --> 00:06:07.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(because that’s what
First and Second Chronicles do,

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:11.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
track the Judean kings
leading to the Messiah),

00:06:11.687 --> 00:06:15.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imagine how he meditated when he got to David

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:18.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or Hezekiah

00:06:18.327 --> 00:06:20.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—185,000 Assyrians killed in one night.

00:06:20.997 --> 00:06:22.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about Josiah?

00:06:22.398 --> 00:06:25.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about Asa
—a million Ethiopians killed?

00:06:25.068 --> 00:06:27.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about Jehoshaphat?

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The combined enemies of Moab, Edom,
Ammon, and so forth

00:06:30.373 --> 00:06:32.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came up against Jehoshaphat,

00:06:32.742 --> 00:06:34.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet Jehovah defended them.

00:06:34.844 --> 00:06:37.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had this in his mind,

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s why he said:
‘I’m ashamed because of what I’ve studied.

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:43.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘No, I don’t need an escort, dear king.

00:06:43.986 --> 00:06:45.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is going to be with us.’

00:06:45.988 --> 00:06:49.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it just shows the same point for us
when we study.

00:06:49.392 --> 00:06:51.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s part of our worship.

00:06:51.527 --> 00:06:55.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we study to draw close to Jehovah God,
not simply to gather facts,

00:06:55.798 --> 00:07:00.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but to allow our attachment to Jehovah God
to get stronger.

00:07:01.204 --> 00:07:03.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, the <i>Watchtower </i> Study.

00:07:03.206 --> 00:07:05.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we study <i>The Watchtower,</i>

00:07:05.341 --> 00:07:07.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but is it just to find an answer?

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it that ‘Oh, I need to make a comment’?

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:12.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not why we study
the <i>Watchtower</i>  magazine.

00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:13.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s part of pure worship.

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:15.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s being fed
by “the faithful and discreet slave.”

00:07:15.952 --> 00:07:19.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read <i>The Watchtower</i>  and we open
the Scriptures to draw close to Jehovah God.

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:22.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the meantime: ‘Yes, I found an answer.

00:07:22.325 --> 00:07:24.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can make a comment.’

00:07:24.026 --> 00:07:27.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But our primary goal is to feed our hearts.

00:07:27.497 --> 00:07:29.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do I feel about what I’m reading?

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:30.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We prepare our hearts.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is my motive in studying the lesson?

00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:35.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each time we open up God’s Word,

00:07:35.738 --> 00:07:40.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our attitude should be like Samuel,
who was told to say:

00:07:40.076 --> 00:07:44.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Speak, Jehovah,
for your servant is listening.”

00:07:45.848 --> 00:07:49.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezra also was given
insight and understanding,

00:07:49.986 --> 00:07:52.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that enabled him
to be a blessing to the nation

00:07:52.155 --> 00:07:54.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he dug deep into God’s Word.

00:07:54.223 --> 00:07:58.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, in chapter 9, verse 2,

00:07:58.861 --> 00:08:00.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he recognized,
when he got there to Jerusalem,

00:08:00.963 --> 00:08:04.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ‘the holy offspring was being mingled
with the pagan nations.’

00:08:04.634 --> 00:08:06.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The men were marrying these pagan women.

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:10.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezra saw the disastrous consequences:

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You’re going to mingle the holy seed
along with pagan women?

00:08:14.544 --> 00:08:18.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You’re going to assimilate the whole nation
into a pagan environment?

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:20.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You’re going to merge true worship?

00:08:20.082 --> 00:08:23.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It could vanish from the earth in time
if not careful.

00:08:23.352 --> 00:08:26.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You wouldn’t be able to locate
the Messiah, the lineage.

00:08:26.789 --> 00:08:28.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Is he of the line of David?
We don’t know.

00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is he of the tribe of Judah?
We don’t know.”

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezra saw that, and he acted

00:08:33.896 --> 00:08:38.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the insight
that Jehovah God gave him.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now notice chapter 10, verse 1

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:45.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(because it again gives us insight
into the beauty of Ezra’s personality),

00:08:45.274 --> 00:08:47.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he did act on it

00:08:47.443 --> 00:08:50.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and got rid of those foreign wives

00:08:50.513 --> 00:08:52.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(chapter 10, verse 1),

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:56.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his humble confession before Jehovah God

00:08:56.786 --> 00:09:00.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what happens
when he humbly prays to Jehovah:

00:09:00.923 --> 00:09:04.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A large crowd of men, women,
and children of [Jerusalem]

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gathered around him . . .
[and] were weeping.”

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Ezra.

00:09:09.832 --> 00:09:14.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They did not cringe and retreat
before a tyrant.

00:09:14.103 --> 00:09:17.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, they were drawn to a loving shepherd.

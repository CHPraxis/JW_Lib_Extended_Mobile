00:00:01.017 --> 00:00:03.053 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to talk about money.

00:00:03.053 --> 00:00:05.055 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, the fact is,

00:00:05.055 --> 00:00:07.057 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we never beg for money.

00:00:07.057 --> 00:00:08.525 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But that’s not to say

00:00:08.525 --> 00:00:10.326 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we can’t talk about money

00:00:10.326 --> 00:00:11.928 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s organization

00:00:11.928 --> 00:00:13.463 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—the earthly part.

00:00:13.463 --> 00:00:16.132 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So it’s long standing;

00:00:16.132 --> 00:00:18.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is a balance here.

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:22.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Going back to <i>The Watchtower,</i>
a long time ago, it says:

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We have never considered it proper
to solicit money for the Lord’s cause,

00:00:27.911 --> 00:00:31.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“after the common custom
[referring to Christendom]; . . .

00:00:31.414 --> 00:00:36.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is our judgment that money raised
by the various begging devices

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:38.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the name of our Lord is offensive,

00:00:38.988 --> 00:00:41.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“unacceptable to him,

00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:43.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and does not bring his blessing

00:00:43.493 --> 00:00:47.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
either upon the givers
or the work accomplished.”

00:00:47.997 --> 00:00:52.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we do not need to be coerced into giving.

00:00:52.102 --> 00:00:56.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We gladly use our money
to support Kingdom activities.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that stands to this day.

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:04.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we’d never want to come to the conclusion
that we can’t talk about money.

00:01:04.914 --> 00:01:09.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Money has to be discussed
in these last days in this system.

00:01:09.919 --> 00:01:12.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It “meets a response in all things.”

00:01:12.856 --> 00:01:16.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I thought we’d take some thoughts
from the <i>Kingdom</i>  book:

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
three reasons why we’re willing
—so willing to give.

00:01:20.997 --> 00:01:22.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some beautiful thoughts.

00:01:22.432 --> 00:01:25.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the first one is connected

00:01:25.335 --> 00:01:29.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with “doing what is pleasing
in [Jehovah’s] eyes.”

00:01:29.105 --> 00:01:31.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finding

00:01:31.107 --> 00:01:35.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Second Corinthians reference here

00:01:35.044 --> 00:01:39.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is so crucial in helping people understand

00:01:39.482 --> 00:01:41.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we don’t beg for money.

00:01:41.584 --> 00:01:45.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, nonetheless, we have to talk
about it from time to time.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here in the ninth chapter,

00:01:51.895 --> 00:01:54.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
donations and such were being discussed.

00:01:54.464 --> 00:01:57.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then this profound, inspired thought,

00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:59.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is reflecting Jehovah’s thinking,

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:02.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is in verse 7

00:02:02.272 --> 00:02:04.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—2 Corinthians 9:7:

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:08.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let each one do
just as he is resolved in his heart,

00:02:08.912 --> 00:02:12.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not grudgingly or under compulsion,

00:02:12.816 --> 00:02:15.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for God loves a cheerful giver.”

00:02:15.285 --> 00:02:17.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there we have it.

00:02:17.287 --> 00:02:20.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re happy to give to Jehovah.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When needs arise,

00:02:22.992 --> 00:02:26.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the organization
brings it to our attention

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:28.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—for example, disasters and such

00:02:28.998 --> 00:02:31.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like the report we had at the annual meeting

00:02:31.434 --> 00:02:34.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the increase in disasters—

00:02:34.337 --> 00:02:38.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
millions of dollars of God’s Kingdom money

00:02:38.308 --> 00:02:40.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was used to help our brothers.

00:02:40.777 --> 00:02:42.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when it comes to giving,

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:45.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s an individual responsibility,
as the verse says,

00:02:45.448 --> 00:02:49.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“resolved in his heart [or her heart],
not grudgingly.”

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:54.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the footnote
addresses the word “reluctantly.”

00:02:54.157 --> 00:02:57.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s not like we embarrass people

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or beg them, saying:
“Look, you’re well-off.

00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:02.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why aren’t you giving more?”

00:03:02.098 --> 00:03:05.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s not their business;
that’s not our business.

00:03:05.034 --> 00:03:07.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to resolve it in our own heart.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So while we discuss money,

00:03:10.006 --> 00:03:14.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we never come across
like we’re putting people

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:16.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—trying to get them

00:03:16.312 --> 00:03:19.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to even grudgingly give
just so we get the money.

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:21.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not this organization.

00:03:21.384 --> 00:03:26.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, Christendom,
they are experts at begging for money.

00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:28.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we love Jehovah.

00:03:28.725 --> 00:03:33.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to be
the kind of person that he loves.

00:03:33.363 --> 00:03:36.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice that beautiful expression:
“God loves a cheerful giver.”

00:03:36.866 --> 00:03:38.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One translation put it nicely:

00:03:38.935 --> 00:03:42.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God loves people who love to give.”

00:03:42.872 --> 00:03:44.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s true.

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:46.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we want Jehovah to love us.

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:49.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this money we might have

00:03:49.612 --> 00:03:53.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—whatever amount, depending
on our own personal circumstances—

00:03:53.816 --> 00:03:56.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re happy to give to Kingdom interests.

00:03:56.552 --> 00:04:00.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s the first one:
We make these donations

00:04:00.223 --> 00:04:02.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of our love for Jehovah.

00:04:02.225 --> 00:04:04.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now this second one, this is interesting

00:04:04.694 --> 00:04:08.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a heart-searching principle
found back in the Mosaic Law.

00:04:08.197 --> 00:04:11.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn to Deuteronomy chapter 16,

00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:13.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you would, please.

00:04:13.803 --> 00:04:16.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Deuteronomy 16,

00:04:16.773 --> 00:04:19.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll see the connection.

00:04:19.208 --> 00:04:22.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While this applied to the Jews at that time,

00:04:22.245 --> 00:04:25.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll see how it applies to us in our day.

00:04:25.081 --> 00:04:29.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to read verse 16
and then verse 17 of Deuteronomy 16.

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:32.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Three times a year,

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:35.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“all your males should appear
before Jehovah your God

00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:37.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the place that he chooses:

00:04:37.327 --> 00:04:39.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“at the Festival of Unleavened Bread,

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:41.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Festival of Weeks,

00:04:41.731 --> 00:04:44.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the Festival of Booths,

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[now notice,] and none of them

00:04:47.937 --> 00:04:51.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“should appear
before Jehovah empty-handed.

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:55.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The gift that each one brings
should be in proportion

00:04:55.244 --> 00:04:58.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the blessing
that Jehovah your God has given you.”

00:04:58.414 --> 00:05:01.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you let that sink in,

00:05:01.684 --> 00:05:05.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is what Jehovah wanted to be conveyed

00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:09.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Israelites
who would attend these festivals—“none.”

00:05:09.258 --> 00:05:11.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, he didn’t say,

00:05:11.294 --> 00:05:14.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If you’re well-off,
if you’ve had a great year

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:17.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(as opposed to some that were poor).’

00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:19.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They still had issues back at that time,

00:05:19.836 --> 00:05:22.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though it was Jehovah’s nation.

00:05:22.772 --> 00:05:25.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he said: 
‘None should appear empty-handed.’

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:27.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that takes in all of us,

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:29.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whatever our circumstances are,

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:31.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether at Bethel or in the field.

00:05:31.981 --> 00:05:36.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah doesn’t approve
of us coming empty-handed.

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:42.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would help us
not to come empty-handed,

00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:46.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this case,
back in Israel or in our time either?

00:05:46.162 --> 00:05:49.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice verse 17,
and this is a lot to think about:

00:05:49.565 --> 00:05:53.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The gift that each one brings
should be in proportion

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:56.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the blessing
that Jehovah your God has given you.”

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:58.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there we have it.

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:01.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You stop and reflect
that they were supposed to do that,

00:06:01.711 --> 00:06:04.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can do the same throughout the year.

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:08.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reflect on the blessings
that Jehovah God has given us.

00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:13.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have to take time to do that;
you have to give that consideration.

00:06:13.222 --> 00:06:16.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The gift that each one brings
should be in proportion to the blessing.”

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:18.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So adding up these blessings,

00:06:18.828 --> 00:06:22.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we’re happy to give
out of our material possessions.

00:06:22.965 --> 00:06:24.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So a profound thought there,

00:06:24.967 --> 00:06:29.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and something to reflect on
so that we don’t find ourselves

00:06:29.972 --> 00:06:34.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—when it comes to contributions
on a monthly basis or whatever—

00:06:34.177 --> 00:06:37.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
empty-handed, perhaps thinking,
‘Well, I’m doing so much here and there.’

00:06:37.747 --> 00:06:42.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, money meets a response in all things,

00:06:42.151 --> 00:06:44.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you have to take that into account,

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if we’re in the poor range.

00:06:47.623 --> 00:06:52.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the third one
is connected with our love for Jesus.

00:06:52.495 --> 00:06:56.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn to John chapter 14,
if you would, please

00:06:56.532 --> 00:06:59.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—John chapter 14.

00:06:59.268 --> 00:07:02.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We give and have voluntary contributions

00:07:02.538 --> 00:07:06.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we love our Lord Jesus.

00:07:06.342 --> 00:07:09.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice what he stated here,

00:07:09.445 --> 00:07:14.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John 14:23:

00:07:14.417 --> 00:07:17.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In answer Jesus said to him:

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘If anyone loves me,
he will observe my word,

00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:23.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and my Father will love him,

00:07:23.793 --> 00:07:27.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will come to him
and make our dwelling with him.’”

00:07:27.663 --> 00:07:31.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So appreciate how Jesus put it—“if.”

00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:34.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s a responsibility
that falls on us individually.

00:07:34.737 --> 00:07:37.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we say we love Jesus

00:07:37.206 --> 00:07:39.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(we’re not like Christendom

00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:41.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with this proclamation
of their love for Jesus,

00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:45.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they really don’t even know
the real Jesus, frankly,

00:07:45.248 --> 00:07:47.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until they get
an accurate knowledge of the truth),

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:49.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we’re in the truth

00:07:49.752 --> 00:07:52.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—dedicated, baptized servants of him—

00:07:52.755 --> 00:07:55.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we really love him,
we’re going to observe his word.

00:07:55.291 --> 00:07:57.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that means
not just carrying out the Kingdom work,

00:07:57.894 --> 00:08:00.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
putting our time and energy into it,

00:08:00.496 --> 00:08:02.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it also means money.

00:08:02.798 --> 00:08:07.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are willing to donate money
to support the worldwide work.

00:08:07.803 --> 00:08:10.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not ashamed to admit

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:13.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it takes money
to have these things operate

00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:18.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—branches, supporting
all of the preaching work,

00:08:18.014 --> 00:08:20.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Kingdom work,
and all these other initiatives

00:08:20.082 --> 00:08:22.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ve had in recent years.

00:08:22.118 --> 00:08:23.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes money.

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:27.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t go to people
that you buy things from and say,

00:08:27.023 --> 00:08:29.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, look,
this is a non-profit organization,”

00:08:29.959 --> 00:08:31.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trying to shame them, saying,
“Well, can you give it to me?”

00:08:31.961 --> 00:08:32.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:08:32.962 --> 00:08:36.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They want their money
and to be paid for the various things

00:08:36.732 --> 00:08:40.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have to use
to accomplish Jehovah’s work.

00:08:40.136 --> 00:08:43.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So something to keep in mind,
those three things:

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:47.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our love for Jehovah
—we want to do what’s pleasing to him.

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:50.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We count our blessings from Jehovah.

00:08:50.846 --> 00:08:54.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, we have our love for Christ Jesus.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we want to do whatever we can.

00:08:56.919 --> 00:09:00.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how you do it
with the financial contributions,

00:09:00.256 --> 00:09:02.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s a personal decision,

00:09:02.258 --> 00:09:04.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah dignifies us with that.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We never want to be shaming somebody

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:10.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we think should be doing thus and so.

00:09:10.233 --> 00:09:12.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a personal matter.

00:09:12.034 --> 00:09:15.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But keep in mind, sometimes, if you are poor

00:09:15.838 --> 00:09:18.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—remember the widow.

00:09:18.407 --> 00:09:21.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So she didn’t come there

00:09:21.043 --> 00:09:24.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the temple empty-handed.

00:09:24.513 --> 00:09:27.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She didn’t have much, but Jehovah loved her.

00:09:27.283 --> 00:09:29.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus loved her for giving what she had.

00:09:29.518 --> 00:09:31.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So even when we’re poor,

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re expected to give monetarily.

00:09:34.657 --> 00:09:37.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s because we love Jehovah,
we love Jesus,

00:09:37.193 --> 00:09:40.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we appreciate
all the blessings we receive

00:09:40.763 --> 00:09:43.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the year and are grateful.

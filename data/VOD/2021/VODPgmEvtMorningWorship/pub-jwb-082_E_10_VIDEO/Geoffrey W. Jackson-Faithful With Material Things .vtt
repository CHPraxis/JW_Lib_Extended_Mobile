00:00:01.017 --> 00:00:02.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This morning, we’re discussing

00:00:02.886 --> 00:00:05.288 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
this illustration that Jesus gave

00:00:05.288 --> 00:00:08.058 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
concerning the unrighteous steward.

00:00:08.058 --> 00:00:11.961 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Of course, it’s found at Luke 16:1-8.

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.365 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What is the real lesson

00:00:15.365 --> 00:00:18.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
behind this illustration that Jesus gave?

00:00:18.568 --> 00:00:22.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s interesting to note
that many people get distracted

00:00:22.472 --> 00:00:25.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even before they find out what the lesson is.

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:27.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How is that so?

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:31.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when they’re reading the Scriptures
and read chapter 15 of Luke,

00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:33.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they see what has been described

00:00:33.383 --> 00:00:37.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as one of the most powerful illustrations
Jesus ever gave

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that of the so-called prodigal son,
or the wasteful son.

00:00:41.024 --> 00:00:43.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then as they read on

00:00:43.093 --> 00:00:46.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they come to this illustration
which has been described

00:00:46.362 --> 00:00:50.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as one of the most
puzzling illustrations Jesus gave.

00:00:50.934 --> 00:00:55.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are so many people concerned
or puzzled by this illustration?

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:58.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, some people feel

00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:02.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus is supporting and condoning

00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:04.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the dishonest use of funds.

00:01:04.748 --> 00:01:07.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is that really the case?

00:01:07.417 --> 00:01:12.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should we get distracted,
wondering why Jesus used this illustration?

00:01:12.422 --> 00:01:14.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as Bible students,
it’s always good for us

00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:16.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see what the Bible says.

00:01:16.893 --> 00:01:21.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s take our Bibles
and turn together to Luke chapter 16.

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:24.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then rather than having
a preconceived idea,

00:01:24.868 --> 00:01:29.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s see what Jesus actually said,
as recorded here in Luke 16.

00:01:30.406 --> 00:01:32.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reading verse 1, it says:

00:01:32.408 --> 00:01:35.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then he also said to the disciples:

00:01:35.411 --> 00:01:37.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘A rich man had a steward

00:01:37.947 --> 00:01:41.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was accused
of handling his goods wastefully.’”

00:01:42.886 --> 00:01:44.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s the first question.

00:01:44.988 --> 00:01:47.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We notice, this man—

00:01:47.323 --> 00:01:50.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus doesn’t say he was found condemned

00:01:50.593 --> 00:01:52.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or he was actually doing something

00:01:52.996 --> 00:01:55.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that had been proven to be wrong,

00:01:55.498 --> 00:01:59.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it mentions here that he was accused.

00:01:59.636 --> 00:02:02.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>
made the interesting comment

00:02:02.238 --> 00:02:04.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this doesn’t necessarily mean to say

00:02:04.674 --> 00:02:08.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he did something wrong,
but he was accused of it.

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:12.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, the Greek that was used here
to record this illustration

00:02:12.816 --> 00:02:17.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allows for the fact
that perhaps he could have been slandered.

00:02:17.253 --> 00:02:19.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what was he accused of?

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:23.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, notice the last words there in verse 1:

00:02:23.426 --> 00:02:27.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of handling his goods wastefully.”

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he wasn’t accused of stealing

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:34.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but using things wastefully.

00:02:34.304 --> 00:02:39.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s interesting to note
that the word used here for “wastefully”

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:41.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the same word that’s used

00:02:41.444 --> 00:02:44.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the previous illustration
of the prodigal son

00:02:44.614 --> 00:02:47.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in chapter 15, verse 13,

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it speaks of the prodigal son
squandering the inheritance.

00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:55.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in that case,
the prodigal, or wasteful, son

00:02:55.925 --> 00:02:59.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t steal the money
from his father, did he?

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He received it in a legal way.

00:03:01.497 --> 00:03:04.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then,
the point was that he squandered it.

00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:08.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So likewise, here we see
that this steward was accused

00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:13.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of wastefully using what was the master’s.

00:03:13.843 --> 00:03:18.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s consider
what he was told in verse 2:

00:03:18.815 --> 00:03:23.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So he called him and said,
‘What is this I hear about you?

00:03:23.753 --> 00:03:27.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Hand in the account of your stewardship,

00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:29.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for you can no longer manage the house.’”

00:03:31.194 --> 00:03:34.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what did the master say to the steward?

00:03:34.831 --> 00:03:38.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he say to him:
‘You’re going to prison’

00:03:38.067 --> 00:03:40.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or ‘We’re going to have a court case’?

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact,
he didn’t even immediately remove him

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from that position of authority.

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what did he say to him?

00:03:48.511 --> 00:03:51.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You need to “hand in the account.”

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in other words,
the manager didn’t really know

00:03:54.183 --> 00:03:56.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what the steward was doing,

00:03:56.185 --> 00:04:00.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he allowed him the opportunity now
to hand in this account.

00:04:00.857 --> 00:04:03.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we look at the background

00:04:03.893 --> 00:04:06.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what actually was said here,

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when we think of it from the viewpoint

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:10.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those who listen to Jesus,

00:04:10.566 --> 00:04:13.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it seems that what the steward had done

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then proceeded to do

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:19.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was actually legitimate and legal.

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was concerned about his future.

00:04:21.644 --> 00:04:24.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If he knew that he had to hand in an account

00:04:24.314 --> 00:04:27.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would result in him going to prison,

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then certainly he probably
wouldn’t have acted the way that he did.

00:04:31.854 --> 00:04:35.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this raises some questions, doesn’t it?

00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:38.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps we might think:
‘Well, he went ahead

00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:42.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and reduced the debts of various ones.

00:04:42.265 --> 00:04:45.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wasn’t that the wrong thing to do?’

00:04:45.601 --> 00:04:48.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, to get the true understanding of this,

00:04:48.104 --> 00:04:50.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s good for us to take note

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the November <i>Watchtower</i>  of this year.

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:56.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the section that says “Did You Know?,”

00:04:56.913 --> 00:04:59.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it tells us there what was involved

00:04:59.515 --> 00:05:02.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a steward’s responsibility.

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:07.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Biblical times, apparently,
a steward could be the manager

00:05:07.357 --> 00:05:12.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the one who ran a household or an estate.

00:05:12.228 --> 00:05:15.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oftentimes, the owner
would just leave everything

00:05:15.965 --> 00:05:19.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
completely to the steward to care for.

00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:22.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All that he was interested in
was the final results.

00:05:22.438 --> 00:05:24.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would he get a profit or not?

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:28.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it’s interesting
that in this <i>Watchtower</i>  article,

00:05:28.077 --> 00:05:30.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it mentions the case of Joseph.

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:34.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we remember
from what Genesis chapter 39 tells us?

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says that Potiphar left everything

00:05:38.554 --> 00:05:40.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Joseph’s control.

00:05:40.656 --> 00:05:44.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he had no thought of anything
except the food that he was receiving.

00:05:44.727 --> 00:05:49.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here we have a situation
where the steward is a manager of an estate.

00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:54.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The master really isn’t concerned
with all the details of what’s happening,

00:05:54.037 --> 00:05:58.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at least up to this point,
and he still has authority.

00:05:59.442 --> 00:06:04.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So those that were listening to Jesus
—what may they have thought about?

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:06.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we don’t know for sure.

00:06:06.482 --> 00:06:08.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But perhaps they may have thought

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:13.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of this steward reducing the interest rate.

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:17.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or perhaps he reduced
his personal commission

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was originally put on these loans.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or perhaps originally in his enthusiasm,
he overcharged them,

00:06:25.835 --> 00:06:29.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now he was reducing it
down to the normal price.

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:34.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever the case,
we know that a steward who is a manager,

00:06:34.477 --> 00:06:36.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like many managers today,

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:39.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has the right to write off
certain debts completely

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:42.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even forgive certain debts.

00:06:42.218 --> 00:06:46.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, obviously, then,
as <i>The Watchtower</i>  pointed out,

00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:49.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this steward still had full control

00:06:49.292 --> 00:06:53.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and had the responsibility and the authority

00:06:53.362 --> 00:06:57.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to make
whatever changes he saw fit.

00:06:57.133 --> 00:07:02.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that begs the question,
Was he dishonest?

00:07:02.004 --> 00:07:06.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when we read a number
of versions of the Bible in English,

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:10.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they actually say the “dishonest steward”

00:07:10.313 --> 00:07:12.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they use the term “dishonest.”

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:16.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s have a look and see again
what the Bible actually says.

00:07:16.352 --> 00:07:19.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The <i>New World Translation</i>
very accurately translates it

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:21.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this way in verse 8:

00:07:21.824 --> 00:07:26.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And his master commended the steward,
though unrighteous.”

00:07:26.562 --> 00:07:28.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, it doesn’t say “dishonest.”

00:07:28.364 --> 00:07:30.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t say he was a thief.

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:35.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Though unrighteous,
because he acted with practical wisdom.”

00:07:36.239 --> 00:07:38.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we think of this,

00:07:38.774 --> 00:07:41.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this steward didn’t do the right thing.

00:07:41.377 --> 00:07:42.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what “unrighteous” means.

00:07:42.812 --> 00:07:44.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is a very broad statement.

00:07:44.814 --> 00:07:46.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what would have been
the right thing to do?

00:07:46.849 --> 00:07:49.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To do things for the master.

00:07:49.085 --> 00:07:52.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in this case,
he was doing something for himself.

00:07:52.588 --> 00:07:56.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, some Bible translators
have tried to capture that thought.

00:07:56.292 --> 00:07:58.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let me read you one example.

00:07:58.961 --> 00:08:03.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says, ‘His boss acknowledged
that the business manager

00:08:03.666 --> 00:08:06.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘who had permitted
the invoices to be changed

00:08:06.769 --> 00:08:11.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had acted cleverly
in his own selfish interest.’

00:08:12.842 --> 00:08:17.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we know exactly all the details
behind what Jesus was saying?

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:08:18.381 --> 00:08:20.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what does this help us to see?

00:08:20.116 --> 00:08:22.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t jump to conclusions.

00:08:22.118 --> 00:08:25.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read what the scripture says,
and don’t get distracted

00:08:25.188 --> 00:08:27.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by details that could take away

00:08:27.623 --> 00:08:30.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the beautiful lesson
that we should gain.

00:08:30.126 --> 00:08:31.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what is the lesson?

00:08:31.527 --> 00:08:32.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus tells us.

00:08:32.695 --> 00:08:34.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look in verse 9:

00:08:34.897 --> 00:08:38.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Also, I say to you:
Make friends for yourselves

00:08:38.267 --> 00:08:40.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by means of the unrighteous riches,

00:08:40.703 --> 00:08:42.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that when such fail,

00:08:42.838 --> 00:08:46.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they may receive you
into the everlasting dwelling places.”

00:08:46.542 --> 00:08:47.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the lesson?

00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:51.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to use our assets,
our material assets,

00:08:51.314 --> 00:08:54.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way that makes friends
with Jehovah and Jesus.

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That results in something good.

00:08:56.586 --> 00:09:00.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we noticed there in verse 9
that it says: “when [these] fail.”

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t say “if.”

00:09:02.558 --> 00:09:04.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we realize, as Jehovah’s servants,

00:09:04.994 --> 00:09:09.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that eventually the commercial systems
of this world will fail.

00:09:09.765 --> 00:09:13.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever money we have,
whatever assets we have

00:09:13.102 --> 00:09:15.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it’s just like with this steward—
they don’t really belong to us,

00:09:15.738 --> 00:09:18.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and soon we’re not going to have them to use.

00:09:18.274 --> 00:09:20.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, surely, we would want to use them

00:09:20.843 --> 00:09:24.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah’s praise
and to make friends with Jehovah.

00:09:24.714 --> 00:09:26.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what assets do Bethelites have?

00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:30.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we have our own personal assets,
few as they may be.

00:09:30.386 --> 00:09:35.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But also, we make use
of the assets of the organization.

00:09:35.091 --> 00:09:38.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, we may not be tempted

00:09:38.461 --> 00:09:41.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be dishonest with those assets,

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:45.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but could we be wasteful with those assets?

00:09:45.434 --> 00:09:47.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that brings us to the final thought

00:09:47.503 --> 00:09:50.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in verse 10, where Jesus said:

00:09:50.172 --> 00:09:52.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The person faithful in what is least

00:09:52.775 --> 00:09:55.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[that is with regard
to material things and assets]

00:09:55.745 --> 00:09:57.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is faithful also in much,

00:09:57.947 --> 00:10:00.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the person unrighteous in what is least

00:10:00.516 --> 00:10:03.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is unrighteous also in much.”

00:10:03.452 --> 00:10:05.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the lesson?

00:10:05.454 --> 00:10:07.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t get distracted by details.

00:10:07.757 --> 00:10:11.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Step back and see
what the illustration is telling us.

00:10:11.694 --> 00:10:14.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in this case, it’s a beautiful reminder

00:10:14.397 --> 00:10:17.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we should use whatever we have
to Jehovah’s glory.

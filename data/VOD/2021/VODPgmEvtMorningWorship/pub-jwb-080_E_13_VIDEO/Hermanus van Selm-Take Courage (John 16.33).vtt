00:00:01.418 --> 00:00:04.187 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We will consider two questions:

00:00:04.187 --> 00:00:07.290 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What is the link between peace and courage,

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.995 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and how can we help others to take courage?

00:00:11.995 --> 00:00:16.800 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Let’s begin with reading John 16:33.

00:00:17.867 --> 00:00:20.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the evening before his death,

00:00:20.036 --> 00:00:24.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus told his apostles at John 16:33:

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:26.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have said these things to you

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that by means of me you may have peace.

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:33.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the world you will have tribulation,

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but take courage!

00:00:35.919 --> 00:00:39.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have conquered the world.”

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:43.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The key words are “peace” and “courage.”

00:00:43.727 --> 00:00:47.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, <i>The Watchtower</i>
from which our comments are taken

00:00:47.497 --> 00:00:52.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
uses the same verse
in connection with the ransom arrangement.

00:00:52.502 --> 00:00:54.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The article states that the ransom

00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:57.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is an expression of courage.

00:00:57.807 --> 00:00:59.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Indeed, we can say that courage

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is connected to the ransom in two ways:

00:01:03.113 --> 00:01:08.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For Jesus, paying the ransom
required courage.

00:01:08.084 --> 00:01:13.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For us, receiving the ransom
gives us courage.

00:01:13.089 --> 00:01:16.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, before we thus consider
the expression “take courage,”

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s first look at the word “peace.”

00:01:20.964 --> 00:01:25.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the peace
that we receive by means of Jesus?

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:29.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s the inner calmness,
the tranquility, that we feel

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we perceive
that we are approved and loved

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:35.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Jehovah and by Jesus.

00:01:35.945 --> 00:01:39.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what is the reason
why we have such inner peace?

00:01:39.983 --> 00:01:43.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is because of the ransom arrangement.

00:01:43.486 --> 00:01:46.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The ransom makes it possible for us

00:01:46.556 --> 00:01:48.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be reconciled to God,

00:01:48.792 --> 00:01:53.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be brought back into a relationship
with Jehovah.

00:01:53.797 --> 00:01:56.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what results from having peace?

00:01:56.933 --> 00:02:00.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, look at John 14:27.

00:02:00.804 --> 00:02:05.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Earlier that same evening,
Jesus told his apostles:

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:10.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I leave you peace;
I give you my peace. . . .

00:02:10.313 --> 00:02:13.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not let your hearts be troubled

00:02:13.016 --> 00:02:16.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor let them shrink out of fear.”

00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:21.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So “the peace of God”
that we receive by means of Jesus

00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:25.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prevents our heart
from shrinking out of fear.

00:02:25.628 --> 00:02:30.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, having peace
will give us courage.

00:02:30.466 --> 00:02:33.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, to illustrate the link
between peace and courage,

00:02:33.603 --> 00:02:37.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think of a flower
—let’s say a tulip.

00:02:37.307 --> 00:02:41.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A tulip has a bulb and a flower.

00:02:41.044 --> 00:02:43.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s compare the bulb with peace

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the flower with courage.

00:02:46.516 --> 00:02:50.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, just as a tulip grows out of a bulb

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a gardener placed in the soil,

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so courage grows out of inner peace

00:02:57.827 --> 00:03:01.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah put in our heart.

00:03:01.364 --> 00:03:04.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without a bulb, there is no flower.

00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:08.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without inner peace,
there is no godly courage.

00:03:08.805 --> 00:03:11.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do we need to do in order to obtain

00:03:11.808 --> 00:03:14.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
peace and courage?

00:03:14.043 --> 00:03:16.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there is a saying
that points in the right direction.

00:03:16.913 --> 00:03:21.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The saying is
that a Bible that is falling apart

00:03:21.017 --> 00:03:25.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
usually belongs to a person who is not.

00:03:25.388 --> 00:03:28.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Indeed, we need to use the Bible often.

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:31.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to study it;
we need to meditate upon it.

00:03:31.761 --> 00:03:36.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more we do so,
the more courageous we will be.

00:03:36.165 --> 00:03:39.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s return to John 16:33,

00:03:39.502 --> 00:03:42.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and consider the two words of our daily text:

00:03:42.572 --> 00:03:44.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Take courage!”

00:03:44.874 --> 00:03:47.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the meaning?

00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:51.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, “take courage” has
the same meaning as “take heart.”

00:03:51.014 --> 00:03:53.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, the word “heart”
and the word “courage”

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
come from the same Latin word, “cor.”

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So “take courage” means

00:03:58.888 --> 00:04:02.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be encouraged because of something.

00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:04.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now as you can see on the monitor,

00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:07.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible records five instances

00:04:07.563 --> 00:04:09.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Jesus used the expression

00:04:09.832 --> 00:04:11.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Take courage!”

00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:13.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In speaking to a paralyzed man,

00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:16.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said: “Take courage . . . !”

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In speaking to a woman

00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:20.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who suffered from a flow of blood,

00:04:20.143 --> 00:04:23.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said: “Take courage . . . !”

00:04:23.246 --> 00:04:25.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In speaking to the frightened apostles

00:04:25.148 --> 00:04:27.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who saw him walking on the sea,

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said: “Take courage!”

00:04:30.053 --> 00:04:32.055 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In speaking to his apostles

00:04:32.055 --> 00:04:34.190 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
during the evening before his death,

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.694 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said: “Take courage!”

00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:40.129 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In appearing to the apostle Paul,

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:43.833 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said: “Take courage!”

00:04:43.833 --> 00:04:48.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when we take a closer look
at these five instances,

00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:51.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we note that Jesus followed a pattern

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whenever he used that expression.

00:04:54.077 --> 00:04:58.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each time after saying “take courage,”

00:04:58.314 --> 00:05:00.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what did Jesus do?

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He added a reason.

00:05:02.618 --> 00:05:05.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus did not only give a command

00:05:05.688 --> 00:05:09.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also a reason
that helped his listeners to understand

00:05:09.993 --> 00:05:13.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>why </i> they could be encouraged.

00:05:13.196 --> 00:05:16.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, look at Acts 23:11,

00:05:16.632 --> 00:05:18.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Jesus spoke to Paul.

00:05:18.968 --> 00:05:23.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, at the end of the first sentence,
we see the words: “Take courage!”

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, what is the next word that Jesus said?

00:05:27.176 --> 00:05:31.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For”
—meaning, <i>for the reason that,</i> or <i>because.</i>

00:05:31.848 --> 00:05:34.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the word <i>for </i> introduces the reason

00:05:34.984 --> 00:05:37.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why Paul could take courage.

00:05:37.353 --> 00:05:41.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thus, we could read that part of the verse
as follows: “Take courage!”

00:05:41.891 --> 00:05:42.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:05:42.825 --> 00:05:47.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘For [the reason that] just as you have given
a thorough witness about me in Jerusalem,

00:05:47.163 --> 00:05:50.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so you must also bear witness in Rome.’

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The clear reason
that Jesus added to his commands

00:05:55.204 --> 00:05:59.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no doubt encouraged Paul.

00:05:59.208 --> 00:06:03.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in the other instances
where Jesus said “take courage,”

00:06:03.346 --> 00:06:06.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the word <i>for</i>  is implied.

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:08.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The monitor shows the reasons

00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:11.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus added in the other instances.

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:15.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 9:2: “Take courage . . . !”

00:06:15.124 --> 00:06:16.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:06:16.192 --> 00:06:18.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Your sins are forgiven.”

00:06:18.361 --> 00:06:21.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 9:22: “Take courage!”

00:06:21.697 --> 00:06:22.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:25.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Your faith has made you well.”

00:06:25.334 --> 00:06:28.504 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 14:27: “Take courage . . . !”

00:06:28.504 --> 00:06:29.439 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:31.507 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“It is I; do not be afraid.”

00:06:31.507 --> 00:06:34.644 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
John 16:33: “Take courage!”

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:35.511 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:38.881 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“I have conquered the world.”

00:06:38.881 --> 00:06:43.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how can we imitate
the pattern that Jesus set?

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:46.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When encouraging others from the platform

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:48.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or in a private conversation,

00:06:48.758 --> 00:06:51.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we tell them not only what to do

00:06:51.227 --> 00:06:54.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also <i>why</i>  they should do so.

00:06:54.097 --> 00:06:56.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We try to persuade their mind

00:06:56.232 --> 00:06:59.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by giving reasons for their actions.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:04.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what else do we see
in the pattern that Jesus followed?

00:07:04.807 --> 00:07:07.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In encouraging others, he tried

00:07:07.376 --> 00:07:10.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only to persuade the mind

00:07:10.113 --> 00:07:13.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also to move the heart.

00:07:13.082 --> 00:07:17.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can see that in three of the examples
that we just considered.

00:07:17.487 --> 00:07:20.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you see on the monitor, here is example 1:

00:07:20.723 --> 00:07:23.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 9:2,

00:07:23.126 --> 00:07:26.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus did not just say “Take courage . . . !”

00:07:26.195 --> 00:07:28.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he said to the paralyzed man:

00:07:28.097 --> 00:07:31.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Take courage, child!”

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:33.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a touching way

00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:35.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to address that paralyzed man!

00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:40.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He must have felt secure
like a child in the arms of his father.

00:07:40.076 --> 00:07:42.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt Jesus’ words

00:07:42.778 --> 00:07:46.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
moved the man’s heart.

00:07:46.215 --> 00:07:49.785 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Example 2: At Matthew 9:22,

00:07:49.785 --> 00:07:53.456 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jesus did not just say “Take courage . . . !”

00:07:53.456 --> 00:07:55.458 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But he said to the woman suffering

00:07:55.458 --> 00:07:56.592 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from a flow of blood:

00:07:56.592 --> 00:08:00.463 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Take courage, daughter!”

00:08:00.463 --> 00:08:03.833 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
How tenderly Jesus treated the ailing woman

00:08:03.833 --> 00:08:05.835 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by calling her “daughter!”

00:08:05.835 --> 00:08:10.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a word of affection
that Jesus had never used before

00:08:10.039 --> 00:08:12.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when addressing a woman.

00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:14.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt Jesus’ words

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
moved the woman’s heart.

00:08:17.513 --> 00:08:21.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Example 3: On the last evening
before Jesus death,

00:08:21.884 --> 00:08:25.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was together with his apostles
in the upper room in Jerusalem.

00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:30.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s imagine what happened
shortly before Jesus told them:

00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:32.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Take courage!”

00:08:32.795 --> 00:08:35.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After instituting the Memorial,

00:08:35.531 --> 00:08:39.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus looked around
at these 11 faithful friends.

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:41.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There they were.

00:08:41.304 --> 00:08:44.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter
—Jesus couldn’t help but love him—

00:08:44.273 --> 00:08:46.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so impulsive but so sincere.

00:08:46.976 --> 00:08:49.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was James and his younger brother John,

00:08:49.645 --> 00:08:53.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
once “sons of thunder,”
but how they had changed for the better!

00:08:53.249 --> 00:08:55.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—still zealous but also compassionate.

00:08:55.551 --> 00:08:58.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there was Andrew,
one of the first disciples he talked to,

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:01.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
still going strong.

00:09:01.891 --> 00:09:05.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Jesus looked from face to face,

00:09:05.928 --> 00:09:09.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a feeling of deep affection
must have welled up in him.

00:09:09.665 --> 00:09:12.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that moment, he felt so close to them

00:09:12.134 --> 00:09:14.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he was moved to address them in a way

00:09:14.704 --> 00:09:17.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had never addressed them before.

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:21.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He called them “little children.”

00:09:21.444 --> 00:09:24.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt Jesus’ words

00:09:24.013 --> 00:09:27.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
moved the hearts of the apostles.

00:09:27.016 --> 00:09:29.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shortly thereafter, he told them:

00:09:29.385 --> 00:09:31.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Take courage!”

00:09:31.854 --> 00:09:35.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what lesson do we learn from Jesus
in these three examples?

00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:40.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we try to encourage others
in the congregation,

00:09:40.062 --> 00:09:43.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Bethel, or in other locations
where we serve,

00:09:43.633 --> 00:09:45.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to convey to them

00:09:45.635 --> 00:09:50.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our warm and sincere feelings of friendship.

00:09:50.373 --> 00:09:53.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to move their hearts.

00:09:53.909 --> 00:09:58.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what are the two main points
of our brief discussion?

00:09:58.214 --> 00:10:01.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have challenges; we have trials,

00:10:01.217 --> 00:10:05.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but because of having peace,
we can be courageous.

00:10:05.688 --> 00:10:08.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when encouraging others,

00:10:08.057 --> 00:10:12.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we try to persuade their mind
and move their heart

00:10:12.228 --> 00:10:16.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we tell them: “Take courage!” my friend,

00:10:16.532 --> 00:10:19.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Jehovah is our Helper.

00:00:01.117 --> 00:00:03.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which is worse?

00:00:03.119 --> 00:00:06.790 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
To stumble others or to be stumbled?

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.858 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
From Jehovah’s viewpoint,

00:00:08.858 --> 00:00:10.960 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
both are serious matters

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.163 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that can affect our lives

00:00:13.163 --> 00:00:15.465 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and also the lives of others.

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:18.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But today, we’re going to focus
on the matter of being stumbled

00:00:18.968 --> 00:00:23.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because our text urges us:
“Do not be quick to take offense.”

00:00:24.808 --> 00:00:27.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James 3:2 warns us

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “we all stumble many times.”

00:00:30.346 --> 00:00:32.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t want to misunderstand these words

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:35.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and say that it’s OK to be stumbled.

00:00:35.018 --> 00:00:37.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not providing an excuse.

00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:40.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, James simply stated a reality

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our imperfect lives.

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The important thing, then, is,

00:00:45.895 --> 00:00:50.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we do when we run
into a potential stumbling block?

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 24:16 tells us:

00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:58.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The righteous one may fall even seven times,

00:00:58.241 --> 00:01:01.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will certainly get up.”

00:01:01.444 --> 00:01:04.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider what might cause us to stumble

00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:08.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how we can avoid being stumbled.

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:10.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some causes of stumbling are injustices

00:01:10.987 --> 00:01:12.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the part of our fellow believers.

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:15.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could be persecution, tribulation,

00:01:15.825 --> 00:01:19.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or it may be the imperfections of others.

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:22.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Any one of these obstacles could cause us

00:01:22.432 --> 00:01:26.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to trip, to stumble, or even to fall down.

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:29.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we prevent these stumbling blocks

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:34.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from turning into roadblocks
that stop our forward movement

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s service?

00:01:36.246 --> 00:01:39.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bibles to Psalm 119.

00:01:39.682 --> 00:01:43.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll read verse 165.

00:01:43.286 --> 00:01:46.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This scripture provides
a simple answer to that question,

00:01:46.756 --> 00:01:51.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it also assures us
that we can avoid being stumbled

00:01:51.494 --> 00:01:56.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Psalm 119:165:

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:00.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Abundant peace belongs to those
who love your law;

00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:04.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nothing can make them stumble.”

00:02:04.307 --> 00:02:06.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not?

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:08.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because if we love Jehovah’s law,

00:02:08.978 --> 00:02:12.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will not allow us to be stumbled.

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:15.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our deep love for him and for his law

00:02:15.418 --> 00:02:18.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will prevent that from happening.

00:02:18.855 --> 00:02:21.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of the most common stumbling blocks

00:02:21.324 --> 00:02:23.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
result from the imperfections of others.

00:02:23.893 --> 00:02:26.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to reflect on two experiences

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that illustrate how we can avoid
letting such problems

00:02:29.465 --> 00:02:31.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
become a permanent stumbling block.

00:02:31.868 --> 00:02:33.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first experience is

00:02:33.536 --> 00:02:36.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Sister Goldie Romocean.

00:02:36.206 --> 00:02:39.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was born in Romania in 1903.

00:02:39.442 --> 00:02:42.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was baptized in 1918.

00:02:42.378 --> 00:02:45.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1921, she immigrated to the United States,

00:02:45.448 --> 00:02:49.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that same year she married
a Romanian brother from her hometown.

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They settled in Akron, Ohio,
and had four daughters.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the mid-1930’s,
Goldie and her husband were stumbled.

00:02:58.995 --> 00:03:03.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen to Goldie as she explains
why they were stumbled

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:06.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what helped them to regain their balance.

00:03:06.903 --> 00:03:08.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She related:

00:03:08.571 --> 00:03:11.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I became angry
with Brother Rutherford.

00:03:11.207 --> 00:03:13.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘A new Witness felt that Brother Rutherford

00:03:13.376 --> 00:03:16.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘had dealt unjustly with him,
not hearing him out.

00:03:16.512 --> 00:03:19.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I felt that Brother Rutherford was wrong.

00:03:19.182 --> 00:03:23.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, one Sunday my sister Mary
and her husband, Dan, came to visit us.

00:03:23.686 --> 00:03:28.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘After dinner Dan said:
“Let’s get ready to go to the meeting.”

00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:30.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘“We don’t go
to the meetings anymore,” I said.

00:03:30.994 --> 00:03:33.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘“We’re mad at Brother Rutherford.”

00:03:33.096 --> 00:03:37.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Dan asked: “Did you know
Brother Rutherford when you got baptized?”

00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:38.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘“Of course not,” I replied.

00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:41.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘“You know I got baptized in Romania.”

00:03:41.337 --> 00:03:44.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘“Well, why did you get baptized?” he asked.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘“Because I learned
that Jehovah is the true God,

00:03:47.277 --> 00:03:51.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and I wanted to dedicate my life
to serve him,” I answered.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘“<i>Never forget that! </i>” Dan replied.

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:57.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘“What if Brother Rutherford
left the truth, would you leave too?”

00:03:57.987 --> 00:04:00.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘“Never, never!” I said.

00:04:00.924 --> 00:04:04.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘That brought me to my senses, and I said:

00:04:04.294 --> 00:04:06.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘“Everybody get ready for the meeting.”

00:04:06.963 --> 00:04:09.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we haven’t stopped since.’

00:04:09.098 --> 00:04:12.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah continued to bless
Goldie and her family.

00:04:12.035 --> 00:04:17.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, her daughter Beth
graduated from the 14th class of Gilead.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The moving account of Goldie’s life story

00:04:19.876 --> 00:04:23.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be found in the April 1, 1997,

00:04:23.947 --> 00:04:25.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
issue of <i>The Watchtower.</i>

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:27.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By all means, go back and read it.

00:04:27.951 --> 00:04:30.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will not only be encouraged

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:33.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you’ll also learn
how she got the name Goldie.

00:04:33.489 --> 00:04:35.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there a lesson here for us?

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:36.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:04:36.926 --> 00:04:40.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Goldie and her family
avoided permanent stumbling

00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:43.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by staying focused on the big picture

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:46.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is, Jehovah’s sovereignty

00:04:46.135 --> 00:04:49.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their personal relationship with him.

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s consider a second experience.

00:04:52.275 --> 00:04:54.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I read the text for today,

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I immediately thought of Brother Adolf Weber.

00:04:58.848 --> 00:05:02.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I first read his experience 38 years ago

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:04.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the <i>1980 Yearbook.</i>

00:05:04.921 --> 00:05:08.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, his experience
made a lasting impression

00:05:08.324 --> 00:05:10.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on my mind and heart.

00:05:11.527 --> 00:05:13.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Adolf Weber was a Swiss woodcutter.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His job was cutting down trees.

00:05:15.832 --> 00:05:19.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the mid-1890’s,
he traveled to the United States.

00:05:19.302 --> 00:05:21.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He worked as a part-time gardener
for Brother Russell,

00:05:21.971 --> 00:05:26.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s how he came to learn
the deep truths of God’s Word.

00:05:26.376 --> 00:05:29.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Weber was fluent
in English, German, and French.

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:31.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He volunteered to return to Europe

00:05:31.948 --> 00:05:35.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to cultivate the French-speaking field,
and Brother Russell agreed.

00:05:35.618 --> 00:05:38.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Weber went
to his hometown in Switzerland,

00:05:38.354 --> 00:05:42.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there he placed ads
in French religious newspapers

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:45.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and found an excellent response to those ads.

00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:46.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then in 1903,

00:05:46.863 --> 00:05:50.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Russell visited Europe
and arranged with Brother Weber

00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:54.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to publish an eight-page French edition
of the <i>Watch Tower.</i>

00:05:54.404 --> 00:05:57.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like a zealous regular pioneer,

00:05:57.006 --> 00:06:01.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the summer, Brother Weber worked
as a woodcutter and a gardener in Switzerland

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then he would travel
to France and to Belgium

00:06:03.946 --> 00:06:05.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to follow up on interested ones

00:06:05.982 --> 00:06:09.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had responded to his newspaper ads.

00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:13.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He traveled extensively
and gave general oversight to the work

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:15.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this French-speaking field in Europe

00:06:15.691 --> 00:06:18.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for over 12 years.

00:06:18.194 --> 00:06:23.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then in 1912,
Brother Russell visited Europe again

00:06:23.066 --> 00:06:28.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he appointed a new brother
who was better educated than Brother Weber

00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:30.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be in charge of the work.

00:06:30.706 --> 00:06:33.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see a potential stumbling block?

00:06:33.176 --> 00:06:35.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely.

00:06:35.178 --> 00:06:38.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Brother Weber didn’t even flinch.

00:06:38.081 --> 00:06:41.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He humbly stepped down
and was happy to do whatever he could

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to advance Kingdom interests.

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:46.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, that better-educated brother

00:06:46.422 --> 00:06:50.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who replaced Brother Weber
eventually left the truth

00:06:50.126 --> 00:06:53.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so did four others who succeeded him.

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:55.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But through all of this,

00:06:55.865 --> 00:06:59.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Weber humbly kept on doing
what he had done for years

00:06:59.735 --> 00:07:04.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—spreading seeds of truth
to honesthearted ones in the field.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there a lesson here for us?

00:07:06.542 --> 00:07:07.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Certainly.

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:10.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your Bibles
to Matthew chapter 23,

00:07:10.813 --> 00:07:13.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll read verse 12.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:18.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This scripture identifies
an outstanding quality of Brother Weber.

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:22.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice the results of showing this quality

00:07:22.291 --> 00:07:26.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Matthew 23:12:

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:29.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whoever exalts himself will be humbled,

00:07:29.232 --> 00:07:33.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.”

How true this proved to be
in Brother Weber’s case!

00:07:39.008 --> 00:07:43.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Weber
was never looking for recognition,

00:07:43.012 --> 00:07:46.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet his experience appears
in the <i>Proclaimers </i> book,

the <i>1980 Yearbook,</i> the<i> 1984 Yearbook,</i>

00:07:49.185 --> 00:07:53.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the <i>1987 Yearbook</i>  because of all
that good work he did in Europe.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The <i>1987 Yearbook</i>  gave
this meaningful summary

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Brother Weber’s life.

00:07:59.629 --> 00:08:02.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said: “Though some had allowed feelings

00:08:02.798 --> 00:08:05.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of self-importance to overreach them,

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:10.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Brother Weber had continued
to serve Jehovah loyally and humbly. . . . 

00:08:10.439 --> 00:08:13.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“His modesty, strong faith,
and zealous service

00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:16.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“left a deep impression on all who knew him.

00:08:16.712 --> 00:08:19.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Finally, at the age of 85,

00:08:19.682 --> 00:08:24.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he finished his earthly course
in February 1948.”

00:08:24.487 --> 00:08:29.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a fitting tribute
to this humble servant of Jehovah

00:08:29.492 --> 00:08:33.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was not quick to take offense!

00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:37.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So may we be
like Brother Weber and Sister Romocean.

00:08:37.533 --> 00:08:41.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s maintain a humble,
modest view of ourselves

00:08:41.404 --> 00:08:44.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and stay focused on building

00:08:44.207 --> 00:08:47.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a close relationship with Jehovah.

00:08:47.577 --> 00:08:51.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we do this,
we will not be quick to take offense

00:08:51.981 --> 00:08:55.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and nothing will make us stumble.

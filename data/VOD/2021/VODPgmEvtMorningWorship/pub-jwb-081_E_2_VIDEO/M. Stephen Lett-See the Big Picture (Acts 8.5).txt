00:00:01 Now, the theme of my discussion is
00:00:03 “Despite Changing Circumstances,
00:00:06 Always See the Big Picture.”
00:00:10 Perhaps you’ve heard the expression,
00:00:12 “He can’t see the forest for the trees.”
00:00:15 This is referring to a person
00:00:17 who is too involved in the details of a problem
00:00:20 to see the situation as a whole.
00:00:22 Now, that’s a dangerous problem for anyone,
00:00:25 but especially one of Jehovah’s people.
00:00:27 No matter what the circumstances,
00:00:30 we want to always see the “big picture.”
00:00:33 The first sentence in today’s Watchtower  comments says this:
00:00:37 “Philip the evangelizer
00:00:39 “provides a fine example
00:00:42 “of one who stayed focused on [the] ministry
00:00:45 despite changing circumstances.”
00:00:49 And for us, just like Philip,
00:00:51 the big picture is always Jehovah’s thinking
00:00:55 —to see Jehovah’s view of the situation.
00:00:58 Jehovah’s thinking, or Jehovah’s viewpoint,
00:01:01 is so lofty—isn’t it?—so elevated.
00:01:03 Open up to Isaiah, please,
00:01:06 chapter 55,
00:01:08 and notice what is said here about the altitude
00:01:11 of Jehovah’s thinking.
00:01:13 Jehovah says in verse 9:
00:01:15 “For as the heavens are higher than the earth,
00:01:19 “so my ways are higher than your ways
00:01:22 and my thoughts than your thoughts.”
00:01:25 And if you think about it, viewpoint really does make a difference, doesn’t it?
00:01:29 It makes a huge difference.
00:01:30 For example, if you walk up to the World Trade Center building
00:01:33 on the sidewalk and look up,
00:01:35 it’s overwhelming—intimidating.
00:01:38 On the other hand, if you fly over the World Trade Center building
00:01:41 in an airplane and look out the window at it,
00:01:43 it looks like a matchstick stuck in the ground.
00:01:46 Well, viewpoint makes a difference.
00:01:48 Here’s another illustration:
00:01:50 Imagine that you’re lost in a complex maze.
00:01:55 Now, overhead, though,
00:01:58 is a trusted friend in a helicopter.
00:02:01 Now, that friend could easily direct you to safety, is that not true?
00:02:05 Well, in this illustration, our trusted friend
00:02:08 with the elevated view is, of course, Jehovah.
00:02:12 In fact, while you’re still looking at this picture,
00:02:14 let me read to you, please, Jehovah’s words
00:02:17 at Isaiah 30:21—his promise.
00:02:21 He says: “And your own ears will hear a word behind you saying,
00:02:26 “‘This is the way.
00:02:28 “‘Walk in it,’ in case you should go to the right
00:02:32 or in case you should go to the left.”
00:02:36 So if we make Jehovah’s thinking our thinking,
00:02:38 then Jehovah will safely guide us through any situation.
00:02:42 But now, what makes it challenging to always see the big picture?
00:02:47 Well, as we touched on —changing circumstances.
00:02:50 First Corinthians 7:31:
00:02:53 “The scene of this world is changing.”
00:02:55 Similarly, we could say the scene of our lives is constantly changing.
00:03:00 In fact, let’s talk about some changing circumstances
00:03:03 that could come our way before the end of this system
00:03:07 in which we want to always see the big picture.
00:03:11 Now, one is a change of residence.
00:03:14 As we touched on, that happened to Philip.
00:03:16 He was forced out of Jerusalem because of intense persecution.
00:03:21 He ended up in Samaria, but he saw the big picture there.
00:03:24 He knew he didn’t have to be in Jerusalem to preach.
00:03:27 He didn’t have to be in Jerusalem to serve Jehovah.
00:03:30 He could do it in Samaria, and he did so—powerfully.
00:03:35 Probably the most outstanding example
00:03:37 of a change of residence is Jesus.
00:03:40 He left his heavenly abode of billions of years
00:03:43 to live on this little tiny earth.
00:03:46 But obviously, he always saw the big picture
00:03:49 by making Jehovah’s thinking his thinking.
00:03:52 Abraham and Sarah were another excellent example
00:03:55 of a drastic change in residence.
00:03:57 Well, that may happen to us.
00:03:59 We may have a change of residence,
00:04:02 either by no choice of our own or by choice.
00:04:05 We may choose to move and serve where the need is greater.
00:04:08 We may have to move to care for family responsibilities.
00:04:13 I know of a Bethel couple who served at Bethel almost 25 years.
00:04:17 They had to leave to care for a father who had dementia,
00:04:21 but they continue to see the big picture.
00:04:24 They knew that you can preach, you can go to meetings,
00:04:27 you can read God’s Word, and you can serve Jehovah wherever you live.
00:04:31 Now, here’s another changing circumstance:
00:04:34 You develop chronic health problems,
00:04:37 perhaps problems that will only be corrected by Jehovah’s new world.
00:04:41 Now, in this vein, think for a moment about Job.
00:04:44 He was struck with cancerous boils
00:04:48 from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet
00:04:51 —brought to within one inch of death.
00:04:55 He wished that he was dead.
00:04:57 And yet, he saw the big picture, didn’t he?
00:05:00 ‘I’ve got to keep my integrity to Jehovah no matter what.’
00:05:04 He even said at Job 27:5:
00:05:07 “Until I die, I will not renounce my integrity.”
00:05:11 Now, he had no idea that he would be restored to good health.
00:05:15 But he knew that if he kept his integrity, he would be resurrected.
00:05:19 Jehovah would call him, and he would answer from the grave.
00:05:23 Well, it’s the same with us.
00:05:25 We may develop chronic health problems.
00:05:27 We may even die before the end of this system.
00:05:31 But if we keep our integrity,
00:05:33 such an individual will take a quick nap
00:05:36 and, from his perspective,
00:05:38 instantaneously open his eyes in the new world
00:05:41 —if he keeps his integrity, like Job.
00:05:45 And if you think about this:
00:05:46 No matter how long we have to suffer some illness,
00:05:49 it’s momentary
00:05:52 compared to the permanency of perfect health in Jehovah’s new world.
00:05:56 That’s what 2 Corinthians 4:17 says:
00:05:58 “For though the tribulation is momentary and light,
00:06:02 [yet] it works out for us a glory that is . . . everlasting.”
00:06:07 So if we keep our eyes on the big picture
00:06:09 —maintain integrity— we can trade a moment of pain
00:06:14 for an eternity of perfect health.
00:06:17 You could say, “An ounce of suffering
00:06:20 for gigatons of pleasure.”
00:06:23 Think of that: A gigaton
00:06:25 —a billion tons compared to an ounce.
00:06:28 Here’s another changing circumstance:
00:06:31 We encounter perceived injustice in the congregation.
00:06:36 Now, you notice we said “perceived,”
00:06:38 because often things are not the way we see them to be.
00:06:43 We can’t read hearts.
00:06:45 We don’t have all the facts.
00:06:46 Often our view is like trying to look into a large house
00:06:50 through the front door that’s cracked open one inch (2.5 cm).
00:06:53 We have a very limited view.
00:06:56 So seeing the big picture,
00:06:57 we’ll recognize that we don’t have all the facts.
00:06:59 And seeing the big picture,
00:07:01 we’ll recognize who does have all the facts—Jehovah.
00:07:04 Everything is “naked and openly exposed” to him.
00:07:08 Jesus—Revelation 2:1 refers to him
00:07:12 as having “the seven stars [the elders] in his right hand
00:07:15 and [walking about] among the seven golden lampstands.”
00:07:20 So Jesus, the head of the congregation, has the facts.
00:07:23 So once we’ve done what’s in our jurisdiction
00:07:26 —perhaps reporting the matter—
00:07:28 seeing the big picture, we’ll leave it in the hands
00:07:31 of those who have all the facts,
00:07:33 confident that they will take care of this matter.
00:07:36 If it truly is an injustice,
00:07:38 they will take care of it in their time and their way.
00:07:41 Now, here’s another changing circumstance:
00:07:44 We come face-to-face with some temptation.
00:07:47 Now, in a case like this, we want to be nothing like Eve.
00:07:51 She obviously didn’t see the big picture, did she?
00:07:54 If she had, she would have realized,
00:07:57 ‘This serpent has done nothing for me.
00:08:00 ‘Jehovah has done everything for me.
00:08:03 ‘In a contradictory situation, who, obviously,
00:08:06 would be telling me the truth?’
00:08:08 Instead, we want to be like Jesus.
00:08:11 When he was tempted by the Devil,
00:08:13 he saw the big picture —didn’t he?—
00:08:14 the issue of universal sovereignty.
00:08:18 So if we’re tempted to look at pornography,
00:08:21 listen to apostate ideas,
00:08:23 flirt with someone who’s not our mate (just a few examples),
00:08:27 let’s pause, elevate our thinking,
00:08:30 make Jehovah’s thinking our thinking,
00:08:32 and let’s see the big picture.
00:08:34 And the big picture is that Satan is trying to get the thin edge of a wedge
00:08:39 into our suit of armor.
00:08:41 Anything this world has to offer
00:08:44 cannot begin to equal the value of our relationship with Jehovah
00:08:48 and our place in his new world.
00:08:50 We’ll also be able to fast-forward if we see the big picture
00:08:53 and see the horrible consequences
00:08:56 of giving in to temptation.
00:08:59 Now, here’s one more changing circumstance: We’re persecuted.
00:09:04 And this can go from ridicule
00:09:07 to being threatened with execution or even being executed.
00:09:12 Think of David for just a moment.
00:09:14 He was ridiculed, and he was threatened with death by Goliath.
00:09:18 But even though David saw how big he was,
00:09:21 David saw the big picture, didn’t he?
00:09:24 He saw how puny, how wimpy
00:09:26 Goliath was compared to Jehovah, the Almighty.
00:09:29 So the big picture has to always include
00:09:32 the almighty God, Jehovah.
00:09:35 And again, we’ll be able to fast-forward to see the horrible consequences
00:09:39 of compromising if we’re persecuted.
00:09:42 On the other hand, we’ll see the wonderful blessings
00:09:45 if we keep our integrity.
00:09:47 We do not compromise.
00:09:49 In fact, even if we’re threatened with death or we’re executed,
00:09:53 if we see the big picture, we’ll realize
00:09:57 that Satan has just handed us a validated passport
00:10:00 right into the new world.
00:10:02 See, that is the big picture.
00:10:05 Well, we’ve talked about seeing the big picture
00:10:07 when you have a change of residence,
00:10:09 your health deteriorates,
00:10:12 you encounter a perceived injustice,
00:10:15 you come face-to-face with temptation,
00:10:17 or you are persecuted.
00:10:19 And these are just a few examples.
00:10:22 It may not always be easy
00:10:24 to see the big picture in challenging circumstances.
00:10:27 But the key is to make Jehovah’s thinking our thinking
00:10:31 —pause, elevate our thinking, view it from Jehovah’s standpoint.
00:10:36 The result will be protection and blessings coming our way
00:10:41 and praise going Jehovah’s way.

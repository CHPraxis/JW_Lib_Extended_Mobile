00:00:01.084 --> 00:00:03.753 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Let’s start by asking a question:

00:00:03.753 --> 00:00:06.056 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Should the Governing Body

00:00:06.056 --> 00:00:07.724 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the brothers who are taking the lead

00:00:07.724 --> 00:00:10.827 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in our organization just mainly focus

00:00:10.827 --> 00:00:14.798 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on spiritual matters and not be concerned

00:00:14.798 --> 00:00:17.233 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about financial matters?

00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:19.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, some may answer,

00:00:19.302 --> 00:00:21.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Yes, that’s what they should be doing.”

00:00:21.304 --> 00:00:24.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And perhaps these ones
may even feel a little embarrassed

00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:26.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if money matters are mentioned

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at meetings or on JW Broadcasting®.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps they may feel
that there’s a precedent

00:00:33.717 --> 00:00:36.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
back in Acts chapter 6,

00:00:36.386 --> 00:00:39.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it speaks
about the days after Pentecost

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:42.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the daily food distribution
was taking place.

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:45.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We remember there that the apostles

00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:48.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
decided that they would delegate that work

00:00:48.398 --> 00:00:52.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the work of giving food at the tables—
to a group of men.

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:55.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And remember, they said
that they would then focus

00:00:55.271 --> 00:00:59.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the spiritual aspects—prayer and so on.

00:00:59.242 --> 00:01:02.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So is this the basis, then, for us to say

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we should just focus
on spiritual matters?

00:01:05.949 --> 00:01:08.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, even looking
at that account, we realize

00:01:08.718 --> 00:01:12.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the apostles were very much involved
with the arrangement, weren’t they?

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:14.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They set the arrangement in place.

00:01:14.357 --> 00:01:17.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They made sure
the food distribution took place,

00:01:17.727 --> 00:01:22.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though they personally didn’t go
to the tables and hand out the food.

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:26.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when we look at the Scriptures,
we see very clearly

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that although we have
a spiritual responsibility

00:01:30.774 --> 00:01:33.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(a spiritual work) that we need to do,

00:01:33.076 --> 00:01:38.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is also a physical side
to “the relief ministry”

00:01:38.081 --> 00:01:41.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many other aspects
that we need to be concerned about.

00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:44.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take for example the apostle Paul.

00:01:44.587 --> 00:01:46.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’d like to take your Bibles,

00:01:46.623 --> 00:01:50.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
turn with me to Galatians chapter 2.

00:01:50.193 --> 00:01:55.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The time setting is about the year 49 C.E.,

00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:58.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Paul and Barnabas are in Jerusalem,

00:01:58.168 --> 00:02:01.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and here, basically, they get the approval

00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:04.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the governing body
to go out to the nations.

00:02:04.841 --> 00:02:09.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s look at Galatians 2:9, 10:

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And when they recognized
the undeserved kindness

00:02:13.116 --> 00:02:16.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that was given me,
James and Cephas and John,

00:02:16.953 --> 00:02:18.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the ones who seemed to be pillars,

00:02:18.988 --> 00:02:22.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“gave Barnabas and me
the right hand of fellowship,

00:02:22.525 --> 00:02:25.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[or in other words,
they gave approval to them and support]

00:02:25.495 --> 00:02:27.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that we should go to the nations

00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:30.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they to those who are circumcised.”

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here the assignment was given,

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then in verse 10, notice:

00:02:35.305 --> 00:02:40.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They asked only
that we keep the poor in mind,

00:02:40.176 --> 00:02:45.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[and notice, Paul says] and this
I have also earnestly endeavored to do.”

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So obviously,

00:02:47.884 --> 00:02:52.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this relief ministry
involving financial matters

00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:56.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was something of concern
to Paul (of interest to him).

00:02:56.392 --> 00:02:58.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we think about that,

00:02:58.828 --> 00:03:02.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see how the apostle Paul
did apply this admonition

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his ministry

00:03:04.801 --> 00:03:07.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his third missionary tour,

00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:11.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which took place between the years 52-56 C.E.

00:03:11.407 --> 00:03:16.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was involved
with collecting contributions and donations

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:20.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the brothers to take back
for the poor brothers in Judea

00:03:20.783 --> 00:03:24.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had a very hard time
at that particular period of time.

00:03:24.354 --> 00:03:27.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at an example of what Paul said

00:03:27.357 --> 00:03:31.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 1 Corinthians chapter 16.

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:36.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 Corinthians 16:1-4,

00:03:37.834 --> 00:03:41.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here he’s speaking
to the Corinthians and says:

00:03:41.537 --> 00:03:45.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now concerning the collection
for the holy ones,

00:03:45.541 --> 00:03:50.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you may follow the directions I gave
to the congregations of Galatia.

00:03:50.246 --> 00:03:53.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On the first day of every week,

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:57.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“each of you should set something aside
according to his own means,

00:03:57.654 --> 00:04:01.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that collections
will not take place when I arrive.

00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:06.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But when I get there, I will send
the men you approve of in your letters

00:04:06.396 --> 00:04:09.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take your kind gift to Jerusalem.”

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:13.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now notice what Paul says in verse 4:

00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:17.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“However, if it seems advisable
for me to go there also,

00:04:17.907 --> 00:04:20.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will go there with me.”

00:04:20.576 --> 00:04:24.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Paul while in the midst
of his third missionary tour,

00:04:24.414 --> 00:04:27.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which of course had a great spiritual theme

00:04:27.116 --> 00:04:29.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—helping people, preaching the good news—

00:04:29.652 --> 00:04:33.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was still interested
in the collection of funds

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would help the brothers
back in Jerusalem.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:40.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice there in verse 4
that he even raises the possibility

00:04:40.163 --> 00:04:43.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of stopping his missionary work

00:04:43.132 --> 00:04:45.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and actually traveling back to Jerusalem.

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:47.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s exactly what happened.

00:04:47.971 --> 00:04:50.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you turn across to Romans,

00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:53.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans chapter 15,

00:04:53.142 --> 00:04:55.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll see what eventuated.

00:04:55.778 --> 00:04:58.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did it seem advisable for him to go back?

00:04:58.915 --> 00:05:03.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, at Romans 15:25, 26, we’re told:

00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:07.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But now I am about to travel
to Jerusalem

00:05:07.156 --> 00:05:09.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to minister to the holy ones.”

00:05:09.425 --> 00:05:11.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, publications have made the point

00:05:11.627 --> 00:05:15.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this return to Jerusalem
—the main purpose—

00:05:15.298 --> 00:05:20.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was to take this money back
to the brothers there in Judea.

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:22.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then he goes on to say:

00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:24.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For those in Macedonia and Achaia

00:05:24.374 --> 00:05:26.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“have been pleased to share their things

00:05:26.376 --> 00:05:28.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by a contribution to the poor

00:05:28.644 --> 00:05:31.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
among the holy ones in Jerusalem.”

00:05:31.714 --> 00:05:34.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So was the financial aspect

00:05:34.884 --> 00:05:38.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the taking of contributions and donations—
important to Paul?

00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:40.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:05:40.023 --> 00:05:44.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He viewed it important enough
to actually put on hold his missionary work

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:46.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and make that journey back.

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:49.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we look at the background there,
we see that perhaps

00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:52.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were nine brothers
that traveled together

00:05:52.468 --> 00:05:55.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and these brothers then took these funds

00:05:55.905 --> 00:05:57.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(probably a substantial amount)

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
back to Jerusalem.

00:05:59.742 --> 00:06:02.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we have made the comment
that this perhaps helped

00:06:02.478 --> 00:06:05.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the safety element
and also credibility

00:06:05.815 --> 00:06:08.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make sure
that nobody could question Paul

00:06:08.818 --> 00:06:11.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the funds that he was taking back.

00:06:11.454 --> 00:06:13.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This also included Titus

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and men who were trustworthy and well-known

00:06:16.893 --> 00:06:19.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and approved of by the brothers there

00:06:19.362 --> 00:06:22.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the various parts of Europe and Asia.

00:06:22.398 --> 00:06:25.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But were these gifts that they were taking

00:06:25.968 --> 00:06:30.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just a matter of charity,
giving out freely to others?

00:06:30.273 --> 00:06:32.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s look again in the Scriptures,

00:06:32.675 --> 00:06:36.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this time to 2 Corinthians chapter 8.

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:41.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 2 Corinthians 8:13-15,

00:06:41.951 --> 00:06:46.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this gives us a reason, we could say,
for the policy, or the viewpoint,

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:50.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Governing Body has
with regard to helping others.

00:06:50.793 --> 00:06:54.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So 2 Corinthians 8:13-15 says:

00:06:54.197 --> 00:06:58.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For I do not want to make it easy
for others, but difficult for you;

00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:01.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but that by means of an equalizing,

00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:06.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“your surplus at the present time
might offset their need,

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:11.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that their surplus
might also offset your deficiency,

00:07:11.013 --> 00:07:13.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that there may be an equalizing.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Just as it is written:

00:07:15.952 --> 00:07:19.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The person with much did not have too much,

00:07:19.255 --> 00:07:23.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the person with little
did not have too little.’”

00:07:23.426 --> 00:07:25.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the principle here?

00:07:25.561 --> 00:07:28.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The principle is
that even though these contributions

00:07:28.931 --> 00:07:32.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were being given
to poor brothers and sisters,

00:07:32.201 --> 00:07:34.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everyone had to do something.

00:07:34.437 --> 00:07:38.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t just a charity
where you gave money to the poor,

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but rather, there was an expectation
that each person

00:07:41.844 --> 00:07:44.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—whether they were poor or they had more—

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would do something toward the situation.

00:07:47.049 --> 00:07:50.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s exactly the view
the Governing Body takes today.

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:54.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Bibles and Bible literature

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:56.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are provided free of charge (without cost)

00:07:56.993 --> 00:07:59.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our brothers in all parts of the earth,

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:03.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the brothers
then donate according to their means.

00:08:03.933 --> 00:08:07.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Kingdom Halls
are being built in many countries

00:08:07.503 --> 00:08:10.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can’t afford to build Kingdom Halls,

00:08:10.106 --> 00:08:14.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet again the Governing Body
allows the opportunity for the brothers

00:08:14.877 --> 00:08:19.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in those countries to also donate
toward the construction of Kingdom Halls.

00:08:19.815 --> 00:08:21.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:08:21.117 --> 00:08:23.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Christendom would probably say:

00:08:23.152 --> 00:08:26.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, these are poor people.
Let’s just make it a charity.”

00:08:26.622 --> 00:08:30.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you see, Jesus didn’t stop the widow
from putting the two coins in, did he?

00:08:30.893 --> 00:08:32.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t say:
“Look. Hold on.

00:08:32.795 --> 00:08:34.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You need that; you’re poor.

00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:37.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let the rich people put money in.”

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, Jesus allowed her to make that donation.

00:08:40.403 --> 00:08:41.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:08:41.337 --> 00:08:45.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because that was her gift to Jehovah
and Jehovah would bless her for doing that.

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:48.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we think about what’s happening

00:08:48.911 --> 00:08:51.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with regard to our organization

00:08:51.147 --> 00:08:56.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not only the printing of Bibles, literature,
building of Kingdom Halls

00:08:56.152 --> 00:09:00.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also this huge disaster relief
that continues on—

00:09:00.089 --> 00:09:02.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what can we be happy with?

00:09:02.124 --> 00:09:04.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can be happy
with the viewpoint of the Governing Body,

00:09:04.694 --> 00:09:06.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can be very happy

00:09:06.862 --> 00:09:09.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Publishing Committee
of the Governing Body

00:09:09.532 --> 00:09:12.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does look after our limited means.

00:09:12.335 --> 00:09:16.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they care for the money so that
when the Governing Body makes decisions

00:09:16.706 --> 00:09:20.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what needs to be done, they don’t say,

00:09:20.109 --> 00:09:22.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There’s no money for it.”

00:09:22.178 --> 00:09:26.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, they make sure that our limited funds
are available for the important work

00:09:26.782 --> 00:09:31.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to spiritually feed people
and help them in a physical sense too.

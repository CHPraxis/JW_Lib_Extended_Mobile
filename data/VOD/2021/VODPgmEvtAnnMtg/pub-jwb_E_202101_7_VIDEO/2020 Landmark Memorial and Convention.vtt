Twenty-twenty was a year
of unprecedented change.

00:00:09.488 --> 00:00:11.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The coronavirus pandemic

00:00:11.991 --> 00:00:14.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has taken a grim toll around the world.

00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:17.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some parts of the world,
the coronavirus is . . .

00:00:17.746 --> 00:00:20.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beginning to spread more quickly.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This global pandemic has thrown the world

00:00:27.715 --> 00:00:30.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into a state of uncertainty.

00:00:32.636 --> 00:00:36.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On a global scale, it was unlike anything

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people
had yet experienced in the 21st century.

00:00:40.853 --> 00:00:43.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyday life for many of us

00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:48.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been disrupted in ways
we might never have imagined.

00:00:51.822 --> 00:00:55.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve made dramatic adjustments
to our activities all over the world.

00:00:56.827 --> 00:00:59.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Learn how to use new apps like Skype®

00:00:59.872 --> 00:01:01.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Zoom—what’s that?

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:05.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It changed how we attended meetings,

00:01:05.628 --> 00:01:09.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
engaged in the ministry,
and visited with friends.

00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:10.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For some of us,

00:01:10.716 --> 00:01:13.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this may have been
the very first time we ever held

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a Memorial in our home.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And although attending in smaller groups
may have been even closer

00:01:20.142 --> 00:01:23.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to how the Memorial
was observed in earlier times,

00:01:23.938 --> 00:01:26.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for most modern-day servants of Jehovah,

00:01:26.982 --> 00:01:30.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this was likely a unique experience.

00:01:33.405 --> 00:01:35.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, during the summer,

00:01:35.783 --> 00:01:38.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we enjoyed a full convention program,

00:01:38.953 --> 00:01:40.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with talks delivered directly

00:01:40.162 --> 00:01:42.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Governing Body members

00:01:42.164 --> 00:01:43.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their helpers,

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:44.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in most cases,

00:01:44.917 --> 00:01:49.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
again, streamed right into our homes.

00:01:54.343 --> 00:01:56.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, despite the various challenges

00:01:56.345 --> 00:01:59.473 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and difficulties experienced in 2020,

00:01:59.473 --> 00:02:02.726 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s organization continued undaunted

00:02:03.227 --> 00:02:06.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
providing the right food at the right time.

00:02:06.105 --> 00:02:08.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why was this convention

00:02:08.732 --> 00:02:12.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unlike any other
in our organization’s history?

00:02:12.528 --> 00:02:14.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What were the challenges?

00:02:14.822 --> 00:02:18.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And most important,
what have been the benefits?

00:02:21.954 --> 00:02:24.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On March 11, 2020,

00:02:24.707 --> 00:02:26.417 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the World Health Organization

00:02:26.417 --> 00:02:27.918 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
made the assessment

00:02:27.918 --> 00:02:30.337 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that COVID-19 could be characterized

00:02:30.337 --> 00:02:31.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a pandemic.

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:34.299 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
At that point, we had no idea

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:35.467 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
as to what governments

00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:37.177 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were going to do worldwide.

00:02:37.177 --> 00:02:39.054 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Would they allow our brothers

00:02:39.054 --> 00:02:41.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to meet in Kingdom Halls?

00:02:41.056 --> 00:02:44.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would they allow our brothers
to meet in larger venues?

00:02:44.685 --> 00:02:46.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had no idea whatsoever.

00:02:47.396 --> 00:02:50.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body
approved a letter to all branches

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:54.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
canceling all live conventions worldwide.

00:02:54.028 --> 00:02:58.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the idea was
for us to prerecord a program

00:02:58.115 --> 00:03:01.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could be used in any location

00:03:01.243 --> 00:03:04.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
around the world
so that they would at least have

00:03:04.496 --> 00:03:07.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the program of the regional convention.

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:09.084 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We wanted to ensure

00:03:09.084 --> 00:03:11.086 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that this spiritual food got out there

00:03:11.086 --> 00:03:13.464 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to all of our dear brothers and sisters.

00:03:13.464 --> 00:03:16.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More important,
we wanted to make certain

00:03:16.467 --> 00:03:20.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this program went forward,
because it honors Jehovah.

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:23.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s the Source of the joy that we have.

00:03:23.348 --> 00:03:27.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, very quickly, speakers were
each assigned two convention parts.

00:03:27.436 --> 00:03:28.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had to prepare them,

00:03:28.854 --> 00:03:31.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was scheduled to have all these talks

00:03:31.023 --> 00:03:34.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recorded during the last two weeks of April.

00:03:34.068 --> 00:03:36.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Giving a talk at an open arena

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:38.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or at a large event,

00:03:38.947 --> 00:03:41.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have the opportunity of getting

00:03:41.408 --> 00:03:43.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feedback from the audience.

00:03:43.702 --> 00:03:46.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you say something
that impresses the audience

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or makes them happy,
seeing the smiling faces there,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
somehow that really stirs up our presentation

00:03:53.003 --> 00:03:56.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helps us to make it
more lively and meaningful.

00:03:56.882 --> 00:04:00.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But being in the basement
of the office building,

00:04:00.594 --> 00:04:05.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looking at a camera
with nobody else in the room,

00:04:05.015 --> 00:04:07.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing that it’s just a couple of persons

00:04:07.017 --> 00:04:10.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recording it in another room certainly is

00:04:10.687 --> 00:04:13.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a very different way to present a talk.

00:04:13.816 --> 00:04:18.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah has allowed us
to endure this time of pandemic,

00:04:18.695 --> 00:04:23.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he also had to know
—and we’re convinced he knew—

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:28.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we could still make
this “Always Rejoice”! program happen

00:04:28.497 --> 00:04:33.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we would use the tools
available to us, and he would help us.

00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:34.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s exactly what we did.

00:04:40.926 --> 00:04:44.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, let’s take a closer look
at some additional challenges faced

00:04:44.012 --> 00:04:46.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
once the talks were recorded.

00:04:46.306 --> 00:04:49.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had the opportunity to hear
from some of the departments involved.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers,

00:04:53.522 --> 00:04:57.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how did the team adapt to the challenges?

00:04:57.025 --> 00:05:00.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the reaction, initially,
was that we were very excited.

00:05:00.404 --> 00:05:02.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love to try new things,

00:05:02.406 --> 00:05:04.074 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and this was a huge opportunity

00:05:04.074 --> 00:05:05.576 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to do just that.

00:05:05.576 --> 00:05:07.578 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But then as we had more meetings about it,

00:05:07.578 --> 00:05:09.329 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we found out what was going to be involved.

00:05:09.329 --> 00:05:11.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We suddenly got very nervous

00:05:11.623 --> 00:05:13.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we found out
about all the translation

00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:15.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how soon everything had to be finished.

00:05:15.627 --> 00:05:18.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What impact did that have?

00:05:18.088 --> 00:05:20.549 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Audio/Video Services had never produced

00:05:20.549 --> 00:05:22.885 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
an online program of this size before.

00:05:22.885 --> 00:05:23.969 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You’re talking

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:27.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an 18-hour online regional convention
that had to be produced

00:05:27.264 --> 00:05:28.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a very short time.

00:05:28.891 --> 00:05:30.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most years,

00:05:30.184 --> 00:05:31.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we just translate the outlines,

00:05:31.727 --> 00:05:33.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which are relatively easy,

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.730 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and then we translate

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.524 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
all the convention videos and dramas.

00:05:37.524 --> 00:05:38.775 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But this year,

00:05:38.775 --> 00:05:43.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the translators not only had to do
that work of translating the videos

00:05:43.113 --> 00:05:48.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they had to translate
the scripts for each talk and then arrange

00:05:48.035 --> 00:05:50.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for recording all of those talks.

00:05:50.412 --> 00:05:52.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a tremendous amount of work.

00:05:52.497 --> 00:05:54.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of us were saying:

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:55.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Can we postpone it?

00:05:55.626 --> 00:05:57.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Can we ask

00:05:57.002 --> 00:05:58.629 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“to write back and say,

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:00.797 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‘Brothers, please, can we do it later?’”

00:06:01.423 --> 00:06:02.466 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because we just thought

00:06:02.466 --> 00:06:04.468 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
it was impossible to do.

00:06:05.427 --> 00:06:07.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The government in India

00:06:07.512 --> 00:06:09.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had announced a complete lockdown,

00:06:09.514 --> 00:06:10.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so overnight

00:06:11.516 --> 00:06:13.518 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we were without our offices,

00:06:13.518 --> 00:06:15.520 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
our computer equipment,

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our recording studios,

00:06:17.522 --> 00:06:20.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the level of connectivity we enjoyed.

00:06:20.317 --> 00:06:25.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We felt like a carpenter
who’s asked to produce furniture

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but has no access
to his toolbox or his workshop.

00:06:31.703 --> 00:06:34.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is a lot to contend with.

00:06:34.831 --> 00:06:38.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are some unique solutions

00:06:38.043 --> 00:06:41.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the teams came up with
to meet those various challenges?

00:06:41.797 --> 00:06:44.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there were amazing solutions.

00:06:44.883 --> 00:06:46.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the things that impressed me

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:51.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the recording studios that were made.

00:06:56.436 --> 00:06:58.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Normally the translators go into the RTO

00:06:58.021 --> 00:07:00.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the branch to do the recording,

00:07:01.191 --> 00:07:06.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now they had to make
hundreds of makeshift studios in their homes.

00:07:06.113 --> 00:07:08.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would translators accomplish the work

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
outside the branch
with the power coming in and out?

00:07:12.035 --> 00:07:14.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the brothers would wait,

00:07:14.746 --> 00:07:18.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as soon as the power came,
they would start working,

00:07:18.333 --> 00:07:21.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter what time it was in the day.

00:07:21.295 --> 00:07:25.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers are so dedicated
that they accomplished the work.

00:07:26.425 --> 00:07:27.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very touching.

00:07:28.552 --> 00:07:30.554 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers who do sign language recordings

00:07:30.554 --> 00:07:31.847 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
had to record

00:07:31.847 --> 00:07:33.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in front of a camera,

00:07:33.557 --> 00:07:34.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they also ideally needed

00:07:34.933 --> 00:07:38.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have a background behind them

00:07:38.395 --> 00:07:43.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was bright green or bright blue

00:07:43.358 --> 00:07:45.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that their signing could be superimposed

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
onto another video.

00:07:47.362 --> 00:07:50.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so some brothers
were able to get a cloth.

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:54.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of our brothers
painted a wall in their house

00:07:54.453 --> 00:07:56.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this bright chartreuse color.

00:07:56.455 --> 00:07:58.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Admirable ingenuity—thank you.

00:07:58.874 --> 00:08:01.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the most interesting solutions

00:08:01.084 --> 00:08:04.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was that many of the translators
around the world

00:08:04.755 --> 00:08:07.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in different branches would go

00:08:07.132 --> 00:08:09.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into their car late at night

00:08:09.134 --> 00:08:11.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when all the noise had subsided

00:08:11.887 --> 00:08:14.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the neighborhood,
and they would do the recording

00:08:14.097 --> 00:08:15.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
inside the car.

00:08:15.307 --> 00:08:19.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you and everyone working with you
for being so willing to adapt.

00:08:19.561 --> 00:08:21.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In your opinion,

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what made all of this possible?

00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:26.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite a global pandemic,

00:08:26.443 --> 00:08:28.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite a lockdown

00:08:28.445 --> 00:08:29.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—none of those things

00:08:29.613 --> 00:08:31.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mattered to Jehovah’s organization.

00:08:31.448 --> 00:08:35.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What has shut down various other things
throughout the world

00:08:35.994 --> 00:08:40.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
proved to be no obstacle for Jehovah
and his earthly organization.

00:08:40.374 --> 00:08:42.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a beautiful thing it is

00:08:42.376 --> 00:08:46.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see this program be something
that’s enjoyed by everyone worldwide!

00:08:47.506 --> 00:08:51.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here, despite the conditions
going on in the world around us,

00:08:51.218 --> 00:08:53.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people are moving forward.

00:08:53.804 --> 00:08:57.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you really see
the fulfillment of Malachi 3:18,

00:08:57.474 --> 00:09:00.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it says
that ‘you will see a distinction

00:09:00.185 --> 00:09:03.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between those serving Jehovah
and those who don’t.’

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone who had a part in this

00:09:05.732 --> 00:09:08.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the thousands of brothers
and sisters around the world

00:09:08.276 --> 00:09:12.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had a part in bringing
these convention programs

00:09:12.114 --> 00:09:14.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our brothers and sisters—

00:09:14.116 --> 00:09:16.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re just normal people
like you and me,

00:09:16.743 --> 00:09:19.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah uses normal people

00:09:19.913 --> 00:09:22.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to accomplish incredible things.

00:09:22.999 --> 00:09:26.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This convention
has been a landmark convention

00:09:26.211 --> 00:09:29.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the content
and the beautiful theme,

00:09:29.631 --> 00:09:33.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we’ll also remember it
for the way Jehovah helped us

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to produce it in so many languages

00:09:36.471 --> 00:09:40.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our brothers and sisters
in the country and around the world.

00:09:40.267 --> 00:09:43.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in translation, we like verbs,

00:09:43.353 --> 00:09:46.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in Jehovah’s name, there’s a verb:

00:09:46.606 --> 00:09:49.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He Causes to Become.”

00:09:49.818 --> 00:09:53.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This 2020 convention was proof

00:09:53.196 --> 00:09:57.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah causes whatever he wants

00:09:57.617 --> 00:10:00.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to become to accomplish his purpose,

00:10:00.412 --> 00:10:03.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because if there’s a convention
that Jehovah used

00:10:03.415 --> 00:10:07.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give glory to his name, this is it.

00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:09.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What beautiful conviction!

00:10:09.921 --> 00:10:11.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, brothers.

00:10:13.675 --> 00:10:15.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah’s spirit helped ensure

00:10:15.677 --> 00:10:19.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the work was accomplished
in spite of many challenges,

00:10:19.764 --> 00:10:23.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what were some of the blessings
experienced once the work was done?

00:10:30.692 --> 00:10:33.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because the convention
is being presented by means of video,

00:10:33.236 --> 00:10:36.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s possible to pause
at any time when necessary

00:10:36.239 --> 00:10:38.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just to go back a little bit
to watch something

00:10:38.492 --> 00:10:40.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that maybe we didn’t quite get.

00:10:40.535 --> 00:10:43.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And maybe even because sometimes
our minds drift,

00:10:43.288 --> 00:10:46.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s good,
because we can go back and rewatch it.

00:10:46.082 --> 00:10:49.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in this way,
we get even more benefit from the program.

00:10:52.964 --> 00:10:54.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I cannot imagine

00:10:54.966 --> 00:10:57.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a convention more international
than this one.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw how the brothers were able

00:10:59.471 --> 00:11:02.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make a difficult situation turn out well

00:11:02.015 --> 00:11:04.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is, we’re together,

00:11:04.392 --> 00:11:07.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if we’re physically apart
from each other.

00:11:07.062 --> 00:11:09.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are united at this convention.

00:11:19.199 --> 00:11:23.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Volunteers were sent by the elders to travel

00:11:23.036 --> 00:11:27.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and obtain the videos
due to lack of Internet in our village.

00:11:28.833 --> 00:11:32.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We traveled about 46 kilometers on foot.

00:11:36.466 --> 00:11:38.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes we would leave early in the morning

00:11:38.885 --> 00:11:41.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or late in the evening, 
even traveling at night

00:11:41.972 --> 00:11:44.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to obtain the videos.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:47.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with Jehovah’s blessing,
we overcame

00:11:47.686 --> 00:11:49.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of these challenges.

00:11:57.195 --> 00:11:59.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lost my dearest wife

00:11:59.406 --> 00:12:02.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about two months
before the convention started.

00:12:02.325 --> 00:12:04.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was cancer.

00:12:05.453 --> 00:12:07.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had been married for 14 years,

00:12:07.914 --> 00:12:10.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she was only 47.

00:12:12.877 --> 00:12:16.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was my greatest partner
in Jehovah’s service,

00:12:16.923 --> 00:12:20.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so this left me with a gaping hole.

00:12:26.766 --> 00:12:29.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The theme of the convention,
“Always Rejoice”!

00:12:30.562 --> 00:12:33.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came just at the right time for me.

00:12:33.356 --> 00:12:37.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know it was Jehovah’s wonderful gift to me.

00:12:37.235 --> 00:12:40.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout the convention,
I could see that Jehovah had sent

00:12:40.447 --> 00:12:45.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the members of the Governing Body
and its helpers to me personally.

00:12:45.285 --> 00:12:48.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t think of a better gift.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:59.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really enjoyed the audio descriptions

00:12:59.424 --> 00:13:02.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I am someone who is legally blind,

00:13:02.427 --> 00:13:06.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the audio descriptions
just opened up a whole new world for me.

00:13:06.264 --> 00:13:10.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ben walks out of the room
as his coworkers shake their heads.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:18.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it was really amazing
to have the videos being described.

00:13:18.526 --> 00:13:23.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for me, I felt like I could now “see”

00:13:23.281 --> 00:13:25.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what was happening.

00:13:25.283 --> 00:13:28.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A lot of what
the audio descriptions described

00:13:28.578 --> 00:13:32.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are things
that I normally would have been curious about

00:13:32.248 --> 00:13:35.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and would have been asking somebody
to help me understand.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had tears in my eyes

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:43.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing that the Governing Body
loves us this much.

00:13:45.637 --> 00:13:48.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I speak Korean.

00:13:48.264 --> 00:13:50.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I speak Japanese.

00:13:51.685 --> 00:13:54.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We made a Japanese section
and a Korean section

00:13:54.604 --> 00:13:57.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like what we would have
at international conventions.

00:13:58.108 --> 00:14:01.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In order to watch
the convention simultaneously, we would count

00:14:01.778 --> 00:14:05.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one, two, three and start playing
our videos at the same time.

00:14:05.448 --> 00:14:08.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This way we were able
to watch and sing together.

00:14:08.535 --> 00:14:11.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really felt
like an international convention.

00:14:12.789 --> 00:14:15.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Something that I thought I would miss a lot
were the Kingdom melodies.

00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:18.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So then I wondered:
‘How is this going to work at home?

00:14:18.566 --> 00:14:21.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘There won’t be a crowd,
everyone singing together.

00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:23.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How’s it going to be?’

00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:26.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought I would really miss it,
but then my family and I agreed

00:14:26.991 --> 00:14:29.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to sing the Kingdom melodies loudly,
and it worked!

00:14:29.952 --> 00:14:33.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have never seen my family sing so loudly.

00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:45.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have three children,
and all five of us

00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:47.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here at home got COVID-19.

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all during the time
that the convention was being shown,

00:14:50.973 --> 00:14:53.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were all exhibiting symptoms.

00:14:53.017 --> 00:14:54.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a really hard time.

00:14:54.768 --> 00:14:59.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our family was so encouraged
by the convention program this year.

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:02.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife, Marisa, even said that to her,

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:04.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was as if the talks the brothers gave

00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:07.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were like hearing advice from a close friend

00:15:07.031 --> 00:15:09.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was sitting right next to you

00:15:09.116 --> 00:15:12.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like they were
right in the same room with us.

00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:18.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The convention is very positive;

00:15:19.543 --> 00:15:21.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s contagious.

00:15:21.545 --> 00:15:24.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has really touched our hearts.

00:15:24.006 --> 00:15:27.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I truly feel the convention
has touched my heart deeply.

00:15:28.052 --> 00:15:31.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both my mom and my dad,
who are right now struggling

00:15:31.472 --> 00:15:34.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with very serious illnesses,

00:15:34.224 --> 00:15:36.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were able to join me,

00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:38.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my brother, and my sister-in-law,

00:15:38.687 --> 00:15:42.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we were together
as a family in our living room.

00:15:42.566 --> 00:15:47.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We got to sing together
and watch the assembly together,

00:15:47.321 --> 00:15:50.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which otherwise
just would not have been possible.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite the struggles,

00:15:52.576 --> 00:15:54.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite the limitations

00:15:55.287 --> 00:15:57.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we may be facing,

00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:01.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
none of that has stopped Jehovah
from reaching out

00:16:01.543 --> 00:16:06.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even being in our own living rooms
during this convention.

Jehovah transforms something

00:16:09.718 --> 00:16:12.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Satan is using right now
to take away our joy

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:15.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into something that gives us joy.

00:16:15.849 --> 00:16:17.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it:

00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:20.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re watching the same spiritual program

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:24.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the same time with the same speakers,
brothers from the Governing Body.

00:16:24.858 --> 00:16:27.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We never imagined
that we would have this opportunity.

00:16:29.613 --> 00:16:32.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, are we all set?

00:16:40.874 --> 00:16:43.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, we’re ready whenever you are
if you want to go ahead.

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:49.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are delighted that you
could join us for this opening session

00:16:49.758 --> 00:16:53.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the “Always Rejoice”!
Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:16:56.432 --> 00:16:59.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when everything around you is chaotic,

00:16:59.935 --> 00:17:04.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the one thing you have
is your relationship with Jehovah.

00:17:07.901 --> 00:17:10.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will walk in your truth.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unify my heart to fear your name.”

00:17:43.312 --> 00:17:46.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we discovered something we had lost

00:17:46.982 --> 00:17:48.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—joy.

00:17:57.618 --> 00:18:01.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what terror,
no matter what trial may come upon us now

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:06.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or in the future,
we will be able to continue to rejoice

00:18:06.043 --> 00:18:10.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s acts of salvation.

00:18:16.011 --> 00:18:19.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While 2020 seemed to be anything
but a time for rejoicing,

00:18:19.807 --> 00:18:22.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this year’s convention proved

00:18:22.434 --> 00:18:25.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that no matter
what the circumstance we are in,

00:18:25.521 --> 00:18:28.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will continue to feed us,

00:18:28.148 --> 00:18:31.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will continue to worship him.

00:18:32.986 --> 00:18:36.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to Jehovah, we experienced

00:18:36.031 --> 00:18:40.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the truthfulness of Philippians 4:4,

00:18:40.244 --> 00:18:43.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that no matter the trail or difficulty,

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:47.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will “always rejoice in the Lord.”

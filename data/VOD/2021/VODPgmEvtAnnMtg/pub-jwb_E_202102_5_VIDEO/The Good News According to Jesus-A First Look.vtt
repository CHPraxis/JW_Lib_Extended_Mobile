Jesus said as recorded at Matthew 11:27:

00:00:05.568 --> 00:00:07.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No one fully knows . . .

00:00:07.778 --> 00:00:11.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Father except the Son

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:15.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and anyone to whom the Son
is willing to reveal him.”

00:00:16.912 --> 00:00:19.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This teaches us two things.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, that it is possible

00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:25.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for us to know the Father fully,

00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:30.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and second, that Jesus is the key
to knowing Jehovah.

00:00:31.677 --> 00:00:35.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus clearly identified his role

00:00:35.097 --> 00:00:37.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in revealing the Father.

00:00:37.474 --> 00:00:39.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On his last night here on earth,

00:00:39.977 --> 00:00:41.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he told his apostles

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:45.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded at John 14:6:

00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:50.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am the way and the truth and the life.

00:00:50.112 --> 00:00:55.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one comes to the Father
except through me.”

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only through Jesus
can we truly know the Father

00:01:00.706 --> 00:01:04.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have an approved relationship with Him.

00:01:04.126 --> 00:01:07.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Earlier, at the transfiguration,

00:01:07.463 --> 00:01:11.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah confirmed Jesus’ pivotal role

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he instructed
Peter, James, and John

00:01:14.178 --> 00:01:16.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to listen to Jesus.

00:01:17.806 --> 00:01:22.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For over a century,
“the faithful and discreet slave”

00:01:22.186 --> 00:01:25.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has provided a wide range of study aids

00:01:25.731 --> 00:01:29.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us learn about the life, ministry,

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:32.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and teachings of Jesus Christ.

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:35.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These gifts enrich our study of God’s Word.

00:01:35.908 --> 00:01:39.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They shed light on the world he lived in,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the places he walked,

00:01:43.248 --> 00:01:45.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the towns where he preached,

00:01:47.044 --> 00:01:49.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the landscapes he saw,

00:01:50.589 --> 00:01:52.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the food he ate,

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even the seasons

00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:58.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which various events took place.

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:01.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These printed publications

00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:03.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are more than just words on a page.

00:02:03.978 --> 00:02:07.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They illuminate Jesus’ personality

00:02:07.022 --> 00:02:09.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reveal his qualities,

00:02:09.191 --> 00:02:12.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which mirror those of his heavenly Father.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learn about Jesus’ compassion,

00:02:16.073 --> 00:02:18.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
self-sacrifice,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
humility, power,

00:02:21.078 --> 00:02:24.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
boldness, courage,

00:02:24.164 --> 00:02:26.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and love.

00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:28.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More important,

00:02:28.585 --> 00:02:31.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
focusing on Jesus’ teachings and example

00:02:31.964 --> 00:02:34.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
draw us closer to the One who sent him.

00:02:35.968 --> 00:02:38.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our meetings, assemblies, and conventions

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:41.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also deepen our love and appreciation

00:02:41.348 --> 00:02:43.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for God’s Son.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In more recent years,

00:02:45.436 --> 00:02:48.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s organization has used videos

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:50.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach the hearts

00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:53.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of all those attending our conventions.

00:02:54.653 --> 00:02:58.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can we continue
to help honest-hearted ones

00:02:58.741 --> 00:03:03.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to understand Jesus’ role
as King and High Priest

00:03:03.245 --> 00:03:07.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to help them acquire
“the mind of Christ”?

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, bringing events of Jesus’ ministry

00:03:11.128 --> 00:03:15.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to life on screen or on the printed page

00:03:15.215 --> 00:03:18.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not without its challenges.

00:03:20.262 --> 00:03:22.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you know,

00:03:22.306 --> 00:03:24.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body
had those full-costume dramas

00:03:24.767 --> 00:03:26.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for years at conventions,

00:03:27.352 --> 00:03:30.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but never was Jesus depicted.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you can understand the challenge.

00:03:32.733 --> 00:03:34.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who’s going to play Jesus?

00:03:35.277 --> 00:03:38.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine trying
to select brothers

00:03:38.697 --> 00:03:44.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in say 200-300 (or even more)
different places

00:03:44.495 --> 00:03:47.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to play the role of Jesus Christ?

00:03:47.206 --> 00:03:48.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then finally,

00:03:48.582 --> 00:03:52.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>‘For a Certainty God Made Him </i>
<i>Lord and Christ’ (Part I, Part II)</i>

00:03:52.544 --> 00:03:54.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we went ahead, 
and the Governing Body approved it:

00:03:54.797 --> 00:03:56.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go ahead. Let’s have that.”

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it worked very well.

00:03:58.634 --> 00:04:02.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you see Jesus 
with the woman that had a flow of blood

00:04:02.721 --> 00:04:06.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the tenderness shown in our video
of Jesus dealing with that woman

00:04:06.475 --> 00:04:10.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and her fear
and yet her confidence

00:04:10.062 --> 00:04:14.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she could be healed by him
and the way Jesus treated her,

00:04:14.233 --> 00:04:17.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that conveyed something
that we would not always bring up

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:19.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our imagination.

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So once we saw the reaction
from the brothers and sisters

00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:26.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how their hearts were touched
by this presentation—

00:04:26.495 --> 00:04:29.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could see
that this is a very effective way

00:04:29.164 --> 00:04:31.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to portray Jesus’ teachings.

00:04:31.208 --> 00:04:33.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What could boost your spirituality more

00:04:33.961 --> 00:04:37.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than actually seeing
the Scriptures come alive?

00:04:39.049 --> 00:04:43.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now here is a very exciting announcement:

00:04:43.887 --> 00:04:48.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body is pleased to announce

00:04:48.267 --> 00:04:52.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a very special video series about Jesus

00:04:52.437 --> 00:04:55.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is currently being developed.

00:04:55.274 --> 00:04:58.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Work is under way to develop and produce

00:04:58.777 --> 00:05:02.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a new, live-action dramatic series

00:05:02.197 --> 00:05:04.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Jesus Christ.

00:05:04.825 --> 00:05:07.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The title of the series is

00:05:07.578 --> 00:05:11.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Good News According to Jesus.</i>

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:15.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This series will combine the strengths

00:05:15.252 --> 00:05:19.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of all our preceding research and study tools

00:05:19.006 --> 00:05:23.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the power of the moving image

00:05:23.594 --> 00:05:28.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and will enable the viewer
to gain an even deeper understanding

00:05:28.265 --> 00:05:30.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jesus’ life and ministry,

00:05:30.976 --> 00:05:35.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which in turn increases
our knowledge of Jehovah.

00:05:36.148 --> 00:05:39.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although other religious
and commercial institutions

00:05:39.776 --> 00:05:43.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have produced various films
on the life of Jesus,

00:05:43.864 --> 00:05:48.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these have often been tainted
by unscriptural views of Jesus,

00:05:48.493 --> 00:05:52.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or they have placed excessive emphasis

00:05:52.206 --> 00:05:54.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on violence.

00:05:54.833 --> 00:05:57.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And existing video productions

00:05:57.377 --> 00:06:00.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
focus on one Bible book at a time

00:06:00.756 --> 00:06:05.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or only on specific episodes
of Jesus’ ministry on earth.

00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:08.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Good News According to Jesus, </i>

00:06:08.722 --> 00:06:11.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
however, will show all the events

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John

00:06:14.394 --> 00:06:17.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the order in which they happened

00:06:17.105 --> 00:06:20.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in as much of the rich detail

00:06:20.442 --> 00:06:25.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as current research
and Bible understanding will allow.

00:06:26.198 --> 00:06:30.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Often, a presentation
like the one you are about to see

00:06:30.244 --> 00:06:34.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is shown
after a feature-length drama is released.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such behind-the-scenes videos

00:06:37.626 --> 00:06:39.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help us to understand and appreciate

00:06:39.962 --> 00:06:44.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
various facets of the video-making process.

00:06:44.258 --> 00:06:49.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, however,
we are giving you a preview

00:06:49.096 --> 00:06:51.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a first look—

00:06:51.098 --> 00:06:53.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at an upcoming convention project

00:06:53.558 --> 00:06:56.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will take years to complete.

00:06:56.561 --> 00:07:00.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In view of the large scope of this project,

00:07:00.023 --> 00:07:02.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we encourage you

00:07:02.067 --> 00:07:05.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make it a matter
of earnest prayer to Jehovah

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:09.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and please support it

00:07:09.533 --> 00:07:12.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to your circumstances.

00:07:12.953 --> 00:07:17.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like see
what Episode One might look like?

00:07:19.167 --> 00:07:23.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To provide an advance impression
of the look and feel of an episode,

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:28.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Audio/Video Services prepares storyboards.

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:31.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re pleased to share with you now

00:07:31.346 --> 00:07:35.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an excerpt from an animated storyboard.

00:07:49.156 --> 00:07:51.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Assuming that he was

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:53.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the group traveling together,

00:07:53.201 --> 00:07:54.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they went a day’s journey

00:07:54.745 --> 00:07:56.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then began to search for him

00:07:56.705 --> 00:07:59.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
among the relatives and acquaintances.

00:08:04.421 --> 00:08:06.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But not finding him,

00:08:06.465 --> 00:08:08.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they returned to Jerusalem

00:08:08.633 --> 00:08:11.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and made a diligent search for him.

00:08:31.448 --> 00:08:34.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, after three days,

00:08:34.034 --> 00:08:36.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they found him in the temple,

00:08:37.537 --> 00:08:39.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sitting in the midst of the teachers

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:40.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and listening to them

00:08:40.916 --> 00:08:43.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and asking them questions.

00:08:45.837 --> 00:08:47.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But all those listening to him

00:08:47.964 --> 00:08:49.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were in constant amazement

00:08:49.966 --> 00:08:52.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at his understanding and his answers.

00:08:54.846 --> 00:08:56.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now when his parents saw him,

00:08:56.681 --> 00:08:58.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were astounded.

00:09:06.608 --> 00:09:10.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Child, why did you treat us this way?

00:09:10.612 --> 00:09:12.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here your father and I

00:09:12.614 --> 00:09:15.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been frantically looking for you.

00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:18.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why were you looking for me?

00:09:18.578 --> 00:09:20.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you not know that I must be

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the house of my Father?

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, they did not understand

00:09:25.252 --> 00:09:27.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what he was saying to them.

00:09:27.254 --> 00:09:29.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he went down with them

00:09:29.256 --> 00:09:30.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and returned to Nazareth,

00:09:30.549 --> 00:09:33.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he continued subject to them.

00:09:33.009 --> 00:09:35.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, his mother carefully kept

00:09:35.345 --> 00:09:37.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all these sayings in her heart.

00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:49.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jesus went on progressing in wisdom

00:09:49.818 --> 00:09:51.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in physical growth

00:09:51.987 --> 00:09:54.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in favor with God and men.

00:09:57.909 --> 00:10:00.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The true light that gives light

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to every sort of man

00:10:02.581 --> 00:10:05.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was about to come into the world.

00:10:08.462 --> 00:10:11.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, this is not the final video.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, it’s an example

00:10:14.134 --> 00:10:18.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how the words on a page can come to life.

00:10:19.598 --> 00:10:22.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Preparing simple, basic drawings

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to convey the idea of a video

00:10:24.769 --> 00:10:28.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is one of the early visual tools used

00:10:28.106 --> 00:10:30.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the approval process.

00:10:30.775 --> 00:10:35.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The animatic review is a very early milestone

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:38.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the visual storytelling.

00:10:38.783 --> 00:10:42.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how has the project been developed?

00:10:42.454 --> 00:10:45.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What direction has the Governing Body given

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:49.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for bringing events
in Jesus’ life to the screen?

00:10:50.837 --> 00:10:54.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So first of all,
the Governing Body approved the concept

00:10:54.299 --> 00:10:57.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of producing a production like this.

00:10:57.511 --> 00:10:59.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there were some questions, such as,

00:10:59.554 --> 00:11:01.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you do it?

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So three options were given
to the Governing Body.

00:11:04.684 --> 00:11:06.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first option

00:11:06.686 --> 00:11:10.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was for us just to have
a theatrical stage production

00:11:10.774 --> 00:11:12.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
similar to what we’d already done.

00:11:12.943 --> 00:11:17.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second set of options involved

00:11:17.155 --> 00:11:19.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
having a narrator speaking

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:23.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just reading the sections of Scripture

00:11:23.036 --> 00:11:25.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in the background to have acting

00:11:25.372 --> 00:11:28.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but not actually having Jesus speaking

00:11:28.083 --> 00:11:31.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or those involved with Jesus speaking.

00:11:31.836 --> 00:11:34.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then finally, the third option

00:11:34.297 --> 00:11:38.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—which is, of course, the hardest
and involves a lot of work—

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:42.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to do a real-life drama.

00:11:42.055 --> 00:11:44.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we were interested to see

00:11:44.099 --> 00:11:46.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how the Governing Body would feel about this.

00:11:46.726 --> 00:11:49.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a joyous time it was
to hear the brothers say:

00:11:49.646 --> 00:11:52.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We want the best for the brotherhood.

00:11:52.274 --> 00:11:54.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We want them to be able to see

00:11:54.776 --> 00:11:58.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the power and impact of what Jesus taught.

00:11:58.071 --> 00:12:00.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we want the third option!”

00:12:00.282 --> 00:12:03.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So then we realized
that there’s a lot of work ahead.

00:12:04.327 --> 00:12:08.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s easy to think:
‘The inspired text is there.

00:12:08.123 --> 00:12:10.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s to write?’

00:12:10.125 --> 00:12:13.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s not as simple
as just taking little, half-hour chunks

00:12:13.628 --> 00:12:15.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
out of the four Gospel accounts

00:12:15.922 --> 00:12:19.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and throwing them
on a script and filming them.

00:12:19.134 --> 00:12:21.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which Gospel account do you use?

00:12:21.678 --> 00:12:24.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you use Matthew’s account?
Mark’s? Luke’s?

00:12:24.347 --> 00:12:27.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, very quickly we saw the need to lay each

00:12:27.642 --> 00:12:31.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the four Gospel accounts side by side

00:12:31.396 --> 00:12:34.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and decide which account

00:12:34.232 --> 00:12:36.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in every case, every event—

00:12:36.693 --> 00:12:39.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gives us the fullest picture,
the most details.

00:12:39.863 --> 00:12:44.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So even if you can’t say everything
that appears in all four accounts,

00:12:44.367 --> 00:12:47.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you use the one
to carry the bulk of the story,

00:12:47.871 --> 00:12:50.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the others provide
the rest of the details

00:12:50.373 --> 00:12:52.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ll actually see.

00:12:52.375 --> 00:12:55.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers who help write the dramas

00:12:55.003 --> 00:12:57.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have a tremendous amount of work to do.

00:12:57.714 --> 00:13:00.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then there are also those
who do the research

00:13:00.592 --> 00:13:03.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just to make sure little details are correct,

00:13:03.053 --> 00:13:05.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether it be the shoes a person has on

00:13:05.347 --> 00:13:07.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or whether he even wears shoes.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:10.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you show something on film,

00:13:10.518 --> 00:13:12.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are committing yourself.

00:13:12.937 --> 00:13:16.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are saying that this is the explanation

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:19.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or, in some cases, the application.

00:13:19.527 --> 00:13:22.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It goes beyond illustration;
it’s the explanation.

00:13:22.197 --> 00:13:24.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the way to understand what happened.

00:13:24.199 --> 00:13:26.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is what sticks
with people’s memories.

00:13:26.868 --> 00:13:30.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s a huge responsibility
to get that right.

00:13:30.664 --> 00:13:34.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our Research Department
already has a lot of information.

00:13:34.668 --> 00:13:38.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But doing something like this
is yet another step

00:13:38.797 --> 00:13:41.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
down the path of being very, very difficult

00:13:41.716 --> 00:13:44.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because there are
a lot more questions that come up.

00:13:44.636 --> 00:13:46.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How are we going to depict the Devil?

00:13:46.304 --> 00:13:48.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you show Jesus walking on water?

00:13:48.098 --> 00:13:51.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What footwear was allowed in the <i>Soreg?</i>

00:13:51.351 --> 00:13:53.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what’s a <i>Soreg?</i>

00:13:53.353 --> 00:13:56.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Research is pivotal in this.

00:13:56.856 --> 00:14:00.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you make a decision about what to depict.

00:14:01.027 --> 00:14:04.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then there are details when it comes

00:14:04.197 --> 00:14:08.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to not just telling it,
not just reading what happened,

00:14:08.368 --> 00:14:11.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now you have to show what happened.

00:14:11.871 --> 00:14:13.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you do that?

00:14:13.873 --> 00:14:16.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you take something that’s static,
like a piece of artwork

00:14:16.126 --> 00:14:18.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s well-researched with solid sources,

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:21.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now bring it to life,
then in many respects,

00:14:21.965 --> 00:14:24.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more research needs to go into this

00:14:24.384 --> 00:14:27.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that everything is looked at
from various angles.

00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:32.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let me explain the challenge
we have with John chapter 6.

00:14:32.308 --> 00:14:35.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we look at Map 3B in the Appendix section,

00:14:35.937 --> 00:14:39.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just imagine we have the Sea of Galilee here.

00:14:39.482 --> 00:14:41.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, according to what it shows us,

00:14:41.568 --> 00:14:43.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have Magadan here on this side

00:14:43.903 --> 00:14:46.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Sea of Galilee,

00:14:46.281 --> 00:14:49.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and up here we have Capernaum.

00:14:49.033 --> 00:14:52.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, according to what this tells us,

00:14:52.036 --> 00:14:54.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus performed his miracle

00:14:54.122 --> 00:14:57.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
across on this side of the Sea of Galilee,

00:14:57.333 --> 00:15:00.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then the apostles traveled by boat

00:15:00.211 --> 00:15:02.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to this general area.

00:15:02.297 --> 00:15:05.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, Jesus joined up with them
when he walked on the water.

00:15:05.759 --> 00:15:08.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So according to John chapter 6,

00:15:08.178 --> 00:15:10.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus starts to teach the crowd

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he is walking along the seashore.

00:15:13.725 --> 00:15:16.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But by the end of John chapter 6,

00:15:16.561 --> 00:15:20.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see that Jesus
is actually speaking at that time

00:15:20.106 --> 00:15:22.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here in Capernaum.

00:15:22.484 --> 00:15:24.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the question comes up,

00:15:24.486 --> 00:15:26.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What part of the dialogue

00:15:26.529 --> 00:15:29.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was actually stated here
in the synagogue in Capernaum,

00:15:29.866 --> 00:15:31.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what part was stated

00:15:31.868 --> 00:15:34.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along the seashore as he was walking along?

00:15:34.412 --> 00:15:38.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’ll have to do
some research into John chapter 6

00:15:38.333 --> 00:15:40.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see where there is a good break

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for us to realize what words

00:15:42.462 --> 00:15:44.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were actually said there in the synagogue.

00:15:44.464 --> 00:15:46.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the challenge.

00:15:46.466 --> 00:15:50.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need for the friends
to be able to watch this video series

00:15:50.512 --> 00:15:52.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and feel they’re actually there.

00:15:52.806 --> 00:15:55.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what they are seeing
is as close to the way

00:15:55.225 --> 00:15:57.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it must have been
as we can possibly make it.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:01.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the role of research
helps us to ensure that.

00:16:01.815 --> 00:16:04.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With scripts being developed and approved,

00:16:04.859 --> 00:16:07.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the production team continues work

00:16:07.779 --> 00:16:09.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the visual look and feel of the series.

00:16:11.783 --> 00:16:13.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we found out
that the project involved

00:16:13.785 --> 00:16:15.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the entirety of Jesus’ ministry,

00:16:15.703 --> 00:16:17.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was simply overwhelming.

00:16:17.247 --> 00:16:19.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once we’ve read our script,
we go into a phase

00:16:19.916 --> 00:16:22.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we start working with storyboards.

00:16:22.544 --> 00:16:25.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Storyboards are kind of like a first pass

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:27.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at what this story might look like.

00:16:28.842 --> 00:16:31.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s compiled
into what’s called an animatic,

00:16:31.302 --> 00:16:33.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is a type of video.

00:16:33.346 --> 00:16:35.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you’ve got a narration,

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:37.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ve got dialogue, and you’ve got music,

00:16:37.433 --> 00:16:39.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s to these cartoon boards.

00:16:39.936 --> 00:16:42.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s great because it gets you prepared

00:16:42.105 --> 00:16:44.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that on set,
the challenges don’t just pop up.

00:16:44.816 --> 00:16:46.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can anticipate them.

00:16:48.611 --> 00:16:50.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Concept art is a communication tool

00:16:50.613 --> 00:16:53.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us to get all on the same page.

00:16:54.367 --> 00:16:58.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Concept art helps us
to get the mood of it, the lighting,

00:16:59.372 --> 00:17:01.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to experience it maybe from a perspective

00:17:01.374 --> 00:17:03.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we hadn’t thought of before.

00:17:04.878 --> 00:17:08.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The story of Jesus’ ministry
isn’t just dry, cold facts.

00:17:08.047 --> 00:17:10.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s actually human stories.

00:17:10.425 --> 00:17:15.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we see how different people
responded and reacted to Jesus’ ministry

00:17:15.013 --> 00:17:17.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how they were shaped 
and molded by what they experienced—

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s essentially that character’s arc.

00:17:19.642 --> 00:17:21.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We go in and say:

00:17:21.644 --> 00:17:24.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“OK, where does our character start?
How does he grow?

00:17:24.939 --> 00:17:28.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And where is he by the end of this series?”

00:17:29.444 --> 00:17:31.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By seeing his struggles,
seeing his challenges,

00:17:31.446 --> 00:17:33.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it makes that character more relatable.

00:17:34.532 --> 00:17:36.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As years of development passed,

00:17:37.827 --> 00:17:42.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the immense scope of this project
came into clear focus.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A natural question arose,

00:17:44.918 --> 00:17:47.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where would we record it?

00:17:48.379 --> 00:17:50.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we were doing the production of Jonah,

00:17:50.381 --> 00:17:52.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we used parts of southern California.

00:17:52.508 --> 00:17:54.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we thought
that would be a very good location.

00:17:54.761 --> 00:17:57.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that was proposed to the Governing Body,

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they said, “Thank you very much,

00:18:00.558 --> 00:18:04.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but we would rather
that you use existing Bethel facilities

00:18:04.312 --> 00:18:05.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that would be available

00:18:05.813 --> 00:18:08.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that maybe are not being utilized
to their full potential.”

00:18:09.317 --> 00:18:12.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We worked with Worldwide Design/Construction,

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:16.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they provided a list
of some of the branches that had space.

00:18:16.157 --> 00:18:19.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we were doing so,
it came to our attention

00:18:19.786 --> 00:18:24.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in Australasia,
the printery was about to be phased out.

00:18:25.083 --> 00:18:27.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the end of 2015,

00:18:28.211 --> 00:18:30.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the printing work was moved to Japan.

00:18:30.588 --> 00:18:32.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The press was then put up for sale.

00:18:32.423 --> 00:18:34.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It sold about three years later.

00:18:34.425 --> 00:18:36.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now we had this big warehouse space

00:18:36.427 --> 00:18:39.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—just what we needed for a studio.

00:18:39.973 --> 00:18:41.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were just stunned

00:18:41.849 --> 00:18:45.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to think that such a project
could be accomplished here.

00:18:45.353 --> 00:18:48.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I think we’ve also seen so much evidence

00:18:48.106 --> 00:18:50.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s blessing on this project

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it’s very clear
it’s something he wants.

00:18:53.653 --> 00:18:55.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The temporary accommodations
here at the branch

00:18:55.989 --> 00:18:57.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were due for demolition,

00:18:57.991 --> 00:19:01.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, I mean, like the bulldozers
were almost at the gate.

00:19:01.244 --> 00:19:03.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we were able to stop those bulldozers

00:19:04.497 --> 00:19:07.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, as a result,
we’re currently renovating those residences.

00:19:07.959 --> 00:19:10.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s hand
was definitely in that experience.

00:19:10.545 --> 00:19:13.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without the stopping of that demolition,

00:19:13.548 --> 00:19:16.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we wouldn’t have had enough accommodations 
to look after this project.

00:19:18.344 --> 00:19:21.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was as if Jehovah
was dropping this option in our laps

00:19:21.681 --> 00:19:25.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all the criteria
that we needed to do this project.

00:19:25.435 --> 00:19:27.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the primary location selected,

00:19:28.855 --> 00:19:31.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Production Design helps take a concept

00:19:31.983 --> 00:19:34.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and make it a reality.

00:19:36.446 --> 00:19:40.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our goal as Production Design
is to immerse the audience in the story.

00:19:40.783 --> 00:19:44.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they have that sense,
now they’re paying attention

00:19:44.078 --> 00:19:47.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to what’s being said on screen

00:19:47.623 --> 00:19:50.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what they can learn,
what they can benefit from it.

00:19:51.169 --> 00:19:53.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s one thing to design something,

00:19:53.171 --> 00:19:55.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then to execute that design
is another thing.

00:19:56.466 --> 00:19:58.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even like with the throne room,

00:19:58.509 --> 00:20:00.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this actually is too much work.

00:20:00.553 --> 00:20:02.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to simplify it.

00:20:02.221 --> 00:20:04.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we need to show three walls?

00:20:04.223 --> 00:20:06.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we just get away with building two walls

00:20:06.517 --> 00:20:10.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have the same effect,
the same production quality?

00:20:10.688 --> 00:20:14.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Usually,
we design the set, we build a set,

00:20:14.192 --> 00:20:17.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we film the set,
and then we tear the set down.

00:20:17.278 --> 00:20:20.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this project is unique
in that we’re not doing that.

00:20:20.114 --> 00:20:22.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These buildings, these structures,

00:20:22.116 --> 00:20:24.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re going to be filming
are going to last for years,

00:20:25.286 --> 00:20:27.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so they had to be built that way.

00:20:28.664 --> 00:20:33.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how do we combine
modern-day building standards to make it last

00:20:33.336 --> 00:20:36.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but still make it look
like an old, ancient, building

00:20:36.005 --> 00:20:38.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was built 2,000 years ago?

00:20:39.258 --> 00:20:42.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were looking for a certain type of finish
—a concrete finish.

00:20:42.845 --> 00:20:45.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through a website,
we found there was a company

00:20:45.681 --> 00:20:49.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over in Perth that was able to achieve this.

00:20:49.644 --> 00:20:52.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after calling them,
we found out they’re brothers.

00:20:53.439 --> 00:20:55.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And those brothers
have been able to come over and help us

00:20:55.608 --> 00:20:58.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their expertise
to get the right type of finish.

00:20:59.654 --> 00:21:03.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The support from all those
under the Australasia branch territory

00:21:03.866 --> 00:21:06.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been faith-strengthening.

00:21:07.537 --> 00:21:09.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So one of the biggest needs
we probably have at the moment

00:21:09.539 --> 00:21:11.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be auditioning.

00:21:11.582 --> 00:21:15.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We absolutely need
more volunteers for acting.

00:21:15.128 --> 00:21:17.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a unique and new form of sacred service.

00:21:17.296 --> 00:21:21.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s something that probably most
never thought they would ever do

00:21:21.467 --> 00:21:24.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or be asked to do,
but there is definitely a need.

00:21:24.679 --> 00:21:28.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more that can make themselves available 
through this auditioning process

00:21:28.099 --> 00:21:31.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would allow us to have
the right people in the roles.

00:21:31.269 --> 00:21:33.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One fundamental principle that underlies

00:21:33.271 --> 00:21:36.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any good acting is empathy.

00:21:36.023 --> 00:21:37.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s something
that we all learn as Christians.

00:21:37.859 --> 00:21:41.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not about showing
the behavior in big ways.

00:21:41.154 --> 00:21:43.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s about understanding
who the character is,

00:21:43.156 --> 00:21:45.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then it exudes naturally.

00:21:45.199 --> 00:21:47.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s organization will always train us,

00:21:47.368 --> 00:21:50.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah’s spirit will make us ready

00:21:50.413 --> 00:21:52.290 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for the task that’s ahead of us.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:53.708 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s simple training,

00:21:53.708 --> 00:21:56.752 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but it’s definitely designed to help somebody

00:21:56.752 --> 00:21:59.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get comfortable in front of a camera,

00:21:59.422 --> 00:22:01.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
performing in front of many people

00:22:01.549 --> 00:22:04.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and being able to relax
—being able to be themselves.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To see our brothers and sisters
offering themselves,

00:22:06.512 --> 00:22:08.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
putting themselves out in this way,

00:22:08.514 --> 00:22:10.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is wonderful.

00:22:13.227 --> 00:22:15.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When this project was first discussed,

00:22:15.271 --> 00:22:18.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it felt like it was so far into the future

00:22:18.107 --> 00:22:19.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and almost an impossibility.

00:22:19.817 --> 00:22:21.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was so big in scope.

00:22:21.819 --> 00:22:24.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now,
it’s actually happening

00:22:24.405 --> 00:22:28.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you see Jehovah’s blessing
on the planning, on the construction,

00:22:28.201 --> 00:22:31.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the people.

00:22:33.164 --> 00:22:34.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will there be challenges?

00:22:34.457 --> 00:22:36.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh yeah, guaranteed.

00:22:36.167 --> 00:22:40.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if Jehovah wants something done,
that’s what happens.

00:22:40.713 --> 00:22:42.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have things at the right time,

00:22:42.673 --> 00:22:44.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s what we’ve done.

00:22:44.091 --> 00:22:46.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve advanced now
to where we’re able to do it

00:22:46.427 --> 00:22:48.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in such a wonderful way for the whole world.

00:22:48.846 --> 00:22:51.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are working with the best words

00:22:51.307 --> 00:22:54.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have ever been spoken on this planet

00:22:54.143 --> 00:22:57.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—words that have power and meaning.

00:22:57.146 --> 00:23:00.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is such a huge endeavor,

00:23:00.316 --> 00:23:04.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet Jehovah has shown us
his direction all along.

00:23:04.278 --> 00:23:06.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It needs to be done.

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:10.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With this project being blessed by Jehovah,
that’s what’s going to happen.

00:23:10.451 --> 00:23:14.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The genuine good news according to Jesus

00:23:14.121 --> 00:23:16.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s what we’re going to have.

00:23:18.084 --> 00:23:22.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s clear that Jehovah is blessing

“Jehovah sent
his only-begotten Son to the earth

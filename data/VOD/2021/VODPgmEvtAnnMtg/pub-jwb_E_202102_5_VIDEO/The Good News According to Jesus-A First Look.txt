00:00:01 Jesus said as recorded at Matthew 11:27:
00:00:05 “No one fully knows . . .
00:00:07 “the Father except the Son
00:00:11 and anyone to whom the Son is willing to reveal him.”
00:00:16 This teaches us two things.
00:00:19 First, that it is possible
00:00:22 for us to know the Father fully,
00:00:25 and second, that Jesus is the key to knowing Jehovah.
00:00:31 Jesus clearly identified his role
00:00:35 in revealing the Father.
00:00:37 On his last night here on earth,
00:00:39 he told his apostles
00:00:41 as recorded at John 14:6:
00:00:45 “I am the way and the truth and the life.
00:00:50 No one comes to the Father except through me.”
00:00:56 Only through Jesus can we truly know the Father
00:01:00 and have an approved relationship with Him.
00:01:04 Earlier, at the transfiguration,
00:01:07 Jehovah confirmed Jesus’ pivotal role
00:01:11 when he instructed Peter, James, and John
00:01:14 to listen to Jesus.
00:01:17 For over a century, “the faithful and discreet slave”
00:01:22 has provided a wide range of study aids
00:01:25 to help us learn about the life, ministry,
00:01:29 and teachings of Jesus Christ.
00:01:32 These gifts enrich our study of God’s Word.
00:01:35 They shed light on the world he lived in,
00:01:40 the places he walked,
00:01:43 the towns where he preached,
00:01:47 the landscapes he saw,
00:01:50 the food he ate,
00:01:53 and even the seasons
00:01:55 in which various events took place.
00:01:59 These printed publications
00:02:01 are more than just words on a page.
00:02:03 They illuminate Jesus’ personality
00:02:07 and reveal his qualities,
00:02:09 which mirror those of his heavenly Father.
00:02:13 We learn about Jesus’ compassion,
00:02:16 self-sacrifice,
00:02:18 humility, power,
00:02:21 boldness, courage,
00:02:24 and love.
00:02:26 More important,
00:02:28 focusing on Jesus’ teachings and example
00:02:31 draw us closer to the One who sent him.
00:02:35 Our meetings, assemblies, and conventions
00:02:38 also deepen our love and appreciation
00:02:41 for God’s Son.
00:02:43 In more recent years,
00:02:45 Jehovah’s organization has used videos
00:02:48 to reach the hearts
00:02:50 of all those attending our conventions.
00:02:54 But how can we continue to help honest-hearted ones
00:02:58 to understand Jesus’ role as King and High Priest
00:03:03 and to help them acquire “the mind of Christ”?
00:03:08 Well, bringing events of Jesus’ ministry
00:03:11 to life on screen or on the printed page
00:03:15 is not without its challenges.
00:03:20 As you know,
00:03:22 the Governing Body had those full-costume dramas
00:03:24 for years at conventions,
00:03:27 but never was Jesus depicted.
00:03:30 And you can understand the challenge.
00:03:32 Who’s going to play Jesus?
00:03:35 Can you imagine trying to select brothers
00:03:38 in say 200-300 (or even more) different places
00:03:44 to play the role of Jesus Christ?
00:03:47 But then finally,
00:03:48 ‘For a Certainty God Made Him  Lord and Christ’ (Part I, Part II)
00:03:52 —we went ahead,  and the Governing Body approved it:
00:03:54 “Go ahead. Let’s have that.”
00:03:56 And it worked very well.
00:03:58 When you see Jesus  with the woman that had a flow of blood
00:04:02 and the tenderness shown in our video of Jesus dealing with that woman
00:04:06 and her fear and yet her confidence
00:04:10 that she could be healed by him and the way Jesus treated her,
00:04:14 that conveyed something that we would not always bring up
00:04:17 in our imagination.
00:04:20 So once we saw the reaction from the brothers and sisters
00:04:22 —how their hearts were touched by this presentation—
00:04:26 we could see that this is a very effective way
00:04:29 to portray Jesus’ teachings.
00:04:31 What could boost your spirituality more
00:04:33 than actually seeing the Scriptures come alive?
00:04:39 Now here is a very exciting announcement:
00:04:43 The Governing Body is pleased to announce
00:04:48 that a very special video series about Jesus
00:04:52 is currently being developed.
00:04:55 Work is under way to develop and produce
00:04:58 a new, live-action dramatic series
00:05:02 on Jesus Christ.
00:05:04 The title of the series is
00:05:07 The Good News According to Jesus.
00:05:11 This series will combine the strengths
00:05:15 of all our preceding research and study tools
00:05:19 with the power of the moving image
00:05:23 and will enable the viewer to gain an even deeper understanding
00:05:28 of Jesus’ life and ministry,
00:05:30 which in turn increases our knowledge of Jehovah.
00:05:36 Although other religious and commercial institutions
00:05:39 have produced various films on the life of Jesus,
00:05:43 these have often been tainted by unscriptural views of Jesus,
00:05:48 or they have placed excessive emphasis
00:05:52 on violence.
00:05:54 And existing video productions
00:05:57 focus on one Bible book at a time
00:06:00 or only on specific episodes of Jesus’ ministry on earth.
00:06:06 The Good News According to Jesus,
00:06:08 however, will show all the events
00:06:11 of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John
00:06:14 in the order in which they happened
00:06:17 and in as much of the rich detail
00:06:20 as current research and Bible understanding will allow.
00:06:26 Often, a presentation like the one you are about to see
00:06:30 is shown after a feature-length drama is released.
00:06:34 Such behind-the-scenes videos
00:06:37 help us to understand and appreciate
00:06:39 various facets of the video-making process.
00:06:44 Today, however, we are giving you a preview
00:06:49 —a first look—
00:06:51 at an upcoming convention project
00:06:53 that will take years to complete.
00:06:56 In view of the large scope of this project,
00:07:00 we encourage you
00:07:02 to make it a matter of earnest prayer to Jehovah
00:07:05 and please support it
00:07:09 according to your circumstances.
00:07:12 Would you like see what Episode One might look like?
00:07:19 To provide an advance impression of the look and feel of an episode,
00:07:23 Audio/Video Services prepares storyboards.
00:07:28 We’re pleased to share with you now
00:07:31 an excerpt from an animated storyboard.
00:07:49 Assuming that he was
00:07:51 in the group traveling together,
00:07:53 they went a day’s journey
00:07:54 and then began to search for him
00:07:56 among the relatives and acquaintances.
00:08:04 But not finding him,
00:08:06 they returned to Jerusalem
00:08:08 and made a diligent search for him.
00:08:31 Well, after three days,
00:08:34 they found him in the temple,
00:08:37 sitting in the midst of the teachers
00:08:39 and listening to them
00:08:40 and asking them questions.
00:08:45 But all those listening to him
00:08:47 were in constant amazement
00:08:49 at his understanding and his answers.
00:08:54 Now when his parents saw him,
00:08:56 they were astounded.
00:09:06 Child, why did you treat us this way?
00:09:10 Here your father and I
00:09:12 have been frantically looking for you.
00:09:16 Why were you looking for me?
00:09:18 Did you not know that I must be
00:09:20 in the house of my Father?
00:09:23 However, they did not understand
00:09:25 what he was saying to them.
00:09:27 Then he went down with them
00:09:29 and returned to Nazareth,
00:09:30 and he continued subject to them.
00:09:33 Also, his mother carefully kept
00:09:35 all these sayings in her heart.
00:09:46 And Jesus went on progressing in wisdom
00:09:49 and in physical growth
00:09:51 and in favor with God and men.
00:09:57 The true light that gives light
00:10:00 to every sort of man
00:10:02 was about to come into the world.
00:10:08 Of course, this is not the final video.
00:10:11 Rather, it’s an example
00:10:14 of how the words on a page can come to life.
00:10:19 Preparing simple, basic drawings
00:10:22 to convey the idea of a video
00:10:24 is one of the early visual tools used
00:10:28 during the approval process.
00:10:30 The animatic review is a very early milestone
00:10:35 for the visual storytelling.
00:10:38 But how has the project been developed?
00:10:42 What direction has the Governing Body given
00:10:45 for bringing events in Jesus’ life to the screen?
00:10:50 So first of all, the Governing Body approved the concept
00:10:54 of producing a production like this.
00:10:57 But there were some questions, such as,
00:10:59 How do you do it?
00:11:01 So three options were given to the Governing Body.
00:11:04 The first option
00:11:06 was for us just to have a theatrical stage production
00:11:10 similar to what we’d already done.
00:11:12 The second set of options involved
00:11:17 having a narrator speaking
00:11:19 and just reading the sections of Scripture
00:11:23 and in the background to have acting
00:11:25 but not actually having Jesus speaking
00:11:28 or those involved with Jesus speaking.
00:11:31 And then finally, the third option
00:11:34 —which is, of course, the hardest and involves a lot of work—
00:11:38 is to do a real-life drama.
00:11:42 So we were interested to see
00:11:44 how the Governing Body would feel about this.
00:11:46 And what a joyous time it was to hear the brothers say:
00:11:49 “We want the best for the brotherhood.
00:11:52 “We want them to be able to see
00:11:54 “the power and impact of what Jesus taught.
00:11:58 Yes, we want the third option!”
00:12:00 So then we realized that there’s a lot of work ahead.
00:12:04 It’s easy to think: ‘The inspired text is there.
00:12:08 What’s to write?’
00:12:10 But it’s not as simple as just taking little, half-hour chunks
00:12:13 out of the four Gospel accounts
00:12:15 and throwing them on a script and filming them.
00:12:19 Which Gospel account do you use?
00:12:21 Do you use Matthew’s account? Mark’s? Luke’s?
00:12:24 So, very quickly we saw the need to lay each
00:12:27 of the four Gospel accounts side by side
00:12:31 and decide which account
00:12:34 —in every case, every event—
00:12:36 gives us the fullest picture, the most details.
00:12:39 So even if you can’t say everything that appears in all four accounts,
00:12:44 you use the one to carry the bulk of the story,
00:12:47 and the others provide the rest of the details
00:12:50 that we’ll actually see.
00:12:52 The brothers who help write the dramas
00:12:55 have a tremendous amount of work to do.
00:12:57 But then there are also those who do the research
00:13:00 just to make sure little details are correct,
00:13:03 whether it be the shoes a person has on
00:13:05 or whether he even wears shoes.
00:13:07 When you show something on film,
00:13:10 you are committing yourself.
00:13:12 You are saying that this is the explanation
00:13:16 or, in some cases, the application.
00:13:19 It goes beyond illustration; it’s the explanation.
00:13:22 It’s the way to understand what happened.
00:13:24 And that is what sticks with people’s memories.
00:13:26 So it’s a huge responsibility to get that right.
00:13:30 So our Research Department already has a lot of information.
00:13:34 But doing something like this is yet another step
00:13:38 down the path of being very, very difficult
00:13:41 because there are a lot more questions that come up.
00:13:44 How are we going to depict the Devil?
00:13:46 How do you show Jesus walking on water?
00:13:48 What footwear was allowed in the Soreg?
00:13:51 And what’s a Soreg?
00:13:53 Research is pivotal in this.
00:13:56 So you make a decision about what to depict.
00:14:01 But then there are details when it comes
00:14:04 to not just telling it, not just reading what happened,
00:14:08 but now you have to show what happened.
00:14:11 How do you do that?
00:14:13 If you take something that’s static, like a piece of artwork
00:14:16 that’s well-researched with solid sources,
00:14:18 and now bring it to life, then in many respects,
00:14:21 more research needs to go into this
00:14:24 so that everything is looked at from various angles.
00:14:29 So let me explain the challenge we have with John chapter 6.
00:14:32 If we look at Map 3B in the Appendix section,
00:14:35 just imagine we have the Sea of Galilee here.
00:14:39 Now, according to what it shows us,
00:14:41 we have Magadan here on this side
00:14:43 of the Sea of Galilee,
00:14:46 and up here we have Capernaum.
00:14:49 Now, according to what this tells us,
00:14:52 Jesus performed his miracle
00:14:54 across on this side of the Sea of Galilee,
00:14:57 and then the apostles traveled by boat
00:15:00 to this general area.
00:15:02 Of course, Jesus joined up with them when he walked on the water.
00:15:05 So according to John chapter 6,
00:15:08 Jesus starts to teach the crowd
00:15:10 as he is walking along the seashore.
00:15:13 But by the end of John chapter 6,
00:15:16 we see that Jesus is actually speaking at that time
00:15:20 here in Capernaum.
00:15:22 So the question comes up,
00:15:24 What part of the dialogue
00:15:26 was actually stated here in the synagogue in Capernaum,
00:15:29 and what part was stated
00:15:31 along the seashore as he was walking along?
00:15:34 So we’ll have to do some research into John chapter 6
00:15:38 and see where there is a good break
00:15:40 for us to realize what words
00:15:42 were actually said there in the synagogue.
00:15:44 That’s the challenge.
00:15:46 We need for the friends to be able to watch this video series
00:15:50 and feel they’re actually there.
00:15:52 And what they are seeing is as close to the way
00:15:55 it must have been as we can possibly make it.
00:15:57 And the role of research helps us to ensure that.
00:16:01 With scripts being developed and approved,
00:16:04 the production team continues work
00:16:07 with the visual look and feel of the series.
00:16:11 So when we found out that the project involved
00:16:13 the entirety of Jesus’ ministry,
00:16:15 it was simply overwhelming.
00:16:17 Once we’ve read our script, we go into a phase
00:16:19 where we start working with storyboards.
00:16:22 Storyboards are kind of like a first pass
00:16:25 at what this story might look like.
00:16:28 That’s compiled into what’s called an animatic,
00:16:31 which is a type of video.
00:16:33 So you’ve got a narration,
00:16:35 you’ve got dialogue, and you’ve got music,
00:16:37 but it’s to these cartoon boards.
00:16:39 It’s great because it gets you prepared
00:16:42 so that on set, the challenges don’t just pop up.
00:16:44 You can anticipate them.
00:16:48 Concept art is a communication tool
00:16:50 to help us to get all on the same page.
00:16:54 Concept art helps us to get the mood of it, the lighting,
00:16:59 and to experience it maybe from a perspective
00:17:01 that we hadn’t thought of before.
00:17:04 The story of Jesus’ ministry isn’t just dry, cold facts.
00:17:08 It’s actually human stories.
00:17:10 When we see how different people responded and reacted to Jesus’ ministry
00:17:15 —how they were shaped  and molded by what they experienced—
00:17:17 that’s essentially that character’s arc.
00:17:19 We go in and say:
00:17:21 “OK, where does our character start? How does he grow?
00:17:24 And where is he by the end of this series?”
00:17:29 By seeing his struggles, seeing his challenges,
00:17:31 it makes that character more relatable.
00:17:34 As years of development passed,
00:17:37 the immense scope of this project came into clear focus.
00:17:42 A natural question arose,
00:17:44 Where would we record it?
00:17:48 When we were doing the production of Jonah,
00:17:50 we used parts of southern California.
00:17:52 And we thought that would be a very good location.
00:17:54 So that was proposed to the Governing Body,
00:17:57 and they said, “Thank you very much,
00:18:00 “but we would rather that you use existing Bethel facilities
00:18:04 “that would be available
00:18:05 and that maybe are not being utilized to their full potential.”
00:18:09 We worked with Worldwide Design/Construction,
00:18:12 and they provided a list of some of the branches that had space.
00:18:16 And as we were doing so, it came to our attention
00:18:19 that in Australasia, the printery was about to be phased out.
00:18:25 At the end of 2015,
00:18:28 the printing work was moved to Japan.
00:18:30 The press was then put up for sale.
00:18:32 It sold about three years later.
00:18:34 So now we had this big warehouse space
00:18:36 —just what we needed for a studio.
00:18:39 We were just stunned
00:18:41 to think that such a project could be accomplished here.
00:18:45 But I think we’ve also seen so much evidence
00:18:48 of Jehovah’s blessing on this project
00:18:50 that it’s very clear it’s something he wants.
00:18:53 The temporary accommodations here at the branch
00:18:55 were due for demolition,
00:18:57 and, I mean, like the bulldozers were almost at the gate.
00:19:01 So we were able to stop those bulldozers
00:19:04 and, as a result, we’re currently renovating those residences.
00:19:07 Jehovah’s hand was definitely in that experience.
00:19:10 Without the stopping of that demolition,
00:19:13 we wouldn’t have had enough accommodations  to look after this project.
00:19:18 It was as if Jehovah was dropping this option in our laps
00:19:21 with all the criteria that we needed to do this project.
00:19:25 With the primary location selected,
00:19:28 Production Design helps take a concept
00:19:31 and make it a reality.
00:19:36 Our goal as Production Design is to immerse the audience in the story.
00:19:40 If they have that sense, now they’re paying attention
00:19:44 to what’s being said on screen
00:19:47 —what they can learn, what they can benefit from it.
00:19:51 It’s one thing to design something,
00:19:53 but then to execute that design is another thing.
00:19:56 Even like with the throne room,
00:19:58 this actually is too much work.
00:20:00 We have to simplify it.
00:20:02 Do we need to show three walls?
00:20:04 Can we just get away with building two walls
00:20:06 and have the same effect, the same production quality?
00:20:10 Usually, we design the set, we build a set,
00:20:14 we film the set, and then we tear the set down.
00:20:17 But this project is unique in that we’re not doing that.
00:20:20 These buildings, these structures,
00:20:22 that we’re going to be filming are going to last for years,
00:20:25 and so they had to be built that way.
00:20:28 So how do we combine modern-day building standards to make it last
00:20:33 but still make it look like an old, ancient, building
00:20:36 that was built 2,000 years ago?
00:20:39 We were looking for a certain type of finish —a concrete finish.
00:20:42 Through a website, we found there was a company
00:20:45 over in Perth that was able to achieve this.
00:20:49 And after calling them, we found out they’re brothers.
00:20:53 And those brothers have been able to come over and help us
00:20:55 with their expertise to get the right type of finish.
00:20:59 The support from all those under the Australasia branch territory
00:21:03 has been faith-strengthening.
00:21:07 So one of the biggest needs we probably have at the moment
00:21:09 would be auditioning.
00:21:11 We absolutely need more volunteers for acting.
00:21:15 It’s a unique and new form of sacred service.
00:21:17 It’s something that probably most never thought they would ever do
00:21:21 or be asked to do, but there is definitely a need.
00:21:24 The more that can make themselves available  through this auditioning process
00:21:28 would allow us to have the right people in the roles.
00:21:31 One fundamental principle that underlies
00:21:33 any good acting is empathy.
00:21:36 It’s something that we all learn as Christians.
00:21:37 It’s not about showing the behavior in big ways.
00:21:41 It’s about understanding who the character is,
00:21:43 and then it exudes naturally.
00:21:45 Jehovah’s organization will always train us,
00:21:47 and Jehovah’s spirit will make us ready
00:21:50 for the task that’s ahead of us.
00:21:52 It’s simple training,
00:21:53 but it’s definitely designed to help somebody
00:21:56 to get comfortable in front of a camera,
00:21:59 performing in front of many people
00:22:01 and being able to relax —being able to be themselves.
00:22:04 To see our brothers and sisters offering themselves,
00:22:06 putting themselves out in this way,
00:22:08 is wonderful.
00:22:13 When this project was first discussed,
00:22:15 it felt like it was so far into the future
00:22:18 and almost an impossibility.
00:22:19 It was so big in scope.
00:22:21 But now, it’s actually happening
00:22:24 and you see Jehovah’s blessing on the planning, on the construction,
00:22:28 on the people.
00:22:33 Will there be challenges?
00:22:34 Oh yeah, guaranteed.
00:22:36 But if Jehovah wants something done, that’s what happens.
00:22:40 We have things at the right time,
00:22:42 and that’s what we’ve done.
00:22:44 We’ve advanced now to where we’re able to do it
00:22:46 in such a wonderful way for the whole world.
00:22:48 We are working with the best words
00:22:51 that have ever been spoken on this planet
00:22:54 —words that have power and meaning.
00:22:57 This is such a huge endeavor,
00:23:00 and yet Jehovah has shown us his direction all along.
00:23:04 It needs to be done.
00:23:06 With this project being blessed by Jehovah, that’s what’s going to happen.
00:23:10 The genuine good news according to Jesus
00:23:14 —that’s what we’re going to have.
00:23:18 It’s clear that Jehovah is blessing
00:23:22 this tremendous undertaking.
00:23:25 The Good News According to Jesus
00:23:28 will help all of us to teach the truth about Jesus,
00:23:32 and it will help us to deepen our own appreciation
00:23:36 for his loving sacrifice in behalf of all mankind.
00:23:40 Jesus said as recorded at John 14:13, 14:
00:23:46 “Whatever you ask in my name,
00:23:50 “I will do this,
00:23:52 “so that the Father may be glorified
00:23:54 “in connection with the Son.
00:23:56 “If you ask anything in my name,
00:23:59 I will do it.”
00:24:02 Thus, our sincere prayer
00:24:05 is that this multi-year project
00:24:07 will be a grand success
00:24:10 and will result in the salvation of many more true disciples,
00:24:15 all to the praise of Jehovah’s great name.
00:24:20 Thank you all for your continued prayers and support.
00:24:24 Thank you for encouraging yet others
00:24:26 to support this project with their prayers,
00:24:29 talents, time, and assets.
00:24:32 Thank you to our dear brothers and sisters in Australasia as well
00:24:37 for your willing spirit.
00:24:39 All of us eagerly await what the future holds
00:24:43 for this good work ahead of us.
00:24:47 The prologue to the book “Come Be My Follower”  states this:
00:24:53 “Jehovah sent his only-begotten Son to the earth
00:24:57 “to give his life as a ransom. . . .
00:25:00 “In addition to dying for us,
00:25:02 “that Son showed us how to live.
00:25:06 “With each step he took,
00:25:08 “he kept his integrity
00:25:10 “and brought joy to his Father’s heart.
00:25:14 “Jesus also showed us how to be like his Father.
00:25:18 “The ways and the will of the Father
00:25:21 “found perfect expression
00:25:23 in the words and deeds of the Son.”
00:25:28 If we want to draw closer to Jehovah
00:25:32 and know him fully,
00:25:34 we must continue to learn more about his Son.
00:25:38 May this new video series
00:25:41 help us to grow in love for the Son
00:25:44 and our loving Father, Jehovah.

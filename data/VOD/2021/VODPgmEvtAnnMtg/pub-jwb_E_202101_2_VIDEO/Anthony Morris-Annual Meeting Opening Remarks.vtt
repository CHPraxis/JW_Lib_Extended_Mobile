Annual meetings of the Watch Tower
Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania

00:00:06.652 --> 00:00:08.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been held for many years

00:00:08.654 --> 00:00:12.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in fact, since January 1885.

00:00:12.992 --> 00:00:15.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have been held in different states
in the United States

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, in 1983, in Britain.

00:00:19.623 --> 00:00:22.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This year, 2020, the corporate meeting

00:00:22.585 --> 00:00:25.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is being held by videoconference.

00:00:25.796 --> 00:00:28.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The spiritual program has been recorded

00:00:28.299 --> 00:00:31.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the benefit of the brothers
all over the earth.

00:00:31.427 --> 00:00:35.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a historic annual meeting.

00:00:36.307 --> 00:00:40.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the past, we have had
some historic annual meetings.

00:00:40.686 --> 00:00:42.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:47.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the annual meeting
held on October 2, 1944, in Pittsburgh,

00:00:47.693 --> 00:00:50.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the members of the Pennsylvania corporation

00:00:50.154 --> 00:00:54.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
adopted six resolutions amending its charter.

00:00:54.491 --> 00:00:58.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The charter had provided
that voting shares be issued

00:00:58.203 --> 00:01:02.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to contributors of funds
to the Society’s work,

00:01:02.082 --> 00:01:06.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the third amendment
eliminated that provision.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thereafter, directors of the Society
were to be voted into office

00:01:11.425 --> 00:01:15.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by individuals
who were fully devoted to Jehovah,

00:01:15.638 --> 00:01:19.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
irrespective of the amount of money
that they contributed

00:01:19.683 --> 00:01:22.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to advance the Kingdom work.

00:01:23.145 --> 00:01:27.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the historic annual meeting in 1944,

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a vital question remained.

00:01:30.778 --> 00:01:34.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since the Governing Body
was then closely identified

00:01:34.365 --> 00:01:39.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Pennsylvania corporation’s
seven-member board of directors,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did this mean that the Governing Body

00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:47.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could never be made up
of more than seven anointed Christians?

00:01:48.128 --> 00:01:50.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moreover, since the directors

00:01:50.798 --> 00:01:54.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are elected
by the members of the corporation,

00:01:54.468 --> 00:01:58.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were the corporation members electing
members of the Governing Body

00:01:58.764 --> 00:02:01.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the annual meeting each year?

00:02:02.393 --> 00:02:04.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are the directors and officers

00:02:04.395 --> 00:02:08.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society
of Pennsylvania

00:02:08.524 --> 00:02:10.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the members of the Governing Body

00:02:10.943 --> 00:02:15.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one and the same, or are they different?

00:02:15.656 --> 00:02:18.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These questions were answered years later.

00:02:18.867 --> 00:02:20.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were answered
at the annual meeting held

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:24.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on October 1, 1971

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—another historic annual meeting.

00:02:28.627 --> 00:02:32.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On that occasion, one of the speakers
pointed out

00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:35.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the governing body preceded

00:02:35.217 --> 00:02:39.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society
of Pennsylvania

00:02:39.138 --> 00:02:42.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by hundreds of years.

00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:45.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, despite some who opposed Jehovah

00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:47.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the earthly part of his organization

00:02:47.896 --> 00:02:51.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who claimed there was no governing body
in the first century

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hence saw no need
for a Governing Body today,

00:02:54.862 --> 00:02:59.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a governing body was formed
at Pentecost of 33 C.E.,

00:02:59.283 --> 00:03:01.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than 18 centuries

00:03:01.326 --> 00:03:06.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the Pennsylvania corporation
came into existence.

00:03:07.207 --> 00:03:11.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first, the governing body
consisted of 12 apostles.

00:03:11.837 --> 00:03:14.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Its number was enlarged later,

00:03:14.715 --> 00:03:19.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for “the apostles and older men in Jerusalem”
were taking the lead.

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:22.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now notice what happened later

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here in the Bible book of Acts

00:03:26.268 --> 00:03:28.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in chapter 15.

00:03:28.312 --> 00:03:32.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So other issues had been handled
by the 12 apostles,

00:03:32.191 --> 00:03:35.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now with this circumcision issue

00:03:35.402 --> 00:03:39.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that came up among the congregations,

00:03:39.323 --> 00:03:43.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice what we read here
in verse 2 of Acts 15:

00:03:43.243 --> 00:03:47.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But after quite a bit of dissension
and disputing

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:49.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by Paul and Barnabas with them,

00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:53.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it was arranged for Paul, Barnabas,
and some of the others

00:03:53.837 --> 00:03:56.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to go up to the apostles

00:03:56.548 --> 00:03:59.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and elders in Jerusalem

00:03:59.134 --> 00:04:01.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding this issue.”

00:04:02.137 --> 00:04:06.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the issue was going to be settled
by the first-century governing body.

00:04:06.475 --> 00:04:09.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now it’s larger than the apostles;

00:04:09.561 --> 00:04:13.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it included the elders and the apostles

00:04:13.774 --> 00:04:15.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jerusalem.

00:04:15.818 --> 00:04:17.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what is the benefit

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of following the direction
from the governing body in the first century

00:04:22.157 --> 00:04:24.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, by extension, today?

00:04:24.701 --> 00:04:29.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice that at Acts 16:4, 5,

00:04:29.248 --> 00:04:31.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re carrying the decree there.

00:04:31.416 --> 00:04:34.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it mentions:
“As they traveled on through the cities,

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they would deliver to them for observance

00:04:38.382 --> 00:04:40.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the decrees that had been decided on

00:04:40.467 --> 00:04:44.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by the apostles and the elders
who were in Jerusalem.

00:04:44.972 --> 00:04:46.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[Now notice.]

00:04:46.515 --> 00:04:49.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then, indeed, the congregations

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“continued to be made firm in the faith

00:04:52.437 --> 00:04:56.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to increase in number day by day.”

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that beautiful?

00:04:58.902 --> 00:05:00.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a governing body.

00:05:00.904 --> 00:05:04.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They didn’t have a need for legal entities

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to advance the Kingdom work
in the first century,

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:12.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they did indeed need a governing body.

00:05:13.417 --> 00:05:16.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As long as conditions in this world permit,

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body will make use
of legal entities.

00:05:20.257 --> 00:05:24.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If a legal entity is dissolved
by government decree,

00:05:24.261 --> 00:05:28.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the preaching work will still go on.

00:05:28.056 --> 00:05:31.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even now, in lands
where restrictions are in effect

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and no legal entities are used,

00:05:34.313 --> 00:05:36.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Kingdom message is being proclaimed,

00:05:36.857 --> 00:05:38.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
disciples are being made,

00:05:38.859 --> 00:05:43.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and theocracy’s increase continues.

00:05:43.155 --> 00:05:48.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the midst of this pandemic,
the preaching continues.

00:05:48.118 --> 00:05:51.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many experiences are happening globally.

00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:53.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, one I received and confirmed

00:05:53.665 --> 00:05:56.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from two elders serving at Warwick Bethel,

00:05:56.668 --> 00:05:58.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think you’ll appreciate.

00:05:58.921 --> 00:06:02.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So much is going on
and so many nice experiences.

00:06:02.216 --> 00:06:05.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A health-care system that operates

00:06:05.135 --> 00:06:08.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dozens of hospitals across the United States,

00:06:08.138 --> 00:06:10.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many of them were COVID hot spots,

00:06:10.891 --> 00:06:13.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wanted to publish a video interview

00:06:13.936 --> 00:06:18.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
featuring two frontline health-care workers
in one of the hospitals.

00:06:18.941 --> 00:06:22.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it happened that the two nurses
they chose for the interviews

00:06:22.903 --> 00:06:24.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were our brothers.

00:06:24.947 --> 00:06:28.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were asked to supply
pictures of their families.

00:06:28.158 --> 00:06:31.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the pictures had been taken
before the pandemic

00:06:31.495 --> 00:06:35.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in front of a paradise scene
in one of our Assembly Halls.

00:06:35.165 --> 00:06:38.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the woman coordinating
the video interviews

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
told the brother
that she recognized that scene.

00:06:42.422 --> 00:06:45.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he asked her if she was a Witness.

00:06:45.676 --> 00:06:49.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She replied:
“No, but I studied with the Witnesses,

00:06:49.346 --> 00:06:51.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I know it’s the truth.

00:06:51.598 --> 00:06:55.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can see how close we are to the end.”

00:06:55.727 --> 00:06:59.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brother then told her
that she’d be happy to know

00:06:59.648 --> 00:07:03.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the second nurse
whom she had interviewed the day before

00:07:03.652 --> 00:07:06.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was also a Witness.

00:07:06.113 --> 00:07:10.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then the woman burst into tears.

00:07:10.367 --> 00:07:15.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said it made sense that the two nurses
selected for this interview

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would both be Witnesses.

00:07:18.083 --> 00:07:20.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I can see it in your approach

00:07:20.085 --> 00:07:23.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in the belief
in something bigger than this.”

00:07:23.797 --> 00:07:27.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she said she planned
to resume her Bible study.

00:07:27.592 --> 00:07:32.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we pray for this woman
and all the wonderful experiences happening

00:07:32.597 --> 00:07:36.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the preaching goes on
during this pandemic.

00:07:36.435 --> 00:07:39.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is all happening
because Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:07:39.855 --> 00:07:42.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
plant and water

00:07:42.232 --> 00:07:45.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “God [keeps] making it grow.”

00:07:45.152 --> 00:07:49.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All glory goes to Jehovah.

00:07:49.323 --> 00:07:52.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At this meeting, as was pointed out last year

00:07:52.784 --> 00:07:55.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the announcement
about the Ramapo project,

00:07:55.871 --> 00:08:00.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will learn that the faithful slave
is not slowing down.

00:08:00.334 --> 00:08:03.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have more work to do until Jehovah says

00:08:03.712 --> 00:08:07.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the preaching work is finished.

00:08:07.924 --> 00:08:10.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we look to the future, we are confident

00:08:10.218 --> 00:08:14.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will care for the spiritual
and material needs of his people.

00:08:14.848 --> 00:08:18.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He and his Son, Jesus Christ,
will continue to provide

00:08:18.018 --> 00:08:21.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the heavenly direction and support needed

00:08:21.104 --> 00:08:23.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to complete the Kingdom preaching work.

00:08:23.982 --> 00:08:26.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

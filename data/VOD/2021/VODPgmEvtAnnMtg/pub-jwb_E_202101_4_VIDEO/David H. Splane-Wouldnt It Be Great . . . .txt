00:00:02 The yeartext for 2020 was about the preaching work:
00:00:06 “Go . . . make disciples . . . , baptizing them.”
00:00:11 Now, in harmony with that theme, the Governing Body directed
00:00:15 that a number of study articles should be prepared
00:00:17 for the study edition of The Watchtower
00:00:19 about the ministry and particularly about conducting Bible studies.
00:00:25 Then at the regional convention this summer,
00:00:28 why, almost the entirety of Saturday
00:00:31 was dedicated to the disciple-making work.
00:00:33 Why?
00:00:35 We don’t just want to report Bible studies;
00:00:39 we want to make disciples.
00:00:41 That’s what Jesus told us to do:
00:00:44 “Go . . . make disciples . . . ,
00:00:46 baptizing them.”
00:00:48 Now, when it comes to reporting Bible studies, we’re doing very well.
00:00:55 Worldwide, we’re reporting about ten million Bible studies.
00:01:00 And when you think of it, in many cases,
00:01:02 more than one person is sitting in on that study.
00:01:05 So it could be that between 12 and 15 million people
00:01:09 are studying the Bible with us.
00:01:12 But now, what about the “make disciples” part of it?
00:01:16 Well, every year, between 200 and 300 thousand people
00:01:21 are baptized.
00:01:23 So you can see that the “make disciples” part
00:01:25 is lagging behind the reporting Bible studies part.
00:01:30 Now, this trend has been a concern of the Governing Body for a number of years.
00:01:35 And we wondered,
00:01:37 ‘Why is it that so many people are not taking a stand for the truth?’
00:01:44 You can probably think of a number of reasons yourself.
00:01:47 Some people, for example, are quite happy to learn what the Bible teaches,
00:01:52 but they’re not willing to act on what the Bible teaches.
00:01:56 They’re not willing to make drastic changes in their life.
00:02:00 Some may have studied through a whole book or maybe two,
00:02:04 but they haven’t been to a single meeting
00:02:07 —maybe one, maybe the Memorial once.
00:02:11 Well, they make us think of something
00:02:16 that Jehovah told the Israelites
00:02:20 back in the days of Ezekiel.
00:02:22 I’d like you to turn to Ezekiel chapter 33,
00:02:26 and we’re going to read verse 32.
00:02:29 Now, this was a description of the Israelites in Ezekiel’s day,
00:02:32 but I think you’ll find that the description fits pretty well
00:02:36 a few of our Bible students.
00:02:39 Ezekiel chapter 33 (I’ll give you a moment),
00:02:42 and we’re going to read verse 32:
00:02:47 “Look! You are to them like a romantic love song,
00:02:52 “sung with a beautiful voice
00:02:54 “and skillfully played on a stringed instrument.
00:02:56 “[But then notice this.]
00:02:59 “They will hear your words,
00:03:01 but no one will act on them.”
00:03:05 Doesn’t that describe some of our Bible students?
00:03:10 Or maybe the study isn’t regular; maybe it isn’t consistent.
00:03:15 Maybe the student often cancels
00:03:17 or maybe the publisher often cancels.
00:03:21 Well, if a study isn’t regular,
00:03:23 it’s pretty hard for the person to make progress, isn’t it?
00:03:26 And in many cases, kindhearted publishers
00:03:31 just can’t bring themselves to stop the study
00:03:34 when no progress is being made.
00:03:36 Or they may say: ‘If I stop the study, I won’t have a study.
00:03:41 I like having a Bible study.’
00:03:46 Well, we’re talking about progressive Bible studies, and that’s a challenge.
00:03:51 It’s not easy to conduct a progressive Bible study.
00:03:55 There are so many factors to consider.
00:03:58 For example: ‘How early do I bring in prayer?
00:04:02 ‘How do I direct interest to the organization?
00:04:05 ‘How early should I mention the meetings?
00:04:08 And what do I do if my Bible student doesn’t show up at the meeting?’
00:04:13 What about opposition?
00:04:15 That can be tricky.
00:04:17 Bring it up too soon, and you might scare him off.
00:04:21 Wait too long, and it may be too late.
00:04:24 And what about the ministry?
00:04:27 ‘How do I encourage my Bible student
00:04:30 ‘to share what he is learning with others?
00:04:33 ‘These are a lot of challenges,
00:04:36 ‘and don’t even mention helping my Bible student
00:04:39 to break a bad habit like smoking.’
00:04:42 Wouldn’t it be great if we could get some help
00:04:45 with some of these things?
00:04:47 Here’s more food for thought:
00:04:49 ‘How do I make sure that the material
00:04:52 ‘is really touching the student’s heart?
00:04:55 ‘I want that student to love Jehovah, to get to know Jehovah.
00:04:59 ‘I want him to have a warm personal relationship
00:05:02 ‘with Jehovah so that no one
00:05:05 ‘—neither the boss nor his relatives nor his mate nor his neighbor—
00:05:10 will be allowed to come between my student and Jehovah God.’
00:05:16 Here’s another thing for conducting a Bible study:
00:05:19 We want to focus on the Scriptures.
00:05:21 Jesus said: “The seed is the word of God.”
00:05:25 ‘So, now, how do I draw my student out
00:05:28 ‘as to his feelings about this scripture?
00:05:31 ‘Maybe he understands what the scripture says,
00:05:34 but how does he feel about what he is learning?’
00:05:38 Wouldn’t it be great
00:05:40 if some of those questions were prepared for us?
00:05:43 Bible students also have challenges in their personal life.
00:05:48 Wouldn’t it be great if we could bring someone
00:05:50 on our study who has gone through a similar situation as the students?
00:05:54 who understands what the student is going through?
00:05:57 That would really take the pressure off, wouldn’t it?
00:05:59 And how can you evaluate the progress of the student?
00:06:03 ‘How do I know if the student is steadily working
00:06:07 ‘toward becoming an unbaptized publisher
00:06:10 and then getting baptized?’
00:06:12 Here’s another thing:
00:06:15 One of the reasons why it takes so long for some to make progress
00:06:18 is that there are two books and a brochure to go through.
00:06:23 That’s a lot of reading.
00:06:24 And when you think of it, a lot of our students
00:06:26 have never opened a book since they left school.
00:06:29 So for them, this is a big change.
00:06:32 Some get baptized before they’ve covered the second book,
00:06:36 and that’s a pity because they’re losing out
00:06:39 on practical information on Christian living
00:06:41 that they really need to have.
00:06:44 And then some of our brothers and sisters
00:06:46 are not even using the Jehovah’s Will  brochure
00:06:50 to direct interest to the organization.
00:06:52 ‘The Jehovah’s Will  brochure? What’s that?’
00:06:55 Exactly!
00:06:57 Wouldn’t it be great if in just one book,
00:07:02 we could cover all of the basic doctrinal matters,
00:07:05 all of the matters about Christian living,
00:07:08 and direct people’s interest to the organization
00:07:12 —in just one book?
00:07:14 That truly would be great.
00:07:16 Well, maybe right now, you’re saying: ‘All right, I understand.
00:07:20 ‘We do need some help with this, but what are you doing about it?’
00:07:24 I’ll tell you.
00:07:26 In April 2018, the Service Committee of the Governing Body
00:07:31 surveyed the branches to find out what teaching methods
00:07:34 were really effective in bringing people along to baptism.
00:07:38 We have to admit that some of the study material and teaching methods
00:07:42 that were used 30 years ago were great for the time,
00:07:46 but they don’t necessarily meet the needs of people today.
00:07:50 Well, they got some good answers in.
00:07:52 And based on the answers, early in 2019, a team of brothers
00:07:57 —there were writers and there were designers and consultants—
00:08:00 they got together to investigate whether we could improve
00:08:04 on the tools that we’re using.
00:08:06 And they came up with a new method
00:08:09 for conducting studies.
00:08:12 Now, let’s stop here and be very clear.
00:08:16 We deeply appreciate all of the study material
00:08:19 that we’ve had over the years.
00:08:21 It’s always been great for the times.
00:08:23 Now, maybe like me, you cut your teeth on “Let God Be True,”
00:08:28 “This Means Everlasting Life,”
00:08:30 “The Truth Shall Make You Free,” —those books were just perfect
00:08:34 for the period just after World War II.
00:08:37 And then we know that the Live Forever  book
00:08:39 was a real favorite with many.
00:08:42 Now, it wasn’t the “Study Forever” book; it was the Live Forever  book.
00:08:47 But some took an awful long time to complete their study in that book.
00:08:52 And, of course, we’ve all appreciated
00:08:54 the Teach Us  book and the Remain in God’s Love  book.
00:08:58 All of this material has been very, very good.
00:09:02 But times change, and people’s needs change as well.
00:09:07 We’re living in a visual society,
00:09:09 and people learn less
00:09:11  by reading than by observing,
00:09:14 by watching, and by discussion.
00:09:17 So, what are we saying?
00:09:21 Are you ready?
00:09:24 Today, the Governing Body is happy to announce
00:09:28 that a brand new publication for conducting Bible studies
00:09:32 will soon be made available in printed form and in electronic form.
00:09:38 Would you like to know the title?
00:09:39 It’s a good one.
00:09:41 Enjoy Life Forever!
00:09:44 —An Interactive Bible Course.
00:09:53 The title is taken from Psalm 22:26:
00:09:57 “Those seeking Jehovah will praise him.
00:10:01 May you enjoy life forever.”
00:10:04 Isn’t that nice?
00:10:06 Isn’t that a nice text?
00:10:08 How was the course put together?
00:10:11 Well, the branches sent in all of their comments,
00:10:14 and they were good comments.
00:10:16 And then the writers got busy,
00:10:19 and they analyzed the comments
00:10:21 that were sent in by the branches.
00:10:25 And on the basis of those comments,
00:10:27 three sample lessons were prepared.
00:10:30 Now, the lessons look good on paper, but would they work in the field?
00:10:34 To find out, those lessons were sent
00:10:37 to 97 different countries
00:10:40 for field-testing,
00:10:42 and the results were very encouraging.
00:10:45 So all 60 lessons in the book
00:10:50 were sent to the field for testing.
00:10:56 Now, the question may come up: ‘Who are the testers?
00:10:59 ‘Did you get all the circuit overseers,
00:11:02 ‘the missionaries, the special pioneers together
00:11:04 and have them test the material?’
00:11:07 Well, there were some of those,
00:11:09 but not all were circuit overseers,
00:11:12 not all were missionaries, or special pioneers.
00:11:15 So a wide variety of brothers and sisters were used in this test.
00:11:19 Some were quite new in the truth,
00:11:21 and others had been in the truth for quite some time.
00:11:25 The result is the publication
00:11:28 that will soon be made available.
00:11:31 Now, what’s different about this course?
00:11:34 I’m not going to go into much detail
00:11:36 because Brother Jackson is going to handle that.
00:11:38 But here are a couple of points:
00:11:40 First of all, very important,
00:11:42 all of the information
00:11:45 that’s required to answer the 60 questions
00:11:48 for baptismal candidates is covered thoroughly in this book.
00:11:53 All of the information needed
00:11:56 —that is, Bible topics, Christian living topics,
00:12:01 directing interest to the organization—
00:12:03 is all thoroughly covered in just one book.
00:12:07 You do not, repeat,
00:12:10 you do not have to study a second book.
00:12:15 What’s the format like?
00:12:17 Well, it’s somewhat similar to the midweek Meeting Workbook,
00:12:21 and you’ll see that it’s organized in a way
00:12:23 that there can be a free discussion
00:12:26 between the student and the conductor.
00:12:28 In fact, in each lesson, there are just a few introductory paragraphs
00:12:34 that the student is invited to read ahead of time.
00:12:37 But most of the lesson will be handled
00:12:40 between the conductor and the student.
00:12:42 It will be a discussion.
00:12:45 The material will focus on the Scriptures.
00:12:49 A typical sentence might read:
00:12:51 ‘Read this scripture; then answer these questions.’
00:12:56 And the questions are provided.
00:12:58 The electronic copy of the book
00:13:01 has links to some 200 different videos
00:13:04 that you can view during the study.
00:13:07 Remember the problem of having somebody along on the study
00:13:12 who has gone through the same problems as the student has?
00:13:15 Problem solved.
00:13:17 You just look up a video interview and play that for the student.
00:13:22 And no doubt, he will glean a great deal of benefit from it.
00:13:26 At regular intervals,
00:13:28 tactful reference is made to sharing the truth with others.
00:13:32 A typical question,
00:13:34 ‘How would you explain what you just learned to a friend?’
00:13:38 At the end of every lesson,
00:13:41 the student is given a goal that he can work toward.
00:13:44 And that way, it will help him to evaluate his progress.
00:13:48 And Jehovah’s qualities are showcased throughout the book.
00:13:52 We want the student to realize
00:13:54 that Jehovah loves him very much
00:13:56 and that Jehovah’s feelings are influenced,
00:14:00 or affected, by the decisions that the student makes.
00:14:04 And that way, he will cultivate a warm,
00:14:07 personal relationship with Jehovah.
00:14:10 Well, we humans are creatures of habit, aren’t we?
00:14:14 We’ve used the simple question-and-answer method
00:14:18 for many, many years in conducting Bible studies.
00:14:21 And it has met the needs in the past.
00:14:24 But in our communication with the branches,
00:14:26 it has become obvious that something else is needed.
00:14:30 So ask Jehovah to help you to get used to this new method, and use it.
00:14:34 You’ll be glad you did.
00:14:36 We pray that Jehovah will bless our efforts to use this tool.
00:14:41 And wouldn’t it be great if when you use it,
00:14:45 you not only study with people but make disciples of them?

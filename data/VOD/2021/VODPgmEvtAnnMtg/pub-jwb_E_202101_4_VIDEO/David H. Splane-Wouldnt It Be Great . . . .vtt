00:00:02.648 --> 00:00:06.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The yeartext for 2020 was
about the preaching work:

00:00:06.735 --> 00:00:11.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go . . . make disciples . . . ,
baptizing them.”

00:00:11.198 --> 00:00:15.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in harmony with that theme,
the Governing Body directed

00:00:15.077 --> 00:00:17.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a number of study articles
should be prepared

00:00:17.663 --> 00:00:19.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the study edition
of <i>The Watchtower</i>

00:00:19.832 --> 00:00:24.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the ministry and particularly
about conducting Bible studies.

00:00:25.796 --> 00:00:28.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then at the regional convention this summer,

00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:31.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why, almost the entirety of Saturday

00:00:31.135 --> 00:00:33.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was dedicated to the disciple-making work.

00:00:33.304 --> 00:00:35.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:00:35.347 --> 00:00:39.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t just want to report Bible studies;

00:00:39.184 --> 00:00:41.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to make disciples.

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:44.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what Jesus told us to do:

00:00:44.023 --> 00:00:46.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go . . . make disciples . . . ,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
baptizing them.”

00:00:48.903 --> 00:00:53.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when it comes to reporting
Bible studies, we’re doing very well.

00:00:55.326 --> 00:01:00.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Worldwide, we’re reporting
about ten million Bible studies.

00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:02.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you think of it, in many cases,

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:05.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than one person
is sitting in on that study.

00:01:05.419 --> 00:01:09.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it could be
that between 12 and 15 million people

00:01:09.298 --> 00:01:12.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are studying the Bible with us.

00:01:12.092 --> 00:01:16.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now,
what about the “make disciples” part of it?

00:01:16.931 --> 00:01:21.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, every year,
between 200 and 300 thousand people

00:01:21.518 --> 00:01:23.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are baptized.

00:01:23.103 --> 00:01:25.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you can see that the “make disciples” part

00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:30.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is lagging behind
the reporting Bible studies part.

00:01:30.986 --> 00:01:35.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this trend has been a concern
of the Governing Body for a number of years.

00:01:35.824 --> 00:01:37.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we wondered,

00:01:37.493 --> 00:01:42.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why is it that so many people
are not taking a stand for the truth?’

00:01:44.124 --> 00:01:47.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can probably think
of a number of reasons yourself.

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:52.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some people, for example, are quite happy
to learn what the Bible teaches,

00:01:52.007 --> 00:01:56.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they’re not willing
to act on what the Bible teaches.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re not willing
to make drastic changes in their life.

00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:04.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some may have studied
through a whole book or maybe two,

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they haven’t been to a single meeting

00:02:07.773 --> 00:02:11.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maybe one, maybe the Memorial once.

00:02:11.944 --> 00:02:16.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, they make us think of something

00:02:16.782 --> 00:02:20.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah told the Israelites

00:02:20.202 --> 00:02:22.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
back in the days of Ezekiel.

00:02:22.413 --> 00:02:26.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like you to turn to Ezekiel chapter 33,

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:29.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read verse 32.

00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:32.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this was a description
of the Israelites in Ezekiel’s day,

00:02:32.715 --> 00:02:36.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I think you’ll find
that the description fits pretty well

00:02:36.176 --> 00:02:39.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a few of our Bible students.

00:02:39.013 --> 00:02:42.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezekiel chapter 33 (I’ll give you a moment),

00:02:42.266 --> 00:02:44.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to read verse 32:

00:02:47.062 --> 00:02:52.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look! You are to them
like a romantic love song,

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“sung with a beautiful voice

00:02:54.236 --> 00:02:56.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and skillfully played
on a stringed instrument.

00:02:56.947 --> 00:02:59.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[But then notice this.]

00:02:59.033 --> 00:03:01.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will hear your words,

00:03:01.994 --> 00:03:05.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but no one will act on them.”

00:03:05.873 --> 00:03:10.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doesn’t that describe some
of our Bible students?

00:03:10.461 --> 00:03:15.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe the study isn’t regular;
maybe it isn’t consistent.

00:03:15.382 --> 00:03:17.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe the student often cancels

00:03:17.384 --> 00:03:21.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or maybe the publisher often cancels.

00:03:21.096 --> 00:03:23.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if a study isn’t regular,

00:03:23.182 --> 00:03:26.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s pretty hard for the person
to make progress, isn’t it?

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in many cases, kindhearted publishers

00:03:31.023 --> 00:03:34.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just can’t bring themselves to stop the study

00:03:34.068 --> 00:03:36.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when no progress is being made.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or they may say:
‘If I stop the study, I won’t have a study.

00:03:41.366 --> 00:03:44.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like having a Bible study.’

00:03:46.288 --> 00:03:51.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’re talking about progressive
Bible studies, and that’s a challenge.

00:03:51.293 --> 00:03:55.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not easy to conduct
a progressive Bible study.

00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:58.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are so many factors to consider.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example: ‘How early do I bring in prayer?

00:04:02.137 --> 00:04:05.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How do I direct interest
to the organization?

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How early should I mention the meetings?

00:04:08.811 --> 00:04:13.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what do I do if my Bible student
doesn’t show up at the meeting?’

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about opposition?

00:04:15.818 --> 00:04:17.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That can be tricky.

00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:21.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bring it up too soon,
and you might scare him off.

00:04:21.448 --> 00:04:24.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wait too long, and it may be too late.

00:04:24.618 --> 00:04:27.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about the ministry?

00:04:27.329 --> 00:04:30.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How do I encourage my Bible student

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:33.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘to share what he is learning with others?

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘These are a lot of challenges,

00:04:36.046 --> 00:04:39.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and don’t even mention
helping my Bible student

00:04:39.883 --> 00:04:42.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to break a bad habit like smoking.’

00:04:42.427 --> 00:04:45.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wouldn’t it be great
if we could get some help

00:04:45.305 --> 00:04:47.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with some of these things?

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:49.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s more food for thought:

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How do I make sure that the material

00:04:52.062 --> 00:04:55.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘is really touching the student’s heart?

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:59.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I want that student to love Jehovah,
to get to know Jehovah.

00:04:59.486 --> 00:05:02.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I want him to have
a warm personal relationship

00:05:02.656 --> 00:05:05.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘with Jehovah so that no one

00:05:05.367 --> 00:05:10.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘—neither the boss nor his relatives
nor his mate nor his neighbor—

00:05:10.414 --> 00:05:14.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be allowed to come
between my student and Jehovah God.’

00:05:16.211 --> 00:05:19.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s another thing
for conducting a Bible study:

00:05:19.006 --> 00:05:21.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to focus on the Scriptures.

00:05:21.967 --> 00:05:25.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said: “The seed is the word of God.”

00:05:25.304 --> 00:05:28.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘So, now, how do I draw my student out

00:05:28.473 --> 00:05:31.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘as to his feelings about this scripture?

00:05:31.852 --> 00:05:34.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Maybe he understands
what the scripture says,

00:05:34.646 --> 00:05:38.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but how does he feel
about what he is learning?’

00:05:38.317 --> 00:05:40.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wouldn’t it be great

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if some of those questions
were prepared for us?

00:05:43.906 --> 00:05:48.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bible students also have challenges
in their personal life.

00:05:48.076 --> 00:05:50.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wouldn’t it be great
if we could bring someone

00:05:50.746 --> 00:05:54.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on our study who has gone through
a similar situation as the students?

00:05:54.458 --> 00:05:57.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who understands
what the student is going through?

00:05:57.336 --> 00:05:59.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That would really take
the pressure off, wouldn’t it?

00:05:59.838 --> 00:06:03.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how can you evaluate
the progress of the student?

00:06:03.634 --> 00:06:07.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How do I know if the student
is steadily working

00:06:07.596 --> 00:06:10.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘toward becoming an unbaptized publisher

00:06:10.098 --> 00:06:12.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then getting baptized?’

00:06:12.935 --> 00:06:15.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s another thing:

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:18.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the reasons why it takes so long
for some to make progress

00:06:18.982 --> 00:06:23.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that there are two books
and a brochure to go through.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a lot of reading.

00:06:24.613 --> 00:06:26.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you think of it,
a lot of our students

00:06:26.698 --> 00:06:29.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have never opened a book
since they left school.

00:06:29.034 --> 00:06:32.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for them, this is a big change.

00:06:32.204 --> 00:06:36.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some get baptized
before they’ve covered the second book,

00:06:36.083 --> 00:06:39.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s a pity because they’re losing out

00:06:39.002 --> 00:06:41.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on practical information on Christian living

00:06:41.672 --> 00:06:44.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they really need to have.

00:06:44.466 --> 00:06:46.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then some of our brothers and sisters

00:06:46.843 --> 00:06:50.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not even using
the <i>Jehovah’s Will </i> brochure

00:06:50.138 --> 00:06:52.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to direct interest to the organization.

00:06:52.975 --> 00:06:55.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘The <i>Jehovah’s Will</i>  brochure?
What’s that?’

00:06:55.435 --> 00:06:57.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exactly!

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:02.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wouldn’t it be great if in just one book,

00:07:02.192 --> 00:07:05.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could cover all
of the basic doctrinal matters,

00:07:05.654 --> 00:07:08.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of the matters about Christian living,

00:07:08.573 --> 00:07:12.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and direct people’s interest
to the organization

00:07:12.369 --> 00:07:14.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in just one book?

00:07:14.413 --> 00:07:16.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That truly would be great.

00:07:16.957 --> 00:07:20.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, maybe right now, you’re saying:
‘All right, I understand.

00:07:20.794 --> 00:07:24.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘We do need some help with this,
but what are you doing about it?’

00:07:24.756 --> 00:07:26.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll tell you.

00:07:26.842 --> 00:07:31.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In April 2018,
the Service Committee of the Governing Body

00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:34.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
surveyed the branches
to find out what teaching methods

00:07:34.516 --> 00:07:38.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were really effective
in bringing people along to baptism.

00:07:38.145 --> 00:07:42.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to admit that some
of the study material and teaching methods

00:07:42.899 --> 00:07:46.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were used 30 years ago
were great for the time,

00:07:46.028 --> 00:07:50.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they don’t necessarily
meet the needs of people today.

00:07:50.157 --> 00:07:52.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, they got some good answers in.

00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:57.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And based on the answers,
early in 2019, a team of brothers

00:07:57.372 --> 00:08:00.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—there were writers and
there were designers and consultants—

00:08:00.667 --> 00:08:04.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they got together to investigate
whether we could improve

00:08:04.087 --> 00:08:06.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the tools that we’re using.

00:08:06.173 --> 00:08:09.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they came up
with a new method

00:08:09.551 --> 00:08:12.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for conducting studies.

00:08:12.387 --> 00:08:16.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s stop here and be very clear.

00:08:16.475 --> 00:08:19.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We deeply appreciate
all of the study material

00:08:19.644 --> 00:08:21.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ve had over the years.

00:08:21.605 --> 00:08:23.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s always been great for the times.

00:08:23.982 --> 00:08:28.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, maybe like me,
you cut your teeth on <i>“Let God Be True,”</i>

00:08:28.653 --> 00:08:30.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“<i>This Means Everlasting Life,”</i>

00:08:30.655 --> 00:08:34.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>“The Truth Shall Make You Free,”</i>
—those books were just perfect

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:37.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the period just after World War II.

00:08:37.037 --> 00:08:39.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we know that the <i>Live Forever </i> book

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:42.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a real favorite with many.

00:08:42.459 --> 00:08:47.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it wasn’t the “Study Forever” book;
it was the <i>Live Forever </i> book.

00:08:47.506 --> 00:08:52.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But some took an awful long time
to complete their study in that book.

00:08:52.094 --> 00:08:54.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, we’ve all appreciated

00:08:54.262 --> 00:08:58.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the <i>Teach Us </i> book
and the <i>Remain in God’s Love</i>  book<i>.</i>

00:08:58.517 --> 00:09:02.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of this material
has been very, very good.

00:09:02.145 --> 00:09:07.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But times change,
and people’s needs change as well.

00:09:07.067 --> 00:09:09.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re living in a visual society,

00:09:09.569 --> 00:09:11.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and people learn less

00:09:11.571 --> 00:09:14.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 by reading than by observing,

00:09:14.825 --> 00:09:17.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by watching, and by discussion.

00:09:17.953 --> 00:09:21.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what are we saying?

00:09:21.415 --> 00:09:23.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you ready?

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, the Governing Body
is happy to announce

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a brand new publication
for conducting Bible studies

00:09:32.968 --> 00:09:38.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will soon be made available
in printed form and in electronic form.

00:09:38.014 --> 00:09:39.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to know the title?

00:09:39.933 --> 00:09:41.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a good one. 

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>

00:09:44.396 --> 00:09:47.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>—An Interactive Bible Course.</i>

00:09:53.655 --> 00:09:57.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The title is taken from Psalm 22:26:

00:09:57.284 --> 00:10:01.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Those seeking Jehovah will praise him.

00:10:01.163 --> 00:10:04.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May you enjoy life forever.”

00:10:04.749 --> 00:10:06.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that nice?

00:10:06.251 --> 00:10:08.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that a nice text?

00:10:08.211 --> 00:10:11.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How was the course put together?

00:10:11.006 --> 00:10:14.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the branches
sent in all of their comments,

00:10:14.217 --> 00:10:16.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were good comments.

00:10:16.261 --> 00:10:19.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then the writers got busy,

00:10:19.431 --> 00:10:21.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they analyzed the comments

00:10:21.433 --> 00:10:25.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were sent in by the branches.

00:10:25.061 --> 00:10:27.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And on the basis of those comments,

00:10:27.189 --> 00:10:30.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
three sample lessons were prepared.

00:10:30.025 --> 00:10:34.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the lessons look good on paper,
but would they work in the field?

00:10:34.863 --> 00:10:37.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To find out, those lessons were sent

00:10:37.741 --> 00:10:40.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to 97 different countries

00:10:40.327 --> 00:10:42.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for field-testing,

00:10:42.412 --> 00:10:45.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the results were very encouraging.

00:10:45.707 --> 00:10:50.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So all 60 lessons in the book

00:10:50.712 --> 00:10:54.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were sent to the field for testing.

00:10:56.092 --> 00:10:59.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the question may come up:
‘Who are the testers?

00:10:59.596 --> 00:11:02.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Did you get all the circuit overseers,

00:11:02.057 --> 00:11:04.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘the missionaries,
the special pioneers together

00:11:04.643 --> 00:11:07.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have them test the material?’

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there were some of those,

00:11:09.022 --> 00:11:12.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but not all were circuit overseers,

00:11:12.317 --> 00:11:15.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not all were missionaries,
or special pioneers.

00:11:15.153 --> 00:11:19.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So a wide variety of brothers
and sisters were used in this test.

00:11:19.866 --> 00:11:21.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some were quite new in the truth,

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:25.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and others had been in the truth
for quite some time.

00:11:25.372 --> 00:11:28.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The result is the publication

00:11:28.667 --> 00:11:31.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will soon be made available.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what’s different about this course?

00:11:34.256 --> 00:11:36.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not going to go into much detail

00:11:36.341 --> 00:11:38.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Brother Jackson
is going to handle that.

00:11:38.468 --> 00:11:40.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But here are a couple of points:

00:11:40.512 --> 00:11:42.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First of all, very important,

00:11:42.556 --> 00:11:45.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of the information

00:11:45.267 --> 00:11:48.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s required to answer the 60 questions

00:11:48.228 --> 00:11:53.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for baptismal candidates
is covered thoroughly in this book.

00:11:53.191 --> 00:11:56.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of the information needed

00:11:56.861 --> 00:12:01.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is, Bible topics,
Christian living topics,

00:12:01.366 --> 00:12:03.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
directing interest to the organization—

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:07.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is all thoroughly covered in just one book.

00:12:07.956 --> 00:12:10.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You do not, repeat,

00:12:10.208 --> 00:12:15.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you do not have to study a second book.

00:12:15.088 --> 00:12:17.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the format like?

00:12:17.299 --> 00:12:21.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s somewhat similar
to the midweek <i>Meeting Workbook,</i>

00:12:21.052 --> 00:12:23.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’ll see that it’s organized in a way

00:12:23.722 --> 00:12:26.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there can be a free discussion

00:12:26.057 --> 00:12:28.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between the student and the conductor.

00:12:28.977 --> 00:12:34.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, in each lesson,
there are just a few introductory paragraphs

00:12:34.024 --> 00:12:37.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the student is invited
to read ahead of time.

00:12:37.277 --> 00:12:40.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But most of the lesson will be handled

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:42.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between the conductor and the student.

00:12:42.657 --> 00:12:45.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will be a discussion.

00:12:45.702 --> 00:12:49.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The material will focus on the Scriptures.

00:12:49.164 --> 00:12:51.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A typical sentence might read:

00:12:51.666 --> 00:12:56.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Read this scripture;
then answer these questions.’

00:12:56.046 --> 00:12:58.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the questions are provided.

00:12:58.882 --> 00:13:01.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The electronic copy of the book

00:13:01.551 --> 00:13:04.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has links to some 200 different videos

00:13:04.554 --> 00:13:07.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you can view during the study.

00:13:07.807 --> 00:13:12.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember the problem
of having somebody along on the study

00:13:12.103 --> 00:13:15.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who has gone through
the same problems as the student has?

00:13:15.732 --> 00:13:17.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Problem solved.

00:13:17.567 --> 00:13:22.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You just look up a video interview
and play that for the student.

00:13:22.364 --> 00:13:26.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And no doubt, he will glean
a great deal of benefit from it.

00:13:26.701 --> 00:13:28.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At regular intervals,

00:13:28.787 --> 00:13:32.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tactful reference is made
to sharing the truth with others.

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:34.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A typical question,

00:13:34.417 --> 00:13:38.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How would you explain
what you just learned to a friend?’

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:41.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the end of every lesson,

00:13:41.132 --> 00:13:44.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the student is given a goal
that he can work toward.

00:13:44.177 --> 00:13:48.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that way, it will help him
to evaluate his progress.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah’s qualities
are showcased throughout the book.

00:13:52.102 --> 00:13:54.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want the student to realize

00:13:54.396 --> 00:13:56.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah loves him very much

00:13:56.981 --> 00:14:00.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that Jehovah’s feelings are influenced,

00:14:00.443 --> 00:14:04.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or affected, by the decisions
that the student makes.

00:14:04.197 --> 00:14:07.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that way, he will cultivate a warm,

00:14:07.242 --> 00:14:10.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
personal relationship with Jehovah.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:14.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we humans
are creatures of habit, aren’t we?

00:14:14.624 --> 00:14:18.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve used the simple
question-and-answer method

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:21.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for many, many years
in conducting Bible studies.

00:14:21.423 --> 00:14:24.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it has met the needs in the past.

00:14:24.134 --> 00:14:26.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in our communication with the branches,

00:14:26.428 --> 00:14:30.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it has become obvious
that something else is needed.

00:14:30.223 --> 00:14:34.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So ask Jehovah to help you
to get used to this new method, and use it.

00:14:34.728 --> 00:14:36.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll be glad you did.

00:14:36.855 --> 00:14:41.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We pray that Jehovah
will bless our efforts to use this tool.

00:14:41.192 --> 00:14:45.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And wouldn’t it be great if when you use it,

00:14:45.196 --> 00:14:49.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you not only study with people
but make disciples of them?

Jehovah has always given us

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the right tool at the right time

00:00:07.611 --> 00:00:09.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach others.

00:00:10.573 --> 00:00:13.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this new book is no exception.

00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:21.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How is this book organized?

00:00:22.293 --> 00:00:25.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each lesson is divided into three parts.

00:00:26.422 --> 00:00:29.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you use it to conduct a Bible study?

00:00:29.758 --> 00:00:31.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might encourage your student

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to read the first part of a lesson in advance

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:36.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to note the questions in bold

00:00:36.557 --> 00:00:38.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the key scriptures.

00:00:39.643 --> 00:00:42.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Begin each study by reading and discussing

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:44.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the first part together.

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:47.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, consider together

00:00:47.568 --> 00:00:49.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the “Dig Deeper” section.

00:00:50.321 --> 00:00:53.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Begin by reading the introductory statement,

00:00:53.032 --> 00:00:55.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which explains what follows,

00:00:55.117 --> 00:00:57.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take note of the subheadings

00:00:57.286 --> 00:00:59.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that outline the main points.

00:00:59.663 --> 00:01:02.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read the scriptures,

00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:05.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
watch the provided videos together,

00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:07.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then discuss how

00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:08.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the scriptures and videos

00:01:08.631 --> 00:01:10.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
answer the related questions.

00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:14.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Discuss the artwork with the student.

00:01:15.638 --> 00:01:17.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then follow with the questions

00:01:17.306 --> 00:01:19.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found in the “Some People Say” section.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, read the “Summary”

00:01:24.188 --> 00:01:27.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and discuss the “Review” questions.

00:01:27.107 --> 00:01:29.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your student can enter the date

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:31.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the lesson was completed.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each lesson provides

00:01:33.322 --> 00:01:35.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a “Goal” for the student,

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:37.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the “Explore” section

00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:39.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
offers additional content

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that may be useful depending

00:01:40.871 --> 00:01:42.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on your student’s needs and interests.

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:47.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, this tool is very different.

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:49.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why was it designed this way?

00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:50.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a lot like

00:01:50.756 --> 00:01:53.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the teaching used in our theocratic schools.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is very interactive.

00:01:55.552 --> 00:01:57.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the one hand,

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the lessons are written in such a way

00:01:59.556 --> 00:02:03.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to really make the student
think about what he is learning.

00:02:03.936 --> 00:02:06.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This tool has the ability

00:02:06.188 --> 00:02:08.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to involve the Bible student.

00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:10.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It shows them a video,

00:02:10.943 --> 00:02:13.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then they have references
they can look at.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the way that it’s designed involves them.

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:21.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s really going to give them
a good foundation.

00:02:22.496 --> 00:02:26.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand, the teacher can use
the viewpoint questions

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:30.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to draw out how the student really feels

00:02:30.295 --> 00:02:32.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what he’s learning from God’s Word.

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:34.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the most thoroughly

00:02:34.675 --> 00:02:36.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
field-tested publication

00:02:36.427 --> 00:02:38.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have ever produced.

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:40.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From writing the text

00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:42.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to simplifying the text

00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:44.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—polishing it, getting it ready—

00:02:44.601 --> 00:02:47.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it has been produced
so that it can be translated

00:02:47.521 --> 00:02:49.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into many languages

00:02:49.523 --> 00:02:52.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so as to help people everywhere.

00:02:52.484 --> 00:02:55.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, this tool is very different,

00:02:55.863 --> 00:02:57.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but is it effective?

00:02:58.907 --> 00:03:01.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hundreds of publishers in almost 100 lands

00:03:01.243 --> 00:03:03.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tested the lessons.

00:03:03.245 --> 00:03:05.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do they say about it?

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:07.541 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I love the new layout.

00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:10.294 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s current, and it’s intuitive.

00:03:10.294 --> 00:03:13.088 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And the way the Bible truths are presented

00:03:13.088 --> 00:03:16.175 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—it’s very logical and easy to understand.

00:03:16.175 --> 00:03:18.177 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I think it’s going to be a game changer.

00:03:19.094 --> 00:03:21.638 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The “Dig Deeper” section is amazing.

00:03:21.638 --> 00:03:23.640 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It ensures that the teaching

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.018 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
comes directly from the Bible.

00:03:26.018 --> 00:03:28.020 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Because this part of the study

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.897 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
becomes a conversation,

00:03:29.897 --> 00:03:32.232 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the students answer right from their hearts,

00:03:32.232 --> 00:03:34.526 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
which allows me to learn a lot more

00:03:34.526 --> 00:03:36.528 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about how they think and feel.

00:03:36.987 --> 00:03:38.989 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The new method really helps us

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.742 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to convince the mind and reach the heart.

00:03:41.742 --> 00:03:43.577 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Most of all, it helps

00:03:43.577 --> 00:03:45.204 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
both the teacher and the student

00:03:45.204 --> 00:03:46.872 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to focus on the Scriptures

00:03:46.872 --> 00:03:48.874 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
rather than on the study aid.

00:03:48.874 --> 00:03:50.876 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We never heard anybody say

00:03:50.876 --> 00:03:52.294 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“the paragraph says”

00:03:52.294 --> 00:03:54.296 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because when they did answer the question,

00:03:54.296 --> 00:03:55.422 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
they were expressing what

00:03:55.422 --> 00:03:57.424 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
they really believed.

00:03:58.884 --> 00:04:02.096 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The lessons are both logical and concise.

00:04:02.096 --> 00:04:04.807 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The method is highly interactive.

00:04:05.974 --> 00:04:07.976 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The students not only respond

00:04:07.976 --> 00:04:09.311 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in their own words

00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:10.646 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but are also able to come

00:04:10.646 --> 00:04:11.980 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to the correct conclusions

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.565 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
all by themselves.

00:04:15.651 --> 00:04:18.403 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It helps me as the teacher to talk less,

00:04:18.403 --> 00:04:20.114 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and it helps the student

00:04:20.114 --> 00:04:22.449 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to express himself and to think.

00:04:23.617 --> 00:04:25.244 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And the videos elicited comments

00:04:25.244 --> 00:04:27.121 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
(sometimes of even a personal nature)

00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:28.789 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that probably never would’ve come out

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:30.791 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
had it not been for the videos.

00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:32.626 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The aim is to get to know Jehovah,

00:04:32.626 --> 00:04:34.169 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to love Jehovah,

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:35.838 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to learn what his will is for us

00:04:35.838 --> 00:04:37.339 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and to do that will,

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:39.842 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and also to draw close to his organization.

00:04:41.677 --> 00:04:43.679 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I have been in full-time service

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:45.722 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for over 50 years.

00:04:45.722 --> 00:04:48.600 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I conduct several Bible studies.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.979 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
These lessons cannot be compared with others.

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:54.273 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They are more effective and just what

00:04:54.273 --> 00:04:56.275 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we need for our times.

00:04:59.194 --> 00:05:01.572 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It equips them to explain to others

00:05:01.572 --> 00:05:03.574 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
what they have learned.

00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:05.659 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And as a teacher,

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:08.370 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that fills me with so much joy

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.581 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that I am motivated to be zealous

00:05:10.581 --> 00:05:13.250 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and find more new Bible studies.

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:16.378 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We are so excited about this new approach

00:05:16.378 --> 00:05:18.213 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to teaching Bible truths!

00:05:18.213 --> 00:05:19.840 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The main points stand out,

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.466 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the application is clear,

00:05:21.466 --> 00:05:23.302 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and it’s easy to remember.

00:05:23.302 --> 00:05:25.137 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And everybody can benefit from it

00:05:25.137 --> 00:05:26.972 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—from those with little or no education

00:05:26.972 --> 00:05:28.891 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to those who are highly educated.

00:05:28.891 --> 00:05:30.517 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Our students are going to love

00:05:30.517 --> 00:05:31.852 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
this new publication.

00:05:31.852 --> 00:05:33.854 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And we will too, as this will make us

00:05:33.854 --> 00:05:35.606 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
better teachers of God’s Word

00:05:35.606 --> 00:05:37.441 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so as to make more disciples

00:05:37.441 --> 00:05:39.234 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
before the end comes.

00:05:39.234 --> 00:05:41.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how do members of the Governing Body

00:05:41.236 --> 00:05:43.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feel about this innovative approach?

00:05:45.407 --> 00:05:48.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This book has the potential
to draw many honesthearted ones

00:05:48.577 --> 00:05:50.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into Jehovah’s organization

00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:53.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve alongside us in pure worship

00:05:53.248 --> 00:05:55.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and dedicate their lives to Jehovah.

00:05:56.793 --> 00:06:00.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Compared to all the Bible study tools
we’ve used in the past,

00:06:00.464 --> 00:06:02.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is gold.

00:06:02.758 --> 00:06:05.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what it’s all about
—helping that student

00:06:05.385 --> 00:06:08.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
build a close relationship with Jehovah.

00:06:08.222 --> 00:06:10.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And unquestionably,

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:14.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this new publication,
this marvelous gift from Jehovah,

00:06:14.311 --> 00:06:18.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help us accomplish this worthy goal.

00:06:19.983 --> 00:06:24.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We humbly recognize
that whatever tool we use,

00:06:24.112 --> 00:06:26.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only Jehovah can make it grow.

00:06:26.198 --> 00:06:31.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re praying that Jehovah
will grant success to this new tool

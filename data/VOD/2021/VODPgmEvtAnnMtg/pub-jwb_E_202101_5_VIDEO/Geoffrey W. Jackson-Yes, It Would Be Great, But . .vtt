00:00:01.355 --> 00:00:03.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wouldn’t it be great?

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:05.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it would be great.

00:00:05.526 --> 00:00:10.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we have a lot of questions, don’t we?

00:00:10.114 --> 00:00:12.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first question is,

00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:14.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did we hear that correctly

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that not only are we receiving
a new publication

00:00:17.955 --> 00:00:21.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we’re also starting a new method

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of conducting Bible studies?

00:00:24.044 --> 00:00:26.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer is yes.

00:00:26.672 --> 00:00:30.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why is that necessary?

00:00:30.134 --> 00:00:32.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, to answer that question,

00:00:32.636 --> 00:00:37.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s think of a few things
that have changed in recent years.

00:00:37.057 --> 00:00:41.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, think about
the <i>New World Translation</i>

00:00:41.353 --> 00:00:44.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the revision
of the <i>New World Translation.</i>

00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:46.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was that revised

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:49.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the <i>Reference Bible</i>
was no longer any good?

00:00:49.904 --> 00:00:51.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:00:51.947 --> 00:00:54.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We remember the explanation given:

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:59.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that reading skills of people have changed.

00:00:59.038 --> 00:01:02.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No longer do people enjoy reading

00:01:02.458 --> 00:01:04.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and taking that slow journey

00:01:04.627 --> 00:01:07.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to eventually get to a destination.

00:01:07.254 --> 00:01:10.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But rather, in this modern age,
we find that people

00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:14.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are wanting to get
to the destination very quickly.

00:01:14.845 --> 00:01:19.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They want clear, simple explanations
that give them the meaning quickly.

00:01:20.726 --> 00:01:23.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if when the Governing Body
were considering

00:01:23.938 --> 00:01:26.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether or not
to revise the <i>New World Translation</i>

00:01:26.732 --> 00:01:30.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had said, ‘But we can’t do this

00:01:30.486 --> 00:01:34.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘because the brothers and sisters
would have to learn a whole lot 

00:01:34.573 --> 00:01:37.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘of new vocabulary
and all their favorite scriptures

00:01:37.826 --> 00:01:39.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘they’d have to memorize again

00:01:39.828 --> 00:01:42.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and they probably wouldn’t be able
to find those verses

00:01:42.581 --> 00:01:45.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the right page in the Bible.’

00:01:45.626 --> 00:01:50.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the Governing Body didn’t decide that
(not to have the revision).

00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:54.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But rather, we saw how Jehovah blessed

00:01:54.426 --> 00:01:56.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the revision of the <i>New World Translation.</i>

00:01:56.845 --> 00:01:59.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And haven’t we been happy

00:01:59.098 --> 00:02:02.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
using this and getting
the benefits from it?

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:06.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But not only have reading skills changed

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also learning skills,

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:12.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s shown by some of the adjustments

00:02:12.444 --> 00:02:15.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have been made to our midweek meeting.

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we see our midweek meeting
is fast-moving, it’s interesting,

00:02:20.494 --> 00:02:25.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it seems so much easier
to learn things about the Bible.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recently, I was talking to a sister

00:02:28.335 --> 00:02:31.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who has been in the truth for about 65 years,

00:02:31.672 --> 00:02:34.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she said concerning the midweek meeting,

00:02:34.717 --> 00:02:37.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have learned more about the Bible

00:02:37.428 --> 00:02:41.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the last few years
than in the previous 60 years.”

00:02:41.515 --> 00:02:44.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And isn’t that true?

00:02:44.351 --> 00:02:48.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if the Governing Body
when they were considering this change

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had said, ‘Well we can’t make that change

00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:55.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the older brothers and sisters
won’t be able to adapt to it.’

00:02:55.988 --> 00:02:59.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Aren’t we happy that the change was made?

00:02:59.908 --> 00:03:04.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course we are,
because we can see the beautiful benefits

00:03:04.371 --> 00:03:06.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have come from that change.

00:03:08.792 --> 00:03:12.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we think about all these changes
that have occurred,

00:03:12.504 --> 00:03:15.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can see that it fulfills
what Jehovah promised.

00:03:15.924 --> 00:03:19.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you turn with me,
please, to the book of Isaiah

00:03:19.762 --> 00:03:22.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Isaiah chapter 60.

00:03:22.431 --> 00:03:25.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let’s remind ourselves of what is said

00:03:25.768 --> 00:03:28.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the beginning of verse 17.

00:03:28.395 --> 00:03:30.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here Jehovah promises:

00:03:30.898 --> 00:03:34.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Instead of the copper I will bring in gold,

00:03:34.902 --> 00:03:38.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and instead of the iron
I will bring in silver,

00:03:38.697 --> 00:03:41.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“instead of the wood, copper,

00:03:41.325 --> 00:03:44.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and instead of the stones, iron.”

00:03:44.536 --> 00:03:48.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doesn’t this nicely describe the promise

00:03:48.165 --> 00:03:52.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has made to help us
to keep improving

00:03:52.127 --> 00:03:55.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the various things that we’re doing
with preaching the good news

00:03:55.297 --> 00:03:58.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also our spiritual feeding programs?

00:03:58.175 --> 00:04:01.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, things continue to improve.

00:04:01.804 --> 00:04:06.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s also remember how verse 16
in the same chapter starts.

00:04:06.391 --> 00:04:08.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says:

00:04:08.393 --> 00:04:12.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And you will actually drink
the milk of nations.”

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:15.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We probably remember that <i>The Watchtower</i>

00:04:15.984 --> 00:04:19.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has helped us to understand
that this ‘milk of the nations’

00:04:19.154 --> 00:04:21.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
involves all the things
that are being developed,

00:04:21.782 --> 00:04:23.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including modern technology.

00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:26.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah’s people with Jehovah’s blessing

00:04:26.912 --> 00:04:30.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have used many of these modern things

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us with teaching and preaching.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, as Brother Splane said very accurately,

00:04:37.923 --> 00:04:42.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Times change, and people’s needs change.”

00:04:42.594 --> 00:04:44.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s very true.

00:04:44.763 --> 00:04:48.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we’ve seen,
reading skills have changed

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and learning skills have too.

00:04:50.853 --> 00:04:54.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for that reason, over the last few years,

00:04:54.815 --> 00:04:58.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our Bible study tools have changed slightly.

00:04:58.652 --> 00:05:03.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve seen how they’ve become
simpler and easier to use,

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many of us are using videos
along with these publications.

00:05:08.245 --> 00:05:11.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, of course,
sometimes it gets a little complicated

00:05:11.248 --> 00:05:15.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we’re not quite sure
what video to show when.

00:05:15.252 --> 00:05:19.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How refreshing it was
when we saw that the digital version

00:05:19.756 --> 00:05:23.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the <i>Good News </i> brochure
had videos embedded in it!

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:28.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you’re able to tap on the video
and have the right video at the right time

00:05:28.265 --> 00:05:30.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you’re conducting a study.

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:34.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this new publication
takes all of this experience

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:38.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ve gained from trying
to enhance our Bible study tools,

00:05:38.609 --> 00:05:43.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now we have something
that will be very easy to use.

00:05:43.405 --> 00:05:48.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what does the publication look like?

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Splane mentioned
that it had been field-tested.

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:54.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who have already used it

00:05:54.583 --> 00:05:57.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what did they say
about this new publication?

00:05:57.628 --> 00:06:01.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how does the Governing Body feel
about this new publication?

00:06:01.798 --> 00:06:06.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All those questions
are answered in this video.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has always given us

00:06:10.891 --> 00:06:13.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the right tool at the right time

00:06:13.644 --> 00:06:15.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach others.

00:06:16.605 --> 00:06:19.775 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And this new book is no exception.

00:06:25.113 --> 00:06:27.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How is this book organized?

00:06:28.325 --> 00:06:31.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each lesson is divided into three parts.

00:06:32.454 --> 00:06:35.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you use it to conduct a Bible study?

00:06:35.791 --> 00:06:37.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might encourage your student

00:06:37.793 --> 00:06:40.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to read the first part of a lesson in advance

00:06:40.212 --> 00:06:42.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to note the questions in bold

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:44.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the key scriptures.

00:06:45.676 --> 00:06:48.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Begin each study by reading and discussing

00:06:48.512 --> 00:06:50.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the first part together.

00:06:51.515 --> 00:06:53.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, consider together

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the “Dig Deeper” section.

00:06:56.353 --> 00:06:59.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Begin by reading the introductory statement,

00:06:59.064 --> 00:07:01.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which explains what follows,

00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:03.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take note of the subheadings

00:07:03.318 --> 00:07:05.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that outline the main points.

00:07:05.696 --> 00:07:08.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read the scriptures,

00:07:08.573 --> 00:07:11.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
watch the provided videos together,

00:07:11.034 --> 00:07:13.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then discuss how

00:07:13.036 --> 00:07:14.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the scriptures and videos

00:07:14.663 --> 00:07:16.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
answer the related questions.

00:07:17.874 --> 00:07:20.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Discuss the artwork with the student.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then follow with the questions

00:07:23.338 --> 00:07:25.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found in the “Some People Say” section.

00:07:27.592 --> 00:07:30.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, read the “Summary”

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and discuss the “Review” questions.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your student can enter the date

00:07:35.142 --> 00:07:37.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the lesson was completed.

00:07:37.352 --> 00:07:39.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each lesson provides

00:07:39.354 --> 00:07:41.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a “Goal” for the student,

00:07:41.732 --> 00:07:43.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the “Explore” section

00:07:43.734 --> 00:07:45.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
offers additional content

00:07:45.152 --> 00:07:46.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that may be useful depending

00:07:46.903 --> 00:07:48.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on your student’s needs and interests.

00:07:50.032 --> 00:07:53.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, this tool is very different.

00:07:53.201 --> 00:07:55.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why was it designed this way?

00:07:55.203 --> 00:07:56.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a lot like

00:07:56.788 --> 00:07:59.583 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the teaching used in our theocratic schools.

00:07:59.583 --> 00:08:01.585 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It is very interactive.

00:08:01.585 --> 00:08:03.211 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
On the one hand,

00:08:03.211 --> 00:08:05.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the lessons are written in such a way

00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:09.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to really make the student
think about what he is learning.

00:08:09.968 --> 00:08:12.220 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This tool has the ability

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.973 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to involve the Bible student.

00:08:14.973 --> 00:08:16.975 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It shows them a video,

00:08:16.975 --> 00:08:19.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then they have references
they can look at.

00:08:19.603 --> 00:08:23.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the way that it’s designed involves them.

00:08:23.565 --> 00:08:27.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s really going to give them
a good foundation.

00:08:28.528 --> 00:08:32.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand, the teacher can use
the viewpoint questions

00:08:32.366 --> 00:08:36.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to draw out how the student really feels

00:08:36.328 --> 00:08:38.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what he’s learning from God’s Word.

00:08:39.581 --> 00:08:40.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the most thoroughly

00:08:40.707 --> 00:08:42.459 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
field-tested publication

00:08:42.459 --> 00:08:44.461 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we have ever produced.

00:08:44.461 --> 00:08:46.463 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
From writing the text

00:08:46.463 --> 00:08:48.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to simplifying the text

00:08:48.465 --> 00:08:50.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—polishing it, getting it ready—

00:08:50.634 --> 00:08:53.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it has been produced
so that it can be translated

00:08:53.553 --> 00:08:55.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into many languages

00:08:55.555 --> 00:08:58.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so as to help people everywhere.

00:08:58.517 --> 00:09:01.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, this tool is very different,

00:09:01.895 --> 00:09:03.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but is it effective?

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hundreds of publishers in almost 100 lands

00:09:07.275 --> 00:09:09.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tested the lessons.

00:09:09.277 --> 00:09:11.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do they say about it?

00:09:11.571 --> 00:09:13.573 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I love the new layout.

00:09:13.573 --> 00:09:16.326 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s current, and it’s intuitive.

00:09:16.326 --> 00:09:19.121 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And the way the Bible truths are presented

00:09:19.121 --> 00:09:22.207 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—it’s very logical and easy to understand.

00:09:22.207 --> 00:09:24.209 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I think it’s going to be a game changer.

00:09:25.127 --> 00:09:27.671 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The “Dig Deeper” section is amazing.

00:09:27.671 --> 00:09:29.673 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It ensures that the teaching

00:09:29.673 --> 00:09:32.050 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
comes directly from the Bible.

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:34.052 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Because this part of the study

00:09:34.052 --> 00:09:35.929 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
becomes a conversation,

00:09:35.929 --> 00:09:38.265 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the students answer right from their hearts,

00:09:38.265 --> 00:09:40.559 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
which allows me to learn a lot more

00:09:40.559 --> 00:09:42.561 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about how they think and feel.

00:09:43.019 --> 00:09:45.021 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The new method really helps us

00:09:45.021 --> 00:09:47.774 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to convince the mind and reach the heart.

00:09:47.774 --> 00:09:49.609 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Most of all, it helps

00:09:49.609 --> 00:09:51.236 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
both the teacher and the student

00:09:51.236 --> 00:09:52.904 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to focus on the Scriptures

00:09:52.904 --> 00:09:54.906 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
rather than on the study aid.

00:09:54.906 --> 00:09:56.908 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We never heard anybody say

00:09:56.908 --> 00:09:58.326 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“the paragraph says”

00:09:58.326 --> 00:10:00.328 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because when they did answer the question,

00:10:00.328 --> 00:10:01.455 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
they were expressing what

00:10:01.455 --> 00:10:03.457 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
they really believed.

00:10:04.916 --> 00:10:08.128 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The lessons are both logical and concise.

00:10:08.128 --> 00:10:10.839 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The method is highly interactive.

00:10:12.007 --> 00:10:14.009 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The students not only respond

00:10:14.009 --> 00:10:15.343 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in their own words

00:10:15.343 --> 00:10:16.678 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but are also able to come

00:10:16.678 --> 00:10:18.013 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to the correct conclusions

00:10:18.013 --> 00:10:19.598 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
all by themselves.

00:10:21.683 --> 00:10:24.436 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It helps me as the teacher to talk less,

00:10:24.436 --> 00:10:26.146 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and it helps the student

00:10:26.146 --> 00:10:28.482 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to express himself and to think.

00:10:29.649 --> 00:10:31.276 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And the videos elicited comments

00:10:31.276 --> 00:10:33.153 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
(sometimes of even a personal nature)

00:10:33.153 --> 00:10:34.821 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that probably never would’ve come out

00:10:34.821 --> 00:10:36.823 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
had it not been for the videos.

00:10:36.823 --> 00:10:38.658 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The aim is to get to know Jehovah,

00:10:38.658 --> 00:10:40.202 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to love Jehovah,

00:10:40.202 --> 00:10:41.870 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to learn what his will is for us

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.371 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and to do that will,

00:10:43.371 --> 00:10:45.874 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and also to draw close to his organization.

00:10:47.709 --> 00:10:49.711 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I have been in full-time service

00:10:49.711 --> 00:10:51.755 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for over 50 years.

00:10:51.755 --> 00:10:54.633 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I conduct several Bible studies.

00:10:54.633 --> 00:10:58.011 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
These lessons cannot be compared with others.

00:10:58.011 --> 00:11:00.305 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They are more effective and just what

00:11:00.305 --> 00:11:02.307 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we need for our times.

00:11:05.227 --> 00:11:07.604 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It equips them to explain to others

00:11:07.604 --> 00:11:09.606 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
what they have learned.

00:11:09.606 --> 00:11:11.691 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And as a teacher,

00:11:11.691 --> 00:11:14.402 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that fills me with so much joy

00:11:14.402 --> 00:11:16.613 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that I am motivated to be zealous

00:11:16.613 --> 00:11:19.282 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and find more new Bible studies.

00:11:20.242 --> 00:11:22.410 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We are so excited about this new approach

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.246 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to teaching Bible truths!

00:11:24.246 --> 00:11:25.872 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The main points stand out,

00:11:25.872 --> 00:11:27.499 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the application is clear,

00:11:27.499 --> 00:11:29.334 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and it’s easy to remember.

00:11:29.334 --> 00:11:31.169 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And everybody can benefit from it

00:11:31.169 --> 00:11:33.004 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—from those with little or no education

00:11:33.004 --> 00:11:34.923 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to those who are highly educated.

00:11:34.923 --> 00:11:36.550 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Our students are going to love

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:37.884 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
this new publication.

00:11:37.884 --> 00:11:39.886 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And we will too, as this will make us

00:11:39.886 --> 00:11:41.638 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
better teachers of God’s Word

00:11:41.638 --> 00:11:43.473 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so as to make more disciples

00:11:43.473 --> 00:11:45.267 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
before the end comes.

00:11:45.267 --> 00:11:47.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how do members of the Governing Body

00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:49.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feel about this innovative approach?

00:11:51.439 --> 00:11:54.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This book has the potential
to draw many honesthearted ones

00:11:54.609 --> 00:11:56.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into Jehovah’s organization

00:11:56.611 --> 00:11:59.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve alongside us in pure worship

00:11:59.281 --> 00:12:01.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and dedicate their lives to Jehovah.

00:12:02.826 --> 00:12:06.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Compared to all the Bible study tools
we’ve used in the past,

00:12:06.496 --> 00:12:08.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is gold.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:11.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what it’s all about
—helping that student

00:12:11.418 --> 00:12:14.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
build a close relationship with Jehovah.

00:12:14.254 --> 00:12:16.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And unquestionably,

00:12:16.381 --> 00:12:20.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this new publication,
this marvelous gift from Jehovah,

00:12:20.343 --> 00:12:24.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help us accomplish this worthy goal.

00:12:26.016 --> 00:12:30.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We humbly recognize
that whatever tool we use,

00:12:30.145 --> 00:12:32.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only Jehovah can make it grow.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:37.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re praying that Jehovah
will grant success to this new tool

00:12:37.235 --> 00:12:41.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build and make disciples of Christ.

00:12:41.531 --> 00:12:44.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are not just preachers.

00:12:44.576 --> 00:12:47.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are teachers.

00:12:47.037 --> 00:12:50.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are disciple-makers.

00:12:50.081 --> 00:12:53.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This new book gives us what we need

00:12:53.084 --> 00:12:55.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help others love Jehovah,

00:12:55.045 --> 00:12:57.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
follow Christ,

00:12:57.005 --> 00:12:59.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
get baptized,

00:12:59.382 --> 00:13:03.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>

00:13:06.348 --> 00:13:09.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a fantastic new publication!

00:13:09.893 --> 00:13:13.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure all of us
are looking forward to using it.

00:13:13.355 --> 00:13:16.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you may be thinking:

00:13:16.566 --> 00:13:20.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How big is it?
How many pages are there?’

00:13:20.195 --> 00:13:24.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there are 256 pages,

00:13:24.282 --> 00:13:27.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there are 60 lessons.

00:13:27.327 --> 00:13:29.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you may be thinking:

00:13:29.871 --> 00:13:33.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Will that be overwhelming to many people

00:13:33.041 --> 00:13:36.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘when we show them this new publication?

00:13:36.461 --> 00:13:40.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Many of our Bible studies that we start

00:13:40.423 --> 00:13:45.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘do lessons 1 and 2, and then by 3,
perhaps they stop studying.

00:13:45.428 --> 00:13:48.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘So if we’re using a large publication,

00:13:48.264 --> 00:13:51.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘could it be that it would be
a waste of a publication

00:13:51.351 --> 00:13:55.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘if someone isn’t going to continue to study?

00:13:55.021 --> 00:13:59.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Wouldn’t it be great
if we also had something else

00:13:59.067 --> 00:14:02.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would introduce this new study system?’

00:14:02.612 --> 00:14:06.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s exactly
what we’re happy to announce:

00:14:06.032 --> 00:14:09.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the release of a new brochure entitled

00:14:09.119 --> 00:14:14.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Enjoy Life Forever</i>
<i>—Introductory Bible Lessons.</i>

00:14:14.124 --> 00:14:18.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this new brochure contains within it

00:14:18.753 --> 00:14:23.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the first three lessons
of the new publication.

00:14:23.383 --> 00:14:26.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you look at the back of this brochure,

00:14:26.636 --> 00:14:31.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll notice that it’s designed similarly
to the design of our tracts.

00:14:31.641 --> 00:14:36.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has the questions:
“Is it possible to enjoy life forever?

00:14:36.396 --> 00:14:41.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you say yes? no? maybe?”

00:14:41.109 --> 00:14:43.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The explanation that’s given below,

00:14:43.862 --> 00:14:46.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with the scriptures, helps us then

00:14:46.406 --> 00:14:50.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to direct the attention
to the first lesson in the brochure.

00:14:50.452 --> 00:14:55.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

What a wonderful way
to introduce this new publication!

00:15:09.429 --> 00:15:13.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So once we’ve gone through the brochure
and finished the three lessons,

00:15:13.099 --> 00:15:16.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if someone shows
that they really want to continue

00:15:16.144 --> 00:15:19.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their Bible study,
then we introduce them

00:15:19.063 --> 00:15:23.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the larger publication
and start at lesson 4.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!
That’s so exciting, isn’t it?

00:15:26.571 --> 00:15:28.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will be very easy to use this

00:15:28.907 --> 00:15:31.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also to use the electronic version,

00:15:31.868 --> 00:15:35.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which has been developed
at the same time as the printed version.

00:15:35.955 --> 00:15:38.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the electronic version in <i>JW Library</i>®,

00:15:38.792 --> 00:15:42.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll be able to just tap the link
and it will take you to the videos

00:15:42.921 --> 00:15:46.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to the verses
or to the reference material.

00:15:46.883 --> 00:15:49.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that exciting?

00:15:49.385 --> 00:15:54.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure all of us are looking forward
to being able to use this new brochure

00:15:54.349 --> 00:15:58.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the new publication
to start Bible studies.

00:15:58.186 --> 00:16:00.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there’s still one question left,

00:16:00.814 --> 00:16:05.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wouldn’t it be great
if we can use these publications

00:16:05.068 --> 00:16:08.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help other persons to become disciples,

00:16:08.154 --> 00:16:11.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yes, and to enjoy life forever?

00:00:04.567 --> 00:00:07.570 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Right now I am serving
in the Central America branch,

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.906 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and I have the opportunity to work
with extraordinary brothers and sisters

00:00:10.906 --> 00:00:14.410 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—both here and in other parts of the world.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.744 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎My name is Rogelio. 

00:00:15.744 --> 00:00:17.079 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I’m part of the Art Department, 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:18.706 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and I’m a digital illustrator.

00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:23.586 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Music really means the world to me.

00:00:23.586 --> 00:00:26.547 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I am Joyce; I’m a pioneer, 

00:00:26.547 --> 00:00:29.091 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and I sing alto in the Bethel chorus.

00:00:32.386 --> 00:00:34.221 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎My name is Lou-Len, 

00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:37.433 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and I serve as a regular pioneer
in a congregation where there’s a need.

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:39.143 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I love doing that.

00:00:39.143 --> 00:00:41.770 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎My life is wonderful.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.524 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Seeing people’s faces light up 
when you teach them God’s name 

00:00:45.524 --> 00:00:47.902 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or when you tell them 
of Jehovah’s promises for us 

00:00:48.986 --> 00:00:51.488 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎fills me with great joy.

00:00:52.406 --> 00:00:53.574 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎My name is Josué Martell.

00:00:53.574 --> 00:00:55.075 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I serve as a regular pioneer

00:00:55.075 --> 00:00:57.119 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and as an elder in the congregation.

00:00:59.038 --> 00:01:01.582 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Ever since I was little,

00:01:01.582 --> 00:01:04.627 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I’ve always loved playing soccer,
and that was my biggest dream.

00:01:04.627 --> 00:01:08.255 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎My goal was to become
a professional soccer player.

00:01:08.255 --> 00:01:11.216 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The truth is, setting goals
was always difficult for me

00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:13.886 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because I always had two passions,

00:01:13.886 --> 00:01:18.057 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘Am I a servant of Jehovah or an artist?’

00:01:18.057 --> 00:01:21.602 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎My goal was to become
the best gymnast in the world.

00:01:21.602 --> 00:01:23.562 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎At that moment,

00:01:23.562 --> 00:01:27.650 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎gymnastics were number one in my life.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.653 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I played at big festivals.

00:01:30.653 --> 00:01:33.405 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Standing ovations

00:01:33.405 --> 00:01:36.158 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—that was amazing.

00:01:36.158 --> 00:01:38.994 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I was surrounded by non-Witnesses

00:01:38.994 --> 00:01:42.414 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎who were using drugs, smoking, and swearing.

00:01:42.414 --> 00:01:46.502 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎My trainer had mapped out
a complete training program

00:01:46.502 --> 00:01:49.838 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎with the Olympics as a goal.

00:01:49.838 --> 00:01:52.049 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This made me feel trapped.

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.594 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I started thinking, 
‘What do I want to do with my life?’ 

00:01:55.594 --> 00:01:59.348 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎More importantly, ‘What does Jehovah want?’

00:01:59.348 --> 00:02:02.685 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When I was studying design,
I was already a regular pioneer.

00:02:02.685 --> 00:02:04.687 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It wasn’t easy for me
to come to the understanding

00:02:04.687 --> 00:02:06.939 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that the one
who really matters is Jehovah.

00:02:07.481 --> 00:02:10.109 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When I was 16 years old, 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:14.530 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎different teams started offering me
high-paying contracts.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.199 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I felt a lot of pressure,
and it was a temptation

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:20.661 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because they would constantly
call me and come to my house.

00:02:20.661 --> 00:02:24.331 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I noticed that when the players
played the sport,

00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:27.501 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎they were happy,
but afterwards they weren’t.

00:02:28.252 --> 00:02:32.006 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎My mother was in the full-time service, 
and I saw her happiness. 

00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:35.718 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That motivated me because I too wanted

00:02:35.718 --> 00:02:38.429 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to experience that lasting happiness.

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:41.056 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I felt a little guilty
when I thought of how much of myself

00:02:41.056 --> 00:02:43.934 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I was giving to design
and art and all of that.

00:02:43.934 --> 00:02:46.687 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So that’s when I made my decision.

00:02:46.687 --> 00:02:50.816 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I decided to leave university
and focus on my service.

00:02:50.816 --> 00:02:54.403 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I realized that for a long time
I hadn’t been growing spiritually.

00:02:54.403 --> 00:02:57.406 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I prayed intensely to Jehovah.

00:02:58.741 --> 00:03:01.326 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I asked: “Do I know you?

00:03:01.326 --> 00:03:06.165 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Do I live the way you would want?”

00:03:06.165 --> 00:03:08.167 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And after that,

00:03:08.167 --> 00:03:11.170 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I stopped performing with non-Witnesses.

00:03:16.216 --> 00:03:18.218 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I prayed to Jehovah.

00:03:18.218 --> 00:03:20.429 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And then, at the convention, 

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:23.348 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we received the DVD Young People Ask
—What Will I Do With My Life? 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.602 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That really was Jehovah’s answer

00:03:26.602 --> 00:03:29.980 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to my prayer.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.982 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In the Bible it says

00:03:31.982 --> 00:03:33.984 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that “the truth will set you free.”

00:03:33.984 --> 00:03:35.986 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That freedom is something
I never used to feel.

00:03:37.905 --> 00:03:41.366 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I love working together
with other sisters in the ministry

00:03:41.366 --> 00:03:44.787 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and seeing how they share
my enthusiasm for making return visits

00:03:44.787 --> 00:03:46.622 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and conducting Bible studies.

00:03:46.622 --> 00:03:49.958 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s just wonderful to see!

00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.086 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎To wake up each day knowing

00:03:52.086 --> 00:03:56.465 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that I am going to do something new
for Jehovah is extraordinary.

00:03:56.465 --> 00:03:59.343 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s an unbelievable blessing;
it’s like living a dream.

00:03:59.343 --> 00:04:02.012 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I feel that I belong to a global organization

00:04:02.012 --> 00:04:05.140 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and we are all going
in the same direction.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.143 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s something really wonderful for me.

00:04:08.143 --> 00:04:11.396 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎To sing for Jehovah
is the most beautiful privilege

00:04:11.396 --> 00:04:13.398 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I could ever imagine.

00:04:13.398 --> 00:04:16.401 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎One of the biggest blessings

00:04:16.401 --> 00:04:18.487 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is that I have a real friendship 
with Jehovah

00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:22.449 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and friendships with my brothers and sisters
—young or old.

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:24.451 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It doesn’t matter.

00:04:25.452 --> 00:04:28.580 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I am really happy 
that when Jehovah looks at me, 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.207 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I feel his approval.

00:04:30.207 --> 00:04:33.085 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That makes me happy.

00:04:33.085 --> 00:04:35.796 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎My trust in Jehovah has grown stronger.

00:04:35.796 --> 00:04:39.508 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The way I communicate with him
continues to improve.

00:04:39.508 --> 00:04:41.885 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And I also love my assignment

00:04:41.885 --> 00:04:45.264 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of being a regular pioneer,
an elder, and being able to support

00:04:45.264 --> 00:04:46.765 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the brothers and sisters.

00:04:46.765 --> 00:04:49.476 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎To continue to be among Jehovah’s people,

00:04:49.476 --> 00:04:51.562 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that’s the joy I was looking for

00:04:51.562 --> 00:04:54.773 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—and I found it!

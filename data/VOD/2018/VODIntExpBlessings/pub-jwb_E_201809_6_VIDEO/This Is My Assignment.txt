00:00:04 ‎Right now I am serving in the Central America branch,
00:00:07 ‎and I have the opportunity to work with extraordinary brothers and sisters
00:00:10 ‎—both here and in other parts of the world.
00:00:14 ‎My name is Rogelio.
00:00:15 ‎I’m part of the Art Department,
00:00:17 ‎and I’m a digital illustrator.
00:00:20 ‎Music really means the world to me.
00:00:23 ‎I am Joyce; I’m a pioneer,
00:00:26 ‎and I sing alto in the Bethel chorus.
00:00:32 ‎My name is Lou-Len,
00:00:34 ‎and I serve as a regular pioneer in a congregation where there’s a need.
00:00:37 ‎I love doing that.
00:00:39 ‎My life is wonderful.
00:00:41 ‎Seeing people’s faces light up  when you teach them God’s name
00:00:45 ‎or when you tell them  of Jehovah’s promises for us
00:00:48 ‎fills me with great joy.
00:00:52 ‎My name is Josué Martell.
00:00:53 ‎I serve as a regular pioneer
00:00:55 ‎and as an elder in the congregation.
00:00:59 ‎Ever since I was little,
00:01:01 ‎I’ve always loved playing soccer, and that was my biggest dream.
00:01:04 ‎My goal was to become a professional soccer player.
00:01:08 ‎The truth is, setting goals was always difficult for me
00:01:11 ‎because I always had two passions,
00:01:13 ‎‘Am I a servant of Jehovah or an artist?’
00:01:18 ‎My goal was to become the best gymnast in the world.
00:01:21 ‎At that moment,
00:01:23 ‎gymnastics were number one in my life.
00:01:27 ‎I played at big festivals.
00:01:30 ‎Standing ovations
00:01:33 ‎—that was amazing.
00:01:36 ‎I was surrounded by non-Witnesses
00:01:38 ‎who were using drugs, smoking, and swearing.
00:01:42 ‎My trainer had mapped out a complete training program
00:01:46 ‎with the Olympics as a goal.
00:01:49 ‎This made me feel trapped.
00:01:52 ‎I started thinking,  ‘What do I want to do with my life?’
00:01:55 ‎More importantly, ‘What does Jehovah want?’
00:01:59 ‎When I was studying design, I was already a regular pioneer.
00:02:02 ‎It wasn’t easy for me to come to the understanding
00:02:04 ‎that the one who really matters is Jehovah.
00:02:07 ‎When I was 16 years old,
00:02:10 ‎different teams started offering me high-paying contracts.
00:02:14 ‎I felt a lot of pressure, and it was a temptation
00:02:17 ‎because they would constantly call me and come to my house.
00:02:20 ‎I noticed that when the players played the sport,
00:02:24 ‎they were happy, but afterwards they weren’t.
00:02:28 ‎My mother was in the full-time service,  and I saw her happiness.
00:02:32 ‎That motivated me because I too wanted
00:02:35 ‎to experience that lasting happiness.
00:02:38 ‎I felt a little guilty when I thought of how much of myself
00:02:41 ‎I was giving to design and art and all of that.
00:02:43 ‎So that’s when I made my decision.
00:02:46 ‎I decided to leave university and focus on my service.
00:02:50 ‎I realized that for a long time I hadn’t been growing spiritually.
00:02:54 ‎I prayed intensely to Jehovah.
00:02:58 ‎I asked: “Do I know you?
00:03:01 ‎Do I live the way you would want?”
00:03:06 ‎And after that,
00:03:08 ‎I stopped performing with non-Witnesses.
00:03:16 ‎I prayed to Jehovah.
00:03:18 ‎And then, at the convention,
00:03:20 ‎we received the DVD Young People Ask —What Will I Do With My Life?
00:03:24 ‎That really was Jehovah’s answer
00:03:26 ‎to my prayer.
00:03:29 ‎In the Bible it says
00:03:31 ‎that “the truth will set you free.”
00:03:33 ‎That freedom is something I never used to feel.
00:03:37 ‎I love working together with other sisters in the ministry
00:03:41 ‎and seeing how they share my enthusiasm for making return visits
00:03:44 ‎and conducting Bible studies.
00:03:46 ‎It’s just wonderful to see!
00:03:49 ‎To wake up each day knowing
00:03:52 ‎that I am going to do something new for Jehovah is extraordinary.
00:03:56 ‎It’s an unbelievable blessing; it’s like living a dream.
00:03:59 ‎I feel that I belong to a global organization
00:04:02 ‎and we are all going in the same direction.
00:04:05 ‎It’s something really wonderful for me.
00:04:08 ‎To sing for Jehovah is the most beautiful privilege
00:04:11 ‎I could ever imagine.
00:04:13 ‎One of the biggest blessings
00:04:16 ‎is that I have a real friendship  with Jehovah
00:04:19 ‎and friendships with my brothers and sisters —young or old.
00:04:22 ‎It doesn’t matter.
00:04:25 ‎I am really happy  that when Jehovah looks at me,
00:04:28 ‎I feel his approval.
00:04:30 ‎That makes me happy.
00:04:33 ‎My trust in Jehovah has grown stronger.
00:04:35 ‎The way I communicate with him continues to improve.
00:04:39 ‎And I also love my assignment
00:04:41 ‎of being a regular pioneer, an elder, and being able to support
00:04:45 ‎the brothers and sisters.
00:04:46 ‎To continue to be among Jehovah’s people,
00:04:49 ‎that’s the joy I was looking for
00:04:51 ‎—and I found it!

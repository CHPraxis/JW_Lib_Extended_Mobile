00:05 My name is Laura.
00:07 I’ve served at Bethel for eight years.
00:09 I’m from a village called Dinnington,
00:11 and I have a twin sister.
00:14 And we were very shy.
00:15 I mean, really;  I can’t stress how shy we were.
00:19 Neither of us dared speak to anyone.
00:21 My nana was  a really big spiritual influence in my life.
00:25 She got really ill,  and she knew she was going to die,
00:28 and she said:  “‘Taste and see that Jehovah is good.’
00:32 “Please promise me you will try
00:35 to put everything into serving Jehovah.”
00:38 That affected me a lot.
00:40 I thought:  ‘This is it. This is my chance.’
00:42 So I went out every Saturday  from that moment on,
00:44 and I got baptized as soon as I could.
00:47 I still couldn’t answer at the meetings  because I was too shy.
00:49 I still struggled to speak  to people in the congregation.
00:52 But in the ministry, I was fine.
00:56 After pioneering five years, I got married.
00:58 We were going to try our best
01:00 to do full-time ministry  for the rest of our lives.
01:03 I really do love Bethel.
01:06 I think there’s a real link  between a good ministry
01:08 and happiness at Bethel.
01:10 So if you love the ministry,  then Bethel is an excellent place.
01:15 For the full eight years,  I’ve been in the laundry.
01:18 It’s a small team  —there are only 40.
01:20 I got to know everyone so well.
01:22 I felt so integrated very quickly.
01:24 They helped me to feel  like I was part of a family.
01:29 Knowing every day
01:30 that here at Bethel  all our time and energy
01:34 goes to serving Jehovah is so satisfying.
01:37 You feel happy at the end of every day,
01:39 even if you’re tired mentally or physically.
01:41 You’ve done everything you can for Jehovah,
01:43 and you can’t beat it, really.

00:04 We live in a beautiful,  quiet town in central Italy,
00:08 between the sea and the mountains.
00:11 We have many friends,  some of whom are good cooks.
00:18 We have been serving for some years  in a Romanian-language congregation,
00:22 and we preach to people who have moved  to Italy to seek a better life.
00:27 When we heard the announcement  about the special campaign,
00:29 we looked at each other  and said, “Let’s go!”
00:36 ‘A large door of activity’  was opening up to us.
00:43 But there was a problem—my job.
00:45 I would need a month’s leave of absence,
00:49 and that would be difficult.
00:51 We prayed, and we did research.
00:53 And during family worship,  we decided that in order to participate,
00:56 I would ask for a one-month leave from work.
00:59 But Jehovah had something else in mind
01:03 that would create  the right circumstances for us.
01:08 When I arrived at work the next day,  I found an unexpected situation.
01:12 Because of the failing economy,
01:14 my boss gave me and some other employees
01:16 a letter of dismissal.
01:18 I was not at all worried.
01:20 I trusted in Jehovah,
01:22 and I knew that this new situation
01:25 would allow me  to participate in the campaign.
01:31 Participating in this campaign  is a dream come true.
01:35 We wanted to participate in 2013,
01:38 but unfortunately things in life  do not always go as we would like.
01:49 We received some truly shocking news.
01:53 My father had been diagnosed  with pancreatic cancer.
01:57 Emotionally, it was not easy.
02:00 The tranquillity  we had dreamed and hoped for
02:03 was almost gone.
02:07 The only thing that could help me  at that moment was
02:11 the hope for what Jehovah promises us.
02:14 In addition to my father’s death,
02:17 I began to experience panic attacks.
02:19 I was afraid of something that didn’t exist
02:26 —afraid of not being able to move on.
02:31 It’s the kind of emotion  that leaves a lump in your throat,
02:33 and you can’t even breathe.
02:36 I realized that only Jehovah
02:38 could help me fill the void that I felt.
02:43 After a family worship,
02:45 Fabio and I decided to turn in  our regular pioneer applications.
02:50 I felt Jehovah at my side,
02:53 embracing and supporting me.
02:55 In the end, they turned out to be  the three most beautiful years of our lives,
03:00 which also allowed us  to participate in this beautiful campaign.
03:06 In Romania, there are  many isolated territories
03:09 that local brothers cannot work  because of the great distances to be covered.
03:18 It is really exciting to reach many people
03:21 by traveling on dirt roads  that are often muddy.
03:34 The people are generous,  hospitable, and genuine.
03:46 They almost always invite us into their homes
03:48 and are willing to talk to us.
03:56 Talking to people who do not know Jehovah
03:59 and who are still very much interested  in doctrinal topics is really exciting.
04:10 Experiencing firsthand  a culture different from ours,
04:13 seeing people who live a more simple life,
04:16 and trying to understand their needs
04:19 is an experience that we will take with us.
04:21 And it will help us  to preach more effectively
04:24 in our assigned  congregation’s territory in Italy.
04:35 Now we are stronger than when we left home.
04:38 This experience has made us  love the ministry even more.
04:45 We look forward to returning  to our home territory with renewed zeal.
04:55 We are certain that Jehovah will guide us  to further service opportunities
04:58 in order to help others know  his wonderful purposes.

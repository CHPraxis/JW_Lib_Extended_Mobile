00:00:02.606 --> 00:00:05.568 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Work constructing 
the new Britain branch offices

00:00:05.568 --> 00:00:07.570 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is well under way. 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.155 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎A theocratic project of this size

00:00:10.155 --> 00:00:12.157 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is no small task;

00:00:12.157 --> 00:00:14.285 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎it involves challenges.

00:00:14.285 --> 00:00:17.288 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What were some of those challenges? 

00:00:17.288 --> 00:00:19.498 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How do those involved feel, 

00:00:19.498 --> 00:00:22.376 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and what could we learn from that?

00:00:22.376 --> 00:00:26.547 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The branch facility is an unusual entity

00:00:26.547 --> 00:00:31.010 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎​—a mixture of volunteers working
and living all on one property. 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.971 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That doesn’t occur very often, if ever.

00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:36.724 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The common thread that people told us​

00:00:36.724 --> 00:00:39.310 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—planning officers or counselors​—

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.062 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when we made inquiries 
about a specific site was,

00:00:42.062 --> 00:00:44.148 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“You will never get a site anywhere in Britain 

00:00:44.148 --> 00:00:46.942 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where you get that combination
in one planning application.”

00:00:46.942 --> 00:00:49.361 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎From a human viewpoint, 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.282 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎it was just a complete conflict of normal criteria.

00:00:55.492 --> 00:00:59.830 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We searched the country far and wide
to try to find a council 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.667 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that was keen to follow the model
that was needed for Bethel.

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:07.296 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Amazingly, after almost three years

00:01:07.296 --> 00:01:09.715 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of searching for suitable properties, 

00:01:09.715 --> 00:01:12.843 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎having looked at over 300 sites, 

00:01:12.843 --> 00:01:16.055 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we only came up with 3 that met the criteria.

00:01:16.055 --> 00:01:19.391 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It was in 2011 
that we looked at a site

00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:21.894 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the Essex area; 
it was a disused hospital.

00:01:21.894 --> 00:01:24.897 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That came to nothing 
because it was developed as residential,

00:01:24.897 --> 00:01:28.859 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but it did eventually introduce us
to the Chelmsford Council.

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:30.778 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And then the planning authorities said, 

00:01:30.778 --> 00:01:31.987 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Well, we can’t help you with that one,

00:01:31.987 --> 00:01:34.782 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but have you thought about this one?”

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.036 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The brothers 
were looking everywhere they could,

00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:42.539 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but this was, in effect, an invisible site. 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.378 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It was a site that we hadn’t even looked at
and wasn’t even on our radar, 

00:01:47.378 --> 00:01:51.382 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎so this is another area where we felt
that Jehovah’s hand was evident.

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.551 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The development on that site
was already approved 

00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:58.305 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎for 69,300 square meters (745,939 sq ft) 

00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:02.434 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and our brief 
was 70,000 square meters (753,474 sq ft).

00:02:02.434 --> 00:02:05.104 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Having looked at so many other sites, 

00:02:05.104 --> 00:02:09.400 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where some doors would open
but others would remain shut, 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.695 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to then come across a property, a site, 

00:02:12.695 --> 00:02:17.074 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where all the doors opened,
you knew this was different.

00:02:17.074 --> 00:02:19.868 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You knew this was the right one.

00:02:22.037 --> 00:02:24.039 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Another aspect of the work

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:26.583 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that was done to secure the site 

00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:30.754 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was that there were a lot 
of peripheral properties, which were strategic

00:02:30.754 --> 00:02:33.799 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and were useful to us in setting up site works 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.219 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and in perhaps removing potential opposition

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:39.596 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to our planning application.

00:02:39.596 --> 00:02:41.682 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For construction reasons, we needed staging; 

00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:44.768 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we needed accommodations; 

00:02:44.768 --> 00:02:47.688 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we needed access points;
we needed a buffer. 

00:02:47.688 --> 00:02:49.398 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Those properties became available 

00:02:49.398 --> 00:02:51.900 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎just where we needed them
and when we needed them.

00:02:52.651 --> 00:02:56.405 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It seemed that every single one
of them had a reason why

00:02:56.405 --> 00:02:58.991 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎they were contemplating selling at that time.

00:02:58.991 --> 00:03:01.410 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So it wasn’t just the branch property itself; 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.788 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎it was all the facilitating properties around it

00:03:04.788 --> 00:03:07.374 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎becoming available at the same time. 

00:03:07.374 --> 00:03:10.502 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Again, it was remarkable
​—unprecedented!

00:03:10.502 --> 00:03:12.713 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎None of them were actually on the market. 

00:03:12.713 --> 00:03:15.716 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I see that too as another evidence
of Jehovah’s blessing.

00:03:17.926 --> 00:03:21.513 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎A principal issue in the negotiation

00:03:21.513 --> 00:03:24.808 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was the issue of contamination.

00:03:24.808 --> 00:03:27.895 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I was stunned 

00:03:27.895 --> 00:03:29.980 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎with the absolute chaos
and mess that it was.

00:03:31.106 --> 00:03:33.150 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So we negotiated

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.403 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a reduction in the purchase price. 

00:03:36.403 --> 00:03:38.697 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The way the negotiations went 

00:03:38.697 --> 00:03:42.910 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was evidence to me of Jehovah’s hand.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.246 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We had a specialist company
do a full survey of the site, 

00:03:46.246 --> 00:03:48.373 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and they commented that there is a barrier 

00:03:48.373 --> 00:03:50.375 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of clay across the whole site. 

00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:51.543 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎If it would have been chalk

00:03:51.543 --> 00:03:53.337 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or limestone or sandstone, 

00:03:53.337 --> 00:03:56.799 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we wouldn’t be able to build
on that property.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.472 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎There were a lot of obstacles to overcome, 

00:04:03.472 --> 00:04:05.307 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and those were overcome little by little. 

00:04:05.307 --> 00:04:07.518 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But we started to see Jehovah’s hand 

00:04:07.518 --> 00:04:12.523 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as seemingly impossible obstacles
began to be removed.

00:04:12.523 --> 00:04:15.734 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Psalm 127:1 says:

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:18.904 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Unless Jehovah builds the house, 

00:04:18.904 --> 00:04:22.908 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎it is in vain 
that [the] builders work hard on it.”

00:04:22.908 --> 00:04:27.246 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Seeing Jehovah’s direction firsthand
through the various phases 

00:04:27.246 --> 00:04:31.208 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎convinces us that the success of this project 

00:04:31.208 --> 00:04:35.295 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is not dependent on favorable circumstances, 

00:04:35.295 --> 00:04:37.297 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the skill of the workers,

00:04:37.297 --> 00:04:41.385 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or even the hard work of those involved. 

00:04:41.385 --> 00:04:46.515 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Building this new branch is only possible
because of Jehovah’s blessing.

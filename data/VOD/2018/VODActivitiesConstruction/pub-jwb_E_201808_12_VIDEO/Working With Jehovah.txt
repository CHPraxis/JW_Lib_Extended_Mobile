00:00:02 ‎Work constructing  the new Britain branch offices
00:00:05 ‎is well under way.
00:00:07 ‎A theocratic project of this size
00:00:10 ‎is no small task;
00:00:12 ‎it involves challenges.
00:00:14 ‎What were some of those challenges?
00:00:17 ‎How do those involved feel,
00:00:19 ‎and what could we learn from that?
00:00:22 ‎The branch facility is an unusual entity
00:00:26 ‎​—a mixture of volunteers working and living all on one property.
00:00:31 ‎That doesn’t occur very often, if ever.
00:00:33 ‎The common thread that people told us​
00:00:36 ‎—planning officers or counselors​—
00:00:39 ‎when we made inquiries  about a specific site was,
00:00:42 ‎“You will never get a site anywhere in Britain
00:00:44 ‎where you get that combination in one planning application.”
00:00:46 ‎From a human viewpoint,
00:00:49 ‎it was just a complete conflict of normal criteria.
00:00:55 ‎We searched the country far and wide to try to find a council
00:00:59 ‎that was keen to follow the model that was needed for Bethel.
00:01:03 ‎Amazingly, after almost three years
00:01:07 ‎of searching for suitable properties,
00:01:09 ‎having looked at over 300 sites,
00:01:12 ‎we only came up with 3 that met the criteria.
00:01:16 ‎It was in 2011  that we looked at a site
00:01:19 ‎in the Essex area;  it was a disused hospital.
00:01:21 ‎That came to nothing  because it was developed as residential,
00:01:24 ‎but it did eventually introduce us to the Chelmsford Council.
00:01:28 ‎And then the planning authorities said,
00:01:30 ‎“Well, we can’t help you with that one,
00:01:31 ‎but have you thought about this one?”
00:01:36 ‎The brothers  were looking everywhere they could,
00:01:39 ‎but this was, in effect, an invisible site.
00:01:42 ‎It was a site that we hadn’t even looked at and wasn’t even on our radar,
00:01:47 ‎so this is another area where we felt that Jehovah’s hand was evident.
00:01:52 ‎The development on that site was already approved
00:01:54 ‎for 69,300 square meters (745,939 sq ft)
00:01:58 ‎and our brief  was 70,000 square meters (753,474 sq ft).
00:02:02 ‎Having looked at so many other sites,
00:02:05 ‎where some doors would open but others would remain shut,
00:02:09 ‎to then come across a property, a site,
00:02:12 ‎where all the doors opened, you knew this was different.
00:02:17 ‎You knew this was the right one.
00:02:22 ‎Another aspect of the work
00:02:24 ‎that was done to secure the site
00:02:26 ‎was that there were a lot  of peripheral properties, which were strategic
00:02:30 ‎and were useful to us in setting up site works
00:02:33 ‎and in perhaps removing potential opposition
00:02:37 ‎to our planning application.
00:02:39 ‎For construction reasons, we needed staging;
00:02:42 ‎we needed accommodations;
00:02:44 ‎we needed access points; we needed a buffer.
00:02:47 ‎Those properties became available
00:02:49 ‎just where we needed them and when we needed them.
00:02:52 ‎It seemed that every single one of them had a reason why
00:02:56 ‎they were contemplating selling at that time.
00:02:58 ‎So it wasn’t just the branch property itself;
00:03:01 ‎it was all the facilitating properties around it
00:03:04 ‎becoming available at the same time.
00:03:07 ‎Again, it was remarkable ​—unprecedented!
00:03:10 ‎None of them were actually on the market.
00:03:12 ‎I see that too as another evidence of Jehovah’s blessing.
00:03:17 ‎A principal issue in the negotiation
00:03:21 ‎was the issue of contamination.
00:03:24 ‎I was stunned
00:03:27 ‎with the absolute chaos and mess that it was.
00:03:31 ‎So we negotiated
00:03:33 ‎a reduction in the purchase price.
00:03:36 ‎The way the negotiations went
00:03:38 ‎was evidence to me of Jehovah’s hand.
00:03:42 ‎We had a specialist company do a full survey of the site,
00:03:46 ‎and they commented that there is a barrier
00:03:48 ‎of clay across the whole site.
00:03:50 ‎If it would have been chalk
00:03:51 ‎or limestone or sandstone,
00:03:53 ‎we wouldn’t be able to build on that property.
00:04:01 ‎There were a lot of obstacles to overcome,
00:04:03 ‎and those were overcome little by little.
00:04:05 ‎But we started to see Jehovah’s hand
00:04:07 ‎as seemingly impossible obstacles began to be removed.
00:04:12 ‎Psalm 127:1 says:
00:04:16 ‎“Unless Jehovah builds the house,
00:04:18 ‎it is in vain  that [the] builders work hard on it.”
00:04:22 ‎Seeing Jehovah’s direction firsthand through the various phases
00:04:27 ‎convinces us that the success of this project
00:04:31 ‎is not dependent on favorable circumstances,
00:04:35 ‎the skill of the workers,
00:04:37 ‎or even the hard work of those involved.
00:04:41 ‎Building this new branch is only possible because of Jehovah’s blessing.

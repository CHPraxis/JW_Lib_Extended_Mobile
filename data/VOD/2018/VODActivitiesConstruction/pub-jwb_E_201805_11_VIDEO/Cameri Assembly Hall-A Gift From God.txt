00:05 All joining in dedicating this Assembly Hall
00:08 to the worship of Jehovah God,
00:10 our grand King,
00:12 and the service of the Messianic King,
00:15 Jesus Christ,
00:17 say, “Yes!”
00:21 All right.  Molto bene!
00:25 On December 3, 2016,
00:28 a new Assembly Hall was dedicated in Cameri,
00:31 in the north of Italy  —some 30 miles (48 km) from Milan.
00:34 The dedication talk was given  by Brother Anthony Morris,
00:39 a member of the Governing Body.
00:40 Almost 4,000 people attended the live event,
00:44 and just under 30,000 brothers  from Piedmont and Lombardy
00:48 were tied in from their Kingdom Halls.
00:51 Over the past 30 years,
00:53 the Assembly Hall  had enabled thousands of brothers
00:56 to enjoy spiritual programs and association.
01:00 However, in recent years a need arose
01:03 to make it more suitable  for the increasing number of publishers.
01:06 So a decision was made
01:08 to tear down the old Assembly Hall  and build a bigger one.
01:11 Before proceeding,
01:13 planning permission for change of use of land
01:16 had to be obtained from the city council.
01:18 Many attempts were made to obtain it.
01:21 In the meantime,  the decision was made to use
01:25 temporary aluminum frame tents  for summer conventions.
01:28 With the help of two engineers,
01:30 an architect, and a surveyor,
01:32 we went back to the city council  for the umpteenth time.
01:36 And this time, the mayor said that we had  the right to proceed with the construction.
01:41 Oh, I will never forget the joy  we felt that day in the month of July
01:45 with that suffocating heat  as we walked out of the office;
01:48 got in the car,  which was parked in the sun
01:51 (we were wearing our ties and jackets);  and thanked Jehovah in prayer.
01:54 After praying, we realized that it was
120 degrees Fahrenheit (49°C) in the car.
02:00 So in 2013,
02:02 the construction work began.
02:05 The first stage of the project
02:07 was carried out by an outside company.
02:11 Later, teams of brothers  and sisters were organized,
02:14 and they devoted their personal time  to this theocratic project.
02:19 Altogether,  there were more than 5,000 volunteers.
02:24 They experienced what Psalm 133:1 says:
02:29 “How good and how pleasant it is
02:32 for brothers to dwell together in unity!”
02:35 The instruction received  from the world headquarters
02:38 was that a light roof  should be built that was inexpensive
02:42 and without pillars so as not to obstruct
02:44 the view of those in the audience.
02:47 After a year of design planning,
02:49 a roof was built with the best beam  weight-to-load capacity ratio.
02:55 Each beam weighs 11 tons
02:57 and has a load capacity of 65 tons.
03:04 One big problem was to make
03:06 the roof’s vertical movement under snow
03:08 compatible with the load-bearing beam  supporting the panels,
03:11 since the hall has a movable partition wall  dividing it into two sections.
03:18 We performed finite element simulations,
03:21 which enabled us to estimate
03:23 the actual movements of the building.
03:25 And we solved the problem by building
03:27 a telescopic structure  that enables the roof to slide,
03:31 as opposed to the load-bearing beam  supporting the panels,
03:34 which is very rigid and almost stationary.
03:40 There are some innovative design details  that make this Assembly Hall unique.
03:47 Another important feature
03:49 of this Assembly Hall
03:50 has to do with the acoustic walls.
03:52 We realized that the shape of the hall
03:54 was not acoustically ideal  for an audience of 4,000 people.
03:59 With the help of consultants,  who are our brothers,
04:03 we figured out how  to alternate sound-absorbing panels
04:06 with sound-reflecting panels,
04:09 which balances the sound in the entire hall.
04:14 Another feature of this hall
04:16 is the movable partition wall,
04:18 which makes it possible
04:19 to have two assemblies simultaneously.
04:21 This is the first wall in the world  that makes it possible
04:24 to have such high-level performance  in terms of quality.
04:30 I am truly amazed.
04:33 And it has made me realize
04:35 that when you get together
04:37 —when you’re united with a common purpose,  sharing strong values and principles—
04:42 great things can be accomplished.
04:45 Such quick payments
04:47 —I had never been asked
04:49 to receive my money before.
04:50 This was the first time
04:52 that others called me to get things paid.
04:56 The hall was empty.
04:57 I walked in and saw it finished.
04:59 I hadn’t seen it like this before.
05:00 I was moved to tears.
05:04 You see, you worked for it;
05:06 you were thinking about it,
05:08 even some sleepless nights;
05:10 and now you see the whole thing finished
05:13 and being put to Jehovah’s honor.
05:15 Yeah, you can’t describe that.
05:18 Brother Morris closed the dedication program
05:21 with an exhortation  based on Ecclesiastes 5:1:
05:26 “Guard your feet whenever you go  to the house of the [true] God;
05:30 and let there be a drawing near to hear.”

00:05.650 --> 00:08.903
All joining in dedicating this Assembly Hall 


00:08.903 --> 00:10.948
to the worship of Jehovah God, 


00:10.948 --> 00:12.991
our grand King, 


00:12.992 --> 00:15.160
and the service of the Messianic King, 


00:15.160 --> 00:17.245
Jesus Christ, 


00:17.245 --> 00:20.000
say, “Yes!” 


00:21.042 --> 00:24.000
All right. 
Molto bene! 


00:25.503 --> 00:28.965
On December 3, 2016, 


00:28.965 --> 00:31.343
a new Assembly Hall was dedicated in Cameri, 


00:31.343 --> 00:34.971
in the north of Italy 
—some 30 miles (48 km) from Milan. 


00:34.972 --> 00:39.017
The dedication talk was given 
by Brother Anthony Morris, 


00:39.017 --> 00:40.685
a member of the Governing Body. 


00:40.685 --> 00:44.105
Almost 4,000 people attended the live event, 


00:44.105 --> 00:48.485
and just under 30,000 brothers 
from Piedmont and Lombardy 


00:48.485 --> 00:51.947
were tied in from their Kingdom Halls. 


00:51.947 --> 00:53.949
Over the past 30 years, 


00:53.948 --> 00:56.826
the Assembly Hall 
had enabled thousands of brothers 


00:56.827 --> 01:00.122
to enjoy spiritual programs and association. 


01:00.122 --> 01:03.292
However, in recent years a need arose 


01:03.292 --> 01:06.212
to make it more suitable 
for the increasing number of publishers. 


01:06.212 --> 01:08.505
So a decision was made 


01:08.505 --> 01:11.258
to tear down the old Assembly Hall 
and build a bigger one. 


01:11.258 --> 01:13.635
Before proceeding, 


01:13.635 --> 01:16.180
planning permission for change of use of land 


01:16.180 --> 01:18.682
had to be obtained from the city council. 


01:18.682 --> 01:21.144
Many attempts were made to obtain it. 


01:21.143 --> 01:25.105
In the meantime, 
the decision was made to use 


01:25.105 --> 01:28.317
temporary aluminum frame tents 
for summer conventions. 


01:28.317 --> 01:30.945
With the help of two engineers, 


01:30.945 --> 01:32.988
an architect, and a surveyor, 


01:32.988 --> 01:36.825
we went back to the city council 
for the umpteenth time. 


01:36.825 --> 01:40.000
And this time, the mayor said that we had 
the right to proceed with the construction. 


01:41.080 --> 01:45.125
Oh, I will never forget the joy 
we felt that day in the month of July 


01:45.125 --> 01:48.837
with that suffocating heat 
as we walked out of the office; 


01:48.837 --> 01:51.049
got in the car, 
which was parked in the sun 


01:51.048 --> 01:54.426
(we were wearing our ties and jackets); 
and thanked Jehovah in prayer. 


01:54.427 --> 01:59.000
After praying, we realized that it was 
120 degrees Fahrenheit (49°C) in the car. 


02:00.190 --> 02:02.225
So in 2013, 


02:02.225 --> 02:05.040
the construction work began. 


02:05.040 --> 02:07.000
The first stage of the project 


02:07.000 --> 02:11.152
was carried out by an outside company. 


02:11.152 --> 02:14.154
Later, teams of brothers 
and sisters were organized, 


02:14.153 --> 02:19.576
and they devoted their personal time 
to this theocratic project. 


02:19.577 --> 02:23.000
Altogether, 
there were more than 5,000 volunteers. 


02:24.232 --> 02:29.670
They experienced what Psalm 133:1 says: 


02:29.670 --> 02:32.297
“How good and how pleasant it is 


02:32.297 --> 02:35.342
for brothers to dwell together in unity!” 


02:35.342 --> 02:38.575
The instruction received 
from the world headquarters 


02:38.575 --> 02:42.412
was that a light roof 
should be built that was inexpensive 


02:42.412 --> 02:44.477
and without pillars so as not to obstruct 


02:44.477 --> 02:47.417
the view of those in the audience. 


02:47.417 --> 02:49.627
After a year of design planning, 


02:49.627 --> 02:54.000
a roof was built with the best beam 
weight-to-load capacity ratio. 


02:55.153 --> 02:57.363
Each beam weighs 11 tons 


02:57.363 --> 03:01.000
and has a load capacity of 65 tons. 


03:04.283 --> 03:06.293
One big problem was to make 


03:06.293 --> 03:08.771
the roof’s vertical movement under snow 


03:08.772 --> 03:11.732
compatible with the load-bearing beam 
supporting the panels, 


03:11.732 --> 03:15.000
since the hall has a movable partition wall 
dividing it into two sections. 


03:18.523 --> 03:21.388
We performed finite element simulations, 


03:21.388 --> 03:23.556
which enabled us to estimate 


03:23.557 --> 03:25.580
the actual movements of the building. 


03:25.580 --> 03:27.582
And we solved the problem by building 


03:27.582 --> 03:31.210
a telescopic structure 
that enables the roof to slide, 


03:31.210 --> 03:34.963
as opposed to the load-bearing beam 
supporting the panels, 


03:34.963 --> 03:38.000
which is very rigid and almost stationary. 


03:40.633 --> 03:46.000
There are some innovative design details 
that make this Assembly Hall unique. 


03:47.365 --> 03:49.075
Another important feature 


03:49.075 --> 03:50.250
of this Assembly Hall 


03:50.250 --> 03:52.460
has to do with the acoustic walls. 


03:52.460 --> 03:54.372
We realized that the shape of the hall 


03:54.372 --> 03:59.690
was not acoustically ideal 
for an audience of 4,000 people. 


03:59.690 --> 04:03.582
With the help of consultants, 
who are our brothers, 


04:03.582 --> 04:06.957
we figured out how 
to alternate sound-absorbing panels 


04:06.957 --> 04:09.399
with sound-reflecting panels, 


04:09.398 --> 04:13.000
which balances the sound in the entire hall. 


04:14.065 --> 04:16.067
Another feature of this hall 


04:16.067 --> 04:18.082
is the movable partition wall, 


04:18.082 --> 04:19.549
which makes it possible 


04:19.548 --> 04:21.781
to have two assemblies simultaneously. 


04:21.782 --> 04:24.367
This is the first wall in the world 
that makes it possible 


04:24.367 --> 04:28.000
to have such high-level performance 
in terms of quality. 


04:30.265 --> 04:33.002
I am truly amazed. 


04:33.002 --> 04:35.004
And it has made me realize 


04:35.003 --> 04:37.401
that when you get together 


04:37.402 --> 04:42.427
—when you’re united with a common purpose, 
sharing strong values and principles— 


04:42.427 --> 04:45.657
great things can be accomplished. 


04:45.657 --> 04:47.765
Such quick payments 


04:47.765 --> 04:49.142
—I had never been asked 


04:49.142 --> 04:50.685
to receive my money before. 


04:50.685 --> 04:52.187
This was the first time 


04:52.187 --> 04:55.000
that others called me to get things paid. 


04:56.150 --> 04:57.358
The hall was empty. 


04:57.358 --> 04:59.193
I walked in and saw it finished. 


04:59.193 --> 05:00.778
I hadn’t seen it like this before. 


05:00.778 --> 05:02.000
I was moved to tears. 


05:04.148 --> 05:06.358
You see, you worked for it; 


05:06.358 --> 05:08.453
you were thinking about it, 


05:08.453 --> 05:10.685
even some sleepless nights; 


05:10.685 --> 05:13.145
and now you see the whole thing finished 


05:13.145 --> 05:15.543
and being put to Jehovah’s honor. 


05:15.543 --> 05:18.233
Yeah, you can’t describe that. 


05:18.233 --> 05:21.861
Brother Morris closed the dedication program 


05:21.862 --> 05:26.137
with an exhortation 
based on Ecclesiastes 5:1: 


05:26.137 --> 05:30.539
“Guard your feet whenever you go 
to the house of the [true] God; 


05:30.538 --> 05:44.886
and let there be a drawing near to hear.”

00:01 Good morning, class!
00:04 As we delve deeper into chapter 4,
00:06 we’re going to see why we know  that evolution is a fact.
00:11 Now, when we think about the word evolution,  what comes to mind?
00:15 Your grades are some  of the highest in the class.
00:18 I have these brochures.
00:20 They’re both really fine schools,  but this one in particular on top
00:24 is the one I would really like  you to consider.
00:28 Rebekah, you’re one of our fastest runners.
00:31 I really want you to consider  trying out for the team.
00:46 I feel so confused.
00:49 I know some things they teach  at school don’t agree with the Bible,
00:53 but sometimes they just seem to make sense.
00:57 Then there’s the pressure to join sports
01:00 and what to do with my future.
01:08 I finally told Mom  some of the challenges I was having.
01:12 She really listened and admitted struggling
01:16 with some of the same issues  when she was younger.
01:20 Then she shared Hebrews 5:13, 14:
01:23 “For everyone  who continues to feed on milk
01:26 “is unacquainted  with the word of righteousness,
01:29 “for he is a young child.
01:31 “But solid food belongs to mature people,
01:35 “to those who through use
01:37 “have their powers of discernment trained
01:39 to distinguish both right and wrong.”
01:42 She said that when her personal study
01:45 went beyond the surface  on questions and issues that bothered her,
01:48 she began to discover  truly meaningful answers
01:52 that built up her faith  and helped her make good decisions.
01:56 It helped her to go  from just feeling it was the truth
01:59 to knowing it.

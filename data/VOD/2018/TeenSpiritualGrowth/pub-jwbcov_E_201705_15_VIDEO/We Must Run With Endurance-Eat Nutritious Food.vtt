00:01.980 --> 00:04.107
Good morning, class! 


00:04.107 --> 00:06.069
As we delve deeper into chapter 4, 


00:06.068 --> 00:11.115
we’re going to see why we know 
that evolution is a fact. 


00:11.115 --> 00:15.827
Now, when we think about the word evolution, 
what comes to mind? 


00:15.827 --> 00:18.955
Your grades are some 
of the highest in the class. 


00:18.955 --> 00:20.958
I have these brochures. 


00:20.958 --> 00:24.126
They’re both really fine schools, 
but this one in particular on top 


00:24.127 --> 00:27.000
is the one I would really like 
you to consider. 


00:28.465 --> 00:31.052
Rebekah, you’re one of our fastest runners. 


00:31.052 --> 00:35.000
I really want you to consider 
trying out for the team. 


00:46.733 --> 00:49.986
I feel so confused. 


00:49.987 --> 00:53.907
I know some things they teach 
at school don’t agree with the Bible, 


00:53.907 --> 00:57.620
but sometimes they just seem to make sense. 


00:57.620 --> 01:00.330
Then there’s the pressure to join sports 


01:00.330 --> 01:04.000
and what to do with my future. 


01:08.255 --> 01:12.635
I finally told Mom 
some of the challenges I was having. 


01:12.635 --> 01:16.305
She really listened and admitted struggling 


01:16.305 --> 01:19.000
with some of the same issues 
when she was younger. 


01:20.475 --> 01:23.853
Then she shared Hebrews 5:13, 14: 


01:23.853 --> 01:26.773
“For everyone 
who continues to feed on milk 


01:26.773 --> 01:29.526
“is unacquainted 
with the word of righteousness, 


01:29.527 --> 01:31.654
“for he is a young child. 


01:31.653 --> 01:35.531
“But solid food belongs to mature people, 


01:35.532 --> 01:37.534
“to those who through use 


01:37.533 --> 01:39.953
“have their powers of discernment trained 


01:39.953 --> 01:42.956
to distinguish both right and wrong.” 


01:42.957 --> 01:45.209
She said that when her personal study 


01:45.208 --> 01:48.878
went beyond the surface 
on questions and issues that bothered her, 


01:48.878 --> 01:52.465
she began to discover 
truly meaningful answers 


01:52.465 --> 01:56.928
that built up her faith 
and helped her make good decisions. 


01:56.928 --> 01:59.931
It helped her to go 
from just feeling it was the truth 


01:59.932 --> 02:31.610
to knowing it.

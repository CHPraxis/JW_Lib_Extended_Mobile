00:01 The theme for this month is
00:03 “In Whom Do You Trust?”
00:06 Do you trust me?
00:08 I hope so.
00:09 All of us want to be trusted.
00:11 Trust is a basic element of everyday life.
00:15 To trust others is a normal reaction.
00:18 Many of us have traveled on a train or a bus.
00:22 Did we worry whether  the conductor or driver
00:25 would bring us safely to our destination?
00:27 Normally, we do not worry.
00:30 We trust an airplane captain to take us safely to our destination.
00:35 We trust that when we enter an elevator,
00:37 it will not crash at the bottom of the shaft,
00:40 but safely take us to the desired floor.
00:44 When we marry, we trust that our partner will remain faithful.
00:49 In many situations in life we need trust.
00:53 What is trust?
00:54 Trust is the “firm belief in the reliability,
00:58 truth, or ability of someone or something.”
01:03 Webster’s dictionary says that it is “confidence”;
01:06 a “reliance [or] resting of the mind on the integrity,
01:10 “veracity, justice, friendship,
01:13 or other sound principle, of another person.”
01:18 Trust is related to confidence,
01:20 belief, faith, and assurance.
01:25 Experiments conducted by Professor Dr. Michael Kosfeld,
01:29 a professor at a university in Frankfurt, Germany,
01:33 led him to the conclusion that trust
01:35 is “a biologically-based part of human nature.”
01:41 Kosfeld discovered that when there is interaction between two people,
01:46 the human brain releases a hormone that stimulates trust.
01:52 “It is, in fact, one of the distinguishing features
01:54 of the human species,” Kosfeld states.
01:59 In everyday life, how discouraged some are if they are not trusted.
02:03 The phrase “Don’t you trust me?”
02:07 is frequently heard with an undertone of sadness or complaint.
02:12 Sometimes children or teenagers ask their parents
02:15 “Don’t you trust me?” when the parents place some restrictions on them,
02:20 perhaps in connection with leisure-time activities.
02:23 Parents do that because they love you young ones
02:27 and want to prevent any spiritual or physical harm befalling you.
02:32 If you cooperate, you will see that parents
02:35 will gradually trust you ever more
02:38 and grant more liberty to you.
02:42 You can prove to them that you are trustworthy.
02:46 In the world,  many people are not trustworthy.
02:49 Since we are living in the time of the end
02:52 and the demons are desperate  and have influenced many people,
02:56 we have to admit that trusting in everybody is not wise.
03:02 Many trusted in religion and were disappointed.
03:05 Others trusted in governments or the United Nations,
03:08 but they were disappointed.
03:10 They trusted political leaders that made all kinds of promises
03:14 but did not keep all of them.
03:16 Some politicians were even exposed as being liars.
03:22 Proverbs 14:15 says:
03:24 “The naive person believes every word,
03:27 but the shrewd one ponders each step.”
03:31 If somebody, even in the truth, promises us big monetary returns
03:36 if we give him money for his planned investment,
03:39 we need to be careful and not believe every word.
03:43 Some that spent their money were in for a disappointment
03:47 when they learned that everything was lost.
03:51 We also should not trust everything we read
03:54 in newspapers or see on television.
03:58 There is another thing we should not trust in—riches.
04:02 Psalm 49:6 speaks about “those who are trusting in their wealth
04:07 and who boast about their great riches.”
04:11 Trusting in riches often leads to disappointment.
04:15 “The one trusting in his riches will fall,”
04:18 says Proverbs 11:28.
04:22 It is not wrong to be rich;  just do not trust in riches.
04:27 Riches are a risk factor.
04:31 Many people today are dishonest and cheat.
04:34 Some business owners have installed
04:36 cameras at the workplace,
04:38 since they do not trust their employees to put in a full day of work.
04:43 They know that some would play video games during work hours.
04:48 But Jehovah created us with the inclination to trust.
04:53 We can especially trust our spiritual brothers.
04:56 True, once in a while such trust is misplaced.
05:00 A few commit serious sins and have to be disfellowshipped.
05:04 But that is rare.
05:08 Jehovah himself is the best example of trusting in others.
05:12 He trusted the Logos to faithfully cooperate
05:15 with him as the “master worker” in creating the universe,
05:20 the earth, and all the living things on earth, including mankind.
05:25 What tremendous trust Jehovah showed in Jesus when He sent him to the earth.
05:31 Jehovah trusted that Jesus would remain faithful
05:34 and redeem mankind  so that His will and purpose with mankind
05:39 and the earth could be accomplished.
05:41 Jehovah trusted him so much that he arranged for prophecies
05:46 to be written that foretold that he would die faithfully.
05:50 This trust on the part of Jehovah was not a risk.
05:54 It was based on the collaboration between the two for aeons of time.
06:01 Think of the prophecy at Psalm 16:10:
06:04 “For you will not leave me in the Grave.”
06:09 Jesus had free will.
06:11 This means that theoretically  he could have sinned.
06:14 If he could not have sinned,
06:17 Satan probably would not have tried three times to tempt Jesus to sin.
06:23 If Jesus could not have sinned,
06:25 why would he be so heavily distressed
06:27 in the garden of Gethsemane that he was sweating blood?
06:31 Why send an angel to comfort and strengthen him
06:34 if he could not sin or fail anyway?
06:39 No question that Jesus felt the unfathomable load
06:43 on his shoulders to remain faithful,
06:47 since not only the salvation of mankind depended on him
06:51 but also the vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty.
06:55 He did not want to disappoint Jehovah.
06:58 Jesus used his own free will
07:01 and was determined to stay loyal.
07:04 How glad we are that he did!
07:09 On the other hand,  Jesus also trusted Jehovah completely.
07:13 He trusted Jehovah that he would resurrect him if he would die faithfully.
07:19 Actually, Jesus was publicly known to trust in Jehovah.
07:23 People that passed by when he was on the torture stake were saying:
07:28 “He has put his trust in God;
07:31 “let Him now rescue him if He wants him,
07:34 for he said, ‘I am God’s Son.’”
07:37 Another example of trust was Abraham.
07:40 When God told him to kill his beloved son Isaac,
07:44 Abraham was willing to do so.
07:46 He trusted that Jehovah could resurrect him.
07:51 Hebrews 11:19 says:
07:53 “He reasoned that God was able to raise him up even from the dead,
07:58 and he did receive him from there in an illustrative way.”
08:02 First Corinthians 13:7 says that
08:05 love “believes all things.”
08:09 Love trusts that prophecies will come true.
08:13 It also believes what our brothers tell us.
08:17 It also helps to grant others the benefit of the doubt
08:19 if a matter could be interpreted in different ways.
08:24 Yes, trusting others is an expression of love.
08:28 If you love somebody, you only assume and think the best of him.
08:34 Another example of trust in Jehovah was Moses.
08:38 He led the nation of Israel out of Egypt into the desert
08:43 —a nation upwards of three million people.
08:46 And they had flocks of cattle and sheep with them.
08:51 When he left Egypt,  did he know how to provide
08:54 these great crowds with water in the desert?
08:57 Did he know what they would be eating
08:59 after the initial foodstuffs that they took out of Egypt ran out?
09:04 Did he know in advance that Jehovah  would miraculously provide the manna?
09:10 It doesn’t seem so.
09:12 But he trusted that Jehovah  would take care of the people.
09:18 The three friends of Daniel were another fine example of trust.
09:22 They did not bow and worship in front of an idol
09:25 that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
09:29 They were told they would be thrown into a fiery furnace if they disobeyed.
09:35 They remained firm and were protected by an angel,
09:39 so that the fire did not do any harm to them.
09:42 After that
09:44 “Nebuchadnezzar then declared:
09:47 “‘Praised be the God of Shadrach,  Meshach, and Abednego,
09:51 “‘who sent his angel and rescued his servants.
09:54 “‘They trusted in him and went against the command of the king
09:59 “‘and were willing to die rather than serve
10:01 or worship any god except their own God.’”
10:05 As we are getting ever closer to the great tribulation,
10:09 we might be confronted with scary challenges
10:12 and tests related to nationalism.
10:15 Will we keep trusting Jehovah?
10:18 We trust we will.
10:20 Jehovah will miraculously save his  people throughout the great tribulation
10:25 and arrange for their survival.
10:29 Today, the faithful slave is put in charge of providing spiritual food for God’s people,
10:34 who number into the millions.
10:37 The slave also shows complete trust in Jehovah
10:40 that he will guide them with his holy spirit.
10:44 What makes it possible  for the “faithful and discreet slave”
10:47 to provide precious spiritual food?
10:51 “I will give you insight and instruct you in the way you should go,”
10:56 says Jehovah at Psalm 32:8.
11:01 Today, Jehovah provides direction to the slave through Jesus.
11:05 Jesus, in turn,  provides direction for his people
11:09 through “the faithful and discreet slave.”
11:12 We can therefore have full confidence
11:15 in the Scriptural insight,  understanding, and guidance.
11:21 Satan tries to sow mistrust.
11:24 Under Communist dictatorship in Romania,
11:27 secret police officers forced a responsible brother
11:30 to walk with them on a heavily frequented street
11:33 hoping that other brothers would see this
11:36 and wrongly conclude that this brother works with the secret police.
11:41 Did the scheme work out?
11:43 No, it failed.
11:45 Brothers did see him but kept trusting him.
11:49 We learn that we should not quickly lose trust in our brothers.
11:56 Satan also has the scheme  to spread rumors about faithful brothers,
12:01 including the faithful slave.
12:04 The method of spreading rumors is not new.
12:07 When Jesus was resurrected and the tomb was empty,
12:10 the soldiers who reported it  were told to spread the rumor
12:14 that the disciples came  and stole the body at night.
12:19 Matthew 28:15 relates:
12:23 “So they took the silver pieces and did as they were instructed,
12:27 and this story has been spread abroad among the Jews up to this very day.”
12:34 Another rumor in the first century was that Christians
12:36 were responsible for the great fire of Rome.
12:40 Could such an accusation be true?
12:43 Historians say that it was Nero,
12:46 the emperor, who set fire to the city.
12:51 Today, rumors are occasionally being spread in electronic form about the faithful slave.
12:56 This has caused some concern on the part of some brothers,
13:00 especially when the reports are commenting on court cases
13:04 where some in the organization were accused.
13:08 Sometimes reference is made to certain quotes and then readers think,
13:13 ‘How can a quote be a rumor?’
13:15 A quote can be taken out of context.
13:19 Critical reports often  give only part of a matter
13:23 and leave out other aspects.
13:26 Often, such rumors play on the emotions.
13:31 Ask yourself: ‘Am I prone to believe rumors?
13:35 ‘And even if I am, should I spread it
13:39 ‘and undermine the trust that others have in the slave
13:42 or in representatives of the branch office?’
13:47 Avoid sensationalism  by not saying something like
13:51 “Can you believe what I heard about this matter or that matter
13:55 or this person or that person?”  referring to a statement
13:59 that may have appeared on Facebook, YouTube, or Twitter.
14:04 The spread of rumors is like wildfire that is hard to control.
14:09 It spreads distrust and can undermine someone’s faith.
14:15 This is not to say that the slave is perfect and never makes mistakes.
14:19 But Jehovah and Jesus trust the imperfect slave
14:23 who cares for things to the best of his ability
14:26 and with the best of motives.
14:28 Shouldn’t we then trust the imperfect slave as well?
14:34 To appreciate the extent of Jehovah and Jesus’ trust in the faithful slave,
14:39 reflect on what he has promised its members.
14:43 He has promised them immortality and incorruption.
14:49 Soon, just before Armageddon,
14:51 the remaining members of the slave will be taken to heaven.
14:55 Since 1919 of our Common Era,
14:58 the slave has been put in charge of some belongings of Christ.
15:03 According to Matthew 24:47,
15:06 when the anointed are taken to heaven, Jesus will at that point entrust
15:11 “all his belongings” to them.
15:15 Does this not reveal immense trust?
15:20 Revelation 4:4 describes  these resurrected anointed
15:24 as corulers with Christ.
15:27 Revelation 22:5 says they will rule,
15:31 not only for a thousand years
15:33 but “forever and ever.”
15:38 What immense trust  Jesus shows toward them!
15:43 Since Jehovah God and Jesus Christ
15:46 completely trust “the faithful and discreet slave,”
15:49 should we not do the same?
15:54 Many servants of Jehovah in the past  showed trust in Jehovah
15:57 when confronted with obstacles or opposition.
16:01 We can trust that Jehovah will not let us be tested beyond what we can bear
16:06 but will provide a “way out”
16:09 so we can remain faithful under trials.
16:13 So whom do you trust?
16:16 You fully trust in Jehovah,  Jesus, and the faithful slave.
16:22 To a reasonable degree, you also trust all your fellow brothers and sisters.
16:28 The writer of Psalm 119:42 mentioned something else we need to trust in
16:33 —God’s Word.
16:35 He wrote:
16:37 “For I put my trust in your word.”
16:41 The prophecies in God’s Word have always come true at the proper time.
16:46 Based on that, we can fully trust that the remaining prophecies
16:51 pointing to the survival of the great tribulation
16:54 and to the Paradise to follow will also come true,
16:59 without the slightest possibility of failure.
17:04 Of course, we should trust not only Jehovah, Jesus,
17:07 the faithful slave, and the Bible  but also our fellow brothers.
17:12 The apostle Paul is a fine example of this.
17:15 He wrote to Philemon
17:18 asking him to kindly receive back
17:21 the runaway slave Onesimus who had become a brother.
17:26 Paul wrote at Philemon 21:
17:30 “I am confident that you will comply,
17:33 so I am writing you, knowing that you will do even more than what I say.”
17:38 When we speak of trust,
17:40 we sometimes think of a little child
17:43 walking hand in hand with his father.
17:47 The child does not question where the father will take him.
17:51 The child trusts the father.
17:54 All throughout the last days,
17:56 true Christians have faced hostility  of so many in the world.
18:01 How strengthening Jehovah’s promise is
18:03 in view of the impending attack by Satan’s hordes!
18:07 When they attack, Jehovah’s people will seem as defenseless.
18:12 But we do not need to quake with fear.
18:15 We trust that Jehovah, Jesus, and the angels
18:18 will fight to deliver us.
18:22 We will not shrink back in fear.
18:25 At Hebrews 10:39, Paul wrote:
18:27 “Now we are not the sort  who shrink back to destruction,
18:31 but the sort who have faith for the preserving of our lives.”
18:36 Today and after Armageddon, all can say,
18:38 according to Psalm 26:1 and 52:8:
18:43 “I have trusted [in Jehovah] without wavering.”
18:46 “My trust is in God’s loyal love, forever and ever.”
18:52 Therefore, keep trusting in Jehovah and those who are proving loyal to him.

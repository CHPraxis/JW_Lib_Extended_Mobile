00:00 The theme for this month’s program is
00:04 “Appreciating Our ‘Gifts in Men.’”
00:09 Who of us does not enjoy being given
00:12 a fine, well-chosen gift?
00:16 For example, you brothers,
00:18 do you not take pleasure in receiving
00:21 a colorful but tasteful,
00:24 100 percent silk tie?
00:27 Or, you sisters,  do you not delight in being given
00:30 an exquisite, charming silk scarf?
00:34 But what if you took that silk tie
00:37 or silk scarf
00:39 and used it to polish your shoes?
00:43 How do you think  the giver of your gift would feel
00:46 if he saw you using his gift in that way?
00:51 Obviously, it would be misuse
00:54 and disrespect for the gift  and would insult the giver.
00:59 What is the point of our illustration?
01:02 Well, Jehovah and Jesus have given us
01:07 a fine, well-chosen gift  in the form of the elders.
01:12 But as we will discuss,
01:14 all of us must make sure
01:17 that we always show appreciation and respect
01:21 for this divine provision.
01:25 Please turn to Ephesians 4:8,
01:30 and let’s read about this gift
01:34 that Jehovah and Jesus have given us.
01:38 It reads:
01:40 “For it says:
01:42 “‘When he ascended on high
01:45 “‘he carried away captives;
01:47 he gave gifts in men.’”
01:51 You notice, by means  of Jesus’ perfect integrity,
01:56 Jesus conquered Satan and his world.
02:00 As a world conqueror,
02:02 figuratively He has plundered captives
02:06 and has given them  as gifts to the congregations.
02:11 How useful are these “gifts in men”?
02:14 Well, please look  at verses 11 and 12 for the answer:
02:18 “And he gave some as apostles,
02:21 “some as prophets,
02:23 “some as evangelizers,
02:26 “some as shepherds and teachers,
02:29 “with a view  to the readjustment of the holy ones,
02:33 “for ministerial work,
02:36 to build up the body of the Christ.”
02:40 Notice, they would be “evangelizers”
02:44 —taking the lead
02:46 in the all-important preaching  and disciple-making work.
02:49 They do not simply say to the publishers,
02:52 “Go in the preaching work.”
02:55 They say: “Come.  Come with us.
03:00 Let’s work together  in this never-to-be-repeated work.”
03:05 They’re also “shepherds”
03:07 —protecting the flock from Satan
03:10 the “murderer,”  “serpent,” “dragon,” and “lion.”
03:14 Additionally, they are “teachers”
03:17 —feeding the flock  with nourishing spiritual food.
03:22 But now we ask,
03:24 How does Jehovah tell us
03:26 that we should feel  about these hardworking “gifts in men”?
03:30 Let’s go to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5,
03:34 and let’s get the answer.
03:37 At 1 Thessalonians chapter 5,
03:39 beginning in verse number 12,
03:42 notice what Jehovah says:
03:45 “Now we request you, brothers,
03:47 “to show respect
03:50 “for those who are working hard among you
03:54 “and presiding over you in the Lord
03:57 “and admonishing you;
03:59 “and to give them extraordinary consideration
04:04 “in love because of their work.
04:07 Be peaceable with one another.”
04:12 Notice, we’re told to “show respect”
04:16 for these dear brothers.
04:18 But now, let’s move to a vital question,
04:22 How can we show, demonstrate,
04:26 that we do deeply respect
04:29 and appreciate these dear brothers?
04:31 The first way:
04:33 by wholeheartedly cooperating with them.
04:38 Please turn to Hebrews 13:17,
04:44 and this scripture describes how deep
04:47 our cooperation should be, verse 17:
04:51 “Be obedient
04:54 “to those who are taking the lead among you
04:57 “and be submissive,
05:00 “for they are keeping watch over you
05:04 “as those who will render an account,
05:07 “so that they may do this  with joy and not with sighing,
05:11 for this would be damaging to you.”
05:15 Notice, we are told to “be obedient.”
05:20 Clearly, this means  that we’re supposed to comply with,
05:23 or obey, what they tell us.
05:26 Of course, that would be with the proviso:
05:29 unless they tell us to do  something that is unscriptural.
05:32 And, of course, that would be extremely rare.
05:36 We’re also told to “be submissive.”
05:40 This includes the attitude
05:42 with which we’re to be obedient
05:45 —doing so with a yielding, positive attitude.
05:51 Would it be possible to be obedient
05:54 but not submissive?
05:56 Well, what if we said:
05:58 “OK. I’ll do what the elders suggest.
06:03 I don’t want to do it, but I’ll do it.”
06:08 We would be obedient but not submissive.
06:12 However, Jehovah tells us
06:14 to display both of these qualities.
06:18 We should be obedient and submissive
06:21 even if what the elders are asking us to do
06:24 is not the best,  most efficient way to do something.
06:29 Permit me to illustrate this point.
06:32 Admittedly, the illustration  is somewhat exaggerated,
06:37 but hopefully it will make the point.
06:40 Please imagine that the elders decide
06:43 that the outside of the Kingdom Hall
06:46 needs to be painted  and that all the publishers
06:50 will be given  a small two-inch (5 cm) paintbrush
06:53 with which to paint.
06:56 Now, what could happen?
06:58 The publishers could get all upset
07:01 concerning this request of the elders,
07:03 saying, “It is ridiculous  that the elders want us
07:08 to paint  with a small two-inch (5 cm) paintbrush!”
07:11 Consequently, some could start campaigning
07:15 for the right for everyone  to use a six-inch (15 cm) paintbrush.
07:20 Others might campaign for using paint rollers
07:25 to roll the paint on the Kingdom Hall.
07:28 Still others  might start trying to build support
07:32 for renting and using a paint sprayer
07:36 to spray the paint on the Kingdom Hall.
07:39 In another camp,  ones might champion the idea
07:42 of hiring out to a contractor
07:45 the painting of the Kingdom Hall,
07:47 while another group is promoting the idea
07:51 that the Kingdom Hall  doesn’t even need to be painted.
07:55 Now, what would be the outcome?
07:59 The congregation would be divided,
08:02 the Kingdom Hall would never get painted,
08:05 publishers could end up  stumbled right out of the truth,
08:09 the elders would be very discouraged,
08:12 Jehovah would be sad,
08:14 and Satan would be made very happy.
08:19 On the other hand,
08:21 what if everyone humbly supported  the elders, perhaps thinking:
08:26 ‘There’s no scripture
08:28 ‘that says we can’t paint  with a two-inch (5 cm) paintbrush.
08:32 ‘In fact, Hebrews 13:17 tells us
08:35 ‘to “be obedient”  and “submissive” to the elders.
08:40 So why don’t we go ahead  and support the elders?’
08:43 Now what would be the outcome?
08:46 The Kingdom Hall would get painted,
08:49 the publishers would get to enjoy
08:52 a lot of good association
08:54 because they’d be working together  for a long time,
08:59 the elders would be very encouraged,
09:02 Satan would be sad,
09:05 and Jehovah’s heart would be made glad.
09:10 Well, what is the point  of this hyperbole illustration?
09:15 Being obedient and submissive  to those taking the lead
09:19 is much more important  than how something is done.
09:23 That is the attitude
09:25 that Jehovah will richly bless.
09:29 But, now, a second way we can demonstrate
09:33 that we deeply appreciate these dear brothers
09:35 is to pray for them.
09:39 Please note what the elder Paul urged
09:43 the brothers to do for him
09:45 at Romans 15:30.
09:50 Here Paul said:
09:52 “Now I urge you, brothers,
09:56 “through our Lord Jesus Christ
09:59 “and through the love of the spirit,
10:02 “that you exert yourselves with me
10:05 in prayers to God for me.”
10:10 Paul recognized
10:12 the power that he would derive
10:15 as a result of others praying for him,
10:19 and your local elders feel the same way.
10:23 But the question is,
10:25 In your personal, private prayers,
10:28 do you regularly thank Jehovah
10:31 for your “gifts in men” and entreat Jehovah
10:33 to richly supply them  with his powerful holy spirit?
10:38 Our answer to that question can reveal much
10:42 about our appreciation  for these hardworking elders.
10:48 Now let’s move to a third way
10:51 that we can demonstrate deep appreciation:
10:54 We can do so by commending the elders.
11:00 Here is a soul-searching question:
11:03 Do you periodically go up
11:05 to various elders and say something like,
11:08 “Brother Elder,
11:10 “we just want  to thank you for your hard work.
11:13 Please be assured that we appreciate it”?
11:18 However, it seems
11:21 that some publishers  never ever commend the elders
11:25 or express appreciation.
11:28 Might this not indicate  that we are taking them
11:31 and their hard work for granted?
11:34 Of course, they will not quit  if you do not give them commendation;
11:38 they primarily do their work for Jehovah.
11:42 But if you do express appreciation,
11:45 believe me, it will be most encouraging to them.
11:50 And even though  it may really surprise the elder
11:53 the very first time you do this,
11:56 please do not hold back
11:58 this “good from those to whom it is owing.”
12:03 Appropriately,
12:05 Jehovah tells us at Proverbs 3:27:
12:09 “Do not withhold good  from those to whom you should give it
12:14 if it is within your power to help.”
12:18 And one thing  that will move us to be more aware
12:22 of commending the elders is to remember  all the good work they are doing.
12:27 Many elders are family men
12:29 who must work secularly  to provide for their families.
12:34 If he has children,
12:36 these young ones need time  and attention from their father.
12:41 He may need to help  them with their schoolwork
12:44 as well as schedule time for them
12:46 to enjoy wholesome recreation.
12:50 Most important, he cares  for the spiritual needs of his family
12:55 —regularly conducting family worship,
12:58 working with them in the ministry,
13:00 and taking them to meetings.
13:02 But in addition  to these numerous responsibilities
13:06 common to many of us,
13:09 they have voluminous additional responsibilities
13:12 as elders.
13:14 And much of the elders’ hard work
13:16 in our behalf  is not seen by the congregation.
13:21 For example, you may see
13:23 an elder giving a part on the meeting.
13:25 What you didn’t see
13:27 are the hours he spent preparing that part.
13:31 How long does it take you
13:34 to prepare a student assignment
13:37 on the midweek meeting?
13:39 Some elders have a part every week,
13:42 sometimes more than one.
13:44 While gaining experience  in speaking is certainly helpful,
13:49 the fact remains
13:51 that good talks require hard work.
13:56 But that is not all that the elders do.
13:59 They have shepherding calls to make
14:01 and judicial cases to handle.
14:04 Some elders are also busy  helping to build Kingdom Halls
14:09 and branch facilities,
14:11 serving on Hospital Liaison Committees,
14:14 volunteering at assemblies and conventions
14:17 —and elders do many other things
14:20 that are too numerous to recount.
14:24 What we see  is often only the tip of the iceberg
14:29 —90 percent of an iceberg
14:31 is unseen underwater.
14:35 At 2 Timothy 4:6,
14:39 the apostle Paul referred to himself
14:42 as “being poured out like a drink offering.”
14:46 A drink offering
14:48 was poured on the altar  and went up in smoke.
14:53 That well describes how the elders likewise
14:57 expend themselves.
15:00 Remembering all of this should move us
15:04 to regularly offer sincere commendation
15:08 to our hardworking elders.
15:10 Now we have discussed ways
15:14 that we can demonstrate
15:16 that we deeply appreciate our “gifts in men.”
15:20 We should  (1) wholeheartedly cooperate with them,
15:27 (2) pray for them,
15:29 and (3) commend them.
15:32 Thereby we will prove
15:34 that we are not even slightly like
15:37 an unappreciative recipient  of a silk tie or a silk scarf,
15:42 who uses that gift to polish his shoes.
15:47 To the contrary,
15:49 we will prove to Jehovah and Jesus
15:52 that we love, respect,
15:55 and appreciate
15:57 the divine gifts —our “gifts in men”—
16:00 that they have so generously given to us!

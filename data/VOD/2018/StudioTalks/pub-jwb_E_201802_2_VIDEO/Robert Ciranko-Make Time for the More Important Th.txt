00:01 I would like to talk about a valuable asset
00:03 that every one of us possesses
00:05 —time.
00:07 It certainly is something  that is on our minds
00:09 as we go about our day’s activities.
00:12 Just think of how often  you look at a clock, your watch,
00:15 or your cell phone to check the time.
00:18 Why do we do that?
00:20 Probably to see  if we are ahead of time, on time,
00:24 behind time, or out of time!
00:26 But what exactly is time?
00:29 One dictionary says  it is “a nonspatial continuum.”
00:34 Another says  it is “the thing that is measured
00:38 as seconds, minutes,  hours, days, and years.”
00:43 To explain exactly what time is  in simple terms is nearly impossible,
00:48 and the Bible does not define it,
00:51 which may suggest that Jehovah knows
00:53 it is beyond our ability to understand fully.
00:57 But the Bible does discuss time.
01:00 It shows that Jehovah is very time conscious.
01:03 It speaks of time  as something that we should use wisely.
01:07 And it gives us  the amazing hope of living into infinity
01:11 —that is, endless time.
01:14 We do know this about time:
01:16 Every human has exactly the same number
01:19 of hours and minutes in each day.
01:22 Rich people cannot buy more hours,
01:24 and scientists cannot invent new minutes.
01:27 We can never recoup  the time we have wasted;
01:31 neither can we save it  to spend on another day.
01:34 Just think, we have exactly  the same number of hours
01:38 to use each day that Jesus Christ  had when he was on the earth!
01:42 And we can be sure  that no human used his time more wisely
01:47 than did God’s Son.
01:50 It has been said that time
01:52 is the most valuable thing  a human can spend.
01:55 And so it is up to us  how we will use the time
01:58 that is at our disposal.
02:01 In this regard, there is a Bible principle  that gives us good direction,
02:06 a principle that was shared  with us by the apostle Paul
02:09 at Philippians 1:9, 10.
02:12 He wrote in verse 9:
02:15 “And this is what I continue praying,”
02:18 and in verse 10,
02:20 “that you may make sure  of the more important things.”
02:24 Therefore, the theme of this month’s program
02:26 is “Make Time for  ‘the More Important Things.’”
02:32 This presents us with a two-fold challenge.
02:34 First, we have to determine
02:37 what are the more important things of life.
02:40 In the scripture we just read,  some Bible translations say
02:44 “have a sense of what is vital.”
02:47 So we must distinguish  between activities that are merely trivial
02:52 and those that really matter.
02:55 In addition to the obligation  to work to support one’s family,
02:59 to care for necessary household chores,
03:02 and to look after one’s children  or aging parents,
03:05 we have many important things  of a spiritual nature
03:09 that deserve our full attention:
03:12 reading and meditating on God’s Word,
03:15 studying the Bible personally  and in family worship,
03:18 preparing for and attending  congregation meetings,
03:22 caring for any responsibilities  that we have in the congregation,
03:26 and participating in the Christian ministry.
03:30 Besides all of that,  who does not want some time to rest,
03:34 to exercise, to work in the garden,
03:37 to enjoy some recreation,
03:40 or to visit with family and friends?
03:43 Have you ever felt that you did not have  enough time to do all those things
03:48 —that you have difficulty  fitting all the spiritual activities
03:52 into your busy life?
03:54 As much as we might like to,  we cannot add an extra hour to our day
03:59 or another day to our week  to accomplish more things.
04:03 So we have to be selective
04:06 about how we spend  the time that we have.
04:10 We will get the most accomplished
04:12 if we prioritize  the things that really matter.
04:17 And what does that mean?
04:19 To prioritize means to decide
04:22 which tasks are more important  and to do them first.
04:26 In other words,  decide what must be given attention
04:29 prior to other things.
04:33 There is a Bible proverb  that nicely illustrates
04:36 the importance  of prioritizing life’s activities.
04:40 Proverbs 12:11 states:
04:43 “The one who cultivates his land
04:46 “will be satisfied with food,
04:49 “but the one pursuing worthless things
04:51 is lacking good sense.”
04:54 What a clear warning that is for a farmer
04:57 not to fill up his day  with worthless endeavors
05:00 and waste the precious time that he  should be spending working in his field!
05:06 Likewise, a Christian  who diligently cultivates his spirituality
05:10 can be confident of Jehovah’s blessing,
05:13 whereas a person  who is distracted by worthless activities
05:17 puts his relationship with God in danger.
05:20 How can we avoid that?
05:23 By not taking valuable time  away from spiritual pursuits
05:27 to spend on the things that distract us
05:30 from serving Jehovah whole-souled.
05:34 For example, when it comes  to communicating with others,
05:38 what should take priority?
05:40 Starting our day  by giving Jehovah praise and thanks
05:44 in prayer for another day of life
05:46 or telephoning an old friend to catch up
05:49 on the latest news in his or her life?
05:52 There’s nothing wrong  with talking to a friend.
05:55 But we need to make sure we take the time
05:57 to talk to our very best Friend, Jehovah.
06:00 Obviously, it is more important  to communicate with our heavenly Father,
06:04 so praying to him should be a priority.
06:09 The apostle Paul had more  to say about time management.
06:13 At Ephesians 5:15-17, he wrote:
06:18 “So keep strict watch that how you walk
06:21 “is not as unwise but as wise persons,
06:24 “making the best use of your time,
06:27 “because the days are wicked.
06:29 “On this account stop being unreasonable,
06:32 “but keep perceiving what
06:34 the will of Jehovah is.”
06:37 Now we can address  the second part of our challenge:
06:40 to make ample time to care
06:43 for the more important things of life.
06:45 What does Paul’s counsel
06:47 to ‘make the best use of your time’  actually mean?
06:52 Literally, in Greek,  it means to ‘buy out the appointed time.’
06:57 That implies buying time  at the expense of something else.
07:02 So it helps to analyze  how our time is actually being spent
07:06 and to see what adjustments are needed
07:09 so that we can buy out, or make,  time for the more important things.
07:15 If we ‘perceive what the will of Jehovah is,’
07:18 then we certainly will want  to use as much time as possible
07:22 to forge an ever stronger  relationship with him
07:25 and to share fully in sacred service.
07:29 Do you have definite periods set aside  for the spiritual activities of life?
07:35 For congregation meetings,  the schedule is set for us.
07:38 We know exactly when  our congregation meets
07:41 for its midweek  and weekend meetings.
07:43 We just have to be sure  that we do not let
07:46 anything else get  in the way of our attending
07:49 because the meetings are a priority.
07:51 Hebrews 10:25 says ‘not to forsake’ them.
07:56 For everything else
07:58 —reading the Bible,  preparing for meetings,
08:01 family worship,  field service activity—
08:05 we have to set our own schedule
08:08 and stick to it as part  of a good spiritual routine.
08:13 As an example,  what does your family do
08:17 most Saturday mornings?
08:19 Many families have the routine  of going in field service every Saturday.
08:23 Rarely is anything allowed  to get in the way of that routine.
08:27 For them,  Saturday morning is not the time
08:31 for music lessons,  dance classes, cooking courses,
08:35 working out at the gym,  or anything else
08:37 —it is their time for field service.
08:41 Having a routine like that  makes life easier for everyone in the family.
08:45 No one has to wonder Friday night
08:48 what is going to happen Saturday morning.
08:50 The decision has already been made
08:53 to go out in the ministry that day.
08:56 Otherwise,  if we leave it up to chance every week,
08:58 then it means  that 52 times during the year
09:02 we have to decide  whether to go in service on Saturday.
09:05 How much simpler it is  to make the decision once and for all
09:10 that we will use  that time slot for the ministry,
09:13 barring any serious,  unforeseen circumstances.
09:17 Of course,  given your family’s situation,
09:20 another day of the week may work better.
09:22 But you get the point.
09:24 Sharing regularly in the Christian ministry  cannot be left up to chance.
09:29 At Mark 13:10,
09:31 Jesus prioritized the ministry when he said:
09:34 “The good news has to be preached first.”
09:38 So if spiritual matters are going  to take precedence in our lives,
09:43 we first have to make them priorities,
09:46 and second,
09:48 make ample time  to care for those priorities.
09:53 That means setting aside  definite periods of time
09:57 to build up our spirituality
09:59 and to stay fully involved  in our worship and service.
10:04 Ecclesiastes 3:1 reinforces this thought.
10:09 It states:
10:10 “There is an appointed time for everything,
10:14 a time for every activity under the heavens.”
10:18 We have to decide  when that “appointed time” is
10:21 for each of our spiritual activities.
10:24 If we are having difficulty with this,
10:27 can we shorten the time  we spend on hobbies, recreation,
10:32 sports, social networking
10:35 and devote that time  to our Bible reading, family worship,
10:39 meeting preparation, or field ministry?
10:42 If we can, we will find it  to be spiritually refreshing
10:46 and invigorating.
10:48 This was the experience  of a family man that I know
10:51 who began preparing better  so as to participate each week
10:55 in the “Digging for Spiritual Gems” portion  of the midweek meeting.
10:59 He made time on Sunday evenings for this.
11:03 All in his family  and congregation have benefited
11:06 from the excellent points he has learned
11:09 as he does research  on the assigned Bible reading,
11:11 and he feels good because of it.
11:15 One married couple decided to eliminate
11:18 some of their hobbies and personal projects.
11:21 They even packed them up  and put them out of sight.
11:23 Why?
11:25 So as not to be distracted by those things.
11:28 They were nonessential activities  that they decided they could do without.
11:34 Likely, we could all benefit  from taking inventory of our lives
11:39 and limiting any unnecessary activities
11:42 that may be interfering  with our spiritual routine.
11:45 Imagine how rewarding that would be!
11:48 Just think, if we could buy out
30 minutes each day
11:52 from doing something  that is not essential,
11:54 that is about how much time it would take
11:56 to read the entire Bible in one year.
12:00 Or if we could buy out  an extra hour or two
12:03 each week for the field ministry,
12:05 think of how much more  we could accomplish
12:07 and how happy  that would make God and Christ,
12:11 as they see us making time  for the more important things!
12:17 Now, why have we felt  the need to spend this time
12:20 discussing how to manage time?
12:22 It is because of something else  that the Bible tells us.
12:26 First Corinthians 7:29 says
12:29 that “the time left is reduced.”
12:32 That certainly is true of the time
12:34 that is left between now  and the great tribulation!
12:37 This is not the time to neglect
12:40 the most important activity of all
12:43 —our worship of Jehovah.

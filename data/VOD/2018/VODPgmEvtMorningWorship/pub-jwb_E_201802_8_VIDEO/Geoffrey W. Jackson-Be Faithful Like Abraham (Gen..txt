00:01 This morning I’d like you to imagine
00:03 for a few moments
00:04 that you’ve been asked to write
00:06 your life story for The Watchtower.
00:09 Well, once you get over the shock,
00:11 how would you go about doing that?
00:14 You’ve probably noticed with many  of the life experiences in The Watchtower,
00:18 usually the first paragraph,
00:21 have a defining moment in that person’s life.
00:25 For example, Brother Eric Beveridge,  who serves with us here in the United States,
00:30 he started off this way:
00:32 “‘I hereby sentence you  to six months in prison.’
00:36 “With those words ringing in my ears,  I was taken off to . . .
00:39 “[p]rison in Manchester, England. . . .
00:41 “I had just faced  one of the toughest tests of my young life
00:45 —I had refused to be conscripted  for military service.”
00:49 Or another brother, Brother Harley Harris,
00:52 who served as a missionary  in Ecuador for many years,
00:54 he referred to the date September 2, 1950.
00:58 He said: “We were at a circuit assembly,  surrounded by a mob.
01:02 “The mayor brought in the National Guard  to protect us from the unruly crowd.
01:07 “Soldiers with drawn rifles  and bayonets lined the street.
01:11 “Amid insults,  we walked to our cars and drove to . . .
01:14 “the remaining sessions of the assembly.
01:16 It was there  that I was baptized at the age of 14.”
01:21 Or another brother, Brother Don MacLean
01:23 —who serves  on the Branch Committee in Australasia,
01:26 a brother originally from Canada—
01:28 made this comment.
01:30 He started his life experience:
01:32 “There I sat, hour after hour,
01:34 “with one of the Royal Canadian  Mounted Police by my side.
01:38 “I was his prisoner.
01:40 “We were headed  for the prison camp at . . . Ontario, Canada,
01:43 “and it seemed  [that] the 1,500-mile train trip
01:46 would never end.”
01:49 Well, those certainly were defining moments
01:52 in the lives of those brothers.
01:54 What about you?
01:56 What is your defining moment?
01:59 Well, you might be thinking,
02:01 ‘No one put a gun  to my head and said,
02:05 “Decide now whether  you’ll serve Jehovah or not.”’
02:08 But for many of us, there have been  defining moments in our lives.
02:12 Perhaps it’s the moment  you decided to serve Jehovah
02:17 or the moment you decided  to become a full-time servant.
02:21 Perhaps it involved some decisions,  such as selling a home,
02:26 selling a business,  deciding to move to Bethel,
02:29 or perhaps leaving your country  and going somewhere else.
02:33 Or it may have involved  certain tests or trials,
02:37 perhaps giving up  opportunities for education
02:40 or for lucrative job opportunities.
02:44 Well, whatever the case,
02:46 I’m sure most of us  have had some defining moments
02:50 in our lives that we remember
02:52 —the decisions that were made  that resulted in much good.
02:57 Let’s think for a moment  about the faithful man Abraham.
03:01 What was the defining moment in his life?
03:04 Well, if you take your Bibles  and turn with me to Hebrews chapter 11,
03:08 of course, here we see  the apostle Paul giving us an outline
03:13 or history of many  of the defining moments
03:16 in the lives of faithful ones.
03:19 At Hebrews 11:8,  it says of Abraham:
03:23 “By faith Abraham, when he was called,
03:27 “obeyed by going out to a place
03:29 “he was to receive as an inheritance;
03:32 he went out,  although not knowing where he was going.”
03:37 Yes, that was a defining moment  in the life of Abraham, wasn’t it?
03:42 He decided to obey Jehovah,  to leave Ur,
03:47 and to travel to a distant country  that he didn’t really know about.
03:53 But was that all that was involved
03:56 with Abraham receiving the reward?
03:59 No.
04:00 Let’s read on a little further in verse 9.
04:04 There it says:
04:05 “By faith he lived as a foreigner
04:08 “in the land of the promise  as in a foreign land,
04:11 “living in tents with Isaac and Jacob,
04:14 the heirs with him  of the very same promise.”
04:18 Now, this is not a defining moment, is it?
04:21 This is a course of faithfulness,
04:24 day in, day out.
04:27 So, what’s the point?
04:29 Well, in the case of Abraham,
04:31 we remember  that eventually he and his family
04:34 crossed the Euphrates River  and into the Promised Land
04:37 in the year 1943 B.C.E.
04:41 But he had to wait 25 years  before his son Isaac was born
04:45 and then another 60 years
04:48 before his grandsons  Esau and Jacob were born.
04:51 And eventually,  he died after being in the Promised Land
04:55 as a foreigner for about 100 years.
04:59 So, what’s the point?
05:01 Although there was  a definite decision he made
05:04 —a defining moment in his life—
05:07 that was backed up as verse 9 says,
05:10 by his faithfulness
05:12 —day in, day out—
05:14 serving Jehovah.
05:17 So the lesson we learn from that is
05:20 that it’s not just the defining moments
05:23 that define who we are.
05:25 Rather, those moments and those decisions
05:29 need to be backed up by faithful service.
05:33 Let’s be quite frank.
05:35 Many of the life experiences  that we read in The Watchtower
05:38 may have a very exciting first paragraph.
05:42 “Yes, they put a gun to my head.
05:44 “Make your decision.
05:45 “Will you die?
05:47 Would you be willing to die for Jehovah?”
05:49 But then,  when you read the rest of the article,
05:52 nothing really exciting  happened in that person’s life.
05:56 I’m sorry to say it.
05:58 That includes my life experience as well.
06:02 Why?
06:03 Because the majority of our lives
06:06 are not involved with defining moments
06:09 —exciting things that are happening.
06:12 Rather, they involve  our faithfulness to Jehovah.
06:16 So we can’t just rely  upon these defining moments and say,
06:20 “Well, I made this decision  to serve Jehovah;
06:23 I passed this test,  so everything is good.”
06:26 No, we need to continue  to back up those defining moments
06:32 with faithful service.
06:34 Remember that in the Scriptures,
06:36 there were many who had  defining moments in their lives.
06:39 Take, for example, Solomon.
06:41 He had a defining moment, didn’t he,  when he prayed to Jehovah
06:45 and he was praised for the fact  that he asked for wisdom rather than wealth?
06:51 But that wasn’t backed up by faithfulness.
06:54 Eventually, that defining moment in his life
06:57 really wasn’t as valuable as it could’ve been
07:00 because of his lack of faithfulness.
07:04 And what about Judas Iscariot?
07:06 Were there some defining moments in his life?
07:09 Obviously, he decided  to follow Jesus at one point.
07:13 And during that time,  when he faithfully followed Jesus,
07:17 no doubt, there were very exciting,  interesting things that happened.
07:21 But again,  those defining moments in his life
07:26 proved to be of little value
07:28 because of the lack  of faithfulness on his part.
07:31 So that helps us to understand
07:33 why the apostle Paul  said some very interesting points
07:37 just before he started this list  that he gives us in Hebrews chapter 11.
07:42 Let’s turn to Hebrews chapter 10,
07:46 Hebrews 10:35-39.
07:53 Notice, this is the point  that we should gain from this lesson.
07:58 Paul says starting in verse 35:
08:01 “Therefore, do not throw away your boldness,
08:04 “which will be richly rewarded.
08:07 For you need endurance,”
08:10 now, that reminds us of what Jesus said
08:12 about ‘the one who endures  to the end will be saved,’
08:16 “so that after you  have done the will of God,
08:19 “you may receive  the fulfillment of the promise.
08:22 “For yet ‘a very little while,’
08:25 “and ‘the one who is coming  will arrive and will not delay.’
08:30 “‘But my righteous one  will live by reason of faith,’
08:34 “and ‘if he shrinks back,  I have no pleasure in him.’
08:39 “Now we are not the sort  who shrink back to destruction,
08:43 but the sort who have faith  for the preserving of our lives.”
08:48 What a very positive comment that is.
08:51 So when we think of our life experience,
08:54 don’t be disappointed if you  don’t have some spectacular things
08:59 that you can mention as defining moments.
09:01 Remember, the important thing
09:04 is not just the decisions  that we make along the way
09:08 but the fact that we remain  faithful to Jehovah
09:11 day in, day out.

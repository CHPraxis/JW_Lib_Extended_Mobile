00:00:01 ‎You know, our text today
00:00:02 ‎and the comments that we just heard
00:00:04 ‎center our attention on our Christian hope.
00:00:08 ‎Very soon, our loving Father, Jehovah,
00:00:10 ‎is going to eliminate pain, suffering, death,
00:00:15 ‎and indeed, as has been commented on,
00:00:18 ‎the happy memories  ‎will just push out all the bad memories.
00:00:22 ‎“The former things  ‎[will indeed] have passed away.”
00:00:25 ‎Now, when I thought about Revelation 21:3, 4,
00:00:29 ‎I thought to myself,  ‎‘I’ve heard those words hundreds of times,
00:00:34 ‎‘and I’ve probably shared those words
00:00:36 ‎hundreds of times in our ministry.’
00:00:39 ‎And while most of us through repetition
00:00:42 ‎have probably memorized  ‎those sacred thoughts,
00:00:46 ‎a good question I thought  ‎would be helpful to think about is,
00:00:51 ‎Are these basic Scriptural truths
00:00:54 ‎still strengthening me now?
00:00:56 ‎Are they, as Brother Cotton just mentioned,
00:00:59 ‎still serving “as an anchor for [my] soul?”
00:01:03 ‎With that thought in mind,  ‎let’s consider three questions:
00:01:07 ‎What is the hope  ‎as described in the Scriptures?
00:01:11 ‎Second, why do we need hope?
00:01:14 ‎And third, how can we strengthen our hope?
00:01:19 ‎First, how would you define hope?
00:01:23 ‎Back in 1993, The Watchtower ‎quoted a writer who said this:
00:01:28 ‎“Most people seem to think that hope
00:01:31 ‎is just a dopy form of denying the truth.”
00:01:35 ‎Others today would equate hope
00:01:38 ‎with optimism or wishful thinking.
00:01:41 ‎And, of course,  ‎the Scriptures encourage positive thinking,
00:01:45 ‎and there are benefits ‎—emotionally and perhaps even physically.
00:01:49 ‎But what do we call a desire or a wish
00:01:53 ‎that’s not based on truth?
00:01:55 ‎What is a desire or a wish  ‎that does not take Jehovah into account?
00:02:00 ‎Well, that’s a dream; that’s an unreality.
00:02:04 ‎And, of course, none of us as true Christians
00:02:07 ‎want to live in La-La land,  ‎or in a dreamworld, do we?
00:02:12 ‎Of course, the Bible  ‎does not use the word “optimism,”
00:02:15 ‎but it does encourage us ‎to strengthen our hope.
00:02:21 ‎What is hope according to the Scriptures?
00:02:24 ‎The original language words  ‎used in the Bible that are translated “hope”
00:02:29 ‎mean “to wait eagerly” and “to expect good.”
00:02:34 ‎In the Scriptures, hope involves  ‎not only the desire for something good
00:02:38 ‎but it includes the basis  ‎for believing that good will come.
00:02:44 ‎That’s much more meaningful than optimism.
00:02:47 ‎Hope, like our faith, is based on evidence
00:02:51 ‎—convincing facts.
00:02:54 ‎And though hope involves  ‎our eager desire for something good,
00:02:58 ‎it does not start with our desires ‎—what we want or what we wish for.
00:03:03 ‎It’s first rooted in what God wants
00:03:07 ‎with regard to his purpose ‎and what God wants for us individually.
00:03:12 ‎Romans 5:5 tells us
00:03:14 ‎that such “hope does not lead  ‎to disappointment.”
00:03:18 ‎So in a brief definition,  ‎we could say that Scriptural hope
00:03:23 ‎is eager expectation based on future realities,
00:03:28 ‎rooted in what Jehovah has taught us.
00:03:32 ‎Our second question:
00:03:34 ‎Why is hope essential for all Christians?
00:03:38 ‎Please open your Bible  ‎with me to Hebrews 11:1,
00:03:44 ‎and notice our well-known definition of faith,
00:03:48 ‎but then notice how hope is associated.
00:03:51 ‎Hebrews 11:1 says:
00:03:55 ‎“Faith is the assured expectation
00:03:58 ‎“of what is hoped for,
00:04:01 ‎“the evident demonstration
00:04:04 ‎of realities that are not seen.”
00:04:08 ‎So just as faith is a requirement
00:04:11 ‎for us to serve Jehovah acceptably
00:04:14 ‎and for our worship not to be in vain,
00:04:16 ‎hope, as an essential element of faith,
00:04:19 ‎is also necessary for all Christians.
00:04:23 ‎To see the connection  ‎between faith and hope a little better,
00:04:27 ‎we might think about the example of Abraham.
00:04:31 ‎Now, from a human standpoint,
00:04:33 ‎Abraham and Sarah  ‎were way past childbearing age
00:04:37 ‎when Jehovah promised them a son.
00:04:40 ‎It’s interesting that in the Scriptures
00:04:42 ‎both Abraham and Sarah  ‎laughed at the angelic announcement.
00:04:46 ‎It was an amazing and tickling prospect to them
00:04:49 ‎to think that they  ‎would have a baby in their older years.
00:04:53 ‎But how did Abraham respond to the promise?
00:04:58 ‎Notice, please, in Romans 4:18
00:05:02 ‎what the Bible says,
00:05:04 ‎linked to this discussion of the need for hope.
00:05:09 ‎Romans 4:18 says:
00:05:12 ‎“Although beyond hope, yet based on hope,
00:05:16 ‎“he had faith that he would become ‎the father of many nations
00:05:19 ‎“according to what had been said:
00:05:21 ‎‘So your offspring will be.’”
00:05:25 ‎Faith “based on hope”
00:05:28 ‎—we see the connection better, don’t we?
00:05:31 ‎You see, Abraham’s God-given hope
00:05:34 ‎gave his faith that he would have a son
00:05:36 ‎a firm foundation.
00:05:38 ‎His faith, in turn,  ‎brightened and strengthened his hope.
00:05:43 ‎So it was not only this conviction in his heart
00:05:46 ‎but it was the eager anticipation of seeing
00:05:49 ‎what Jehovah had promised come to fulfillment.
00:05:54 ‎Another reason that we need hope
00:05:58 ‎has to do with the storms  ‎that you and I are undoubtedly facing now
00:06:02 ‎or will face  ‎before the end of the system comes.
00:06:06 ‎In Paul’s letter to the Hebrews, ‎he illustrated hope
00:06:10 ‎“as an anchor for the soul, ‎both sure and firm.”
00:06:14 ‎So when confronting storms,
00:06:16 ‎what do sailors,  ‎both in ancient times and today, often do?
00:06:21 ‎They lower the ship’s anchor.
00:06:23 ‎Why?
00:06:24 ‎Well, if the anchor  ‎takes hold of the firm seabed,
00:06:28 ‎it helps the ship ride out the storm.
00:06:31 ‎It keeps that ship  ‎away from dangerous reefs or the shoreline.
00:06:35 ‎Interestingly,  ‎when the apostle Paul was on that ship
00:06:38 ‎en route to Rome in the year 58 C.E.,
00:06:41 ‎the ship was in danger of running aground.
00:06:44 ‎The Bible tells us  ‎that the sailors cast out four anchors
00:06:49 ‎—not just one, four— ‎from the stern,
00:06:53 ‎and as a result,  ‎the ship safely rode out the storm.
00:06:56 ‎Well, it’s not hard to see the connection
00:06:58 ‎with hope and our stormy times today, is it?
00:07:02 ‎Our “sure and firm” hope,
00:07:04 ‎our setting our mind with eager expectation ‎of what Jehovah has promised,
00:07:08 ‎keeps us emotionally, mentally, ‎and spiritually balanced
00:07:12 ‎no matter what  ‎is raging around us in our life
00:07:16 ‎—in full-time service, with our family,
00:07:19 ‎with our finances, with our health.
00:07:21 ‎We can weather the storms
00:07:24 ‎because of our eager expectation ‎of what Jehovah has promised.
00:07:27 ‎Really, few things  ‎could be more stabilizing in our life
00:07:32 ‎than this eager expectation of what Jehovah,
00:07:34 ‎the God who does not lie, has promised to us.
00:07:38 ‎Well, that leads to a third question:
00:07:41 ‎How can we strengthen our hope?
00:07:44 ‎Well, as has been commented on beautifully ‎by our four commenters,
00:07:48 ‎we need to think specifically
00:07:51 ‎about how Jehovah’s promises apply to us
00:07:56 ‎and what they will mean for us and our family
00:07:59 ‎in the near future.
00:08:02 ‎Though we serve Jehovah out of love
00:08:04 ‎—and that’s our principal motivation—
00:08:06 ‎Jehovah wants us to think about the rewards
00:08:09 ‎that he has outlined for us in the Scriptures.
00:08:11 ‎He wants us to visualize
00:08:13 ‎and meditate on such blessings.
00:08:17 ‎One sister, in referring to the beautiful artwork
00:08:20 ‎that’s in our magazines, said this:
00:08:22 ‎“When I see pictures  ‎of the coming Paradise . . . ,
00:08:25 ‎“I examine them closely,  ‎as one would a travel brochure.
00:08:29 ‎“I endeavor to see myself there
00:08:32 ‎“because this is where I truly hope to be
00:08:35 ‎in God’s due time.”
00:08:38 ‎Daydreaming?
00:08:39 ‎No.
00:08:40 ‎Meditation on truths
00:08:43 ‎and on precious promises that will not lie?
00:08:47 ‎Yes.
00:08:49 ‎Notice, please,  ‎with me at 2 Peter 3:11, 12
00:08:54 ‎how the inspired counsel encourages us
00:08:57 ‎to strengthen and build up  ‎our hope in view of what’s coming.
00:09:01 ‎Second Peter chapter 3,  ‎let’s read together verses 11 and 12:
00:09:06 ‎“Since all these things  ‎are to be dissolved in this way
00:09:10 ‎“[with regard to what  ‎we’re expecting in the near future
00:09:13 ‎“with the great tribulation  ‎leading into Armageddon],
00:09:16 ‎“consider what sort of people you ought to be
00:09:19 ‎“in holy acts of conduct  ‎and deeds of godly devotion,
00:09:22 ‎“as you await and keep close in mind
00:09:27 ‎“the presence of the day of Jehovah,
00:09:29 ‎“through which the heavens ‎will be destroyed in flames
00:09:32 ‎and the elements  ‎will melt in the intense heat!”
00:09:36 ‎Notice in verse 12 that expression, ‎“keep close in mind”
00:09:40 ‎—“eagerly desire,” literally, “speed up.”
00:09:44 ‎Do you see how our positive meditation,
00:09:47 ‎our visualizing what’s to come, ‎will strengthen us?
00:09:51 ‎Yes, meaningful prayer,
00:09:53 ‎meaningful Bible study,
00:09:55 ‎meaningful reflection
00:09:58 ‎will help us to keep  ‎Jehovah’s day close in mind.
00:10:01 ‎It will help us to “rejoice in the hope,”
00:10:05 ‎and then we will experience the realization
00:10:08 ‎of all that we’ve hoped for ‎from the God “who cannot lie.”

00:00.883 --> 00:03.520
“He does not go back on his promise.” 


00:03.520 --> 00:05.155
Now, those words say a lot 


00:05.155 --> 00:06.923
about a person, don’t they? 


00:06.923 --> 00:09.191
What Bible examples are there of those 


00:09.192 --> 00:12.429
who please Jehovah by keeping their promise? 


00:12.428 --> 00:14.763
And what is in store for those who do so, 


00:14.763 --> 00:17.000
even when it is bad for them? 


00:18.468 --> 00:21.003
Well, we know Jesus, of course, 
is the foremost example 


00:21.003 --> 00:24.706
of one who kept his promise 
to do Jehovah’s will. 


00:24.707 --> 00:26.877
But imperfect people too 


00:26.877 --> 00:30.980
have displayed loyalty 
by keeping their promises. 


00:30.980 --> 00:34.750
For instance, in Joshua chapter 9, 


00:34.750 --> 00:38.688
we read that the Gibeonites 
tricked the chieftains of Israel 


00:38.688 --> 00:42.191
into concluding 
a covenant of peace with them. 


00:42.192 --> 00:47.197
Unwittingly, the Israelites 
promised not to destroy Gibeon. 


00:47.197 --> 00:49.732
What makes this of special interest 


00:49.732 --> 00:54.170
is that those disguised men 
were part of the Hivite nation, 


00:54.170 --> 00:57.273
which was considered 
to be a threat to Israel. 


00:57.273 --> 00:59.641
At Joshua 10:2, 


00:59.642 --> 01:04.000
it says 
that ‘all of Gibeon’s men were warriors.’ 


01:05.182 --> 01:08.350
What happened when Israel learned the truth? 


01:08.350 --> 01:11.687
Joshua 9:18 tells us: 


01:11.687 --> 01:14.190
“The Israelites did not attack them, 


01:14.190 --> 01:16.960
“because the chieftains of the assembly 


01:16.960 --> 01:19.228
“had sworn an oath to them 


01:19.228 --> 01:22.798
by Jehovah the God of Israel.” 


01:22.798 --> 01:26.770
Did Jehovah approve 
of their decision not to attack them? 


01:26.770 --> 01:29.305
Yes, he did, as events recorded 


01:29.305 --> 01:32.075
in Joshua chapter 10 go on to prove. 


01:32.075 --> 01:35.612
And we’ll come back to that in a few minutes. 


01:35.612 --> 01:38.882
In another example, 
Mordecai urged Esther 


01:38.882 --> 01:41.484
to go in before King Ahasuerus 


01:41.483 --> 01:44.853
and plead for his favor 
on behalf of the Jews. 


01:44.853 --> 01:47.190
Now, Esther knew 
that going in unannounced 


01:47.190 --> 01:49.192
could mean her life. 


01:49.192 --> 01:52.929
Mordecai, however, 
reasoned with her about the matter 


01:52.928 --> 01:55.096
and the importance of doing so, 


01:55.097 --> 01:59.302
and Esther gave him her word 
that she would go in. 


01:59.302 --> 02:01.304
Please notice what she says 


02:01.303 --> 02:05.808
in Esther 4:16, 


02:05.808 --> 02:07.810
in the final part of that verse. 


02:07.810 --> 02:09.812
She’s really giving her word. 


02:09.812 --> 02:12.349
She says: 
“I will go in to the king, 


02:12.348 --> 02:14.716
“which is against the law, 


02:14.717 --> 02:18.000
and if I am to perish, I will perish.” 


02:19.755 --> 02:23.927
Well, we know how it turned out 
for Esther, Mordecai, and the Jews. 


02:23.927 --> 02:25.929
Esther kept her word, 


02:25.928 --> 02:28.463
and they were all blessed for it, 
weren’t they? 


02:28.463 --> 02:31.466
Why did such ones live up to their word? 


02:31.467 --> 02:33.870
Because, among other things, 
they had qualities, 


02:33.870 --> 02:38.473
such as faith, loyalty, 
and love for Jehovah and for others. 


02:38.473 --> 02:43.478
The chieftains of Israel had faith 
and viewed Jehovah as real 


02:43.478 --> 02:47.483
and were aware 
of their promise to the Gibeonites. 


02:47.483 --> 02:52.021
Out of faith and loyalty, 
they would not go back on their word. 


02:52.022 --> 02:56.725
Also, Esther was moved by love 
to see the greater good 


02:56.725 --> 03:01.063
and to put her own life at risk 
in order to help her people. 


03:01.063 --> 03:03.900
Now, going back to our second question, 


03:03.900 --> 03:06.702
What is in store for those 
who keep their promises 


03:06.702 --> 03:09.939
even when it is bad for them? 


03:09.938 --> 03:14.000
Let’s look at the principle 
found at Mark 4:24. 


03:15.412 --> 03:19.000
Now, here Jesus said in part: 


03:21.117 --> 03:23.887
“With the measure that you are measuring out, 


03:23.887 --> 03:26.722
“you will have it measured out to you, 


03:26.722 --> 03:30.894
yes, you will have more added to you.” 


03:30.893 --> 03:33.596
Well, what is the principle here? 


03:33.597 --> 03:35.599
As the context shows, 


03:35.598 --> 03:38.533
Jesus was speaking about a person 


03:38.533 --> 03:42.271
receiving information and enlightenment 


03:42.272 --> 03:45.107
by paying attention to his words. 


03:45.107 --> 03:48.579
But this thought of having “more added” 


03:48.578 --> 03:50.580
can be seen in many ways. 


03:50.580 --> 03:54.517
For example, 
when we’re loyal to Jehovah, 


03:54.517 --> 03:58.370
he often blesses us 
with more than we might expect. 


03:58.370 --> 04:00.807
At times, even a surprise. 


04:00.807 --> 04:03.810
Psalm 84:11 says of him: 


04:03.810 --> 04:07.080
“Jehovah will not hold back anything good 


04:07.080 --> 04:10.032
from those walking in integrity.” 


04:10.032 --> 04:14.504
Now, going back to what happened 
with Israel and the Gibeonites, 


04:14.503 --> 04:16.871
we read in Joshua chapter 8 


04:16.872 --> 04:20.282
that in an earlier battle against Ai, 


04:20.282 --> 04:24.414
Jehovah helped Israel 
with a strategy that led to victory. 


04:24.413 --> 04:26.415
But the account does not say 


04:26.415 --> 04:30.887
that He performed 
astounding miracles in doing so. 


04:30.887 --> 04:34.924
On the other hand, in Joshua chapter 10, 


04:34.923 --> 04:37.660
we find something more. 


04:37.660 --> 04:40.663
After the Gibeonites 
tricked the chieftains of Israel 


04:40.663 --> 04:43.548
into making that covenant of peace with them, 


04:43.548 --> 04:48.570
the Gibeonites were threatened 
by an alliance of five kings of the Amorites. 


04:48.570 --> 04:50.940
What would the Israelites do? 


04:50.940 --> 04:53.408
Well, as we know, they kept their promise 


04:53.408 --> 04:56.861
and went out to defend the Gibeonites. 


04:56.862 --> 04:59.182
In verse 7 of chapter 10, 


04:59.182 --> 05:04.037
we read that Joshua 
and all his fighting men went out to do this, 


05:04.037 --> 05:08.257
and as they kept their word, 
Jehovah blessed them. 


05:08.257 --> 05:11.344
In verse 8, he said to them: 
“Do not be afraid . . . 


05:11.343 --> 05:16.281
Not one of them 
will be able to stand against you.” 


05:16.282 --> 05:19.885
Well, Jehovah was pleased 
with their decision, wasn’t he? 


05:19.885 --> 05:22.922
He showed his approval in a marvelous way. 


05:22.922 --> 05:26.659
Giant hailstones 
dropped down on their enemies, 


05:26.658 --> 05:30.396
and even the sun 
remained motionless in the sky 


05:30.397 --> 05:32.399
for about a whole day. 


05:32.398 --> 05:35.735
Chapter 10 and verse 14 says: 


05:35.735 --> 05:38.470
“There has never been a day like that one, 


05:38.470 --> 05:40.740
“either before it or after it, 


05:40.740 --> 05:43.910
“when Jehovah listened to the voice of a man, 


05:43.910 --> 05:47.663
for Jehovah was fighting for Israel.” 


05:47.663 --> 05:49.765
Yes, Jehovah really loved the Israelites, 


05:49.765 --> 05:51.783
didn’t he
—for keeping their promise? 


05:51.783 --> 05:55.688
And when the Israelites went to war 
for Gibeon, He supported them. 


05:55.688 --> 05:58.925
Or as they say, “He poured it on.”


05:58.925 --> 06:01.877
Have you ever sensed 
Jehovah doing that for you 


06:01.877 --> 06:05.915
when you stick to a difficult task, 
to a promise? 


06:05.915 --> 06:07.917
Isn’t it true that when we do so, 


06:07.917 --> 06:12.472
we often look back and see blessings 
that we never anticipated? 


06:12.472 --> 06:14.674
Among other things, 
we might be surprised 


06:14.673 --> 06:16.991
at how our faith has grown, 


06:16.992 --> 06:19.329
how our love has deepened, 


06:19.328 --> 06:24.083
and how things that we 
may have once viewed as overwhelming 


06:24.083 --> 06:26.168
are now manageable. 


06:26.168 --> 06:29.038
One Bethelite who endured in his assignment 


06:29.038 --> 06:32.741
in spite of the loss of his mother said this 


06:32.742 --> 06:35.377
—he also included 
some mistreatment by others—


06:35.377 --> 06:38.299
he said: 
“Sometimes we go through something 


06:38.298 --> 06:40.548
“we’ve never experienced before, 


06:40.548 --> 06:42.816
“and we may not understand why Jehovah 


06:42.817 --> 06:45.689
“does not do a specific thing we request. 


06:45.688 --> 06:48.891
“But when we endure, we see, 


06:48.892 --> 06:53.179
“one, his greater comprehension 
of the overall situation 


06:53.178 --> 06:57.048
“and, two, his desire for us to rely on him 


06:57.048 --> 06:59.385
“and know that he’s there for us, 


06:59.385 --> 07:02.053
“and that we’ve not lost his favor 


07:02.053 --> 07:05.256
“when we experience 
a difficult time in our life. 


07:05.257 --> 07:07.327
“As Jehovah helps us, 


07:07.327 --> 07:10.964
“we have to do as Genesis 24:21 says 


07:10.963 --> 07:15.000
and ‘stare in amazement’ 
as he answers our prayers.” 


07:16.663 --> 07:18.670
Well, that’s a beautiful thought. 


07:18.670 --> 07:20.973
And so the blessings may take a while, 


07:20.973 --> 07:24.176
but we can trust that Jehovah 
will be there to help us 


07:24.177 --> 07:26.212
at the right time. 


07:26.212 --> 07:28.230
That happened with Job. 


07:28.230 --> 07:33.018
He once said: “Until I die, 
I will not renounce my integrity!” 


07:33.018 --> 07:35.938
And he lived up to those words, didn’t he? 


07:35.938 --> 07:39.491
So much so that after enduring 
great sorrow and suffering 


07:39.492 --> 07:41.560
he was able to say: 


07:41.560 --> 07:43.863
“My ears have heard about you, 


07:43.863 --> 07:47.233
but now I do see you with my eyes.” 


07:47.233 --> 07:49.735
Yes, Job’s faith grew. 


07:49.735 --> 07:53.738
And, as we know, 
Jehovah eventually restored Job’s health, 


07:53.738 --> 07:58.643
doubled his wealth, 
and blessed him with a beautiful family. 


07:58.643 --> 08:01.096
We benefit from such Bible accounts. 


08:01.097 --> 08:04.150
Like Jehovah’s servants in the past, 


08:04.150 --> 08:06.652
we may suffer from persecution, 


08:06.652 --> 08:10.014
injustice, disasters, grief, 


08:10.013 --> 08:13.091
disappointments, or serious illness. 


08:13.092 --> 08:16.129
In addition, 
we may have to work hard 


08:16.128 --> 08:20.131
to fulfill our promise 
to be a good husband, wife, 


08:20.132 --> 08:22.902
or a friend in time of need. 


08:22.902 --> 08:24.687
The list is long. 


08:24.687 --> 08:29.109
And despite the difficulties 
or even the pain at times, we can do it. 


08:29.108 --> 08:33.711
We can imitate the faith 
of past and present examples 


08:33.712 --> 08:36.015
and live up to our promises


08:36.015 --> 08:41.753
—including, of course, 
our dedication vow to Jehovah. 


08:41.753 --> 08:45.725
Since Jehovah often does more 
for us than we might expect, 


08:45.725 --> 08:50.162
we’re confident 
that what he holds out for our future 


08:50.162 --> 08:52.899
is greater than we can now imagine. 


08:52.898 --> 08:56.501
As Psalm 31:19 says of Jehovah: 


08:56.502 --> 08:59.089
“How abundant your goodness is! 


08:59.088 --> 09:09.615
You have stored it up 
for those who fear you.”

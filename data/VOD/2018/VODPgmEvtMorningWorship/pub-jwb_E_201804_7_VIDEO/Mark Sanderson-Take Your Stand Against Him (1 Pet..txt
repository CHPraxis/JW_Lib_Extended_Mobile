00:01 Is it possible to survive
00:04 the attack of a roaring lion?
00:06 Well, now, I did some
00:08 —just quick— checking on various wildlife websites,
00:11 and here’s what they say.
00:13 Basically, they all give the same advice
00:16 if you’re being attacked by a lion.
00:18 They say: “Hold your ground.
00:21 Never run or turn back.”
00:24 In fact, one website says:
00:27 “A lion can run 50 miles per hour (80 km/h).
00:30 “So stand still.
00:33 If you run, you will only die tired.”
00:38 Well, that’s true.
00:40 First Peter 5:9
00:43 gives us exactly the same advice.
00:47 It says: “Take your stand against him.”
00:51 Well, in this case  not against a literal lion,
00:54 but against that “roaring lion,”  Satan the Devil,
00:58 who is seeking to devour  every single one of us.
01:03 Our ability to stand firm  when facing this lion
01:07 —to be able to oppose him,
01:10 to refuse to be intimidated by him,
01:13 to refuse to run away or turn back—
01:17 requires what the apostle Peter  next mentions there in verse 9,
01:22 and Brother Crane  so nicely covered in his comment.
01:25 We have to: “Take [our] stand against him,
01:28 firm in the faith.”
01:31 To be successful,  we must have complete trust
01:35 and complete confidence in Jehovah.
01:39 Well, now, in that regard,  let’s look at an example
01:42 of someone in Bible times who had  that kind of confidence in Jehovah.
01:47 This is in the days of King Jehoshaphat,
01:50 when Judah was threatened  by the combined forces
01:54 of Moab, Ammon,
01:56 and the inhabitants  of the mountainous region of Seir.
01:59 Now let’s begin by opening our Bibles
02:02 and reading 2 Chronicles 20:12.
02:08 So here Jehoshaphat is praying to Jehovah;
02:10 he’s pouring out his heart to him,  and see what he says:
02:14 “O our God,  will you not execute judgment on them?
02:19 “For we are powerless before this large crowd
02:23 “that is coming against us;
02:25 “and we do not know what we should do,
02:28 but our eyes are toward you.”
02:32 Well, Jehoshaphat was facing the lion.
02:36 He said to Jehovah:  ‘We don’t know what to do.’
02:40 But Jehoshaphat had complete and total trust;
02:45 he had firm faith in Jehovah.
02:48 Well, what did Jehovah  tell Jehoshaphat to do?
02:51 See verse 17:
02:54 “You will not need to fight this battle.
02:57 Take your position.”
02:59 Does that sound familiar?
03:01 “Take your position, stand still,
03:05 “and see the salvation of Jehovah  in your behalf.
03:09 “O Judah and Jerusalem,
03:11 “do not be afraid or be terrified.
03:13 “Tomorrow go out against them,
03:16 and Jehovah will be with you.”
03:19 Well, what did Jehovah tell them to do?
03:22 He said: ‘Take a position  in opposition to that military force,
03:27 ‘stand firm, refuse to run away,
03:30 and see the salvation  that will come from Jehovah.’
03:34 Well, in order to do that,
03:36 Jehoshaphat and the people with him
03:39 would need to have strong, firm, solid faith.
03:44 Well, now, to help the people,
03:46 look at what Jehoshaphat said to them
03:48 as they were getting ready for this battle.
03:50 In verse 20, you see,  just about the middle of the verse,
03:55 it says:  “Jehoshaphat stood up and said:
03:58 “‘Listen to me, O Judah  and you inhabitants of Jerusalem!
04:02 “‘Put faith in Jehovah your God
04:06 “‘so that you may be able to stand firm.
04:10 “‘Put faith in his prophets,
04:12 and you will be successful.’”
04:16 Well, that’s exactly what happened.
04:18 See, with that kind of confidence in Jehovah,
04:21 with that firm trust in him,  with that standing firm,
04:25 what did Jehovah do?
04:27 Well, according to verses 22 and 23
04:30 —you’ll remember what happened—
04:32 the men of Ammon, Moab,  and the inhabitants
04:35 of the mountainous region of Seir,
04:37 they all went to striking down one another.
04:41 And verse 23 says:
04:43 “And the Ammonites and the Moabites
04:45 “turned against the inhabitants  of the mountainous region of Seir
04:49 “to destroy and annihilate them;
04:51 “and when they finished  with the inhabitants of Seir,
04:54 they helped to destroy one another.”
04:58 Well, Jehovah had rewarded  their firm faith in him.
05:03 The weapons that had been formed
05:05 against Jehoshaphat and his people  had no success.
05:10 Well, now,  sometimes we think, of course,
05:12 that these kinds of situations  only happened in Bible times.
05:17 But it’s amazing to see  how our brothers in our modern day
05:21 have had that same kind of faith
05:23 and have stood firm against the lion.
05:27 Here are just a couple of experiences
05:29 that really touched my heart.
05:31 Here’s one about a brother  named Pavel from Russia.
05:35 In 1958,
05:37 Pavel was arrested for religious activities.
05:41 “Accompanying me to the train,” he says,
05:43 “the officer [with me] said,
05:45 “‘Look at your wife for the last time
05:48 because you will never see her again.’”
05:51 Well, there’s the lion.
05:53 “I spent six months  in solitary confinement before my trial.
05:58 “During interrogations, . . .  the investigators did everything
06:01 “to undermine my faith.
06:04 “Sometimes violence was used.
06:06 I begged Jehovah  to give me the strength to stay firm.”
06:11 But now look what happened.
06:14 “During a routine interrogation,
06:16 “the investigator called me  into his study and [he] said:
06:20 “‘Now we will show you  what your organization is doing.
06:24 “Then you can see  if it is God’s work or not!’
06:27 “Looking at me intently, he continued:
06:31 “‘This year your convention in New York
06:34 “‘was attended by 253,000 people
06:37 “‘in two stadiums.
06:39 “The convention lasted eight days.’
06:42 “The investigator strewed  the table with photographs.
06:46 “In one of them,  I saw happy delegates
06:49 “in colorful native dress  embracing one another.
06:52 “Another photo showed  Brother Knorr giving a talk,
06:55 “and yet others showed the baptism.
06:58 “The investigator could not even imagine
07:02 “what I was feeling at that moment.
07:04 “I felt that I was attending the convention
07:07 “without ever having left the prison.
07:10 “I felt new strength flooding into me.
07:14 “[It was just what] I had needed.
07:17 “. . . And Jehovah generously  blessed me in a special way.
07:21 I was ready to endure further.”
07:24 Isn’t that amazing?
07:26 Here’s another similar experience,
07:28 1960, also in Russia,
07:31 a large publicized trial  of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
07:34 About 300 persons  were present in the courtroom,
07:37 including many of our brothers and sisters.
07:41 Well, as the evidence—
07:43 As evidence against the brothers,
07:45 the prosecutor decided to present  a letter from Nathan H. Knorr.
07:50 One of the brothers  who attended the trial said this:
07:53 “The prosecutor loudly began to read a letter
07:57 “that had been intercepted by the KGB
07:59 “from Brother Knorr  to the brothers in the Soviet Union.
08:03 “For all of us Witnesses present in the hall,
08:06 “it was a wonderful gift from Jehovah.
08:08 “This letter warmed our hearts!
08:11 “We heard wise counsel from the Bible
08:14 “and encouragement to serve  our fellow believers lovingly
08:17 “and to stay faithful [even] under trials.
08:20 “The prosecutor read the letter
08:23 “from the beginning to the very end.
08:26 “We listened with rapt attention.
08:28 It seemed to us that we were  attending a convention!”
08:33 Well, now, brothers, what additional lessons
08:37 do we learn from these two experiences?
08:40 When we stand our ground against Satan,
08:44 firm in the faith,
08:46 then Jehovah will do just what he promised
08:49 at 1 Peter 5:10.
08:52 Do you see what it says there?
08:54 “But after you have suffered a little while,
08:57 “the God of all undeserved kindness,
09:00 “who called you to his everlasting glory  in union with Christ,
09:04 “will himself finish your training.
09:07 “He will make you firm,
09:09 “he will make you strong,
09:11 he will firmly ground you.”
09:14 So, brothers,
09:16 can we survive the attack of a roaring lion?
09:21 Absolutely!
09:23 With firm faith, let’s stand fast
09:27 and see the salvation from Jehovah.

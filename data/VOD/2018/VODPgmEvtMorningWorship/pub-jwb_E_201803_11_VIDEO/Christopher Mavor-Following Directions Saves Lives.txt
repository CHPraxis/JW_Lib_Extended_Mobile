00:01 There’s a railroad sign
00:03 that most of us have seen
00:04 before we cross a railroad track.
00:07 It says: “Stop, Look,
00:09 [and] Listen.”
00:12 And some will say:  “and Live.”
00:15 Now, why is  this sign there?
00:19 Because we know that  crossing a railroad track
00:23 can endanger our lives.
00:25 But the danger  is not so evident;
00:29 it’s not immediately seen.
00:31 It must be deduced
00:33 —you must use  your thinking abilities.
00:35 And that’s why  one sign says:
00:37 “See Tracks? Think Train!”
00:41 So we first must stop
00:45 and then look both ways
00:48 and then even engage  the sense of hearing to listen.
00:52 Do we hear a rumble?  a vibration in the earth?
00:55 Do we see a headlight coming our way?
00:59 Is a whistle blowing?
01:01 You see, all these indicate a danger.
01:04 The train is not in front of us immediately,
01:07 but we have to be aware  of the danger because,
01:11 as this picture shows, a fast moving train
01:15 just cannot stop immediately
01:17 if we happen to be in the middle  of the railroad tracks.
01:21 If we were there,  we definitely would be killed.
01:26 To avoid such a tragedy,
01:28 we therefore must use what the Bible calls
01:31 our “perceptive powers”
01:33 to discern the danger that is before us.
01:37 And then we must take appropriate action
01:41 to find safety to make sure  that we are not victimized by the danger.
01:46 Now, this well illustrates  what Jehovah has been telling us
01:50 through his Word  and through his organization.
01:53 Jehovah is telling us today to stop,
01:57 look, and listen.
02:01 Look around you.
02:03 Discern the times that we’re living in.
02:05 We’re living in the last days.
02:08 The end is very near.
02:10 The great tribulation is about to take place.
02:14 Now, it’s necessary to have discernment
02:17 in order to come to this conclusion.
02:19 Jesus said you would need discernment.
02:23 At Luke 17:20, 21,
02:26 he says that the Kingdom
02:28 would not be “coming  with striking observableness.”
02:33 It would take discernment  to understand the signs
02:37 and what it would mean  and what action to take.
02:41 This ability to discern requires cultivation
02:45 —we need to work on it.
02:47 The Bible at Hebrews 5:14
02:50 calls it the “powers of discernment”
02:53 or what we used to call  the “perceptive powers.”
02:57 And as we learned in yesterday’s text  when it referred to the prophet Daniel,
03:01 he was exemplary
03:03 in using his perceptive powers
03:06 to perceive, or to discern, the will of God.
03:10 And it was necessary for him to do so
03:12 in order to avoid the dangerous situation
03:15 that he and his companions were in
03:17 there at the palace in Babylon.
03:21 Now, Daniel continued to cultivate
03:23 these powers of discernment.
03:26 Later on in his life,
03:28 he made a deep study of the prophecies,
03:31 especially those of Jeremiah.
03:33 And then he concluded, or discerned,
03:36 where they were in the stream of time
03:38 —that the end  of the 70-year desolation of Jerusalem
03:41 was coming to its conclusion.
03:44 And this moved him to take  specific action to prepare himself
03:48 as well as other faithful Jews
03:52 so that they could proceed  with Jehovah’s will and purpose.
03:57 He therefore understood the times  and events that were taking place
04:01 because of the deep study that he did,
04:03 and he was able to discern
04:05 what was taking place  in the world around him.
04:09 Now, Jesus taught us to do  something very similar.
04:13 He told us to cultivate discernment,
04:16 and he used  a beautiful illustration to do that.
04:19 Open your Bibles, please,  to the book of Luke,
04:23 and we’ll look at chapter 21
04:26 and verses 29-31.
04:29 And here Jesus uses this technique  of “stop, look, listen, and live.”
04:34 He says in verse 29:
04:36 “Notice the fig tree  and all the other trees.”
04:39 So stop and look around you, he says.
04:42 And verse 30, it says:  “[And] when they are budding.”
04:45 In other words, look at these plants
04:47 and “you see it for yourselves
04:49 and know that now the summer is near.”
04:52 So discern it;  perceive what is taking place here.
04:56 And then he tells us and listen in verse 31:
05:00 “Likewise also you,  when you see these things happening,
05:04 know that the Kingdom of God is near.”
05:08 So here Jesus was telling us  to stop, look, listen,
05:12 and then we would live.
05:16 Now, “the faithful and discreet slave”
05:18 —they’re guided by the head  of the congregation, Jesus Christ.
05:22 And he is providing direction  to us in a very similar way
05:27 to help us sharpen  our powers of discernment
05:30 to comprehend and understand  what’s going on around us.
05:34 It’s through the pages of The Watchtower
05:37 and our assemblies and conventions
05:40 that we are told to stop —leave off your everyday life and concerns
05:44 and stop for a moment;
05:46 and then look into God’s Word
05:50 —read it and see what the Bible has to say
05:53 about Jehovah’s will and purpose  and especially our time period;
05:57 and then take time to listen
06:00 to the explanations provided
06:03 through “the faithful and discreet slave”
06:06 about prophecies and about our time period
06:09 and the nearness of the great tribulation.
06:12 Now, today, we are receiving  a very clear message
06:17 from Jehovah God’s organization
06:20 through Jesus Christ  and through “the faithful and discreet slave”
06:23 that the great tribulation is imminent.
06:27 Now, how should this information affect us?
06:32 Well, for one thing, the anxieties of life
06:35 —the things that immediately confront us  on a day-to-day basis—
06:38 can sap our energy  and can totally distract us
06:42 away from the bigger issues.
06:45 And Jesus warned us against this.
06:47 In fact, going back to the book  of Luke chapter 17,
06:50 there Jesus uses the accounts
06:53 of Noah as well as Sodom and Gomorrah  to be a warning to us.
06:58 There He says that the days of the Son of man
07:01 would be like the days of Noah and Sodom.
07:03 And why?  Because people would be distracted
07:06 with the mundane cares of life.
07:09 It’s these mundane cares of life
07:12 that can truly dull our powers of perception.
07:17 We would not be able to discern
07:19 where we are in the stream of time
07:21 or the danger that is confronting us.
07:26 So we have to really be careful  that we don’t allow these things
07:30 to dull our powers of discernment.
07:33 Otherwise, we can find ourselves  just wandering onto a railroad track
07:36 and not really looking,  not listening, being distracted,
07:40 and before you know it,  a train could overtake us.
07:43 And that’s exactly what is happening  to people in the world today.
07:46 They’re distracted by these things,  and they’re failing to take notice
07:50 that Jehovah God is coming  at them at full speed
07:54 to execute judgment  against Satan’s wicked world.
07:58 However, when we sharpen  our powers of discernment,
08:02 we clearly see the signs.
08:04 And Jesus said that you would.
08:06 He said at Luke 17:24
08:08 that it would be like lightning flashing
08:11 from one end of the sky  to the other end of the sky.
08:14 But it would be only  because our powers of discernment
08:17 would see these things and understand them.
08:21 Now, we see very clearly.
08:23 We look around at the political world today,
08:25 and we can see  these “lightning flashes” all around us.
08:28 In Daniel’s vision of chapter 2
08:32 —the iron and the clay  of the final world power—
08:34 we see how fragmented they are,
08:36 how weak and ineffectual  this world government is.
08:39 At 2 Timothy 3:1-5, the attitudes of people,
08:43 including those who are leaders in the world,
08:46 are arrogant and blasphemous and haughty.
08:49 These are clear indications
08:51 that we are very near the time of the end.
08:54 In fact, these individuals  and these governments
08:57 are very much like  an illustration that we saw
09:00 in the October 15, 1971,  issue of The Watchtower
09:04 of a little ant standing on a railroad track,
09:07 and here we see  God’s Kingdom coming at them.
09:10 And we, obviously,  see what the outcome will be.
09:14 They will be completely pulverized
09:17 by the power and speed
09:19 of Jehovah’s executional forces.
09:22 So we see, therefore, it’s important
09:26 for us to sharpen our powers of discernment
09:31 —to cultivate this quality— so that we are not caught off guard,
09:34 we always see the danger,  and we can take appropriate action.
09:38 So every day, let us stop, look,
09:41 and listen to Jehovah’s warnings.
09:45 This will help us stay out  of the danger zone,
09:48 and we’ll be able to survive  the end of this system of things,
09:52 and the great tribulation  will not catch us off guard.

00:00:01.685 --> 00:00:04.220 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, perhaps we could take our Bibles 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.258 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and turn to Colossians 3:​13. 

00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:10.727 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And let’s analyze this verse together 

00:00:10.727 --> 00:00:14.798 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and see what it is that Jehovah expects of us. 

00:00:14.798 --> 00:00:17.634 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So in Colossians 3:​13, 

00:00:17.634 --> 00:00:20.870 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎it says: 
“Continue putting up with one another 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.239 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and forgiving one another freely 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:27.110 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“even if anyone has a cause 
for complaint against another. 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.046 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Just as Jehovah freely forgave you, 

00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:32.649 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎you must also do the same.” 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:34.651 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, certainly this verse

00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:37.554 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎gives us plenty of food for thought
​—doesn’t it?​—

00:00:37.554 --> 00:00:41.591 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎areas in which, perhaps, 
we can work on and improve in. 

00:00:41.591 --> 00:00:43.993 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But what two things stand out 

00:00:43.993 --> 00:00:46.262 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as being required of us? 

00:00:46.262 --> 00:00:48.798 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, looking back, 
you notice the first one, 

00:00:48.798 --> 00:00:51.534 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“continue putting up with one another,” 

00:00:51.534 --> 00:00:53.937 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and then the second point, 

00:00:53.937 --> 00:00:56.973 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“forgiving one another freely.”

00:00:56.973 --> 00:00:59.375 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, let’s look at that first expression: 

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:01.978 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Continue putting up with one another.” 

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:05.482 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, what’s the difference 
between these two expressions? 

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:08.384 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, we’re told that this first expression 

00:01:08.384 --> 00:01:12.689 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎doesn’t refer to serious sins 
but perhaps talks about things 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.892 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that are irritating, annoying, 

00:01:15.892 --> 00:01:18.261 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎things that we may not necessarily 

00:01:18.261 --> 00:01:20.630 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎have a cause for complaint concerning, 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.033 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but they still get us very upset anyway

00:01:24.033 --> 00:01:26.736 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎​—these minor things. 

00:01:26.736 --> 00:01:28.872 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What are some of the things that annoy you?

00:01:28.872 --> 00:01:31.608 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Let’s be honest. 

00:01:31.608 --> 00:01:36.346 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Are you annoyed when someone is always late? 

00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:40.750 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Are you annoyed when they’re always early? 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.687 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Are you annoyed when someone is outspoken? 

00:01:44.687 --> 00:01:48.424 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Does it annoy you when someone is too quiet? 

00:01:48.424 --> 00:01:50.426 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s amazing​
—isn’t it?​—

00:01:50.426 --> 00:01:52.495 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎what the things that annoy us are.

00:01:52.495 --> 00:01:56.933 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I remember back in the ’70’s, 
Brother Knorr gave an outstanding talk

00:01:56.933 --> 00:02:01.437 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where he alluded to the fact 
that maybe there’s a sister in the congregation,

00:02:01.437 --> 00:02:04.474 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and she’s hearing 
this other sister, new in the truth,

00:02:04.474 --> 00:02:06.543 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎answering up time after time,

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:08.545 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and in her heart, she’s thinking,

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:11.648 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘Why doesn’t she just keep quiet?’ 

00:02:11.648 --> 00:02:14.851 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, maybe we’ve all 
experienced those feelings. 

00:02:14.851 --> 00:02:18.655 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And if we’re judged on them, 
perhaps we’ll agree: 

00:02:18.655 --> 00:02:21.524 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘Well, it’s not justified; 
I don’t really have a cause, 

00:02:21.524 --> 00:02:24.294 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but it still irritates me.’ 

00:02:24.294 --> 00:02:26.462 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s true—isn’t it?​—
the expression 

00:02:26.462 --> 00:02:30.700 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Sometimes it’s not the mountains 
ahead of us that cause problems, 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.802 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎it’s the pebble in the shoe.” 

00:02:32.802 --> 00:02:35.338 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And it’s sometimes the small things 

00:02:35.338 --> 00:02:37.640 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that irritate us the most.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.642 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I remember when I was serving 

00:02:39.642 --> 00:02:42.812 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in Western Samoa 
many years ago at the branch, 

00:02:42.812 --> 00:02:46.816 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we had quite a number of brothers 
from overseas working on construction. 

00:02:46.816 --> 00:02:50.653 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And there was one brother who had 
the habit of first thing in the morning 

00:02:50.653 --> 00:02:53.656 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as he arrived before breakfast, 

00:02:53.656 --> 00:02:58.127 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎saying, “Good morning!” to everyone. 

00:02:58.127 --> 00:03:01.431 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Some found that annoying. 

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:03.967 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Maybe you can relate to that. 

00:03:03.967 --> 00:03:07.170 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And, no doubt, you feel 
very happy when you read the scripture 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.874 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎at Proverbs 27:14, 
where it says in one translation: 

00:03:10.874 --> 00:03:14.177 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘A loud and cheerful greeting 
early in the morning 

00:03:14.177 --> 00:03:17.180 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is taken as a curse.’ 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.283 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You may be thinking, ‘Amen to that.’ 

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:23.953 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And that brother ceased his habit 
after he read that scripture​

00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:26.189 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—or at least it was read to him. 

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:30.894 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But we may not always be able 
to find a scripture 

00:03:30.894 --> 00:03:34.397 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that backs up this irritation that we feel. 

00:03:34.397 --> 00:03:35.899 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So, what do we do?

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:37.567 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, what does it say? 

00:03:37.567 --> 00:03:40.737 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Continue putting up with one another.” 

00:03:40.737 --> 00:03:45.041 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Continue”​—it’s something 
that we just have to keep on doing.

00:03:45.041 --> 00:03:48.311 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, that brings us 
to the second part of our verse, 

00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:51.614 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“forgiving one another freely.” 

00:03:51.614 --> 00:03:55.985 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s interesting, when we look 
at other translations of this verse,

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:58.821 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎most follow the King James Version 

00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:01.424 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and just say “forgive.” 

00:04:01.424 --> 00:04:05.762 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The New World Translation says ‘forgive freely.’ 

00:04:05.762 --> 00:04:08.298 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The reason is that this isn’t your normal

00:04:08.298 --> 00:04:10.934 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Greek word for “forgiveness.” 

00:04:10.934 --> 00:04:14.037 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It denotes generosity, 

00:04:14.037 --> 00:04:17.807 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a willingness to go beyond what’s required. 

00:04:17.807 --> 00:04:22.412 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s interesting 
that The Watchtower even back in 1882

00:04:22.412 --> 00:04:26.482 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was using that expression, 
to ‘forgive one another freely,’

00:04:26.482 --> 00:04:29.953 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎well before the time 
of the New World Translation.

00:04:29.953 --> 00:04:32.388 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So this gives us something to think about 

00:04:32.388 --> 00:04:35.391 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because it’s not just a matter of forgiving, 

00:04:35.391 --> 00:04:38.594 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but we need to be generous about forgiving. 

00:04:38.594 --> 00:04:43.266 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We have to be willing to,  
as it were, bestow a pardon 

00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:47.337 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎on someone 
who really doesn’t deserve that pardon.

00:04:47.337 --> 00:04:49.639 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, why should we be interested 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.942 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in developing 
and working on these two aspects: 

00:04:52.942 --> 00:04:56.980 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“putting up with one another” 
and ‘forgiving freely’? 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.917 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, we’ve heard 
the reasons many times before, haven’t we? 

00:05:00.917 --> 00:05:04.320 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The first one, of course, 
is that Jehovah has forgiven us. 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.923 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎If we turn back just one chapter, 

00:05:06.923 --> 00:05:10.860 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎chapter 2 of Colossians and verse 13,

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.563 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎this point is highlighted for us. 

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:16.666 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It says in chapter 2, verse 13: 

00:05:16.666 --> 00:05:19.902 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Furthermore, though you 
were dead in your trespasses 

00:05:19.902 --> 00:05:22.472 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and in the uncircumcised state of your flesh, 

00:05:22.472 --> 00:05:25.408 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“God made you alive together with him. 

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:30.413 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“He kindly forgave us 

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:32.682 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎all our trespasses.” 

00:05:32.682 --> 00:05:35.985 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So this is the model 
that Jehovah has given us. 

00:05:35.985 --> 00:05:40.390 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s true, 
we sometimes can find some reason

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.393 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎why we feel 
we don’t have to forgive someone else. 

00:05:43.393 --> 00:05:46.396 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But remember the illustration Jesus gave

00:05:46.396 --> 00:05:48.998 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the slave who had the huge debt. 

00:05:48.998 --> 00:05:51.367 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎If you calculated it in denarius, 

00:05:51.367 --> 00:05:55.471 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎there were 60 million denarii that he owed;

00:05:55.471 --> 00:05:57.473 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎he was forgiven that. 

00:05:57.473 --> 00:05:59.709 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Then he went after the other man 

00:05:59.709 --> 00:06:01.944 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎who owed him just a small amount. 

00:06:01.944 --> 00:06:04.480 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But have you ever thought 
that if you asked that slave, 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.482 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎maybe he would say: “Well, it’s true. 

00:06:06.482 --> 00:06:11.020 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I really appreciate having everything forgiven, 
but I still don’t have any money. 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.623 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I need some money, 
so that’s why I wanted to get 

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:16.492 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the other slave to give me the money.” 

00:06:16.492 --> 00:06:18.561 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, there’s always a reason
​—isn’t there?​—

00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:20.630 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎⁠even if it’s a distorted reason 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.933 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as to why we don’t follow Jehovah’s example. 

00:06:23.933 --> 00:06:28.371 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But looking back at Colossians 3:​13, 
what does it say? 

00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:33.076 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“If anyone has a cause 
for complaint against another.” 

00:06:33.076 --> 00:06:36.145 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So that gives us a good idea, doesn’t it?

00:06:36.145 --> 00:06:38.648 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The second reason, of course, is that 

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:41.851 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we do need others to forgive us. 

00:06:41.851 --> 00:06:45.855 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The very things that annoy us

00:06:45.855 --> 00:06:49.258 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and irritate us in others are sometimes

00:06:49.258 --> 00:06:51.494 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the same things that we do to others.

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:53.329 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Have you ever noticed that? 

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:55.965 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And how annoying it is 
when someone points that out to you: 

00:06:55.965 --> 00:06:58.000 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“You’re annoyed with that person? 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.603 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Don’t you realize what you do?” 

00:07:00.603 --> 00:07:03.439 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, that’s something good for us to remember​
—isn’t it?​—

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:06.509 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the fact that we do need 
to have others forgive us. 

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:08.511 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And then another reason

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:12.915 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is that it maintains the peace 
within the Christian congregation. 

00:07:12.915 --> 00:07:15.151 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The Watchtower made a comment on this. 

00:07:15.151 --> 00:07:20.089 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It said that in countries 
where our work is restricted or under ban, 

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:24.427 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎many of our brothers 
have to meet together in smaller groups. 

00:07:24.427 --> 00:07:26.829 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And when you do that, you get to know 

00:07:26.829 --> 00:07:29.966 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎everyone’s weaknesses and idiosyncrasies. 

00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:33.169 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s so much easier to be annoyed by others 

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:36.239 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when you’re dealing 
with small groups of persons. 

00:07:36.239 --> 00:07:38.541 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The Watchtower then made the comment 

00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:41.010 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎what good training it is for us now 

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.312 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to learn how to put up with one another

00:07:43.312 --> 00:07:45.381 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when we’re in larger groups, 

00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:49.652 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because later we may need 
to worship Jehovah in smaller groups. 

00:07:49.652 --> 00:07:54.457 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So it’s good training for us 
as we keep peace in the congregation.

00:07:54.457 --> 00:07:55.958 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And what can help us?

00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:59.328 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, there are many different things 
that can help us in this regard. 

00:07:59.328 --> 00:08:01.764 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The one point in the marginal reference

00:08:01.764 --> 00:08:05.067 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎you see there is at 1 Peter 4:​8, 

00:08:05.067 --> 00:08:07.069 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and that’s where it tells us we need 

00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:10.806 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to “have intense love for one another”​

00:08:10.806 --> 00:08:13.409 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—not just love but “intense love.” 

00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:16.646 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And this word “intense” means “full strength.” 

00:08:16.646 --> 00:08:20.449 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Literally, it means “to stretch out our love.” 

00:08:20.449 --> 00:08:25.488 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So as we come across these things 
that irritate us, annoy us, in life 

00:08:25.488 --> 00:08:29.892 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or if we come across persons 
who actually do sin against us, 

00:08:29.892 --> 00:08:31.928 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎what should we keep in mind? 

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:34.997 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Continue putting up with one another.” 

00:08:34.997 --> 00:08:38.234 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘Continue freely forgiving one another.’

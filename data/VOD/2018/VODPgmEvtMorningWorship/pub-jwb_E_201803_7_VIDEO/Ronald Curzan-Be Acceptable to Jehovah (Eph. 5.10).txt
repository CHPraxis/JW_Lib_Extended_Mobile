00:01 These were very practical comments.
00:02 And they all tie in well
00:04 with what the apostle Paul was trying to tell
00:07 those in the Ephesian congregation
00:10 about examining themselves.
00:12 The same way we have to do today
00:14 —examining ourselves  so that we please Jehovah.
00:16 If you’d like,  please open up to Ephesians chapter 5,
00:20 and we’ll read verse 10,  which is our theme scripture.
00:24 Ephesians 5:10, it says:
00:28 “Keep on making sure  of what is acceptable to the Lord.”
00:31 And then it goes on in verse 11:
00:34 “And stop sharing in the unfruitful works  that belong to the darkness;
00:39 rather, expose them for what they are.”
00:43 So it’s very clear to us,  in this chapter of Ephesians chapter 5,
00:48 that there are things  that Jehovah views as acceptable
00:52 and things he views as unacceptable.
00:55 Jehovah’s standard of what is unacceptable
00:58 is outlined in quite a few  of the verses in chapter 5 here.
01:01 If you would just scan  through verses 3, 4, and 5,
01:06 we’ll see that unwholesome talk about sex,
01:09 shameful conduct, obscene jesting
01:13 —and then verse 18, drunkenness—
01:16 well, these are things  that will bar us from God’s Kingdom.
01:20 When you think  about entertainment today,
01:23 it’s nearly impossible  to try to find something
01:25 that is acceptable to Jehovah
01:27 that does not have  immoral sex, pornography,
01:31 spiritism, and violence.
01:33 Satan has thoroughly saturated  all forms of the media.
01:37 So thoroughly,  that it’s in our literature,
01:40 it’s in movies,  it’s in electronic games,
01:42 and everything that we  can think of Satan has infiltrated.
01:46 Yes, he knows that Jehovah  hates these things,
01:50 and he doesn’t mind if part of our heart  hates these things
01:54 as long as part of our heart  loves these things.
01:57 So we do well to ask ourselves:
02:00 ‘Does the entertainment that I choose help me
02:04 ‘in my being acceptable to Jehovah?
02:06 ‘Does it help me to have the qualities
02:10 ‘that Jehovah endears in me,
02:12 and will he draw closer to me?’
02:14 Well, the spirit of the world  reflects rebellion of the Bible,
02:18 which outlines  Jehovah’s qualities and his standards.
02:22 We want to show respect for the Bible,
02:25 which teaches us  to love what Jehovah loves
02:28 and hate what he hates.
02:31 And what will help us to do this  and resist the spirit of the world
02:35 and draw closer to Jehovah  and be acceptable to him?
02:38 Let’s notice verse 17,
02:40 chapter 5 and verse 17, it says:
02:44 “On this account stop being unreasonable,
02:46 but keep perceiving  what the will of Jehovah is.”
02:51 We need to constantly think:
02:53 ‘What would Jehovah want me to do?’
02:56 Well, verse 1 and verse 2  help us to appreciate this, it says:
03:00 “Become imitators of God,  as beloved children,
03:03 “and go on walking in love,  just as the Christ also loved us
03:07 “and [he] gave himself [up]  for us as an offering
03:10 and a sacrifice,  a sweet fragrance to God.”
03:14 So, bottom line,  we need to imitate Jehovah and Jesus.
03:18 Our sacrifices need to be  acceptable to Jehovah
03:22 as was Jesus’.
03:24 What made Jesus so pleasing?
03:27 Well, he did everything  the way Jehovah wanted him to do.
03:31 In fact, he said something  that we want to say one day:
03:34 “I always do the things pleasing to him.”
03:37 And one day in perfection,  we will be able to say that.
03:40 Jesus was pleasing  in his word, in his deed, in his actions.
03:44 Well, how can we imitate Jesus  and thus imitate Jehovah?
03:48 Well, let’s briefly discuss three ways.
03:51 First: Pray for God’s holy spirit.
03:54 When confronted with trials,  what did Jesus do?
03:57 He did not rely on himself;  he petitioned Jehovah for help.
04:02 So if we’re struggling with a temptation
04:04 —a certain fleshly weakness—
04:06 it’s vital that we do the same.
04:09 We can also talk to the elders —our loving shepherds—
04:11 who will pray with us, and they will definitely help us
04:15 to remain faithful  with words of encouragement.
04:19 Number two: Obey Jehovah completely.
04:23 Jesus always did things  that were pleasing to his Father.
04:26 Luke 22:42 says:
04:29 “Let, not my will, but yours take place.”
04:32 Remember,  there is no substitute for obedience.
04:36 We cannot be acceptable without obedience.
04:39 Number three: Know the Scriptures well.
04:42 Jesus used God’s Word as his authority.
04:46 His whole life revolved around knowing
04:49 and obeying and encouraging others  about God’s laws.
04:52 We all have busy schedules.
04:54 We have work to do  —busy in the congregation.
04:57 It’s more than just trying to find time  to dig deep into God’s Word;
05:01 we must make the time.
05:03 So, what do our schedules tell us
05:06 about our love for Jehovah?
05:09 our love for his Word?
05:11 Do we read the Bible daily?
05:14 And if we do,  how much time do we take
05:17 to let it sink into our mind  and our heart and to meditate?
05:22 Are we content with just looking
05:24 at the basics —the surface—
05:26 or digging deeper and deeper  below the surface?
05:31 It’s vital that we train  our minds and our hearts,
05:34 but it takes time  and it takes effort,
05:37 just as a marathon runner  must devote much time and effort
05:40 to his training to run a race.
05:43 In fact, as we know,  Christians are likened
05:45 to running a race,  and it’s a race for life.
05:47 Let’s see  what the apostle Paul had to tell us.
05:49 If we go over to 1 Corinthians,
05:53 1 Corinthians chapter 9,
05:56 a scripture we know very well,  and we’ll start in verse 24.
06:01 And there are a few key elements
06:02 that we would like to extract  as we’re reading these verses.
06:05 Here Paul said:
06:07 “Do you not know  that the runners in a race all run,
06:09 “but only one receives the prize?
06:12 “Run in such a way that you may win it.
06:16 “Now everyone competing in a contest
06:18 “exercises self-control in all things  [there’s a key].
06:22 “Of course, they do it  to receive a crown that can perish,
06:25 “but we, one that does not perish.
06:28 “Therefore, the way  I am running is not aimlessly;
06:31 “the way I am aiming my blows
06:33 “is so as not to be striking the air;
06:37 “but I pummel my body
06:39 “[and the footnote says,  “punish; strictly discipline”]
06:42 “and lead it as a slave,  so that after I have preached to others,
06:46 “I myself should not become disapproved
06:50 [or the footnote says, “disqualified”]  somehow.”
06:55 So we definitely want to have  self-control like a runner.
06:58 We need to say no to Satan’s world
07:00 and yes to things  that are acceptable to Jehovah.
07:04 And we definitely want  to make sure that we are acceptable
07:07 and never to be disapproved.
07:10 Perhaps we can illustrate this.
07:12 In the 1994 New York City Marathon,
07:15 there was a young man named German Silva,
07:18 and he ran an outstanding race.
07:21 In fact, there was only half a mile  to the finish line in Central Park,
07:25 and somehow he got distracted.
07:27 He took the wrong path.
07:29 Did he lose the race?
07:31 Well, the lead runner took over.
07:33 Well, he got redirected;  he went back on the path;
07:36 he began to run faster and faster.
07:39 He passed up the lead runner,
07:41 and he won the New York City Marathon  by two seconds.
07:44 What does this tell us?
07:46 It tells us that sometimes  we can lose our focus, we can be sidetracked,
07:50 or we could get involved  in unacceptable conduct.
07:54 But allow God’s Word  and loving shepherds to readjust our course.
07:59 Never give up.
08:01 Just a few years later, after that —1997—
08:04 German began running again  in a New York City Marathon.
08:07 He thought he had this one all in the bag;
08:10 he thought he was going to win this race.
08:12 But he started to run slower.
08:14 He began to—  He dehydrated.
08:17 Instead of taking  just a few seconds to hydrate,
08:20 he skipped that.
08:21 He thought he could do it.
08:23 Well, what could this tell us?
08:25 Well, we cannot afford to take shortcuts.
08:27 We need to have  a regular intake of spiritual food
08:30 to keep pace with Jehovah’s organization.
08:33 We do this  by what the commenters told us today,
08:36 that is, a regular intake  of God’s Word and meditation.
08:39 As we run the Christian course —the race for life—
08:42 remember, it’s not the speed,  it’s the direction
08:46 —that’s what matters the most.
08:48 And may we always run in such a way  that is acceptable to Jehovah.

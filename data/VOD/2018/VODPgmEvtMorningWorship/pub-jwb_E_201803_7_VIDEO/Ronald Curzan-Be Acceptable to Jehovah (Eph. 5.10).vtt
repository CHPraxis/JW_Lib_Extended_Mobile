00:01.050 --> 00:02.785
These were very practical comments. 


00:02.785 --> 00:04.353
And they all tie in well 


00:04.353 --> 00:07.056
with what the apostle Paul was trying to tell 


00:07.057 --> 00:10.094
those in the Ephesian congregation 


00:10.093 --> 00:12.161
about examining themselves. 


00:12.162 --> 00:14.164
The same way we have to do today 


00:14.163 --> 00:16.966
—examining ourselves 
so that we please Jehovah. 


00:16.967 --> 00:20.037
If you’d like, 
please open up to Ephesians chapter 5, 


00:20.037 --> 00:24.740
and we’ll read verse 10, 
which is our theme scripture. 


00:24.740 --> 00:28.612
Ephesians 5:10, it says: 


00:28.612 --> 00:31.999
“Keep on making sure 
of what is acceptable to the Lord.” 


00:31.998 --> 00:34.031
And then it goes on in verse 11: 


00:34.032 --> 00:39.037
“And stop sharing in the unfruitful works 
that belong to the darkness; 


00:39.037 --> 00:43.810
rather, expose them for what they are.” 


00:43.810 --> 00:48.815
So it’s very clear to us, 
in this chapter of Ephesians chapter 5, 


00:48.815 --> 00:52.385
that there are things 
that Jehovah views as acceptable 


00:52.385 --> 00:55.422
and things he views as unacceptable. 


00:55.422 --> 00:58.425
Jehovah’s standard of what is unacceptable 


00:58.425 --> 01:01.978
is outlined in quite a few 
of the verses in chapter 5 here. 


01:01.978 --> 01:06.815
If you would just scan 
through verses 3, 4, and 5, 


01:06.815 --> 01:09.918
we’ll see that unwholesome talk about sex, 


01:09.918 --> 01:13.283
shameful conduct, obscene jesting 


01:13.283 --> 01:16.120
—and then verse 18, drunkenness—


01:16.120 --> 01:20.930
well, these are things 
that will bar us from God’s Kingdom. 


01:20.930 --> 01:23.032
When you think 
about entertainment today, 


01:23.032 --> 01:25.535
it’s nearly impossible 
to try to find something 


01:25.535 --> 01:27.837
that is acceptable to Jehovah 


01:27.837 --> 01:31.074
that does not have 
immoral sex, pornography, 


01:31.073 --> 01:33.510
spiritism, and violence. 


01:33.510 --> 01:37.747
Satan has thoroughly saturated 
all forms of the media. 


01:37.747 --> 01:40.117
So thoroughly, 
that it’s in our literature, 


01:40.117 --> 01:42.452
it’s in movies, 
it’s in electronic games, 


01:42.452 --> 01:46.605
and everything that we 
can think of Satan has infiltrated. 


01:46.605 --> 01:50.177
Yes, he knows that Jehovah 
hates these things, 


01:50.177 --> 01:54.314
and he doesn’t mind if part of our heart 
hates these things 


01:54.313 --> 01:57.983
as long as part of our heart 
loves these things. 


01:57.983 --> 02:00.286
So we do well to ask ourselves: 


02:00.287 --> 02:04.024
‘Does the entertainment that I choose help me 


02:04.023 --> 02:06.876
‘in my being acceptable to Jehovah? 


02:06.877 --> 02:10.079
‘Does it help me to have the qualities 


02:10.078 --> 02:12.181
‘that Jehovah endears in me, 


02:12.182 --> 02:14.384
and will he draw closer to me?’


02:14.383 --> 02:18.521
Well, the spirit of the world 
reflects rebellion of the Bible, 


02:18.522 --> 02:22.592
which outlines 
Jehovah’s qualities and his standards. 


02:22.592 --> 02:25.049
We want to show respect for the Bible, 


02:25.048 --> 02:28.251
which teaches us 
to love what Jehovah loves 


02:28.252 --> 02:31.100
and hate what he hates. 


02:31.100 --> 02:35.205
And what will help us to do this 
and resist the spirit of the world 


02:35.205 --> 02:38.307
and draw closer to Jehovah 
and be acceptable to him? 


02:38.307 --> 02:40.315
Let’s notice verse 17, 


02:40.315 --> 02:44.580
chapter 5 and verse 17, it says: 


02:44.580 --> 02:46.983
“On this account stop being unreasonable, 


02:46.983 --> 02:51.955
but keep perceiving 
what the will of Jehovah is.” 


02:51.955 --> 02:53.957
We need to constantly think: 


02:53.957 --> 02:56.425
‘What would Jehovah want me to do?’ 


02:56.425 --> 03:00.330
Well, verse 1 and verse 2 
help us to appreciate this, it says: 


03:00.330 --> 03:03.298
“Become imitators of God, 
as beloved children, 


03:03.298 --> 03:07.503
“and go on walking in love, 
just as the Christ also loved us 


03:07.503 --> 03:10.406
“and [he] gave himself [up] 
for us as an offering 


03:10.407 --> 03:14.477
and a sacrifice, 
a sweet fragrance to God.” 


03:14.477 --> 03:18.782
So, bottom line, 
we need to imitate Jehovah and Jesus. 


03:18.782 --> 03:22.319
Our sacrifices need to be 
acceptable to Jehovah 


03:22.318 --> 03:24.453
as was Jesus’.


03:24.453 --> 03:27.190
What made Jesus so pleasing? 


03:27.190 --> 03:31.093
Well, he did everything 
the way Jehovah wanted him to do. 


03:31.093 --> 03:34.496
In fact, he said something 
that we want to say one day: 


03:34.497 --> 03:37.367
“I always do the things pleasing to him.” 


03:37.367 --> 03:40.304
And one day in perfection, 
we will be able to say that. 


03:40.303 --> 03:44.740
Jesus was pleasing 
in his word, in his deed, in his actions. 


03:44.740 --> 03:48.878
Well, how can we imitate Jesus 
and thus imitate Jehovah? 


03:48.878 --> 03:51.646
Well, let’s briefly discuss three ways. 


03:51.647 --> 03:54.850
First: Pray for God’s holy spirit. 


03:54.850 --> 03:57.953
When confronted with trials, 
what did Jesus do? 


03:57.953 --> 04:02.025
He did not rely on himself; 
he petitioned Jehovah for help. 


04:02.025 --> 04:04.593
So if we’re struggling with a temptation 


04:04.593 --> 04:06.695
—a certain fleshly weakness—


04:06.695 --> 04:09.382
it’s vital that we do the same. 


04:09.382 --> 04:11.999
We can also talk to the elders
—our loving shepherds—


04:11.998 --> 04:15.821
who will pray with us,
and they will definitely help us 


04:15.822 --> 04:19.309
to remain faithful 
with words of encouragement.


04:19.308 --> 04:23.478
Number two: Obey Jehovah completely. 


04:23.478 --> 04:26.915
Jesus always did things 
that were pleasing to his Father. 


04:26.915 --> 04:29.252
Luke 22:42 says: 


04:29.252 --> 04:32.889
“Let, not my will, but yours take place.” 


04:32.888 --> 04:36.225
Remember, 
there is no substitute for obedience. 


04:36.225 --> 04:39.528
We cannot be acceptable without obedience. 


04:39.528 --> 04:42.998
Number three: Know the Scriptures well. 


04:42.998 --> 04:46.068
Jesus used God’s Word as his authority. 


04:46.068 --> 04:49.038
His whole life revolved around knowing 


04:49.038 --> 04:52.841
and obeying and encouraging others 
about God’s laws. 


04:52.842 --> 04:54.844
We all have busy schedules. 


04:54.843 --> 04:57.646
We have work to do 
—busy in the congregation. 


04:57.647 --> 05:01.450
It’s more than just trying to find time 
to dig deep into God’s Word; 


05:01.450 --> 05:03.987
we must make the time. 


05:03.987 --> 05:06.789
So, what do our schedules tell us 


05:06.788 --> 05:09.425
about our love for Jehovah? 


05:09.425 --> 05:11.960
our love for his Word? 


05:11.960 --> 05:14.347
Do we read the Bible daily? 


05:14.347 --> 05:17.050
And if we do, 
how much time do we take 


05:17.050 --> 05:22.572
to let it sink into our mind 
and our heart and to meditate? 


05:22.572 --> 05:24.574
Are we content with just looking 


05:24.573 --> 05:26.575
at the basics
—the surface—


05:26.575 --> 05:30.000
or digging deeper and deeper 
below the surface?


05:31.030 --> 05:34.200
It’s vital that we train 
our minds and our hearts, 


05:34.200 --> 05:37.002
but it takes time 
and it takes effort, 


05:37.002 --> 05:40.340
just as a marathon runner 
must devote much time and effort 


05:40.340 --> 05:43.325
to his training to run a race. 


05:43.325 --> 05:45.695
In fact, as we know, 
Christians are likened 


05:45.695 --> 05:47.897
to running a race, 
and it’s a race for life. 


05:47.897 --> 05:49.899
Let’s see 
what the apostle Paul had to tell us. 


05:49.898 --> 05:53.986
If we go over to 1 Corinthians, 


05:53.987 --> 05:56.405
1 Corinthians chapter 9, 


05:56.405 --> 06:01.060
a scripture we know very well, 
and we’ll start in verse 24. 


06:01.060 --> 06:02.678
And there are a few key elements 


06:02.678 --> 06:05.313
that we would like to extract 
as we’re reading these verses. 


06:05.313 --> 06:07.098
Here Paul said: 


06:07.098 --> 06:09.785
“Do you not know 
that the runners in a race all run, 


06:09.785 --> 06:12.455
“but only one receives the prize? 


06:12.455 --> 06:16.175
“Run in such a way that you may win it. 


06:16.175 --> 06:18.762
“Now everyone competing in a contest 


06:18.762 --> 06:22.549
“exercises self-control in all things 
[there’s a key]. 


06:22.548 --> 06:25.718
“Of course, they do it 
to receive a crown that can perish, 


06:25.718 --> 06:28.120
“but we, one that does not perish. 


06:28.120 --> 06:31.757
“Therefore, the way 
I am running is not aimlessly; 


06:31.757 --> 06:33.794
“the way I am aiming my blows 


06:33.793 --> 06:37.113
“is so as not to be striking the air; 


06:37.113 --> 06:39.248
“but I pummel my body 


06:39.248 --> 06:42.851
“[and the footnote says, 
“punish; strictly discipline”] 


06:42.852 --> 06:46.722
“and lead it as a slave, 
so that after I have preached to others, 


06:46.722 --> 06:50.092
“I myself should not become disapproved 


06:50.092 --> 06:54.000
[or the footnote says, “disqualified”] 
somehow.” 


06:55.032 --> 06:58.700
So we definitely want to have 
self-control like a runner. 


06:58.700 --> 07:00.837
We need to say no to Satan’s world 


07:00.837 --> 07:04.174
and yes to things 
that are acceptable to Jehovah. 


07:04.173 --> 07:07.810
And we definitely want 
to make sure that we are acceptable 


07:07.810 --> 07:10.447
and never to be disapproved. 


07:10.447 --> 07:12.515
Perhaps we can illustrate this. 


07:12.515 --> 07:15.685
In the 1994 New York City Marathon, 


07:15.685 --> 07:18.520
there was a young man named German Silva, 


07:18.520 --> 07:21.257
and he ran an outstanding race. 


07:21.257 --> 07:25.427
In fact, there was only half a mile 
to the finish line in Central Park, 


07:25.427 --> 07:27.464
and somehow he got distracted. 


07:27.463 --> 07:29.465
He took the wrong path. 


07:29.465 --> 07:31.100
Did he lose the race? 


07:31.100 --> 07:33.302
Well, the lead runner took over. 


07:33.302 --> 07:36.589
Well, he got redirected; 
he went back on the path; 


07:36.588 --> 07:39.191
he began to run faster and faster. 


07:39.192 --> 07:41.194
He passed up the lead runner, 


07:41.193 --> 07:44.896
and he won the New York City Marathon 
by two seconds. 


07:44.897 --> 07:46.899
What does this tell us? 


07:46.898 --> 07:50.903
It tells us that sometimes 
we can lose our focus, we can be sidetracked, 


07:50.903 --> 07:54.940
or we could get involved 
in unacceptable conduct. 


07:54.940 --> 07:59.478
But allow God’s Word 
and loving shepherds to readjust our course. 


07:59.478 --> 08:01.480
Never give up. 


08:01.480 --> 08:04.250
Just a few years later, after that
—1997—


08:04.250 --> 08:07.520
German began running again 
in a New York City Marathon. 


08:07.520 --> 08:10.623
He thought he had this one all in the bag; 


08:10.623 --> 08:12.641
he thought he was going to win this race. 


08:12.642 --> 08:14.727
But he started to run slower. 


08:14.727 --> 08:17.264
He began to— 
He dehydrated. 


08:17.263 --> 08:20.365
Instead of taking 
just a few seconds to hydrate, 


08:20.365 --> 08:21.867
he skipped that. 


08:21.867 --> 08:23.202
He thought he could do it. 


08:23.202 --> 08:25.204
Well, what could this tell us? 


08:25.203 --> 08:27.506
Well, we cannot afford to take shortcuts. 


08:27.507 --> 08:30.777
We need to have 
a regular intake of spiritual food 


08:30.777 --> 08:33.245
to keep pace with Jehovah’s organization. 


08:33.245 --> 08:36.248
We do this 
by what the commenters told us today, 


08:36.248 --> 08:39.918
that is, a regular intake 
of God’s Word and meditation. 


08:39.918 --> 08:42.921
As we run the Christian course
—the race for life—


08:42.922 --> 08:46.259
remember, it’s not the speed, 
it’s the direction


08:46.258 --> 08:48.326
—that’s what matters the most. 


08:48.327 --> 08:58.905
And may we always run in such a way 
that is acceptable to Jehovah.

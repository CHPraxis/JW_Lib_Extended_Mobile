00:01.667 --> 00:03.787
“If they have persecuted me, 


00:03.787 --> 00:06.089
they will also persecute you” 


00:06.088 --> 00:07.756
—Jesus’ words. 


00:07.757 --> 00:11.695
And Paul saw the truth of Jesus’ words. 


00:11.695 --> 00:14.330
As a follower of Jesus, Paul experienced 


00:14.330 --> 00:17.300
much persecution and tribulation. 


00:17.300 --> 00:19.968
And isn’t it true 
that we see the same today? 


00:19.968 --> 00:24.040
Satan still challenges 
the integrity of Jehovah’s people. 


00:24.040 --> 00:28.243
In fact, the Bible indicates 
that Satan will increase his attacks 


00:28.243 --> 00:31.013
on Jehovah’s people in these last days. 


00:31.013 --> 00:32.781
And we see this happening. 


00:32.782 --> 00:35.952
As we look at the attacks being made 
on Jehovah’s people around the world, 


00:35.952 --> 00:38.422
we think of our brothers in Eritrea, 


00:38.422 --> 00:41.190
our brothers in Korea, 
in Russia, other places, 


00:41.190 --> 00:43.192
and even smaller attacks 


00:43.192 --> 00:45.762
that we may not even personally hear about. 


00:45.762 --> 00:49.865
Truly, Jesus’ words 
are being fulfilled today. 


00:49.865 --> 00:51.902
But the question 
we want to consider today is, 


00:51.902 --> 00:54.604
What about us personally? 


00:54.603 --> 00:57.306
See, the text says 
that ‘if they’ve persecuted me,’ 


00:57.307 --> 01:00.977
Jesus said, 
‘they will persecute you.’ 


01:00.977 --> 01:04.247
At 2 Timothy 3:12, it says: 


01:04.247 --> 01:08.685
“All those desiring 
to live with godly devotion . . . 


01:08.685 --> 01:10.753
will also be persecuted.” 


01:10.753 --> 01:12.755
So that means we’re not exempt. 


01:12.755 --> 01:15.692
And as our text highlights, 
things can quickly turn. 


01:15.692 --> 01:19.095
Sometimes it’s outright persecution 
from governments 


01:19.095 --> 01:21.297
or opposition from family members. 


01:21.297 --> 01:24.567
In other cases, 
it may be efforts to block our work 


01:24.567 --> 01:29.305
or hamper a theocratic project 
or another initiative. 


01:29.305 --> 01:31.540
How will we do 


01:31.540 --> 01:35.445
when faced with persecution 
and opposition? 


01:35.445 --> 01:38.448
Now, it’s easy to say “Trust in Jehovah,” 
and we know we need to do that. 


01:38.448 --> 01:39.948
But what does that mean? 


01:39.948 --> 01:41.951
How do we know what decisions to make? 


01:41.952 --> 01:43.487
What’s the right decision? 


01:43.487 --> 01:45.122
What’s not the right decision? 


01:45.122 --> 01:48.390
Are there principles that can guide us? 


01:48.390 --> 01:50.760
Well, let’s consider three of them. 


01:50.760 --> 01:54.530
The first one is 
that the apparent easy solution 


01:54.530 --> 01:56.532
out of a situation 


01:56.532 --> 01:59.269
may not be the right solution. 


01:59.268 --> 02:01.736
Look in Isaiah chapter 30, 


02:01.737 --> 02:06.042
and we’ll look at a solution 
that the kings of Israel and Judah 


02:06.042 --> 02:08.945
fell back on from time to time. 


02:08.945 --> 02:12.000
Isaiah chapter 30, 
and let’s read verses 1 and 2. 


02:14.450 --> 02:16.618
It says: 
“‘Woe to the stubborn sons,’ 


02:16.618 --> 02:18.621
“declares Jehovah, 


02:18.622 --> 02:22.325
“‘who carry out plans that are not mine, 


02:22.325 --> 02:25.362
“‘who make alliances, but not by my spirit, 


02:25.362 --> 02:28.064
“‘in order to add sin to sin. 


02:28.063 --> 02:31.133
“‘They go down to Egypt 
without consulting me, 


02:31.133 --> 02:34.136
“‘to take shelter under Pharaoh’s protection 


02:34.137 --> 02:38.074
and to take refuge 
in the shadow of Egypt!’” 


02:38.073 --> 02:40.976
You see, the nation 
thought it was a good solution 


02:40.977 --> 02:45.949
to enlist Egypt’s aid 
to keep off the Babylonians and others. 


02:45.948 --> 02:49.618
That seemed to be the best choice, 
and we saw over and over again 


02:49.618 --> 02:52.755
that the unfaithful kings 
of Israel and Judah did that. 


02:52.755 --> 02:55.858
They chose to strike deals 
with Jehovah’s enemies 


02:55.858 --> 02:59.395
to protect them 
from other enemies of Jehovah. 


02:59.395 --> 03:03.867
And so when under attack, 
when facing opposition, 


03:03.867 --> 03:07.404
we too may be encouraged to strike a deal 


03:07.403 --> 03:11.306
—maybe a bit of a compromise 
to lessen the pressure. 


03:11.307 --> 03:14.710
But now, at other times, 
we notice that Paul and others 


03:14.710 --> 03:18.180
did appeal to government officials 
or appealed to Caesar, 


03:18.180 --> 03:20.182
and Jehovah blessed that. 


03:20.182 --> 03:22.185
So what’s the lesson? 


03:22.185 --> 03:26.088
Well, the lesson is that we need 
to make sure that we’re following a course 


03:26.088 --> 03:28.891
that is in harmony with Jehovah’s purpose 


03:28.892 --> 03:30.927
and that is backed by his spirit. 


03:30.927 --> 03:32.962
So we need to prayerfully make sure 


03:32.962 --> 03:36.265
that the arrangement 
that we’re working out is Jehovah’s will 


03:36.265 --> 03:39.702
and to remember that the logical solution 


03:39.702 --> 03:41.737
from man’s perspective 


03:41.737 --> 03:45.375
may not always be Jehovah’s solution. 


03:45.375 --> 03:47.410
Second principle: 


03:47.410 --> 03:51.880
and that is not to become distracted 
from our main focus and our main work. 


03:51.880 --> 03:54.983
And we have a good example of that 
when considering Nehemiah. 


03:54.983 --> 03:58.420
As we know, Nehemiah 
was blocked by enemies of Jehovah 


03:58.420 --> 04:02.858
who were trying to stop him 
from completing his theocratic project. 


04:02.858 --> 04:06.000
Look, for example, at Nehemiah 6:2. 


04:07.963 --> 04:10.098
Nehemiah 6:2, and it says: 


04:10.098 --> 04:14.103
“Sanballat and Geshem 
immediately sent this message to me: 


04:14.103 --> 04:17.173
“‘Come, and let us 
set a time to meet together 


04:17.173 --> 04:19.641
“in the villages of the Valley Plain of Ono.’ 


04:19.642 --> 04:22.579
But they were scheming to harm me.” 


04:22.578 --> 04:25.915
Now, the distance between Jerusalem 
and the Valley Plain of Ono 


04:25.915 --> 04:29.818
was about 30 to 35 miles, 
or about 50 kilometers, away. 


04:29.818 --> 04:32.388
Sanballat was not looking 
to get together with Nehemiah 


04:32.388 --> 04:34.390
to work out how they could help them. 


04:34.390 --> 04:37.793
He was scheming to divert the work, 
to slow down the work, 


04:37.793 --> 04:41.363
to oppose the work; 
and Nehemiah knew what they were up to. 


04:41.363 --> 04:44.100
Notice what he says in verse 3. 


04:44.100 --> 04:47.170
He says: 
“I sent messengers to them, saying: 


04:47.170 --> 04:51.673
“‘I am engaged in a great work, 
and I am not able to go down. 


04:51.673 --> 04:55.711
Why should the work stop 
while I leave it to come to you?’” 


04:55.712 --> 04:57.714
See, Nehemiah did not allow himself 


04:57.713 --> 05:00.683
to become distracted 
from his main assignment 


05:00.683 --> 05:03.351
—from the work 
that he had been given to do. 


05:03.352 --> 05:05.655
Now, when that didn’t work, 
his opposers tried 


05:05.655 --> 05:07.790
to get him to choose a solution 


05:07.790 --> 05:11.293
that would harm his reputation 
and bring reproach on Jehovah’s name. 


05:11.293 --> 05:13.328
Look over in verse 10. 


05:13.328 --> 05:15.331
See, this says: 
‘Well, come into the temple. 


05:15.332 --> 05:18.669
Let’s shut the doors of the temple 
because they’re coming to kill you.’ 


05:18.668 --> 05:20.770
Well, look at verse 13. 


05:20.770 --> 05:25.207
He says: “He had been hired 
to frighten me and to cause me to sin, 


05:25.207 --> 05:28.712
“so that they would have grounds 
to damage my reputation 


05:28.712 --> 05:31.547
in order to reproach me.” 


05:31.547 --> 05:34.184
Well see, likewise, 
at times we may be offered 


05:34.183 --> 05:38.320
solutions out of a situation 
or to relieve pressure from opposition 


05:38.320 --> 05:40.322
which will distract us 


05:40.322 --> 05:43.425
from our primary work 
—our service to Jehovah. 


05:43.425 --> 05:46.595
Or it may be an initiative 
that’s a little bit in a gray area. 


05:46.595 --> 05:49.565
Yes, everybody does it, 
but it’s a gray area. 


05:49.565 --> 05:53.335
And it could damage our reputation 
or bring reproach on Jehovah’s name. 


05:53.335 --> 05:55.103
So again, what do we do? 


05:55.103 --> 05:57.106
Will we seek Jehovah’s direction? 


05:57.107 --> 06:02.112
Will this solution distract us 
from our main commission? 


06:02.112 --> 06:04.280
How will it appear to onlookers? 


06:04.280 --> 06:07.517
What will it do to Jehovah’s name? 


06:07.517 --> 06:11.387
Now, these first two principles 
do not mean that we do not do anything; 


06:11.387 --> 06:13.724
and that leads to our third principle. 


06:13.723 --> 06:17.826
And that is we do what we can 
from a practical standpoint. 


06:17.827 --> 06:22.065
We give Jehovah something to bless, 
and then we wait on Jehovah. 


06:22.065 --> 06:25.000
And the account of Hezekiah 
is a beautiful example of that. 


06:25.000 --> 06:27.903
We had the drama 
at our convention this year, 


06:27.903 --> 06:32.475
where the ruthless king of Assyria 
was determined to take Jerusalem. 


06:32.475 --> 06:36.712
Rabshakeh taunted Hezekiah 
and tried to get the people to surrender 


06:36.712 --> 06:39.082
and make a deal with Assyria. 


06:39.082 --> 06:41.084
What did Hezekiah do? 


06:41.083 --> 06:44.420
Well, he displayed 
wisdom and military strategy 


06:44.420 --> 06:46.555
while waiting on Jehovah. 


06:46.555 --> 06:50.158
He did what he could 
to give Jehovah something to bless. 


06:50.158 --> 06:51.526
Remember what they did? 


06:51.527 --> 06:55.264
They went and diverted 
the water sources outside the city 


06:55.263 --> 06:56.998
so that if there was a siege, 


06:56.998 --> 06:59.468
the Assyrians 
would have trouble getting water. 


06:59.468 --> 07:02.605
They strengthened the city’s fortification 
—the walls. 


07:02.605 --> 07:05.608
They made missiles in abundance and shields. 


07:05.608 --> 07:09.378
They did what they could, 
but they trusted in Jehovah. 


07:09.378 --> 07:14.350
Remember what Hezekiah said to the people 
as recorded at 2 Chronicles 32:7, 8? 


07:14.350 --> 07:16.152
He says: 
“Be courageous and strong. . . . 


07:16.152 --> 07:19.789
There are more with us 
than there are with him.” 


07:19.788 --> 07:22.325
So they did what they could, 


07:22.325 --> 07:25.227
but they relied on Jehovah 
for the real solution. 


07:25.227 --> 07:26.862
And interestingly, in this case, 


07:26.862 --> 07:29.132
Jehovah did not use 
anything of what they did. 


07:29.132 --> 07:32.602
He provided an angel to deliver them. 


07:32.602 --> 07:35.972
So likewise, 
when facing persecution today, 


07:35.972 --> 07:39.975
facing opposition today, 
we do what’s in the power of our hand to do 


07:39.975 --> 07:42.978
while keeping in mind 
those first two principles 


07:42.978 --> 07:47.550
and then we see 
what Jehovah works out in our behalf. 


07:47.550 --> 07:49.818
So, what’s the lesson for us? 


07:49.818 --> 07:52.855
Well, the lesson 
is that in the face of persecution, 


07:52.855 --> 07:54.963
when we’re going through opposition, 


07:54.963 --> 07:58.895
the way through the situation 
may not be clear. 


07:58.895 --> 08:01.363
It may not be readily apparent. 


08:01.363 --> 08:06.135
But look for principles 
that can help us to make good decisions. 


08:06.135 --> 08:09.872
And, really, it all boils down 
to our most effective means 


08:09.872 --> 08:12.609
of dealing with persecution and opposition. 


08:12.608 --> 08:16.000
Notice what it says at Psalm 9:10. 


08:18.280 --> 08:21.952
Psalm 9:10, 


08:21.952 --> 08:26.689
it says: 
“Those knowing your name will trust in you; 


08:26.688 --> 08:30.860
you will never abandon 
those seeking you, O Jehovah.” 


08:30.860 --> 08:35.297
“Those knowing your name will trust in you.” 


08:35.297 --> 08:37.434
We know Jehovah. 


08:37.433 --> 08:39.435
We know Jehovah’s name. 


08:39.435 --> 08:41.753
We know what his name means. 


08:41.753 --> 08:44.740
We know that Jehovah can become, 
he can cause us to become, 


08:44.740 --> 08:46.742
he can cause any of his creation 


08:46.742 --> 08:49.829
to become whatever is needed 
to fulfill his purpose. 


08:49.828 --> 08:52.096
We just need to trust in him. 


08:52.097 --> 08:55.535
He will never abandon us.


08:55.535 --> 09:00.472
So yes, as followers of Jesus, 
we will be persecuted. 


09:00.472 --> 09:04.310
We will face opposition. 


09:04.310 --> 09:08.447
When those days come, how will we do? 


09:08.447 --> 09:12.769
Well, may these and other principles 
help us to make good decisions, 


09:12.768 --> 09:16.671
and may we ultimately trust in 
and wait on Jehovah, 


09:16.672 --> 09:27.034
convinced that he will never abandon us.

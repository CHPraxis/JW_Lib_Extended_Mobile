00:01 Let’s consider the account that’s referred to
00:04 in our Watchtower comments.
00:06 If you turn with me in your Bibles
00:08 to the book of Luke,
00:10 we’ll read this in its entirety.
00:12 Follow with me, please,
00:13 at Luke 10:38-42.
00:22 It says:  “Now as they went on their way,
00:24 “he entered into a certain village.
00:26 “Here a woman named Martha  received him as a guest in her house.
00:31 “She also had a sister called Mary,  who sat down at the feet of the Lord
00:35 “and kept listening to what he was saying.
00:38 “Martha, on the other hand,
00:40 “was distracted  with attending to many duties.
00:43 “So she came to him and said:
00:46 “‘Lord, does it not matter to you
00:48 “‘that my sister  has left me alone to attend to things?
00:52 “Tell her to come and help me.’
00:54 “In answer the Lord said to her:
00:56 “‘Martha, Martha,
00:59 “‘you are anxious  and disturbed about many things.
01:02 “‘A few things, though,  are needed, or just one.
01:06 “‘For her part,  Mary chose the good portion,
01:10 and it will not be taken away from her.’”
01:14 Did you note in verse 40,  it said that Martha
01:17 “was distracted  with attending to many duties”?
01:23 It’s quite likely that Martha  may not have felt that way.
01:27 After all, she was not engaged  in some sort of hobby
01:31 or materialistic pursuit,
01:33 and her duties were certainly not trivial.
01:36 She was tending to the needs of Jesus.
01:39 Now, we think about that —taking care of the Messiah, the Son of God.
01:44 That had to be one of the greatest privileges
01:47 and one of the greatest honors  an individual could have.
01:50 So it’s no wonder that in verse 40
01:52 she encourages Jesus  to tell her sister, Mary,
01:56 to come and help her.
01:58 But this raises an interesting question:
02:03 Is it possible for Christians today
02:06 to become distracted
02:09 even while engaging  in worthwhile theocratic pursuits?
02:14 Well, consider three examples.
02:17 We want to do more in the ministry,
02:19 so we decide to learn a new language.
02:23 We focus on learning the language,  but in the process,
02:28 we neglect time to read  and study the Bible in our mother tongue.
02:34 Or perhaps we decide we’re going to move  and serve where the need is greater,
02:39 and we begin to occupy so much  of our time in learning about the country
02:44 —its customs and the food—
02:46 that that begins to overshadow
02:49 our family worship and personal study.
02:53 Or how about our Bethel assignment?
02:56 We love our assignment.
02:58 Our work is very interesting.
02:59 We enjoy working hard.
03:02 But we become so absorbed  in staying ahead in our work
03:06 and keeping things moving
03:08 that we begin to do  self-imposed overtime work
03:13 on a regular basis,
03:15 neglecting our meeting attendance
03:17 and perhaps even time with our mate.
03:21 Did you notice that each situation
03:23 began as a worthwhile theocratic endeavor?
03:27 But can we see how it’s possible
03:30 that each hypothetical situation
03:33 could become a realistic distraction?
03:38 Now, let’s just go back  for a moment to the account in Luke
03:41 because it’s important  to note that Jesus never said
03:45 that what Martha was doing was wrong.
03:48 Like our text mentioned, he loved Martha.
03:51 She was a spiritual woman,
03:52 and he was very appreciative  for what she was doing in his behalf.
03:57 But he very kindly reminds her and shows her
04:01 that her meal preparations  were distracting her
04:04 to the point  that it interfered with her receiving
04:07 what he refers to in verse 42  as “the good portion”
04:12 —a spiritual activity,  listening to his teachings.
04:17 Martha was not taking advantage  of a unique opportunity
04:22 to deepen her faith.
04:24 Very interestingly,  the September 1, 1999, Watchtower
04:28 elaborates on this account,  and it makes this comment.
04:32 It says:  “Moved by love, some [today]
04:34 “—much like Martha—  do their utmost to minister
04:38 “to the needs of fellow believers.
04:40 “They are practical-minded  and quick to take action,
04:43 “and Jehovah promises  to reward their labors of love.
04:47 “Others perhaps more closely resemble Mary.
04:51 “They are quiet and contemplative.
04:54 “Their eagerness to meditate upon God’s Word
04:56 helps them  to stay solidly rooted in the faith.”
05:00 But then it says this:
05:04 “Both . . . fill a vital need  in the Christian congregation.”
05:09 And by extension,  we’ll just add in the Bethel family as well.
05:13 It continues:  “In the end, however,
05:15 “all should ‘choose the good portion’
05:18 “by putting [spiritual or] primary emphasis
05:21 on spiritual things.”
05:24 Well, that helps us  to see the balance, doesn’t it?
05:27 It makes me think,  perhaps in a modern-day application,
05:30 what if the circuit overseer  came to visit our congregation
05:34 and everyone wanted to go out  and work with him in the ministry,
05:38 but no one was willing to stop  and provide him with a meal?
05:43 That wouldn’t be good,  would it, or hospitable?
05:46 Just like it wouldn’t be balanced  for him to have multiple meal invitations,
05:51 and then no one showed up  to support him and his wife in the ministry.
05:55 So the point is,  we want to make sure
05:58 that we care for our needs  and the needs of others
06:01 but also make sure  that we remember our priorities.
06:06 So, what’s the key to ensuring
06:08 that our endeavors  will not become distractions?
06:11 Well, notice how the Bible explains this.
06:14 Turn with me, please,  to Philippians chapter 1.
06:20 At Philippians chapter 1,  notice verses 9 and 10:
06:27 “And this is what I continue praying,
06:30 “that your love  may abound still more and more
06:33 “with accurate knowledge  and full discernment;
06:35 “that you may make sure  of the more important things,
06:39 “so that you may be flawless  and not stumbling others
06:43 up to the day of Christ.”
06:45 So before we undertake  any endeavor, any assignment,
06:50 you notice we want to pray,  reason things out,
06:54 use accurate knowledge, and discernment.
06:57 And if we’re able to use that insight  —good judgment—
07:01 then it’s going to help us  to discern, or perceive,
07:06 what is most important to God.
07:09 And when we know that,  well, then, we can harmonize our thoughts,
07:13 our actions,  and our decisions accordingly.
07:16 By making sure  of the more important things,
07:19 we gain Jehovah’s blessing and favor.
07:22 So think about those situations we mentioned.
07:26 If we’re going to learn a new language
07:28 or move where the need is greater,
07:30 well, that’s amazing!
07:32 It’s appreciated, and it’s definitely needed.
07:35 In fact, we’re encouraged to do it  if we have the circumstances.
07:38 And, of course, in our Bethel assignment,  who of us does not want to work hard,
07:42 to get to know our work well,  and give our all to Jehovah?
07:47 But we can appreciate
07:50 how Jesus shows us  a valuable and balanced lesson
07:54 —that even in worthwhile theocratic pursuits,
07:58 we should not let anything distract
08:01 or impede our spiritual progress.
08:04 We don’t want to miss  opportunities to strengthen our faith,
08:07 to bond with our brothers and sisters,
08:10 and, most importantly, to bond with Jehovah.
08:15 If we just go back to Luke,
08:17 notice how Jesus  concluded his words to Martha.
08:21 In verse 42, he says
08:23 that because ‘Mary chose the good portion,
08:26 it will not be taken away from her.’
08:30 So, what she learned that day
08:32 —the commendation,  the spiritual instruction from Jesus—
08:36 Mary would never forget that.
08:38 That would stay with her  for the rest of her life.
08:43 And likely,  we can recall a similar account
08:48 —maybe a talk, a meeting,  something that was said at the convention,
08:53 a spiritual discussion  that we had with someone—
08:55 and that conversation, or discussion,
08:58 had a profound impact on our faith  and our relationship with Jehovah.
09:03 Well, if you’ve had situations like that,
09:05 you know that those are precious;
09:07 they’re very special.
09:09 And those are things  that we want to hold on to.
09:14 So, what a beautiful reminder we had today.
09:16 And let’s not be distracted.
09:18 May we work to strengthen our spirituality
09:21 and relationship with Jehovah
09:23 by always choosing “the good portion,”
09:26 and if we do, we can be assured  that Jehovah will bless our efforts.

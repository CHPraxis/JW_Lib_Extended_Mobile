00:00:01.284 --> 00:00:03.286 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎By the time the apostle Peter

00:00:03.286 --> 00:00:05.121 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎wrote the words of today’s text,

00:00:05.121 --> 00:00:07.057 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎individuals who were Jews,

00:00:07.057 --> 00:00:09.325 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎proselytes, Samaritans,

00:00:09.325 --> 00:00:11.061 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and Gentiles had been brought

00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:12.729 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎into the Christian congregation

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:14.531 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as God’s people,

00:00:14.531 --> 00:00:16.833 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the spiritual Israel of God.

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:19.302 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In the verse before today’s text,

00:00:19.302 --> 00:00:22.172 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Peter outlined what their mission was.

00:00:22.172 --> 00:00:26.109 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Let’s open 
to 1 Peter chapter 2 and read that.

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.979 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s in verses 9 and 10 of 1 Peter 2.

00:00:31.481 --> 00:00:32.816 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He wrote:

00:00:32.816 --> 00:00:36.886 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“But you are ‘a chosen race, 
a royal priesthood,

00:00:36.886 --> 00:00:41.224 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘a holy nation, 
a people for special possession,

00:00:41.224 --> 00:00:44.494 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“that you should declare abroad 
the excellencies’

00:00:44.494 --> 00:00:48.264 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“of the One who called you 
out of darkness into his wonderful light.

00:00:48.264 --> 00:00:50.433 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“For you were once not a people,

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:53.870 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but now you are God’s people.”

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.974 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And, of course, this refers 
to the spirit-anointed members

00:00:57.974 --> 00:01:00.777 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the congregation 
who would be responsible

00:01:00.777 --> 00:01:04.280 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎for glorifying Jehovah’s name 
as his Witnesses.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.518 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And this harmonizes 
with what Peter had said years earlier

00:01:08.518 --> 00:01:11.621 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the first-century governing body meeting,

00:01:11.621 --> 00:01:14.390 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as reported in Acts chapter 15.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.227 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So let’s turn there, Acts 15,

00:01:17.227 --> 00:01:20.964 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and we will begin with verse 14.

00:01:20.964 --> 00:01:24.234 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It says: 
“Symeon has related thoroughly how God

00:01:24.234 --> 00:01:26.970 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“for the first time 
turned his attention to the nations

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.607 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“to take out of them a people for his name.

00:01:30.607 --> 00:01:32.709 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“And with this the words 
of the Prophets agree,

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:34.711 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“just as it is written:

00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:37.580 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘After these things 
I will return and raise up again

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.716 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘the tent of David that is fallen down;

00:01:39.716 --> 00:01:42.452 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘I will rebuild its ruins and restore it,

00:01:42.452 --> 00:01:46.256 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘so that the men who remain 
may earnestly seek Jehovah,

00:01:46.256 --> 00:01:48.458 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘together with people of all the nations,

00:01:48.458 --> 00:01:50.927 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘people who are called by my name,

00:01:50.927 --> 00:01:55.231 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎says Jehovah, who is doing these things.’”

00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:57.467 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, what about the rest of us

00:01:57.467 --> 00:01:59.602 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎who are not anointed Christians

00:01:59.602 --> 00:02:02.772 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but who call ourselves Jehovah’s Witnesses?

00:02:02.772 --> 00:02:04.874 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Are we also God’s people?

00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:06.910 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, most certainly!

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.512 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And what a proud honor it is for us

00:02:09.512 --> 00:02:12.215 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to bear the name of the only true God.

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:15.218 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But with that name comes responsibility,

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:19.122 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎one that other religious groups 
do not want to take on.

00:02:19.122 --> 00:02:21.324 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You see, we are under obligation 

00:02:21.324 --> 00:02:23.626 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to bear witness to Jehovah,

00:02:23.626 --> 00:02:25.829 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to tell the truth about him, 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.631 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and to expose false teachings 

00:02:28.631 --> 00:02:30.967 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that misrepresent Jehovah.

00:02:30.967 --> 00:02:34.237 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And a classic example 
of an unscriptural dogma

00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:37.841 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that God’s people have exposed is the Trinity,

00:02:37.841 --> 00:02:40.210 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎which reminds me of another hoax

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.446 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that fooled many people 
who should have known better.

00:02:43.446 --> 00:02:47.483 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s the true story 
about a man named van Meegeren,

00:02:47.483 --> 00:02:51.487 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a Dutch artist, born in 1889,

00:02:51.487 --> 00:02:53.723 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎who perpetrated what may have been

00:02:53.723 --> 00:02:57.594 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the most sensational art hoax of all time.

00:02:57.594 --> 00:03:00.029 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You see, he never won the critical acclaim

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:02.232 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that he thought he was due as an artist.

00:03:02.232 --> 00:03:04.701 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So to get back at the art critics, 

00:03:04.701 --> 00:03:06.970 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎he decided to demonstrate his talent

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.939 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎by producing a painting that would fool them all,

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:11.274 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and he set out to imitate 

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:15.445 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the famous 17th-century Dutch impressionist, 

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:17.647 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Johannes Vermeer.

00:03:17.647 --> 00:03:21.017 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, van Meegeren spent 4 years figuring out

00:03:21.017 --> 00:03:24.687 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎how to make 
a new painting look 300 years old.

00:03:24.687 --> 00:03:26.689 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The canvas was the easy part.

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:28.691 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He just took a lesser-known painting 

00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:31.194 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from the 17th century 
and removed the picture.

00:03:31.194 --> 00:03:33.763 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎His biggest problem was getting oil paint

00:03:33.763 --> 00:03:37.066 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to harden thoroughly, 
which usually takes 50 years.

00:03:37.066 --> 00:03:41.337 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He solved it 
by mixing his pigments with a synthetic resin

00:03:41.337 --> 00:03:45.008 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎instead of oil and then baking the canvas.

00:03:45.008 --> 00:03:47.777 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, van Meegeren produced six paintings 

00:03:47.777 --> 00:03:50.780 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that were passed off as Vermeers.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.416 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎His greatest sold in 1937.

00:03:53.416 --> 00:03:57.553 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It was entitled 
Christ and the Disciples at Emmaus.

00:03:57.553 --> 00:04:00.490 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The most authoritative art historian of the day 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.693 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎said it was a genuine Vermeer masterpiece,

00:04:03.693 --> 00:04:06.229 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎untouched, on the original canvas, 

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:08.932 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and that it had no restoration done to it.

00:04:08.932 --> 00:04:11.768 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But in reality, it was a fake.

00:04:11.768 --> 00:04:15.471 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The critic’s opinion was taken 
as gospel in the art world, 

00:04:15.471 --> 00:04:20.443 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎so much so that this critic 
had been nicknamed “The Pope.”

00:04:20.443 --> 00:04:23.379 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Eventually, though, 
a chemical analysis proved 

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:26.449 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that the paint contained 
an ingredient that had not been discovered 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:28.952 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎until two centuries after Vermeer died, 

00:04:28.952 --> 00:04:33.056 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and that’s what exposed 
van Meegeren as a fraud.

00:04:33.056 --> 00:04:36.292 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, something similar 
went on during the apostasy 

00:04:36.292 --> 00:04:39.295 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that took place 
after the death of the apostles.

00:04:39.295 --> 00:04:42.598 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Less than 300 years 
after the Bible was completed, 

00:04:42.598 --> 00:04:46.803 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a Trinitarian added to 1 John 5:7 the words 

00:04:46.803 --> 00:04:51.040 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“in heaven, the Father, 
the Word, and the Holy Ghost: 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.110 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and these three are one.”

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.646 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎However, this addition does not appear 

00:04:56.646 --> 00:04:58.648 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the oldest Greek manuscripts, 

00:04:58.648 --> 00:05:02.719 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎proving it’s a fake; 
it’s a corruption of God’s Word.

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:07.457 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And yet for centuries, 
the churches propagated the Trinity doctrine.

00:05:07.457 --> 00:05:09.592 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As recently as the 19th century, 

00:05:09.592 --> 00:05:11.627 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎almost all Bible translations 

00:05:11.627 --> 00:05:14.130 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎had this spurious addition.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.367 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As late as 1897, Pope Leo XIII 

00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:19.469 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎upheld the corrupted text 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:21.704 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the Latin Vulgate.

00:05:21.704 --> 00:05:24.307 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Interestingly, the New Catholic Encyclopedia 

00:05:24.307 --> 00:05:27.076 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎comments on this 
and says: “The Trinitarian dogma 

00:05:27.076 --> 00:05:32.015 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“is in the last analysis 
a late 4th century invention.

00:05:32.015 --> 00:05:34.083 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Among the Apostolic Fathers, 

00:05:34.083 --> 00:05:36.219 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“there had been nothing 
even remotely approaching 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:39.489 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎such a mentality or perspective.”

00:05:39.489 --> 00:05:42.191 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, Jehovah’s anointed Witnesses 

00:05:42.191 --> 00:05:46.329 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎firmly rejected Christendom’s Trinity dogma.

00:05:46.329 --> 00:05:50.867 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In 1915, 
The Watch Tower exposed the foolishness 

00:05:50.867 --> 00:05:53.870 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of teaching a doctrine 
that contradicts the Bible.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.872 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The Watch Tower said: 

00:05:55.872 --> 00:05:58.007 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“In what a jumble of contradictions 

00:05:58.007 --> 00:06:00.943 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and confusion 
do they find themselves who say 

00:06:00.943 --> 00:06:03.579 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“that Jesus and the Father are one God!

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:05.581 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“This would involve the idea 

00:06:05.581 --> 00:06:08.184 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“that our Lord Jesus acted 
the hypocrite when on earth 

00:06:08.184 --> 00:06:10.653 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and only pretended 
to address God in prayer, 

00:06:10.653 --> 00:06:13.056 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“when He Himself was the same God. . . .

00:06:13.056 --> 00:06:16.492 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“The Father has always been immortal, 
hence could not die.

00:06:16.492 --> 00:06:18.761 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“How then, could Jesus have died? . . .

00:06:18.761 --> 00:06:21.864 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“The Scriptures declare, 
however, that He did die. . . .

00:06:21.864 --> 00:06:25.968 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“If they admit that Jesus really died, 
they take the other horn of the dilemma; 

00:06:25.968 --> 00:06:27.970 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“for believing that their three Gods 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.972 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“are all one person as many do, 

00:06:29.972 --> 00:06:33.042 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“when Jesus died 
they must all three have died.

00:06:33.042 --> 00:06:35.912 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“If they all died, who raised them to life?

00:06:35.912 --> 00:06:38.448 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“How foolish all this sounds! . . .

00:06:38.448 --> 00:06:42.151 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Shall we thus contradict the Apostles 
and Prophets and Jesus Himself, 

00:06:42.151 --> 00:06:45.154 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and ignore reason 
and common sense, in order to hold 

00:06:45.154 --> 00:06:48.758 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“to a dogma handed to us 
from the dark, superstitious past, 

00:06:48.758 --> 00:06:51.394 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“by a corrupt apostate Church?

00:06:51.394 --> 00:06:53.896 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Nay!” says The Watch Tower.

00:06:55.198 --> 00:06:59.202 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, Jehovah’s people 
continue to uphold the excellencies

00:06:59.202 --> 00:07:01.938 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎ of the only true God.

00:07:01.938 --> 00:07:05.174 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Whether in ancient times, 
as with the natural Israelites 

00:07:05.174 --> 00:07:07.977 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or in modern times, as with spiritual Israel, 

00:07:07.977 --> 00:07:11.481 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah’s words through Isaiah are still true.

00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:16.352 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Look at it at Isaiah 43:21.

00:07:16.352 --> 00:07:19.188 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Of course, 
we know in Isaiah chapter 43 

00:07:19.188 --> 00:07:22.091 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah declares: 
“You are my witnesses.”

00:07:22.091 --> 00:07:25.928 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And in verse 21 he says: 

00:07:25.928 --> 00:07:29.599 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“The people whom I formed for myself

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:33.703 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎so that they might declare my praise.”

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:35.805 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And the effort that Jehovah’s Witnesses​

00:07:35.805 --> 00:07:38.074 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—God’s people​—
have put forth to expose

00:07:38.074 --> 00:07:43.079 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎ Bible teachings that are false, 

00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:45.148 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to teach the truth about Jehovah, 

00:07:45.148 --> 00:07:48.184 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and to sanctify God’s name 
has taken on proportions 

00:07:48.184 --> 00:07:50.953 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎never attained by any other religious group.

00:07:50.953 --> 00:07:53.656 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And Jehovah takes notice of that.

00:07:53.656 --> 00:07:56.592 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Look at Malachi the 3rd chapter.

00:07:56.592 --> 00:07:59.162 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Malachi chapter 3, 

00:07:59.162 --> 00:08:01.564 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎beginning with verse 16.

00:08:03.633 --> 00:08:06.269 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Malachi 3:​16: 

00:08:06.269 --> 00:08:10.306 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“At that time those 
who feared Jehovah spoke with one another, 

00:08:10.306 --> 00:08:12.275 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“each one with his companion,

00:08:12.275 --> 00:08:14.777 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and Jehovah kept paying 
attention and listening.

00:08:14.777 --> 00:08:17.880 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“And a book of remembrance 
was written before him 

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.551 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“for those fearing Jehovah 
and for those meditating on 

00:08:21.551 --> 00:08:25.521 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“[or the footnote says, 
possibly, “treasuring”] his name.

00:08:25.521 --> 00:08:28.524 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘And they will be mine,’ 
says Jehovah of armies, 

00:08:28.524 --> 00:08:32.628 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘in the day when I produce 
a special property.’”

00:08:32.628 --> 00:08:35.731 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So Jehovah truly does love those 

00:08:35.731 --> 00:08:38.801 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎who fear him and treasure his name, 

00:08:38.801 --> 00:08:42.271 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎making them truly God’s people.

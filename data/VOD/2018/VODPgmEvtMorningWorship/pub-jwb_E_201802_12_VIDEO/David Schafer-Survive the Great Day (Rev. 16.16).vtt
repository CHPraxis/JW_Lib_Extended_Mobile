00:02.285 --> 00:04.453
“They.” 


00:04.453 --> 00:08.323
“They gathered them together 


00:08.323 --> 00:11.360
“to the place that is called in Hebrew 


00:11.360 --> 00:13.363
Armageddon.” 


00:13.363 --> 00:17.300
Who are “they”? 


00:17.300 --> 00:19.902
Who is being “gathered”? 


00:19.902 --> 00:22.239
And what is the significance of that to us 


00:22.238 --> 00:24.873
as we go about our sacred service today? 


00:24.873 --> 00:27.310
The answers can be found in the context. 


00:27.310 --> 00:31.982
I invite you to find Revelation chapter 16, 


00:31.982 --> 00:36.000
and let’s begin reading in verse 13, 


00:37.920 --> 00:39.922
which says: 


00:39.922 --> 00:41.992
“And I saw three 


00:41.992 --> 00:46.997
“unclean inspired expressions 


00:46.997 --> 00:49.465
“that looked like frogs 


00:49.465 --> 00:51.633
“come out of the mouth of the dragon 


00:51.633 --> 00:54.336
“and out of the mouth of the wild beast 


00:54.337 --> 00:57.274
“and out of the mouth of the false prophet. 


00:57.273 --> 01:02.278
“They are, in fact, 
expressions inspired by demons 


01:02.278 --> 01:04.746
“and they perform signs, 


01:04.747 --> 01:08.552
“and they go out to the kings 
of the entire inhabited earth, 


01:08.552 --> 01:13.557
to gather them together to the war 
of the great day of God the Almighty.” 


01:13.557 --> 01:15.859
And verse 16 says: 


01:15.858 --> 01:19.928
“And they [these “expressions”] 


01:19.928 --> 01:22.798
“gathered them 
[“the kings of the entire inhabited earth”] 


01:22.798 --> 01:26.368
to the place that is called 
in Hebrew Armageddon.” 


01:26.368 --> 01:28.538
“Expressions.” 


01:28.538 --> 01:33.543
Now, these must be 
very persuasive expressions 


01:33.543 --> 01:35.811
because they compel 


01:35.812 --> 01:38.047
not just a few isolated kings here and there 


01:38.047 --> 01:41.584
but “the kings of the entire inhabited earth” 


01:41.583 --> 01:45.086
to this situation called Armageddon. 


01:45.087 --> 01:49.725
Now, these expressions, 
you notice, are unclean, 


01:49.725 --> 01:53.262
so they cannot originate with Jehovah. 


01:53.262 --> 01:56.399
And yet, they are inspired 


01:56.398 --> 01:59.301
—“inspired by demons.” 


01:59.302 --> 02:01.905
And yet, 
they have their ultimate source 


02:01.905 --> 02:05.342
in “the mouth of the dragon,” 
Satan the Devil 


02:05.342 --> 02:07.344
—“the father of the lie.” 


02:07.343 --> 02:10.580
But, now, 
who actually gives voice 


02:10.580 --> 02:12.748
to these expressions? 


02:12.748 --> 02:15.285
Well, notice in verse 13 that the expressions 


02:15.285 --> 02:20.290
also ‘come out of the mouths 
of the wild beast and the false prophet’


02:20.290 --> 02:22.958
—political entities of Satan’s world. 


02:22.958 --> 02:26.830
So here we have 
unclean expressions inspired by demons 


02:26.830 --> 02:29.798
—originating with Satan but voiced, repeated, 


02:29.798 --> 02:34.303
parroted, and echoed by people 


02:34.303 --> 02:37.306
who constitute Satan’s wicked world. 


02:37.307 --> 02:40.777
But, now, just what are these expressions 


02:40.777 --> 02:45.649
that are so persuasive 
that they compel kings? 


02:45.648 --> 02:51.786
What concept would be so compelling? 


02:51.787 --> 02:56.192
Since 1914, 
Satan has been stepping up his efforts 


02:56.192 --> 02:59.695
to mislead “the entire inhabited earth.” 


02:59.695 --> 03:01.797
And one of his goals 


03:01.797 --> 03:06.469
is to deceive mankind 
into thinking that humans


03:06.468 --> 03:08.771
—that Satan’s way of ruling is the best—


03:08.772 --> 03:12.242
that humans can actually achieve 


03:12.242 --> 03:14.510
peace and security 


03:14.510 --> 03:17.947
through their own systems and governments. 


03:17.947 --> 03:21.450
Moreover, 
according to 1 Thessalonians 5:1-3, 


03:21.450 --> 03:26.088
they will soon be saying 
that they have actually achieved 


03:26.088 --> 03:28.090
“peace and security.” 


03:28.090 --> 03:32.362
Now, adding to the power 
of these inspired expressions 


03:32.362 --> 03:35.064
are the signs. 


03:35.063 --> 03:38.568
The signs make it seem 


03:38.568 --> 03:41.370
as if these expressions 
are actually coming true 


03:41.370 --> 03:45.808
and perhaps that they 
even have the backing of God. 


03:45.808 --> 03:50.813
But the only god backing 
these particular inspired expressions 


03:50.813 --> 03:54.516
is “the god of this system of things.”


03:54.517 --> 03:57.687
Is it unprecedented 


03:57.687 --> 04:01.290
that Satan the Devil would use miracles 


04:01.290 --> 04:04.360
in an attempt to lend credibility 


04:04.360 --> 04:09.365
to his ideas, his wicked lies? 


04:09.365 --> 04:13.368
At Exodus 7:10-12, 


04:13.368 --> 04:17.573
Jehovah empowers Aaron’s rod 
to become a snake, 


04:17.573 --> 04:20.276
but Pharaoh’s magic-practicing priests 


04:20.277 --> 04:24.480
mimicked that very sign. 


04:24.480 --> 04:29.418
Likewise, they mimicked the first 
and the second of the Ten Plagues. 


04:29.418 --> 04:33.188
OK, but what about after the Christian 
congregation came into existence? 


04:33.188 --> 04:37.726
Paul indicated at 2 Thessalonians 2:3-12 


04:37.727 --> 04:39.729
that the apostate movement, 


04:39.728 --> 04:42.898
which eventually gave birth 
to the clergy of Christendom, 


04:42.898 --> 04:47.903
would be backed 
“by the operation of Satan 


04:47.903 --> 04:50.071
“with every powerful work 


04:50.072 --> 04:53.442
and lying signs and wonders.”


04:53.442 --> 04:55.979
—2 Thessalonians 2:9. 


04:55.978 --> 04:59.715
Moreover, Mark 13:22 says—


04:59.715 --> 05:02.452
In the prophecy of the last days, Jesus said: 


05:02.452 --> 05:05.187
“False Christs and false prophets 


05:05.187 --> 05:08.457
“will arise and will perform signs 


05:08.457 --> 05:11.394
“and wonders to lead astray, if possible, 


05:11.393 --> 05:14.096
[even] the chosen ones.” 


05:14.097 --> 05:16.732
So, clearly, demons teach. 


05:16.732 --> 05:19.769
And it is not beyond Satan and the demons 


05:19.768 --> 05:24.540
to back up their false claims 
with wonders at times, 


05:24.540 --> 05:28.610
although, obviously, 
their power in that regard is limited. 


05:28.610 --> 05:31.147
A subtle reminder of that fact 


05:31.147 --> 05:35.017
is found at Revelation 16:16, 


05:35.017 --> 05:39.322
which says that they are ‘gathered together 
to the place called Armageddon,’ 


05:39.322 --> 05:42.859
“to the war of the great day 
of God the Almighty.” 


05:42.858 --> 05:46.895
“The Almighty”
—only Jehovah can hold that title. 


05:46.895 --> 05:51.033
And that very word 
is a guarantee that Jehovah’s will 


05:51.033 --> 05:54.636
will ultimately prevail.


05:54.637 --> 05:57.140
Still, is it possible 


05:57.140 --> 06:02.112
that some professed Christians 
could start to believe 


06:02.112 --> 06:06.182
“expressions inspired by demons” 


06:06.182 --> 06:08.184
that “perform signs”? 


06:08.183 --> 06:11.720
If it weren’t possible, 
at least for individuals, 


06:11.720 --> 06:16.125
then why would 
Revelation chapter 16 contain this warning 


06:16.125 --> 06:19.462
right in the middle of the discussion 
about Armageddon that we just read? 


06:19.462 --> 06:22.132
The verse that we skipped, verse 15, 


06:22.132 --> 06:25.702
contains a very relevant reminder 


06:25.702 --> 06:27.737
for each and every one of us. 


06:27.737 --> 06:29.105
Now, sometimes we skip it 


06:29.105 --> 06:31.107
because we keep all the verses 
about Armageddon together. 


06:31.107 --> 06:33.475
But, this is not an afterthought, a sidebar, 


06:33.475 --> 06:36.845
just a wise saying 
plunked in for no apparent reason. 


06:36.845 --> 06:38.313
It’s totally relevant. 


06:38.313 --> 06:39.448
Let’s read it: 


06:39.448 --> 06:42.118
“Look! [verse 15] 


06:42.118 --> 06:44.653
“I am coming as a thief. 


06:44.653 --> 06:48.690
“Happy is the one who stays awake 
and keeps his outer garments, 


06:48.690 --> 06:51.993
“so that he may not walk naked 


06:51.993 --> 06:55.000
and people look upon his shamefulness.” 


06:56.398 --> 06:59.868
So here we are, right on the cusp 


06:59.868 --> 07:04.173
of the outbreak of the great tribulation. 


07:04.173 --> 07:07.976
You have an identity
—“garments”—


07:07.977 --> 07:12.915
an identity 
as a faithful witness of Jehovah God. 


07:12.915 --> 07:13.917
Keep your identity. 


07:13.917 --> 07:14.717
How? 


07:14.717 --> 07:16.452
By keeping awake spiritually.


07:16.452 --> 07:18.454
The article from which our text is taken,


07:18.453 --> 07:20.690
entitled
“‘Your Deliverance Is Getting Near’!”


07:20.690 --> 07:24.360
in the July 15, 2015, issue 
of The Watchtower, points out


07:24.360 --> 07:28.330
—in harmony with the Scriptures, 
boiling down a number of Scriptural facts—


07:28.330 --> 07:31.433
that Babylon the Great will be destroyed. 


07:31.433 --> 07:35.805
Then, the initial part 
of the great tribulation will be cut short. 


07:35.805 --> 07:38.107
There will be a brief respite, 


07:38.107 --> 07:40.109
during which the majority of mankind 


07:40.108 --> 07:43.678
will seek refuge in human organizations. 


07:43.678 --> 07:48.683
Our message of good news 
will change to one of judgment. 


07:48.683 --> 07:53.521
Then, the coalition of nations 
referred to as Gog of Magog 


07:53.522 --> 07:57.427
will be bent on attacking 
Jehovah’s anointed ones 


07:57.427 --> 08:00.564
and their associates. 


08:00.563 --> 08:03.631
Now, only loyal love for Jehovah 


08:03.632 --> 08:08.237
and obedient support 
of his anointed ones will get us through. 


08:08.237 --> 08:11.340
That will mean everything!


08:11.340 --> 08:14.243
So, what must we do now? 


08:14.243 --> 08:15.845
Stay awake. 


08:15.845 --> 08:17.880
You have an identity


08:17.880 --> 08:21.250
—not just a Bethelite or Gilead graduate. 


08:21.250 --> 08:22.285
No. 


08:22.285 --> 08:24.320
You’ve worked hard, with Jehovah’s help, 


08:24.320 --> 08:26.455
to establish an identity 


08:26.455 --> 08:30.092
as a Christian worshipper of Jehovah


08:30.092 --> 08:31.627
—keep it. 


08:31.627 --> 08:35.197
Perform “holy acts of conduct.” 


08:35.197 --> 08:39.602
We could say, 
things we don’t do


08:39.602 --> 08:43.405
—things we don’t watch, 
things we don’t read, 


08:43.405 --> 08:47.877
things we don’t think about, 
things we don’t say. 


08:47.877 --> 08:52.882
Don’t let the demons tamper 
with your identity as a Christian 


08:52.882 --> 08:56.385
with their “unclean inspired expressions.” 


08:56.385 --> 08:58.653
Perform “deeds of godly devotion,” 


08:58.653 --> 09:00.521
we could say, 
things we do 


09:00.522 --> 09:02.959
—preaching, lingering in prayer, 


09:02.958 --> 09:05.526
continuing in your personal study. 


09:05.527 --> 09:10.099
Much is covered in Gilead, 
yes, but not everything. 


09:10.098 --> 09:12.635
The online Study Bible is amazing, 


09:12.635 --> 09:14.903
and it just keeps getting 
better day after day, 


09:14.903 --> 09:18.040
helping us to forge a closer bond, 


09:18.040 --> 09:20.843
a close personal attachment, 
with Jehovah. 


09:20.843 --> 09:25.815
Continue devoting time 
to such “deeds of godly devotion” now 


09:25.815 --> 09:27.817
and you will succeed then. 


09:27.817 --> 09:31.887
You will not be duped by the expressions 


09:31.887 --> 09:33.924
that perform signs, 


09:33.923 --> 09:35.925
as others are. 


09:35.925 --> 09:37.927
No, you will survive 


09:37.927 --> 09:41.430
“the great day of God the Almighty,” 


09:41.430 --> 09:50.157
now so very near at hand.

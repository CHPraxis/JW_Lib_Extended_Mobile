00:01.051 --> 00:04.154
‎Over 100 years ago, 

00:04.154 --> 00:07.891
‎on October 31, 1916, 

00:07.891 --> 00:10.093
‎Brother Charles Taze Russell

00:10.093 --> 00:12.095
‎was traveling on a train 

00:12.095 --> 00:13.763
‎as part of a lecture tour

00:13.763 --> 00:15.765
‎across the United States. 

00:15.765 --> 00:17.867
‎Quite unexpectedly,

00:17.867 --> 00:21.337
‎and at the young age of 64,

00:21.337 --> 00:23.406
‎Brother Russell died. 

00:23.406 --> 00:27.544
‎For years, he had been traveling continually. 

00:27.544 --> 00:31.514
‎You know, it’s been said 
that Brother Russell covered 

00:31.514 --> 00:33.883
‎more than a million miles. 

00:33.883 --> 00:36.986
‎Now, of course, some of you 
may have accomplished that feat, 

00:36.986 --> 00:40.423
‎but at that time, of course, 
we were not talking about air travel. 

00:40.423 --> 00:44.060
‎Brother Russell 
had to accomplish that by train and ship 

00:44.060 --> 00:47.630
‎and goodness knows what other means
—quite an accomplishment! 

00:47.630 --> 00:50.300
‎In addition to that, he had delivered 

00:50.300 --> 00:55.171
‎more than 30,000 sermons, lectures, and talks. 

00:55.171 --> 00:58.041
‎He had written books and other material 

00:58.041 --> 01:01.778
‎totaling over 50,000 pages. 

01:01.778 --> 01:05.482
‎Yet, despite all of the privileges 
that he had enjoyed

01:05.482 --> 01:07.784
‎​—his tremendous Bible knowledge 

01:07.784 --> 01:11.387
‎and the powerful way 
that Jehovah had used him​—

01:11.387 --> 01:15.058
‎in just a moment he was gone.

01:15.058 --> 01:19.162
‎It really illustrates 
the truth of what James says here 

01:19.162 --> 01:22.632
‎at James 4:​13, 14. 

01:22.632 --> 01:25.535
‎Let’s read this together, 

01:25.535 --> 01:28.571
‎James 4:​13. 

01:28.571 --> 01:30.507
‎It says: “Come, now, you who say: 

01:30.507 --> 01:32.509
‎“‘Today or tomorrow we will travel 

01:32.509 --> 01:34.944
‎“‘to this city and will spend a year there, 

01:34.944 --> 01:38.348
‎“and we will do business and make some profit,’ 

01:38.348 --> 01:43.052
‎“whereas you do not know 
what your life will be like tomorrow. 

01:43.052 --> 01:46.823
‎“For you are a mist 
that appears for a little while 

01:46.823 --> 01:48.892
‎and then disappears.” 

01:48.892 --> 01:50.894
‎Well, that’s true. 

01:50.894 --> 01:54.030
‎You see, really, no matter 
what privileges we may enjoy​

01:54.030 --> 01:58.301
‎—how skilled a teacher we may be, 
what knowledge we’ve accumulated​—

01:58.301 --> 02:00.303
‎we are all just like 

02:00.303 --> 02:04.174
‎‘a mist appearing for a while 
and then disappearing.’ 

02:04.174 --> 02:06.176
‎Well, this is an idea 

02:06.176 --> 02:09.379
‎that occurs over and over again 
in the Scriptures 

02:09.379 --> 02:11.514
‎and, really, with the purpose 

02:11.514 --> 02:13.583
‎of encouraging all of us

02:13.583 --> 02:18.121
‎to take 
a close and sober and serious look 

02:18.121 --> 02:20.290
‎at the way that we use our lives. 

02:20.290 --> 02:22.292
‎And even more importantly, 

02:22.292 --> 02:25.328
‎how we use them to serve Jehovah. 

02:25.328 --> 02:27.330
‎In Luke chapter 12, 

02:27.330 --> 02:31.701
‎you’ll remember that Jesus taught 
an illustration regarding a rich man. 

02:31.701 --> 02:32.535
‎Do you remember this?

02:32.535 --> 02:34.170
‎Let’s open our Bibles and read it together, 

02:34.170 --> 02:38.641
‎Luke 12:16. 

02:38.641 --> 02:41.678
‎Now, just before we read it, 
you’ll remember that the purpose 

02:41.678 --> 02:45.715
‎of Jesus giving this illustration 
was to emphasize the importance 

02:45.715 --> 02:47.717
‎of being rich toward God. 

02:47.717 --> 02:50.386
‎Now, let’s read 
what he says here in verse 16: 

02:50.386 --> 02:53.389
‎“The land of a rich man produced well. 

02:53.389 --> 02:56.259
‎“So he began reasoning within himself, 

02:56.259 --> 03:00.230
‎“‘What should I do now that I have 
nowhere to gather my crops?’ 

03:00.230 --> 03:03.032
‎“Then he said, ‘I will do this: 

03:03.032 --> 03:06.870
‎“‘I will tear down 
my storehouses and build bigger ones, 

03:06.870 --> 03:10.506
‎“‘and there I will gather 
all my grain and all my goods, 

03:10.506 --> 03:12.508
‎“‘and I will say to myself: 

03:12.508 --> 03:16.312
‎“‘“You have many 
good things stored up for many years; 

03:16.312 --> 03:21.317
‎take it easy, eat, drink, enjoy yourself.”’ 

03:21.317 --> 03:25.655
‎“But God said to him, ‘Unreasonable one, 

03:25.655 --> 03:29.325
‎“‘this night they are demanding 
your life from you.  

03:29.325 --> 03:33.363
‎“Who, then, is to have 
the things you stored up?’ 

03:33.363 --> 03:37.800
‎“So it goes with the man 
who stores up treasure for himself

03:37.800 --> 03:41.137
‎but is not rich toward God.”

03:41.137 --> 03:44.440
‎Well, what was the problem with this man? 

03:44.440 --> 03:48.778
‎In the 2007 Watchtower, 
August 1st issue, 

03:48.778 --> 03:50.980
‎this illustration was discussed. 

03:50.980 --> 03:55.251
‎And The Watchtower said 
that “the rich man’s plan 

03:55.251 --> 03:59.956
‎“provided [really] only
a false sense of security.

03:59.956 --> 04:02.792
‎“Practical as it might have seemed [to him], 

04:02.792 --> 04:07.196
‎“it left out one vital element​—God’s will. 

04:07.196 --> 04:09.832
‎“The man was only thinking about himself, 

04:09.832 --> 04:12.201
‎“how he would be able to take his ease 

04:12.201 --> 04:15.505
‎“and eat, drink, and enjoy himself. 

04:15.505 --> 04:19.375
‎“He thought that because [he had] 
‘many good things,’ 

04:19.375 --> 04:22.412
‎he would also have ‘many years.’”

04:22.412 --> 04:24.013
‎Isn’t that an interesting point? 

04:24.013 --> 04:27.216
‎You see, he thought the abundance 
of things that he possessed 

04:27.216 --> 04:30.520
‎would somehow equate 
to the length of his life. 

04:30.520 --> 04:32.522
‎But The Watchtower went on to say: 

04:32.522 --> 04:36.793
‎“Too bad for him, 
things did not work out that way. 

04:36.793 --> 04:41.798
‎“Just as Jesus said earlier, 
‘even when a person has an abundance

04:41.798 --> 04:46.369
‎his life does not result 
from the things he possesses.’” 

04:46.369 --> 04:49.706
‎Well, that brings us back to James chapter 4. 

04:49.706 --> 04:52.141
‎Let’s go back there again, 

04:52.141 --> 04:54.677
‎and look at what verse 15 says. 

04:54.677 --> 04:58.848
‎See, after commenting on how 
a life is just like a mist appearing, 

04:58.848 --> 05:00.850
‎then verse 15 says: 

05:00.850 --> 05:04.988
‎“Instead, you should say: 
‘If Jehovah wills, 

05:04.988 --> 05:08.925
‎we will live and do this or that.’” 

05:08.925 --> 05:12.962
‎You see, the Bible makes it clear 
that we should never ever develop 

05:12.962 --> 05:15.732
‎overconfidence
—overconfidence in anything​—

05:15.732 --> 05:19.936
‎in our position, our knowledge, 
our wisdom, our wealth. 

05:19.936 --> 05:24.574
‎But instead, you see, 
have complete confidence in Jehovah. 

05:24.574 --> 05:27.143
‎Really, our only hope, 

05:27.143 --> 05:30.813
‎our only confidence is with Jehovah. 

05:30.813 --> 05:34.917
‎Now, this applies 
not just to our view of life itself 

05:34.917 --> 05:38.654
‎but, really, 
also to our view of all of our activities. 

05:38.654 --> 05:42.025
‎You see, in that verse in James chapter 4, 

05:42.025 --> 05:44.193
‎it says that it’s not just about our life 

05:44.193 --> 05:47.864
‎but about whether we will do this or do that.

05:47.864 --> 05:49.866
‎So it really applies to all 

05:49.866 --> 05:52.835
‎of the different things that we do every day.  

05:52.835 --> 05:56.406
‎Recently, we’ve been hearing reports 

05:56.406 --> 06:01.377
‎of increasing persecution 
in various lands, including Russia. 

06:01.377 --> 06:03.679
‎Now, when we hear those reports, 

06:03.679 --> 06:06.149
‎perhaps we begin to think right away 

06:06.149 --> 06:10.253
‎that this is something 
that could only happen in a faraway land. 

06:10.253 --> 06:13.856
‎You see, in countries like 
the United States and Canada 

06:13.856 --> 06:15.925
‎(those who are listening to this program), 

06:15.925 --> 06:19.028
‎perhaps we have the attitude that, well, 

06:19.028 --> 06:22.031
‎this freedom of worship that we enjoy 

06:22.031 --> 06:26.169
‎is always going to be here, 
and it will never change. 

06:26.169 --> 06:29.772
‎But it’s interesting 
to consider what happened in one case

06:29.772 --> 06:33.976
‎in 1972 in the country of Singapore. 

06:33.976 --> 06:37.547
‎On January 12, 1972, 

06:37.547 --> 06:40.349
‎a missionary 
who was serving at the branch, 

06:40.349 --> 06:44.921
‎received a letter suddenly
​—hand delivered to him​—

06:44.921 --> 06:47.590
‎saying that he was banished 
from the country 

06:47.590 --> 06:49.926
‎and must leave within two weeks. 

06:49.926 --> 06:52.995
‎Now, this brother 
had been serving there peacefully 

06:52.995 --> 06:55.031
‎for 23 years; 

06:55.031 --> 06:58.067
‎everything was going along very smoothly. 

06:58.067 --> 07:01.737
‎Two days later, 
the Kingdom Hall was padlocked, 

07:01.737 --> 07:05.408
‎all the literature was banned in the country, 

07:05.408 --> 07:08.211
‎the bank accounts 
that belonged to the branch 

07:08.211 --> 07:11.414
‎and to the congregation were all seized. 

07:11.414 --> 07:16.285
‎Well, suddenly 
and very unexpectedly our work 

07:16.285 --> 07:20.957
‎and all of our activities 
had been banned in that country.

07:20.957 --> 07:22.992
‎Well, now, what do we learn from this? 

07:22.992 --> 07:27.463
‎Is it to teach us that we should live 
in some kind of morbid fear 

07:27.463 --> 07:31.267
‎that our work is going to be banned 
at any moment? 

07:31.267 --> 07:35.505
‎Well, what’s the real reality 
of what happened in Singapore? 

07:35.505 --> 07:38.674
‎How did those unexpected events 

07:38.674 --> 07:41.043
‎affect our brothers in that land? 

07:41.043 --> 07:43.646
‎Well, they were not broken. 

07:43.646 --> 07:46.883
‎Looking to Jehovah 
with complete confidence, 

07:46.883 --> 07:50.353
‎they continued to find ways 
to worship Jehovah. 

07:50.353 --> 07:52.722
‎And Jehovah has blessed their efforts 

07:52.722 --> 07:56.259
‎right up until this present day. 

07:56.259 --> 07:58.461
‎So, brothers, it’s true, 

07:58.461 --> 08:00.663
‎as James chapter 4 teaches us, 

08:00.663 --> 08:05.535
‎life in this system 
is really filled with uncertainty. 

08:05.535 --> 08:09.205
‎But if we have made Jehovah our confidence 

08:09.205 --> 08:12.708
‎and if we are truly rich toward God, 

08:12.708 --> 08:15.144
‎then, really, whatever may come, 

08:15.144 --> 08:17.613
‎whatever situation may befall us

08:17.613 --> 08:21.350
‎​—even our untimely death​—

08:21.350 --> 08:26.122
‎we are completely 
and totally safe with Jehovah. 

08:26.122 --> 08:29.892
‎And he is the One
​—because we’ve made him our confidence​—

08:29.892 --> 08:39.095
‎who will care for us in every way.

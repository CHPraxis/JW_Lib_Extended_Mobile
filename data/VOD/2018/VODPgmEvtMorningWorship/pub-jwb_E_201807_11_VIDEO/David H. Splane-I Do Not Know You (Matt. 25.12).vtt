00:01.985 --> 00:04.220
Well, if you’re like me,

00:04.220 --> 00:06.890
you may need to review

00:06.890 --> 00:09.025
some of these points sometimes.

00:09.025 --> 00:12.362
We had the parable of the virgins explained

00:12.362 --> 00:14.364
in The Watchtower some time ago.

00:14.364 --> 00:17.267
But let’s try to review the parable

00:17.267 --> 00:19.502
and see what we can remember.

00:19.502 --> 00:23.273
Now, we know that there are ten virgins,

00:23.273 --> 00:27.744
and all of them are waiting 
for a bridegroom to come.

00:27.744 --> 00:32.682
Now, there are 
five wise virgins, or discreet virgins,

00:32.682 --> 00:35.485
and then there are five foolish virgins.

00:35.485 --> 00:37.020
And there’s a difference.

00:37.020 --> 00:40.690
The wise are prepared for any contingency.

00:40.690 --> 00:43.293
They not only have oil in their lamps

00:43.293 --> 00:46.830
but they have extra oil as well.

00:46.830 --> 00:51.367
And you can be sure 
that it’s virgin olive oil.

00:53.069 --> 00:58.007
Now, the wise virgins, 
why do they have so much oil?

00:58.007 --> 01:01.678
Because they’re willing 
to wait until the bridegroom comes.

01:01.678 --> 01:04.748
They must love the bridegroom very much.

01:04.748 --> 01:07.851
And they know that it’s all about him; 
it’s not about them.

01:07.851 --> 01:12.155
They want somebody to be on hand 
when the bridegroom arrives.

01:12.155 --> 01:14.257
The foolish virgins

01:14.257 --> 01:16.960
—well, they’re willing to wait for a while.

01:16.960 --> 01:19.028
But the bridegroom had better hurry up

01:19.028 --> 01:21.731
because they only have 
a little bit of oil in their lamp,

01:21.731 --> 01:25.468
and they have no extra oil at all.

01:25.468 --> 01:29.139
They’re primarily concerned with themselves.

01:29.139 --> 01:32.542
Well, the bridegroom doesn’t come right away,

01:32.542 --> 01:35.779
and all of the virgins fall asleep.

01:35.779 --> 01:38.581
But in the middle 
of the night, there is a cry,

01:38.581 --> 01:40.650
apparently in the distance:

01:40.650 --> 01:43.086
“Here is the bridegroom!”

01:43.086 --> 01:46.923
But the bridegroom 
still doesn’t make an appearance.

01:46.923 --> 01:51.327
Well, the virgins awaken, 
they dress their lamps,

01:51.327 --> 01:55.632
they put their lamps in order, 
and they wait.

01:55.632 --> 01:58.768
And still the bridegroom doesn’t come.

01:58.768 --> 02:03.206
The lamps 
of the foolish virgins begin to flicker,

02:03.206 --> 02:05.842
and they realize 
that they’re going to run out of oil.

02:05.842 --> 02:10.046
So they ask the wise 
to share some of their oil with them,

02:10.046 --> 02:12.048
and the wise refuse.

02:12.048 --> 02:13.149
Why?

02:13.149 --> 02:14.818
Because they’re selfish?

02:14.818 --> 02:16.085
No.

02:16.085 --> 02:18.087
Because they’re wise.

02:18.087 --> 02:22.358
If they share some of their oil 
with the foolish virgins,

02:22.358 --> 02:26.329
then the wise will run out 
and the foolish will run out

02:26.329 --> 02:29.632
and then no one will be 
on hand to greet the bridegroom.

02:29.632 --> 02:31.634
And really, it’s all about the bridegroom.

02:31.634 --> 02:34.370
They want someone to be on hand

02:34.370 --> 02:37.640
to hail the bridegroom when he arrives.

02:37.640 --> 02:40.376
So, what do the foolish do?

02:40.376 --> 02:44.113
They rush off to find an all-night 7-Eleven

02:44.113 --> 02:47.550
or Walmart that might be selling oil

02:47.550 --> 02:50.320
—like that’s going 
to happen in the first century.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.655
And in the meantime, while they’re gone,

02:52.655 --> 02:54.757
the bridegroom arrives

02:54.757 --> 02:59.762
and the wise virgins 
are ushered into the wedding feast.

02:59.762 --> 03:02.932
Well, now this is 
a parable for the last days.

03:02.932 --> 03:05.001
How do we know that?

03:05.001 --> 03:08.504
Because everything in Matthew 24 and 25

03:08.504 --> 03:10.673
relates to the last days.

03:10.673 --> 03:13.142
So we’re talking 
about something that occurs

03:13.142 --> 03:15.845
during Jesus’ presence.

03:15.845 --> 03:19.782
Whom do the virgins represent?

03:19.782 --> 03:21.784
All of the anointed.

03:21.784 --> 03:24.087
Not just “the faithful and discreet slave”

03:24.087 --> 03:27.123
but all of the anointed.

03:27.123 --> 03:29.125
Now, that’s quite a statement.

03:29.125 --> 03:31.661
How would you prove that?

03:31.661 --> 03:35.164
What scripture would you point to to prove

03:35.164 --> 03:39.736
that the virgins represent all 
of the anointed and not just a small class

03:39.736 --> 03:44.307
—small group—
like “the faithful and discreet slave”?

03:44.307 --> 03:47.477
Our go-to scripture is Luke chapter 12.

03:49.512 --> 03:51.681
Let’s turn there.

03:51.681 --> 03:55.151
And now, this is not 
a parallel scripture to Matthew 24.

03:55.151 --> 03:58.922
This is Jesus talking about 
the same subject on another occasion,

03:58.922 --> 04:01.557
but this will clarify matters for us.

04:01.557 --> 04:04.661
Luke chapter 12,

04:04.661 --> 04:09.532
and first we’ll read 
verse 32 to get the context.

04:09.532 --> 04:13.236
He says: “Have no fear, little flock.”

04:13.236 --> 04:16.606
Well, who constitute the “little flock”?

04:16.606 --> 04:18.608
All of the anointed, right?

04:18.608 --> 04:20.677
“Have no fear, little flock,

04:20.677 --> 04:23.613
for your Father has approved 
of giving you the Kingdom.”

04:23.613 --> 04:25.715
So he’s talking to all of the anointed.

04:25.715 --> 04:29.619
And what does he say 
to them in verses 35 and 36?

04:29.619 --> 04:34.290
See if you can see 
the similarity with what we just read.

04:34.290 --> 04:36.693
“Be dressed and ready

04:36.693 --> 04:39.762
“and have your lamps burning,

04:39.762 --> 04:44.400
“and you should be like men waiting 
for their master to return from the marriage,

04:44.400 --> 04:48.171
so when he comes and knocks, 
they may at once open to him.”

04:48.171 --> 04:51.841
Do you see the similarity 
between Matthew 24 and Luke 12?

04:51.841 --> 04:54.644
So now Jesus is addressing these words

04:54.644 --> 04:57.113
to all of the anointed.

04:58.247 --> 05:02.685
Now, in the parable there’s an interval

05:02.685 --> 05:06.255
between the cry “Here is the bridegroom!”

05:06.255 --> 05:09.225
and the coming of the bridegroom.

05:09.225 --> 05:11.728
Now what about the fulfillment?

05:11.728 --> 05:14.063
When do you think the cry went up,

05:14.063 --> 05:17.266
“Here is the bridegroom”?

05:17.266 --> 05:20.236
You’re right, 1914.

05:20.236 --> 05:23.706
But the bridegroom didn’t come just then.

05:23.706 --> 05:25.808
When does he come?

05:25.808 --> 05:28.011
At the great tribulation.

05:28.011 --> 05:30.013
How do we know?

05:30.013 --> 05:33.950
We know because in Matthew 24 and 25,

05:33.950 --> 05:37.687
there are eight references 
to the coming of the Master,

05:37.687 --> 05:41.958
and each and every one of them 
refer to the great tribulation.

05:41.958 --> 05:45.128
So we’re talking 
about the Master returning

05:45.128 --> 05:49.098
—the bridegroom coming 
at the great tribulation.

05:49.098 --> 05:53.836
And will he find the anointed 
with their lamps burning,

05:53.836 --> 05:58.141
or will they have let their light go out?

05:58.141 --> 06:01.577
That is the simple question there.

06:01.577 --> 06:06.249
Now, is Jesus saying that many 
of the anointed would be found unfaithful

06:06.249 --> 06:08.918
when the great tribulation breaks out?

06:08.918 --> 06:10.219
No.

06:10.219 --> 06:13.856
Remember what we said 
about the evil slave

06:13.856 --> 06:16.592
referred to in Matthew 24?

06:16.592 --> 06:20.263
He talks 
about a “faithful and discreet slave,”

06:20.263 --> 06:22.765
and then he talks about an evil slave.

06:22.765 --> 06:25.701
And we learn that Jesus is not saying

06:25.701 --> 06:28.805
that there is 
a separate “faithful and discreet slave”

06:28.805 --> 06:31.941
and then a separate and distinct evil slave.

06:31.941 --> 06:36.946
But rather, he is saying, 
if the faithful slave becomes evil,

06:36.946 --> 06:40.616
then he cannot expect the Master’s favor.

06:40.616 --> 06:44.020
And it’s the same 
with the parable of the virgins.

06:44.020 --> 06:46.022
He’s saying, 
if any of the anointed

06:46.022 --> 06:49.125
did allow their light to go out,

06:49.125 --> 06:53.229
they could not expect 
the favor of the bridegroom

06:53.229 --> 06:57.133
and be allowed to enter 
into the wedding feast.

06:57.133 --> 06:59.902
Well, that’s very interesting.

06:59.902 --> 07:02.038
But that’s quite a statement, isn’t it?

07:02.038 --> 07:05.241
And some have had 
questions about the evil slave

07:05.241 --> 07:09.979
and whether the Bible really allows 
for the faithful slave becoming evil

07:09.979 --> 07:11.981
or whether it’s a separate group.

07:11.981 --> 07:14.650
And the reason why 
they’ve raised the question

07:14.650 --> 07:18.387
is because of the way Jesus 
put it in Matthew chapter 24.

07:18.387 --> 07:20.423
Let’s just check it

07:21.958 --> 07:23.993
—Matthew 24.

07:26.696 --> 07:29.365
Now, we know in verse 45,

07:29.365 --> 07:33.069
Jesus said: “Who really is 
the faithful and discreet slave?”

07:33.069 --> 07:37.240
Verse 46: 
“Happy is that slave

07:37.240 --> 07:40.476
if his master on coming 
finds him doing so!”

07:40.476 --> 07:43.045
But then, in verse 48, he says:

07:43.045 --> 07:46.315
“But if ever that evil slave says

07:46.315 --> 07:48.451
“in his heart, ‘My master is delaying,’”

07:48.451 --> 07:51.154
and then, in verse 50: 
“The master . . . will come . . .

07:51.154 --> 07:54.223
and he will punish him 
with the greatest severity.”

07:54.223 --> 07:56.792
So they’ve looked at the expression

07:56.792 --> 07:59.595
“if ever that evil slave” and they’ve said,

07:59.595 --> 08:04.500
“Well, doesn’t that allow 
for a separate evil slave?”

08:04.500 --> 08:07.570
And we say no.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.139
But why do we say that?

08:10.139 --> 08:14.377
Just look at the end of verse 48.

08:14.377 --> 08:18.080
Do you see at the very end 
of verse 48 there’s a little “j”?

08:18.080 --> 08:20.283
It’s a marginal reference.

08:20.283 --> 08:23.319
Now, notice the marginal reference to “j.”

08:23.319 --> 08:26.522
It returns us to our go-to scripture,

08:26.522 --> 08:28.524
Luke chapter 12,

08:28.524 --> 08:31.194
this time verses 45 and 46.

08:31.194 --> 08:34.630
So let’s see 
if that will shed some light on this.

08:34.630 --> 08:36.632
Let’s turn to Luke chapter 12,

08:38.267 --> 08:41.437
and we’re going 
to start reading from verse 42.

08:41.437 --> 08:43.973
And remember what we’re trying to discover:

08:43.973 --> 08:46.709
Is Jesus talking about two different groups

08:46.709 --> 08:48.945
—a faithful slave and an evil slave?

08:48.945 --> 08:52.381
Or is he talking 
about the faithful slave becoming evil?

08:52.381 --> 08:56.185
See if the way he puts it 
on this occasion clarifies it for you.

08:56.185 --> 08:58.521
Starting with verse 42:

08:58.521 --> 09:00.990
“Who really is the faithful steward,

09:00.990 --> 09:05.595
“the discreet one, whom his master 
will appoint over his body of attendants

09:05.595 --> 09:09.131
“to keep giving them their measure 
of food supplies at the proper time?

09:09.131 --> 09:11.200
“Happy is that slave

09:11.200 --> 09:14.837
“if his master on coming finds him doing so!

09:14.837 --> 09:18.641
I tell you truthfully, 
he will appoint him over all his belongings.”

09:18.641 --> 09:20.776
Well, we’re on track, aren’t we?

09:20.776 --> 09:23.879
This is what Jesus 
was talking about in Matthew 24.

09:23.879 --> 09:26.182
But now notice the way he puts it

09:26.182 --> 09:28.884
according to verse 45:

09:28.884 --> 09:32.822
“But if ever that slave,”

09:32.822 --> 09:37.326
the same slave that’s mentioned 
in verse 43: “Happy is that slave.”

09:37.326 --> 09:39.996
“If ever that slave should say in his heart,

09:39.996 --> 09:42.265
“‘My master delays coming,’

09:42.265 --> 09:46.202
“and starts to beat 
the male and female servants

09:46.202 --> 09:49.839
“and to eat and drink 
and get drunk, the master of that slave

09:49.839 --> 09:52.141
“will come on a day 
that he is not expecting him

09:52.141 --> 09:54.143
“and at an hour that he does not know,

09:54.143 --> 09:56.479
and he will punish him 
with the greatest severity.”

09:56.479 --> 09:58.914
He’s talking about the same slave, isn’t he?

09:58.914 --> 10:02.151
If that slave is faithful, 
he will be rewarded;

10:02.151 --> 10:06.022
if that slave is unfaithful, 
he will be punished.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.958
And it’s the same 
with the parable of the virgins.

10:08.958 --> 10:11.694
If the virgins are faithful, 
they will be rewarded;

10:11.694 --> 10:14.397
if not, they will be punished.

10:14.397 --> 10:18.334
This parable does have 
relevance to the “great crowd.”

10:18.334 --> 10:20.002
How do we know?

10:20.002 --> 10:23.439
Mark 13:37, Jesus said:

10:23.439 --> 10:27.476
“What I say to you, I say to all:

10:27.476 --> 10:29.645
Keep on the watch.”

10:29.645 --> 10:33.683
So just as the anointed have to be found 
faithful at the great tribulation,

10:33.683 --> 10:38.087
those of the great crowd 
have to be found faithful as well.

10:38.087 --> 10:42.058
So in very simple terms, 
how would you sum up

10:42.058 --> 10:45.728
the lesson of the parable of the virgins?

10:45.728 --> 10:53.930
Keep on the watch!

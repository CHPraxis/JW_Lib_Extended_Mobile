00:01 Well, if you’re like me,
00:04 you may need to review
00:06 some of these points sometimes.
00:09 We had the parable of the virgins explained
00:12 in The Watchtower some time ago.
00:14 But let’s try to review the parable
00:17 and see what we can remember.
00:19 Now, we know that there are ten virgins,
00:23 and all of them are waiting  for a bridegroom to come.
00:27 Now, there are  five wise virgins, or discreet virgins,
00:32 and then there are five foolish virgins.
00:35 And there’s a difference.
00:37 The wise are prepared for any contingency.
00:40 They not only have oil in their lamps
00:43 but they have extra oil as well.
00:46 And you can be sure  that it’s virgin olive oil.
00:53 Now, the wise virgins,  why do they have so much oil?
00:58 Because they’re willing  to wait until the bridegroom comes.
01:01 They must love the bridegroom very much.
01:04 And they know that it’s all about him;  it’s not about them.
01:07 They want somebody to be on hand  when the bridegroom arrives.
01:12 The foolish virgins
01:14 —well, they’re willing to wait for a while.
01:16 But the bridegroom had better hurry up
01:19 because they only have  a little bit of oil in their lamp,
01:21 and they have no extra oil at all.
01:25 They’re primarily concerned with themselves.
01:29 Well, the bridegroom doesn’t come right away,
01:32 and all of the virgins fall asleep.
01:35 But in the middle  of the night, there is a cry,
01:38 apparently in the distance:
01:40 “Here is the bridegroom!”
01:43 But the bridegroom  still doesn’t make an appearance.
01:46 Well, the virgins awaken,  they dress their lamps,
01:51 they put their lamps in order,  and they wait.
01:55 And still the bridegroom doesn’t come.
01:58 The lamps  of the foolish virgins begin to flicker,
02:03 and they realize  that they’re going to run out of oil.
02:05 So they ask the wise  to share some of their oil with them,
02:10 and the wise refuse.
02:12 Why?
02:13 Because they’re selfish?
02:14 No.
02:16 Because they’re wise.
02:18 If they share some of their oil  with the foolish virgins,
02:22 then the wise will run out  and the foolish will run out
02:26 and then no one will be  on hand to greet the bridegroom.
02:29 And really, it’s all about the bridegroom.
02:31 They want someone to be on hand
02:34 to hail the bridegroom when he arrives.
02:37 So, what do the foolish do?
02:40 They rush off to find an all-night 7-Eleven
02:44 or Walmart that might be selling oil
02:47 —like that’s going  to happen in the first century.
02:50 And in the meantime, while they’re gone,
02:52 the bridegroom arrives
02:54 and the wise virgins  are ushered into the wedding feast.
02:59 Well, now this is  a parable for the last days.
03:02 How do we know that?
03:05 Because everything in Matthew 24 and 25
03:08 relates to the last days.
03:10 So we’re talking  about something that occurs
03:13 during Jesus’ presence.
03:15 Whom do the virgins represent?
03:19 All of the anointed.
03:21 Not just “the faithful and discreet slave”
03:24 but all of the anointed.
03:27 Now, that’s quite a statement.
03:29 How would you prove that?
03:31 What scripture would you point to to prove
03:35 that the virgins represent all  of the anointed and not just a small class
03:39 —small group— like “the faithful and discreet slave”?
03:44 Our go-to scripture is Luke chapter 12.
03:49 Let’s turn there.
03:51 And now, this is not  a parallel scripture to Matthew 24.
03:55 This is Jesus talking about  the same subject on another occasion,
03:58 but this will clarify matters for us.
04:01 Luke chapter 12,
04:04 and first we’ll read  verse 32 to get the context.
04:09 He says: “Have no fear, little flock.”
04:13 Well, who constitute the “little flock”?
04:16 All of the anointed, right?
04:18 “Have no fear, little flock,
04:20 for your Father has approved  of giving you the Kingdom.”
04:23 So he’s talking to all of the anointed.
04:25 And what does he say  to them in verses 35 and 36?
04:29 See if you can see  the similarity with what we just read.
04:34 “Be dressed and ready
04:36 “and have your lamps burning,
04:39 “and you should be like men waiting  for their master to return from the marriage,
04:44 so when he comes and knocks,  they may at once open to him.”
04:48 Do you see the similarity  between Matthew 24 and Luke 12?
04:51 So now Jesus is addressing these words
04:54 to all of the anointed.
04:58 Now, in the parable there’s an interval
05:02 between the cry “Here is the bridegroom!”
05:06 and the coming of the bridegroom.
05:09 Now what about the fulfillment?
05:11 When do you think the cry went up,
05:14 “Here is the bridegroom”?
05:17 You’re right, 1914.
05:20 But the bridegroom didn’t come just then.
05:23 When does he come?
05:25 At the great tribulation.
05:28 How do we know?
05:30 We know because in Matthew 24 and 25,
05:33 there are eight references  to the coming of the Master,
05:37 and each and every one of them  refer to the great tribulation.
05:41 So we’re talking  about the Master returning
05:45 —the bridegroom coming  at the great tribulation.
05:49 And will he find the anointed  with their lamps burning,
05:53 or will they have let their light go out?
05:58 That is the simple question there.
06:01 Now, is Jesus saying that many  of the anointed would be found unfaithful
06:06 when the great tribulation breaks out?
06:08 No.
06:10 Remember what we said  about the evil slave
06:13 referred to in Matthew 24?
06:16 He talks  about a “faithful and discreet slave,”
06:20 and then he talks about an evil slave.
06:22 And we learn that Jesus is not saying
06:25 that there is  a separate “faithful and discreet slave”
06:28 and then a separate and distinct evil slave.
06:31 But rather, he is saying,  if the faithful slave becomes evil,
06:36 then he cannot expect the Master’s favor.
06:40 And it’s the same  with the parable of the virgins.
06:44 He’s saying,  if any of the anointed
06:46 did allow their light to go out,
06:49 they could not expect  the favor of the bridegroom
06:53 and be allowed to enter  into the wedding feast.
06:57 Well, that’s very interesting.
06:59 But that’s quite a statement, isn’t it?
07:02 And some have had  questions about the evil slave
07:05 and whether the Bible really allows  for the faithful slave becoming evil
07:09 or whether it’s a separate group.
07:11 And the reason why  they’ve raised the question
07:14 is because of the way Jesus  put it in Matthew chapter 24.
07:18 Let’s just check it
07:21 —Matthew 24.
07:26 Now, we know in verse 45,
07:29 Jesus said: “Who really is  the faithful and discreet slave?”
07:33 Verse 46:  “Happy is that slave
07:37 if his master on coming  finds him doing so!”
07:40 But then, in verse 48, he says:
07:43 “But if ever that evil slave says
07:46 “in his heart, ‘My master is delaying,’”
07:48 and then, in verse 50:  “The master . . . will come . . .
07:51 and he will punish him  with the greatest severity.”
07:54 So they’ve looked at the expression
07:56 “if ever that evil slave” and they’ve said,
07:59 “Well, doesn’t that allow  for a separate evil slave?”
08:04 And we say no.
08:07 But why do we say that?
08:10 Just look at the end of verse 48.
08:14 Do you see at the very end  of verse 48 there’s a little “j”?
08:18 It’s a marginal reference.
08:20 Now, notice the marginal reference to “j.”
08:23 It returns us to our go-to scripture,
08:26 Luke chapter 12,
08:28 this time verses 45 and 46.
08:31 So let’s see  if that will shed some light on this.
08:34 Let’s turn to Luke chapter 12,
08:38 and we’re going  to start reading from verse 42.
08:41 And remember what we’re trying to discover:
08:43 Is Jesus talking about two different groups
08:46 —a faithful slave and an evil slave?
08:48 Or is he talking  about the faithful slave becoming evil?
08:52 See if the way he puts it  on this occasion clarifies it for you.
08:56 Starting with verse 42:
08:58 “Who really is the faithful steward,
09:00 “the discreet one, whom his master  will appoint over his body of attendants
09:05 “to keep giving them their measure  of food supplies at the proper time?
09:09 “Happy is that slave
09:11 “if his master on coming finds him doing so!
09:14 I tell you truthfully,  he will appoint him over all his belongings.”
09:18 Well, we’re on track, aren’t we?
09:20 This is what Jesus  was talking about in Matthew 24.
09:23 But now notice the way he puts it
09:26 according to verse 45:
09:28 “But if ever that slave,”
09:32 the same slave that’s mentioned  in verse 43: “Happy is that slave.”
09:37 “If ever that slave should say in his heart,
09:39 “‘My master delays coming,’
09:42 “and starts to beat  the male and female servants
09:46 “and to eat and drink  and get drunk, the master of that slave
09:49 “will come on a day  that he is not expecting him
09:52 “and at an hour that he does not know,
09:54 and he will punish him  with the greatest severity.”
09:56 He’s talking about the same slave, isn’t he?
09:58 If that slave is faithful,  he will be rewarded;
10:02 if that slave is unfaithful,  he will be punished.
10:06 And it’s the same  with the parable of the virgins.
10:08 If the virgins are faithful,  they will be rewarded;
10:11 if not, they will be punished.
10:14 This parable does have  relevance to the “great crowd.”
10:18 How do we know?
10:20 Mark 13:37, Jesus said:
10:23 “What I say to you, I say to all:
10:27 Keep on the watch.”
10:29 So just as the anointed have to be found  faithful at the great tribulation,
10:33 those of the great crowd  have to be found faithful as well.
10:38 So in very simple terms,  how would you sum up
10:42 the lesson of the parable of the virgins?
10:45 Keep on the watch!

00:01 Imitation really is built into human nature.
00:05 It’s one of our most used
00:07 and powerful learning tools.
00:09 I mean, think of all the things
00:11 that you’ve learned by imitation.
00:12 Even just think
00:13 of the current work assignments you have
00:15 or your job.
00:16 How much of it did you learn  by just watching someone else do that work?
00:21 Children imitate their parents  when they learn how to speak,
00:25 think, eat, and even walk just like them.
00:28 Children even learn to imitate  the very subtle accents of their parents,
00:32 and those accents get passed on  from one generation to the next.
00:36 I’ve had people say to me,  “John, you walk just like your father.”
00:40 I have no idea how that happened.
00:44 Sometimes we imitate others,  and we don’t even know that we’re doing it.
00:49 Have you ever been listening to the radio,
00:51 and a few hours later  you’re humming or singing a song,
00:54 and you realize that that was the very song
00:57 that was on the radio several hours ago?
01:01 Imitation is such a part
01:04 of the human learning experience  that we’re doing it all the time.
01:07 We can’t turn it off.
01:10 Imitation is also used by animals
01:13 to learn their skills  by watching their parents.
01:16 I saw the cutest example of this
01:18 when we were watching  a herd of elephants in Zambia.
01:21 The mother elephant  and the baby elephant were walking by,
01:24 and the baby elephant  was trying to grab some grass
01:28 and tear it off and put it in his mouth  like his mother was;
01:32 but every time he did it,  he ended up with nothing.
01:35 But he was sure watching his mom  —how she was doing it—
01:39 and seeing how he could imitate  and get some of that for himself.
01:44 Well, since imitation  is such a powerful learning tool
01:49 and has such an effect on the person we are
01:51 and the person that we are to become,
01:54 we need to be very careful  about who we choose to imitate.
01:58 Who do you choose to imitate?
02:01 Well, see, who we choose to imitate  determines who we want to become.
02:06 That’s why there’s so much caution  in the Scriptures about our association,
02:10 because who we choose to imitate  rubs off on us, so to speak,
02:15 in subtle ways  that we might not even notice right away.
02:18 Notice the counsel given to the Israelites
02:21 about not imitating the nations around them.
02:24 If you look at Exodus 23:24,
02:28 notice the counsel  that Jehovah gave to the Israelites.
02:33 He said:  “You must not bow down to their gods
02:36 “or be persuaded to serve them,
02:38 and you must not imitate their practices.”
02:42 And he continues this thought  at Deuteronomy 18:9.
02:53 Deuteronomy 18:9, it says:
02:55 “When you have entered into the land  that Jehovah your God is giving you,
02:59 “you must not learn to imitate
03:02 the detestable practices of those nations.”
03:07 Well, what happened when the Israelites  chose to imitate the nations around them,
03:11 to ignore the advice Jehovah had given them?
03:14 Well, let’s look at 2 Kings 17:15.
03:20 Second Kings 17:15:
03:28 “They continued rejecting  his regulations and his covenant
03:31 “that he had made with their forefathers
03:33 “and his reminders  that he had given to warn them,
03:36 “and they kept following worthless idols
03:38 “[And notice what happened  to them when they did that.]
03:41 “and became worthless themselves,
03:43 “imitating the nations all around them
03:46 that Jehovah  had commanded them not to imitate.”
03:50 So if we imitate worthless things,  what’s going to happen to us?
03:54 We’re going to be worthless.
03:56 If we fast-forward to Christian times,
03:58 we can see  that the same advice was given to us.
04:02 If we look at 3 John 11,
04:10 it’s very straightforward advice:
04:12 “Beloved one, do not imitate what is bad,
04:16 “but imitate what is good.
04:19 “The one who does good originates with God.
04:21 The one who does bad has not seen God.”
04:25 Well, the message is clear.
04:26 If we want to ‘see God,’  or have a good relationship with Jehovah,
04:31 then we need to imitate what is good.
04:33 And our text for today at Ephesians 5:1
04:37 really says it  about as simply and clearly as we can:
04:41 “Become imitators of God.”
04:44 So Jehovah is telling us  in our text for today: ‘Imitate me.’
04:48 So if someone asks us, “Who do you choose to imitate?”
04:51 we follow the advice of Ephesians 5:1;
04:54 we want to imitate Jehovah.
04:56 Well, how can we imitate Jehovah?
04:59 Well, first, one way is by reading the Bible.
05:02 We have learned love, hope, faith, loyalty,
05:06 and so many other fine qualities
05:09 by reading about how Jehovah  wants us to conduct ourselves.
05:13 I mean, look at the Law  that Jehovah gave to the nation of Israel.
05:17 We can learn so much about how Jehovah
05:20 feels about being honest, clean, fair, just.
05:25 Or in different Bible examples,  we see Jehovah’s patience
05:29 in dealing with Jonah  and His mercy in dealing with the Ninevites.
05:35 Reading the Bible  gives us a very clear picture
05:38 of our perfect God, Jehovah,  who we worship.
05:40 And he gives us  the perfect role model to imitate.
05:44 When we read the Bible  and continually ask ourselves,
05:47 ‘What do I learn about Jehovah,  and how can I learn to imitate him?’
05:51 that really is like us keeping our eye  on Jehovah, with our mind’s eye,
05:55 and watching what he’s doing,  and we’re imitating him.
06:00 Another way that we can imitate Jehovah
06:02 is by imitating others who are imitating him.
06:05 Jehovah has used the pages of the Bible
06:08 to give us real-life stories  of people who we can imitate.
06:11 I mean, we’ve never met Abraham and Sarah,
06:14 but don’t you feel like you know them?
06:16 I’m sure there’s much more that we can learn
06:19 about these beautiful, spiritual people  in the new world,
06:22 but what is laid out  in the Scriptures is enough
06:25 for us to imitate  the beautiful examples they set for us.
06:29 Or what about Jesus?
06:30 We’ve never met Jesus,
06:32 but by reading the Bible accounts,
06:34 don’t you feel like you know him
06:36 and you know how he would react  and think about certain situations?
06:41 The apostle Paul simply explained this
06:45 at 1 Corinthians 11:1.
06:47 He said: “Become imitators of me,  . . . as I am of Christ.”
06:51 So we have Jesus Christ  as an example of imitating his Father.
06:55 The apostle Paul was imitating Christ.
06:58 Now, the apostle Paul,  of course, wasn’t saying,
07:01 “Imitate the way I give my talks;  imitate the way I move;
07:03 imitate the way I walk or say things.”
07:06 But at Hebrews 13:7,
07:10 he stressed what it was that we  were to imitate about others,
07:15 Hebrews 13:7:
07:17 “Remember those who  are taking the lead among you,
07:20 “who have spoken the word of God to you,
07:22 “and as you contemplate  how their conduct turns out,
07:26 imitate their faith.”
07:29 So we are to imitate the faith
07:33 and example that others set in imitating  Jesus and imitating Jehovah.
07:39 Now, to illustrate the choice  that we have of who we’re going to imitate,
07:44 I’d like you to imagine in your mind
07:46 two big, huge machines with lots of parts.
07:50 Now, one machine is run  by Jehovah and Jesus Christ,
07:54 and the other machine  is run by Satan and the world.
07:58 And I want you to imagine  that you’re a part on the mechanics bench.
08:02 When Jehovah goes to pick you up  and look at you and see,
08:06 Do you fit as a part in his organization?
08:11 well, we can if we imitate him
08:14 and other spiritual people  who are useful to Jehovah.
08:17 We can become a useful part  of his beautiful organization.
08:23 If we imitate Jehovah,  then if Satan goes over to that bench
08:28 and picks us up  and tries to put us into his machine,
08:31 we’re not going to fit anywhere.
08:33 We are no part of his world or organization.
08:38 I mean, how sad it would be
08:40 if we shaped  and imitated ourselves after the world
08:44 and when Satan picked us up we fit right in
08:46 with his machine and organization!
08:50 So who do you choose to imitate?
08:53 We choose to imitate Jehovah.
08:55 We want to be just like him when we grow up.
09:00 How can we imitate Jehovah?
09:03 By getting to know him personally  through reading the Bible
09:07 and imitating others who are imitating him.

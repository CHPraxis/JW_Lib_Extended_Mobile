00:03.440 --> 00:05.442
Every day we make choices

00:05.442 --> 00:08.821
that can affect 
our relationship with Jehovah.

00:08.821 --> 00:10.823
When there’s a clear Scriptural command,

00:10.823 --> 00:12.783
the right choice may seem easy.

00:14.535 --> 00:18.247
But what if there’s not?

00:18.247 --> 00:21.709
How can we be sure 
we’re making a wise decision?

00:23.752 --> 00:26.922
An invitation to our niece’s wedding arrived.

00:28.257 --> 00:31.385
Thomas was excited about it.

00:34.096 --> 00:36.390
I was excited too.

00:38.684 --> 00:40.811
But the ceremony

00:40.811 --> 00:43.230
was being held at a local church.

00:44.315 --> 00:48.110
I wondered if it would still be OK 
for me to attend.

00:49.194 --> 00:51.196
Even though Thomas wasn’t yet willing

00:51.196 --> 00:54.950
to accept a Bible study, 
he gradually softened over the years

00:54.950 --> 00:57.161
since I came into the truth.

00:57.161 --> 01:01.332
I knew he understood why 
I would never enter a church for worship,

01:01.332 --> 01:03.918
but what about attending a wedding?

01:03.918 --> 01:06.253
Jehovah approves of weddings.

01:09.256 --> 01:10.883
That afternoon,

01:10.883 --> 01:12.927
I went to help Amy plan a menu

01:12.927 --> 01:15.930
for the pioneer school lunch coming up.

01:18.682 --> 01:22.645
She noticed I was a bit distracted,

01:22.645 --> 01:25.314
so I told her my concerns about the wedding.

01:25.314 --> 01:28.108
But you’re not thinking of going, are you?

01:28.108 --> 01:31.820
Amy sure had a strong opinion on the matter,

01:31.820 --> 01:35.616
but I didn’t feel 
she really understood my situation.

01:37.826 --> 01:40.287
Although I appreciated her concern,

01:40.287 --> 01:43.082
I felt like she was judging me.

01:45.334 --> 01:48.295
The next day, I decided 
to visit Charlotte and Allan

01:48.295 --> 01:50.506
and ask their advice.

01:52.424 --> 01:55.094
Like me, Charlotte had come into the truth

01:55.094 --> 02:00.015
many years before Allan, 
so they really understood my situation.

02:00.015 --> 02:02.017
Is Amy right?

02:02.017 --> 02:04.645
Would it be wrong to attend the wedding?

02:04.645 --> 02:06.772
What would you do if you were me?

02:07.982 --> 02:10.275
Charlotte explained that in situations

02:10.275 --> 02:12.945
where there’s no specific Bible command,

02:12.945 --> 02:14.947
it becomes a matter of conscience.

02:16.281 --> 02:19.368
And what one person’s conscience allows

02:19.368 --> 02:21.453
may be different from another.

02:23.163 --> 02:25.165
The important thing

02:25.165 --> 02:28.419
is that we make decisions 
that leave us with a good conscience.

02:41.181 --> 02:44.351
But how do I do that?

02:44.351 --> 02:49.148
Dear Emma, it’s really a matter of training.

02:49.148 --> 02:52.067
Allan showed me the scripture 
at Hebrews 5:14,

02:52.067 --> 02:54.069
where the apostle Paul wrote:

02:54.069 --> 02:56.655
“Solid food belongs to mature people,

02:56.655 --> 02:58.657
“to those who through use

02:58.657 --> 03:01.201
“have their powers of discernment trained

03:01.201 --> 03:03.579
to distinguish both right and wrong.”

03:06.957 --> 03:11.170
But Paul didn’t just write those words;

03:11.170 --> 03:15.549
he lived them.

03:15.549 --> 03:19.219
He carefully studied 
the principles in God’s Word.

03:20.679 --> 03:24.099
And as a result, 
he was able to make decisions

03:24.099 --> 03:26.393
that left him with a good conscience.

03:30.397 --> 03:33.859
So even when there’s no stated law 
on a matter,

03:33.859 --> 03:36.111
we can always find a Bible principle

03:36.111 --> 03:39.281
that can give us insight into God’s thinking.

03:42.367 --> 03:46.747
So I made it a matter of prayer, 
and then I got to work.

03:51.418 --> 03:54.296
I researched articles

03:54.296 --> 03:57.716
in the Watch Tower Publications Index 
and the Research Guide.

03:59.426 --> 04:04.056
I found a really good thought 
in chapter 2 of the “God’s Love” book.

04:08.143 --> 04:11.480
I also read about others 
who faced similar situations

04:11.480 --> 04:15.526
and what Bible principles they found helpful.

04:15.526 --> 04:19.321
Then I meditated on all these.

04:26.662 --> 04:29.373
As I kept studying, 
I was able to bring my conscience

04:29.373 --> 04:32.334
in harmony with Jehovah’s spirit,

04:32.334 --> 04:34.378
not just with my heart.

04:45.305 --> 04:48.684
I realized that having 
a Bible-trained conscience

04:48.684 --> 04:52.980
doesn’t mean everyone 
will always think exactly alike

04:52.980 --> 04:55.023
—and that’s OK.

04:55.023 --> 04:59.319
But if we train our conscience 
by applying Bible principles,

04:59.319 --> 05:02.239
it will guide us along in life, 
so that each of us

05:02.239 --> 05:13.398
can remain in God’s love.

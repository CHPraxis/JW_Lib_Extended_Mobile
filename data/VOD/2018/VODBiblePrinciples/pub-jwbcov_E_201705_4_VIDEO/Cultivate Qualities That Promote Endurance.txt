00:06 Ah, you’re up early today.
00:09 Dad?
00:10 Yeah?
00:12 I want to get baptized.
00:13 OK, let’s talk about it.
00:17 I was thinking, you know, Mom was baptized  when she was 12, and, you know, I . . .
00:22 And now you’re 12, is that it?
00:24 I know what you’re thinking, Dad,  but I’m ready.
00:26 I know I am.
00:27 I tell you what,
00:28 let’s do a special family study series first.
00:31 OK?
00:33 On what?
00:36 Well, we’ll start with faith.
00:40 Being dedicated to Jehovah
00:42 and staying dedicated to him,
00:45 it requires that we have strong faith.
00:50 “By faith Noah, after receiving  divine warning of things not yet seen,
00:55 showed godly fear  and constructed an ark.”
00:59 Abraham just “as good as offered up Isaac.”
01:01 So how did that take a lot of faith?
01:06 So the Bible says  that Abel was faithful his whole life,
01:08 but he was also faithful until death.
01:11 So, what do you think that means?
01:37 Rachel,
01:39 keep your faith strong  and you will never fail.
01:42 Love, Dad.
02:19 How do you like the pictures?
02:21 I really like this one of us.
02:24 Oh, your mom  would have really liked this one.
02:27 I just wish  she could have been there today.
02:30 I know, me too.
02:33 Which is why I’ve been thinking  that if she were here,
02:36 I think she would have wanted  you to have this.
02:39 Mom’s memory book.
02:41 I thought you  could pick up where she left off
02:43 and fill it with your theocratic memories.
02:47 And then, one day soon, we can share  those memories with her in the new world.
02:50 What do you say?
02:51 Yeah, I would love that.
02:53 Yeah? Good.
02:54 Thanks, Dad.
02:55 You’re welcome.
03:06 Hey, Dad.
03:07 Hey, Rachel.
03:08 I was just looking  at some old pictures of you.
03:10 Wow, that was a long time ago.
03:13 Yeah, it was.
03:15 Hey, is there any mail for me?
03:17 Yeah, it’s right here on the counter.
03:19 Ah, OK.
03:24 It’s just another wedding invitation.
03:29 How was your day?
03:31 How was the museum?
03:35 Oh, it was OK.
03:38 Is something bothering you?
03:43 Yeah.
03:45 I feel like all my friends  are getting married.
03:49 People at work wonder why I’m not dating.
03:52 And they’ve even tried to set me up.
03:55 I mean, come on, aren’t you interested in,  you know, being with a guy?
04:02 I met someone at the museum today.
04:04 He was really nice.
04:07 I’m finally getting the attention I want,
04:09 but it’s not from a Witness.
04:11 Just call me, OK?
04:12 Maybe, maybe.
04:13 It’ll be fun.
04:14 So, what are you going to do about it?
04:32 Rachel, always remember,
04:35 virtue is a beautiful quality.
04:38 It’s not just passive avoidance  but has real power
04:43 —power to do good.
04:45 Treasure virtue  and Jehovah will treasure you.
04:49 Love, Dad.
04:55 Virtue is based on our love for Jehovah.
04:59 As it says in the book of Psalms:
05:02 “O you lovers of Jehovah, hate what is bad.”
05:09 Just call me, OK?
05:11 It’ll be fun.
05:13 Do I love Jehovah enough to hate what is bad?
05:29 Hey, any mail for me today?
05:31 No, not today.
05:33 Ah, the printing company called though.
05:34 I picked up this package for you.
05:36 The invitations arrived.
05:37 Yeah.
05:39 Eventually, I ended up getting engaged  to a wonderful brother.
05:43 But even so,
05:45 I realized that marriage  wasn’t the solution to my problem.
05:50 Remaining faithful to Jehovah  is what really made me happy.
06:07 Mom, do we have anything to eat?
06:10 I can’t believe you’re still hungry.
06:13 He is a growing boy.
06:15 What are you going to do  with all that energy, Son?
06:16 I’m trying to study.
06:18 For school?
06:20 No, it’s for the meeting tomorrow.
06:21 I want to be able to give a comment.
06:23 That’s good.
06:24 I’m sensing there’s a problem though.
06:26 Yeah, a big one.
06:27 I don’t like to study.
06:29 It’s so boring.
06:31 You know,  I used to find it hard to study too,
06:33 and then I realized  study can be like exercise.
06:38 It may not seem enjoyable at first,
06:41 but once you make the effort  and then establish a regular routine,
06:45 it becomes enjoyable
06:47 —even fun.
06:49 And soon,  it won’t feel like work anymore.
06:51 I agree.
06:53 I’ll tell you what,  we can go up to your room,
06:56 and I’ll show you how  to get the most out of your study.
06:59 OK, sounds good.
07:03 All right,
07:05 I thought we’d start by showing me,  maybe, where you’re stuck.
07:07 Well, I’m trying to find the answer. . .
07:09 Dad reminded me  to pray to Jehovah first,
07:11 asking for help  to understand what I’m studying.
07:15 He said it’s important  to look up the scriptures
07:18 and make sure I review the main points.
07:20 Then, think about how  the material applies to me.
07:24 I learned that study  isn’t just preparing for meetings;
07:27 it’s learning about Jehovah  and how to live a good life.
07:31 And it doesn’t always mean reading.
07:35 Sometimes I can even look at creation
07:38 or draw pictures about something I learned.
07:41 After a few weeks,  I really started to enjoy it
07:44 and my study time flew by.
07:55 Where’s Noah?
07:57 He’s up in his room studying.
07:59 Really?
08:07 Are you still studying?
08:09 Oh, man, Grandpa and Dad were right.
08:12 About what?
08:13 Well, they said that studying  wouldn’t feel like work anymore.
08:16 I remember when Grandpa  said the same thing to me.
08:19 Really?
08:20 I brought this for you.
08:22 He gave this to me  when I was about your age.
08:25 Rachel, apply yourself to study,
08:29 and soon it won’t feel like work.
08:31 Love, Dad.
08:42 Hey, Mom.
08:43 Morning, Noah.
08:44 You going out in service?
08:45 No, actually,  I have some things I need to get done,
08:48 and then I was hoping  to do some painting or sketching later.
08:51 Nice.
08:52 Oh, good.  You must be ahead on your schedule.
08:53 You ready, Son?
08:55 Ready.
08:56 Thanks for lunch.
08:57 You’re welcome.  See you.
08:58 Have a good day.
08:59 Bye, Mom. Love you.
09:00 I’ve been planning  this day off for months now.
09:03 I really want a chance to relax and paint.
09:06 I hardly ever get to take some time off.
09:09 Nothing is going to get in the way.
09:16 Hi, Anne.
09:17 Hey, Rach.  How are you?
09:19 Good.  How are you?
09:20 Good.  Well, I’m on the way to the hall for service,
09:23 and I was wondering if later today,  maybe if you had some time—
09:27 I started a new study with this young girl.
09:28 Oh, nice.
09:29 Actually, you know,  I already have plans for the day.
09:31 Oh, OK.
09:32 What about Sarah?
09:33 I checked.
09:34 She has plans.
09:35 Daisy?
09:36 No.
09:37 Simone?
09:38 No, but that’s OK.
09:40 I’ll find somebody.
09:41 Thanks so much for understanding, Anne.
09:43 I felt bad, but she didn’t seem to mind.
09:47 Like she said,  I’m sure she’ll find someone.
09:59 Well, look at that.
10:01 My old memory book.
10:03 I haven’t seen this in a while.
10:10 Dad’s cards always gave me such good advice.
10:17 Rachel, self-control is more  than just refraining from doing bad.
10:22 It compels us to do good,
10:24 like Kingdom preaching.
10:26 Don’t let the unwilling flesh  extinguish the fire of a willing spirit.
10:31 Love, Dad.
10:36 Self-control  —I never thought of it that way before.
10:41 There’s nothing wrong with taking a day off,
10:44 but Anne does need help.
10:47 And I’ll still have time  to paint when I get back.
10:52 Change of plans, Rachel.
10:58 Hi, Anne.  This is Rachel.
11:00 Did you find anybody  to go on the Bible study with you?
11:04 Could I go with you?
11:07 Perfect, where can I meet you?
11:11 See you soon.
11:17 I’m glad I decided to help Anne.
11:20 That was such a good Bible study,
11:25 and I still have time to paint.
11:28 This turned out to be a great day.
11:35 So how was pioneer school?
11:37 It was great.
11:38 We had Brother Daniels
11:39 as our primary instructor.
11:41 He’s incredible.
11:42 He’s a good teacher.
11:44 And, Noah, what was it like  to be in pioneer school with your grandpa?
11:47 It was great; it really was.
11:49 Hard to believe, though,
11:50 I never thought  this system would last so long.
11:52 And I certainly never thought  I’d be a grandfather.
11:54 So, Grandpa,  what was it like when you were my age?
11:57 Well, when I was about your age,  I had just become a new father.
12:05 I could tell even then  that your mother was going to be an artist.
12:08 Those were good times for us.
12:12 A few years later, though,
12:16 your grandmother became seriously ill.
12:20 Hey, Sweetie.
12:21 We didn’t know it at the time,  but she wasn’t going to get better.
12:27 Watching your best friend  die a little each day,
12:32 it just tears you up inside.
12:54 With Jehovah’s help
12:57 and with the support  of the brothers and sisters,
12:59 we got through it.
13:04 We learned to rely on Jehovah
13:07 in ways we never had before.
13:10 And that helped when, years later,
13:13 another test came our way.
13:16 You see, back then, some were looking
13:19 to a certain date as signifying  the end of this old system of things.
13:23 A few even went so far
13:26 as selling their homes  and quitting their jobs.
13:28 I admit that I was ready  to see this old system go away too,
13:33 but something just didn’t seem right.
13:37 Both at meetings and in my personal study,
13:40 I was reminded of what Jesus said
13:43 —nobody knows the day or hour.
13:47 I was dedicated to Jehovah,
13:50 not a date.
13:54 After that year came and went,
13:55 most of those who had wrong expectations
13:57 made the needed adjustments  and they stayed.
14:03 We didn’t run away, and we didn’t give up.
14:07 We trusted in Jehovah.
14:11 When I see older ones now,
14:13 I don’t just see gray hair,
14:15 I see living,  breathing examples of endurance.
14:20 Wow, Grandpa, I didn’t know  you had to endure through all that.
14:23 We got through it with Jehovah’s help.
14:26 But, Scott, you were  in pioneer school recently, right?
14:28 Yeah, just a year ago.
14:30 Who were your instructors?
14:32 We had Brother Smith and Brother Harris.
14:37 But, Scott, you were  in pioneer school recently, right?
14:40 Yeah, just a year ago.
14:42 Who were your instructors?
14:47 I didn’t know
14:52 that evening would be  one of our last together.
15:03 If I had known,  I would have thanked Dad
15:07 for all that he did
15:17 —teaching me how to study,
15:22 meditate,
15:27 and put into practice beautiful qualities.
15:35 A gift he shared,
15:37 not just with me,
15:48 but a gift and Scriptural reminders  that somehow seemed to keep giving.
15:57 No matter how hard it got,
16:07 the Bible training he gave me  never steered me wrong.
16:12 I had no idea the impact it would have on me,
16:17 but he did.
16:23 I thank Jehovah  that he raised me in the truth
16:26 the way he did.
16:40 Rachel,
16:42 as a parent, you pray
16:45 that your child  always stays close to Jehovah.
16:48 So I made it my goal  to instill the qualities
16:52 at 2 Peter 1:5-10
16:57 into your heart as best I could.
16:59 “Put forth all earnest effort
17:02 “to supply to your faith virtue,
17:06 “to your virtue knowledge,
17:09 “to your knowledge self-control,
17:14 “to your self-control endurance,
17:18 “to your endurance godly devotion,
17:23 “to your godly devotion brotherly affection,
17:27 “to your brotherly affection love.
17:32 “For if you keep on doing these things,
17:35 you will by no means ever fail.”
17:42 Love, Dad.

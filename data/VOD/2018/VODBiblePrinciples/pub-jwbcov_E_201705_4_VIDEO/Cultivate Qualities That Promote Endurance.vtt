00:06.990 --> 00:09.392
Ah, you’re up early today.


00:09.392 --> 00:10.394
Dad?


00:10.393 --> 00:12.395
Yeah?


00:12.395 --> 00:13.597
I want to get baptized.


00:13.597 --> 00:15.000
OK, let’s talk about it.


00:17.933 --> 00:21.000
I was thinking, you know, Mom was baptized 
when she was 12, and, you know, I . . .


00:22.538 --> 00:24.540
And now you’re 12, is that it?


00:24.540 --> 00:26.608
I know what you’re thinking, Dad, 
but I’m ready. 


00:26.608 --> 00:27.743
I know I am.


00:27.743 --> 00:28.778
I tell you what, 


00:28.778 --> 00:31.981
let’s do a special family study series first. 


00:31.982 --> 00:33.049
OK?


00:33.048 --> 00:36.051
On what?


00:36.052 --> 00:40.057
Well, we’ll start with faith.


00:40.057 --> 00:42.725
Being dedicated to Jehovah 


00:42.725 --> 00:45.228
and staying dedicated to him, 


00:45.228 --> 00:48.000
it requires that we have strong faith. 


00:50.367 --> 00:55.372
“By faith Noah, after receiving 
divine warning of things not yet seen, 


00:55.372 --> 00:59.275
showed godly fear 
and constructed an ark.”


00:59.275 --> 01:01.710
Abraham just “as good as offered up Isaac.” 


01:01.710 --> 01:05.000
So how did that take a lot of faith?


01:06.382 --> 01:08.552
So the Bible says 
that Abel was faithful his whole life, 


01:08.552 --> 01:11.054
but he was also faithful until death. 


01:11.053 --> 01:13.000
So, what do you think that means?


01:37.413 --> 01:39.581
Rachel, 


01:39.582 --> 01:42.685
keep your faith strong 
and you will never fail. 


01:42.685 --> 01:45.000
Love, Dad.


02:19.488 --> 02:21.623
How do you like the pictures?


02:21.623 --> 02:24.126
I really like this one of us.


02:24.127 --> 02:27.997
Oh, your mom 
would have really liked this one.


02:27.997 --> 02:30.900
I just wish 
she could have been there today.


02:30.900 --> 02:33.302
I know, me too. 


02:33.302 --> 02:36.840
Which is why I’ve been thinking 
that if she were here, 


02:36.840 --> 02:39.642
I think she would have wanted 
you to have this.


02:39.642 --> 02:41.444
Mom’s memory book.


02:41.443 --> 02:43.580
I thought you 
could pick up where she left off 


02:43.580 --> 02:47.017
and fill it with your theocratic memories. 


02:47.017 --> 02:50.354
And then, one day soon, we can share 
those memories with her in the new world. 


02:50.353 --> 02:51.753
What do you say?


02:51.753 --> 02:53.590
Yeah, I would love that.


02:53.590 --> 02:54.590
Yeah? Good.


02:54.590 --> 02:55.592
Thanks, Dad.


02:55.592 --> 02:57.000
You’re welcome.


03:06.002 --> 03:07.170
Hey, Dad.


03:07.170 --> 03:08.672
Hey, Rachel. 


03:08.672 --> 03:10.707
I was just looking 
at some old pictures of you.


03:10.707 --> 03:13.075
Wow, that was a long time ago.


03:13.075 --> 03:15.077
Yeah, it was.


03:15.077 --> 03:17.080
Hey, is there any mail for me?


03:17.080 --> 03:19.082
Yeah, it’s right here on the counter.


03:19.082 --> 03:21.000
Ah, OK. 


03:24.353 --> 03:27.000
It’s just another wedding invitation. 


03:29.892 --> 03:31.962
How was your day? 


03:31.962 --> 03:34.000
How was the museum?


03:35.063 --> 03:38.568
Oh, it was OK.


03:38.568 --> 03:41.000
Is something bothering you?


03:43.372 --> 03:45.375
Yeah.


03:45.375 --> 03:49.812
I feel like all my friends 
are getting married. 


03:49.812 --> 03:52.715
People at work wonder why I’m not dating. 


03:52.715 --> 03:55.150
And they’ve even tried to set me up.


03:55.150 --> 03:59.000
I mean, come on, aren’t you interested in, 
you know, being with a guy?


04:02.158 --> 04:04.193
I met someone at the museum today. 


04:04.193 --> 04:07.363
He was really nice. 


04:07.363 --> 04:09.898
I’m finally getting the attention I want, 


04:09.898 --> 04:11.666
but it’s not from a Witness.


04:11.667 --> 04:12.602
Just call me, OK?


04:12.602 --> 04:13.502
Maybe, maybe.


04:13.502 --> 04:14.904
It’ll be fun.


04:14.903 --> 04:17.000
So, what are you going to do about it?


04:32.888 --> 04:35.991
Rachel, always remember, 


04:35.992 --> 04:38.829
virtue is a beautiful quality. 


04:38.828 --> 04:43.031
It’s not just passive avoidance 
but has real power


04:43.032 --> 04:45.669
—power to do good. 


04:45.668 --> 04:49.905
Treasure virtue 
and Jehovah will treasure you. 


04:49.905 --> 04:52.000
Love, Dad.


04:55.678 --> 04:59.181
Virtue is based on our love for Jehovah. 


04:59.182 --> 05:02.285
As it says in the book of Psalms: 


05:02.285 --> 05:07.000
“O you lovers of Jehovah, hate what is bad.”


05:09.992 --> 05:11.727
Just call me, OK? 


05:11.727 --> 05:13.462
It’ll be fun.


05:13.462 --> 05:18.000
Do I love Jehovah enough to hate what is bad?


05:29.545 --> 05:31.813
Hey, any mail for me today?


05:31.813 --> 05:33.315
No, not today. 


05:33.315 --> 05:34.817
Ah, the printing company called though. 


05:34.817 --> 05:36.252
I picked up this package for you.


05:36.252 --> 05:37.720
The invitations arrived.


05:37.720 --> 05:39.055
Yeah.


05:39.055 --> 05:43.760
Eventually, I ended up getting engaged 
to a wonderful brother. 


05:43.760 --> 05:45.260
But even so, 


05:45.260 --> 05:50.900
I realized that marriage 
wasn’t the solution to my problem. 


05:50.900 --> 05:55.000
Remaining faithful to Jehovah 
is what really made me happy.


06:07.850 --> 06:10.520
Mom, do we have anything to eat?


06:10.520 --> 06:13.055
I can’t believe you’re still hungry.


06:13.055 --> 06:15.090
He is a growing boy. 


06:15.090 --> 06:16.625
What are you going to do 
with all that energy, Son?


06:16.625 --> 06:18.627
I’m trying to study.


06:18.627 --> 06:20.095
For school? 


06:20.095 --> 06:21.863
No, it’s for the meeting tomorrow. 


06:21.863 --> 06:23.431
I want to be able to give a comment.


06:23.432 --> 06:24.867
That’s good. 


06:24.867 --> 06:26.769
I’m sensing there’s a problem though.


06:26.768 --> 06:27.970
Yeah, a big one. 


06:27.970 --> 06:29.238
I don’t like to study. 


06:29.238 --> 06:31.573
It’s so boring. 


06:31.573 --> 06:33.708
You know, 
I used to find it hard to study too, 


06:33.708 --> 06:38.313
and then I realized 
study can be like exercise. 


06:38.313 --> 06:41.050
It may not seem enjoyable at first, 


06:41.050 --> 06:45.555
but once you make the effort 
and then establish a regular routine, 


06:45.555 --> 06:47.157
it becomes enjoyable 


06:47.157 --> 06:49.225
—even fun. 


06:49.225 --> 06:51.893
And soon, 
it won’t feel like work anymore.


06:51.893 --> 06:53.830
I agree. 


06:53.830 --> 06:56.865
I’ll tell you what, 
we can go up to your room, 


06:56.865 --> 06:59.668
and I’ll show you how 
to get the most out of your study.


06:59.668 --> 07:02.000
OK, sounds good.


07:03.272 --> 07:05.107
All right, 


07:05.107 --> 07:07.510
I thought we’d start by showing me, 
maybe, where you’re stuck.


07:07.510 --> 07:09.245
Well, I’m trying to find the answer. . .


07:09.245 --> 07:11.747
Dad reminded me 
to pray to Jehovah first, 


07:11.747 --> 07:14.000
asking for help 
to understand what I’m studying. 


07:15.150 --> 07:18.020
He said it’s important 
to look up the scriptures 


07:18.020 --> 07:20.657
and make sure I review the main points. 


07:20.657 --> 07:24.060
Then, think about how 
the material applies to me. 


07:24.060 --> 07:27.897
I learned that study 
isn’t just preparing for meetings; 


07:27.897 --> 07:31.867
it’s learning about Jehovah 
and how to live a good life. 


07:31.867 --> 07:35.037
And it doesn’t always mean reading. 


07:35.037 --> 07:38.040
Sometimes I can even look at creation 


07:38.040 --> 07:41.377
or draw pictures about something I learned. 


07:41.377 --> 07:44.480
After a few weeks, 
I really started to enjoy it 


07:44.480 --> 07:49.000
and my study time flew by.


07:55.992 --> 07:57.727
Where’s Noah?


07:57.727 --> 07:59.995
He’s up in his room studying.


07:59.995 --> 08:01.000
Really?


08:07.035 --> 08:09.238
Are you still studying?


08:09.238 --> 08:12.275
Oh, man, Grandpa and Dad were right.


08:12.275 --> 08:13.943
About what?


08:13.943 --> 08:16.811
Well, they said that studying 
wouldn’t feel like work anymore.


08:16.812 --> 08:19.415
I remember when Grandpa 
said the same thing to me. 


08:19.415 --> 08:20.850
Really?


08:20.850 --> 08:22.318
I brought this for you. 


08:22.318 --> 08:24.000
He gave this to me 
when I was about your age. 


08:25.822 --> 08:29.525
Rachel, apply yourself to study, 


08:29.525 --> 08:31.527
and soon it won’t feel like work. 


08:31.527 --> 08:34.000
Love, Dad.


08:42.472 --> 08:43.639
Hey, Mom.


08:43.638 --> 08:44.540
Morning, Noah.


08:44.540 --> 08:45.942
You going out in service?


08:45.942 --> 08:48.544
No, actually, 
I have some things I need to get done, 


08:48.543 --> 08:51.246
and then I was hoping 
to do some painting or sketching later.


08:51.247 --> 08:52.282
Nice.


08:52.282 --> 08:53.917
Oh, good. 
You must be ahead on your schedule. 


08:53.917 --> 08:55.250
You ready, Son?


08:55.250 --> 08:56.652
Ready.


08:56.652 --> 08:57.987
Thanks for lunch.


08:57.987 --> 08:58.889
You’re welcome. 
See you.


08:58.888 --> 08:59.555
Have a good day.


08:59.555 --> 09:00.723
Bye, Mom.
Love you.


09:00.723 --> 09:02.000
I’ve been planning 
this day off for months now. 


09:03.792 --> 09:06.262
I really want a chance to relax and paint. 


09:06.262 --> 09:09.399
I hardly ever get to take some time off. 


09:09.398 --> 09:12.000
Nothing is going to get in the way.


09:16.438 --> 09:17.506
Hi, Anne.


09:17.507 --> 09:19.609
Hey, Rach. 
How are you?


09:19.608 --> 09:20.776
Good. 
How are you?


09:20.777 --> 09:23.479
Good. 
Well, I’m on the way to the hall for service, 


09:23.478 --> 09:27.015
and I was wondering if later today, 
maybe if you had some time— 


09:27.015 --> 09:28.985
I started a new study with this young girl.


09:28.985 --> 09:29.852
Oh, nice. 


09:29.852 --> 09:31.854
Actually, you know, 
I already have plans for the day.


09:31.853 --> 09:32.855
Oh, OK.


09:32.855 --> 09:33.990
What about Sarah?


09:33.990 --> 09:34.590
I checked. 


09:34.590 --> 09:35.792
She has plans.


09:35.792 --> 09:36.792
Daisy?


09:36.792 --> 09:37.627
No.


09:37.627 --> 09:38.327
Simone?


09:38.327 --> 09:40.329
No, but that’s OK. 


09:40.328 --> 09:41.296
I’ll find somebody.


09:41.297 --> 09:43.632
Thanks so much for understanding, Anne.


09:43.632 --> 09:47.737
I felt bad, but she didn’t seem to mind. 


09:47.737 --> 09:50.000
Like she said, 
I’m sure she’ll find someone.


09:59.215 --> 10:01.550
Well, look at that. 


10:01.550 --> 10:03.452
My old memory book. 


10:03.452 --> 10:07.000
I haven’t seen this in a while. 


10:10.960 --> 10:13.000
Dad’s cards always gave me such good advice.


10:17.833 --> 10:22.705
Rachel, self-control is more 
than just refraining from doing bad. 


10:22.705 --> 10:24.740
It compels us to do good, 


10:24.740 --> 10:26.742
like Kingdom preaching. 


10:26.742 --> 10:31.614
Don’t let the unwilling flesh 
extinguish the fire of a willing spirit. 


10:31.613 --> 10:34.000
Love, Dad. 


10:36.085 --> 10:41.623
Self-control 
—I never thought of it that way before. 


10:41.623 --> 10:44.693
There’s nothing wrong with taking a day off, 


10:44.693 --> 10:47.228
but Anne does need help. 


10:47.228 --> 10:52.033
And I’ll still have time 
to paint when I get back. 


10:52.033 --> 10:55.000
Change of plans, Rachel.


10:58.440 --> 11:00.575
Hi, Anne. 
This is Rachel. 


11:00.575 --> 11:04.547
Did you find anybody 
to go on the Bible study with you? 


11:04.547 --> 11:07.049
Could I go with you? 


11:07.048 --> 11:10.000
Perfect, where can I meet you? 


11:11.320 --> 11:14.000
See you soon. 


11:17.125 --> 11:20.128
I’m glad I decided to help Anne. 


11:20.128 --> 11:25.200
That was such a good Bible study, 


11:25.200 --> 11:28.403
and I still have time to paint. 


11:28.403 --> 11:33.000
This turned out to be a great day.


11:35.310 --> 11:37.045
So how was pioneer school?


11:37.045 --> 11:38.613
It was great. 


11:38.613 --> 11:39.615
We had Brother Daniels 


11:39.615 --> 11:41.150
as our primary instructor. 


11:41.150 --> 11:42.552
He’s incredible. 


11:42.552 --> 11:44.220
He’s a good teacher. 


11:44.220 --> 11:47.457
And, Noah, what was it like 
to be in pioneer school with your grandpa?


11:47.457 --> 11:49.225
It was great; it really was.


11:49.225 --> 11:50.658
Hard to believe, though, 


11:50.658 --> 11:52.395
I never thought 
this system would last so long. 


11:52.395 --> 11:54.963
And I certainly never thought 
I’d be a grandfather.


11:54.963 --> 11:57.966
So, Grandpa, 
what was it like when you were my age? 


11:57.967 --> 12:02.000
Well, when I was about your age, 
I had just become a new father.


12:05.007 --> 12:08.744
I could tell even then 
that your mother was going to be an artist. 


12:08.743 --> 12:11.000
Those were good times for us.


12:12.748 --> 12:16.618
A few years later, though, 


12:16.618 --> 12:20.255
your grandmother became seriously ill.


12:20.255 --> 12:21.423
Hey, Sweetie.


12:21.423 --> 12:26.000
We didn’t know it at the time, 
but she wasn’t going to get better. 


12:27.463 --> 12:31.000
Watching your best friend 
die a little each day, 


12:32.133 --> 12:35.000
it just tears you up inside. 


12:54.823 --> 12:57.560
With Jehovah’s help 


12:57.560 --> 12:59.995
and with the support 
of the brothers and sisters, 


12:59.995 --> 13:02.000
we got through it. 


13:04.467 --> 13:07.135
We learned to rely on Jehovah 


13:07.135 --> 13:10.205
in ways we never had before. 


13:10.205 --> 13:13.008
And that helped when, years later, 


13:13.008 --> 13:16.078
another test came our way.


13:16.078 --> 13:19.681
You see, back then, some were looking 


13:19.682 --> 13:23.519
to a certain date as signifying 
the end of this old system of things. 


13:23.518 --> 13:26.221
A few even went so far 


13:26.222 --> 13:28.990
as selling their homes 
and quitting their jobs. 


13:28.990 --> 13:33.862
I admit that I was ready 
to see this old system go away too, 


13:33.862 --> 13:36.000
but something just didn’t seem right. 


13:37.600 --> 13:40.502
Both at meetings and in my personal study, 


13:40.502 --> 13:43.972
I was reminded of what Jesus said 


13:43.972 --> 13:47.409
—nobody knows the day or hour. 


13:47.408 --> 13:50.011
I was dedicated to Jehovah, 


13:50.012 --> 13:53.000
not a date. 


13:54.048 --> 13:55.783
After that year came and went, 


13:55.783 --> 13:57.886
most of those who had wrong expectations 


13:57.887 --> 14:02.000
made the needed adjustments 
and they stayed. 


14:03.458 --> 14:07.295
We didn’t run away, and we didn’t give up. 


14:07.295 --> 14:11.733
We trusted in Jehovah. 


14:11.733 --> 14:13.735
When I see older ones now, 


14:13.735 --> 14:15.905
I don’t just see gray hair, 


14:15.905 --> 14:20.442
I see living, 
breathing examples of endurance. 


14:20.442 --> 14:23.445
Wow, Grandpa, I didn’t know 
you had to endure through all that. 


14:23.445 --> 14:26.315
We got through it with Jehovah’s help. 


14:26.315 --> 14:28.850
But, Scott, you were 
in pioneer school recently, right? 


14:28.850 --> 14:30.518
Yeah, just a year ago.


14:30.518 --> 14:32.086
Who were your instructors?


14:32.087 --> 14:35.000
We had Brother Smith and Brother Harris.


14:37.927 --> 14:40.462
But, Scott, you were 
in pioneer school recently, right?


14:40.462 --> 14:42.130
Yeah, just a year ago.


14:42.130 --> 14:43.000
Who were your instructors?


14:47.402 --> 14:52.407
I didn’t know 


14:52.407 --> 14:57.000
that evening would be 
one of our last together. 


15:03.885 --> 15:07.122
If I had known, 
I would have thanked Dad 


15:07.122 --> 15:12.000
for all that he did 


15:17.532 --> 15:21.000
—teaching me how to study, 


15:22.738 --> 15:27.475
meditate, 


15:27.475 --> 15:31.000
and put into practice beautiful qualities. 


15:35.717 --> 15:37.720
A gift he shared, 


15:37.720 --> 15:40.000
not just with me, 


15:48.930 --> 15:53.000
but a gift and Scriptural reminders 
that somehow seemed to keep giving. 


15:57.472 --> 16:00.000
No matter how hard it got, 


16:07.482 --> 16:11.000
the Bible training he gave me 
never steered me wrong. 


16:12.788 --> 16:17.125
I had no idea the impact it would have on me, 


16:17.125 --> 16:21.000
but he did. 


16:23.498 --> 16:26.368
I thank Jehovah 
that he raised me in the truth 


16:26.368 --> 16:29.000
the way he did.


16:40.315 --> 16:42.350
Rachel, 


16:42.350 --> 16:45.287
as a parent, you pray 


16:45.287 --> 16:48.857
that your child 
always stays close to Jehovah. 


16:48.857 --> 16:52.795
So I made it my goal 
to instill the qualities 


16:52.795 --> 16:57.398
at 2 Peter 1:5-10 


16:57.398 --> 16:59.901
into your heart as best I could. 


16:59.902 --> 17:02.805
“Put forth all earnest effort 


17:02.805 --> 17:06.575
“to supply to your faith virtue, 


17:06.575 --> 17:09.745
“to your virtue knowledge, 


17:09.745 --> 17:14.315
“to your knowledge self-control, 


17:14.315 --> 17:18.687
“to your self-control endurance, 


17:18.687 --> 17:23.395
“to your endurance godly devotion, 


17:23.395 --> 17:27.162
“to your godly devotion brotherly affection, 


17:27.162 --> 17:32.034
“to your brotherly affection love. 


17:32.033 --> 17:35.203
“For if you keep on doing these things, 


17:35.203 --> 17:41.000
you will by no means ever fail.” 


17:42.845 --> 17:55.808
Love, Dad.

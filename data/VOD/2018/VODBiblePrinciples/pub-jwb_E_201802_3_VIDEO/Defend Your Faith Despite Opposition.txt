00:11 It was one of those mornings
00:13 when everything seemed to be going right.
00:18 In fact, this whole year was going right
00:21 ever since I got baptized.
00:24 My family is closer than ever.
00:28 I’ve made some good friends  in the congregation.
00:32 I even started a Bible study.
00:35 It felt good to let go of my fears
00:38 and serve Jehovah with everything I have.
00:44 But things can change very quickly.
00:58 Uh, I’m sorry.  You know what?
00:59 I think I saw Grayson  over the weekend on Saturday.
01:02 I think he might be one of those people  that tells you about the Bible.
01:04 One of those, uh—
01:05 You’re saying Grayson is a Jehovah’s Witness?
01:08 Yeah.  Let me go ask him.
01:11 Hey, Grayson?
01:13 Hey, how’s it going, Ron?
01:15 Did I see you on Saturday morning  over on Main Street?
01:17 Yeah.  You know, I’m one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
01:19 And what we do,  we go out and talk to people about—
01:21 I’m sorry.  I just don’t get it.
01:24 You’ll go knocking on strangers’ doors
01:26 to support your own religion,  yet you won’t stand and support this country.
01:29 Why don’t you people
01:31 get involved and make  a real difference for once?
01:44 I was really disappointed in myself.
01:47 I guess I hadn’t moved past  all my fears like I thought.
01:53 Later that night,  for family worship,
01:55 we sat down and discussed  our brothers who were in prison
01:58 for their faith.
02:00 Mom, why are they in prison?
02:02 They don’t want to fight;  they don’t want to kill people.
02:04 It really touched Aiden.
02:07 He was moved to pray for them that night.
02:11 His prayer touched my heart.
02:14 And with so much on my mind,  I couldn’t sleep.
02:18 So I decided to get up  and do some research.
02:21 I found some information  on the apostle Peter.
02:24 Despite his zeal,
02:27 he also struggled at times
02:29 with fear of man
02:31 like when he denied Jesus three times.
02:37 But eventually, he overcame that fear.
02:42 We strictly ordered you
02:44 not to keep teaching  on the basis of this name,
02:48 and yet look!
02:51 you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching,
02:53 and you are determined
02:55 to bring the blood of this man upon us.
02:57 We must obey God as ruler rather than men.
03:01 The God of our forefathers raised up Jesus,
03:03 whom you killed,  hanging him on a stake.
03:26 “Always ready to make a defense
03:28 “before everyone who demands of you a reason
03:32 for the hope you have”
03:36 —Peter focused on his hope,
03:39 not his fear.
03:41 Just like these faithful brothers  have been doing,
03:46 I want to be like them  and make Jehovah proud of me.
04:01 The next day I woke up,
04:03 and I was thinking about the apostle Peter
04:06 and our brothers  who were in prison for their faith.
04:15 And even though I was still a little nervous,
04:17 I felt ready to talk to Eric.
04:23 Hey, Ron, Eric.
04:25 Sorry I didn’t get a chance  to explain the other day,
04:27 but if you have a moment now,  I’d love to be able to talk to you.
04:29 I don’t want to hear it.
04:32 Sorry, Grayson.
04:35 And I thought that was it.
04:41 But it wasn’t.
04:43 Ron said he wanted to know more.
04:49 Maybe I’ll never completely  get rid of my fears.
04:52 But my love for Jehovah
04:54 and the example of his courageous servants
04:56 helps me to be ready to meet the challenge.
04:59 The other day I wanted to show you something.

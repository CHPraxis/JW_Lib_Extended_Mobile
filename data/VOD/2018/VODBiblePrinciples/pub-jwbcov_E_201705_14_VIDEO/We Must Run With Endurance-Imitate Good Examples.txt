00:34 Would you guys like  a little something to eat?
00:36 Thanks for coming.
00:45 Jehovah created humans  with what unique abilities?
00:52 Sister Allison . . .
01:00 . . . about our Creator.
01:01 I don’t know why  I get so nervous around people.
01:09 I want to be more outgoing,  but I’m just not that type of person.
01:14 Maybe I’m just too shy  to be useful to Jehovah.
01:19 What was that scripture  Allison commented on last night?
01:23 Philippians 3:17:
01:26 “Unitedly become imitators of me, brothers,
01:29 “and keep your eye on those  who are walking in a way
01:32 that is in harmony  with the example we set for you.”
01:36 Then she mentioned how scared she was  to give talks or even go door to door.
01:41 But then she found a good friend  in the congregation.
01:44 By imitating her friend’s zeal,
01:47 she eventually worked up the courage  to start pioneering.
01:51 Maybe if I reach out to Allison,  she could be that friend for me.

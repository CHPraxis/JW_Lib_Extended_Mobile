00:34.388 --> 00:36.056
Would you guys like 
a little something to eat? 


00:36.057 --> 00:39.000
Thanks for coming. 


00:45.232 --> 00:48.000
Jehovah created humans 
with what unique abilities? 


00:52.698 --> 00:54.000
Sister Allison . . .


01:00.205 --> 01:01.998
. . . about our Creator.


01:01.998 --> 01:06.000
I don’t know why 
I get so nervous around people. 


01:09.213 --> 01:14.135
I want to be more outgoing, 
but I’m just not that type of person. 


01:14.135 --> 01:18.000
Maybe I’m just too shy 
to be useful to Jehovah. 


01:19.767 --> 01:23.270
What was that scripture 
Allison commented on last night? 


01:23.270 --> 01:26.065
Philippians 3:17: 


01:26.065 --> 01:29.735
“Unitedly become imitators of me, brothers, 


01:29.735 --> 01:32.655
“and keep your eye on those 
who are walking in a way 


01:32.655 --> 01:36.533
that is in harmony 
with the example we set for you.” 


01:36.533 --> 01:41.538
Then she mentioned how scared she was 
to give talks or even go door to door. 


01:41.538 --> 01:44.916
But then she found a good friend 
in the congregation. 


01:44.917 --> 01:47.044
By imitating her friend’s zeal, 


01:47.043 --> 01:51.506
she eventually worked up the courage 
to start pioneering. 


01:51.507 --> 03:13.235
Maybe if I reach out to Allison, 
she could be that friend for me.

00:04.692 --> 00:06.694
The more you study,

00:06.694 --> 00:08.696
the more you understand Jehovah.

00:08.696 --> 00:10.739
The more you understand Jehovah,

00:10.739 --> 00:12.241
the more you love him.

00:12.241 --> 00:14.243
Jehovah clearly tells us:

00:14.243 --> 00:16.203
“My thoughts are not your thoughts.”

00:16.203 --> 00:18.455
So if we want to understand 
Jehovah’s thinking better,

00:18.455 --> 00:20.916
we need to dig deep in our study,

00:20.916 --> 00:23.711
and then we share those thoughts with others.

00:24.920 --> 00:26.964
Personal study is like fuel

00:26.964 --> 00:28.966
that keeps you going.

00:29.967 --> 00:32.303
Personally, I’m not a good student,

00:32.303 --> 00:35.431
but I really learned how to study the Bible.

00:35.431 --> 00:37.933
The Bible came alive during Gilead.

00:37.933 --> 00:41.979
Self-discipline is involved 
—very much.

00:44.648 --> 00:49.111
I overcome the tiredness aspect

00:49.111 --> 00:51.405
of Bible study by not doing it

00:51.405 --> 00:53.574
at a time of day 
when I know I’m going to be tired.

00:53.574 --> 00:56.952
I can be tired for other things later on 
—but not for that.

00:59.496 --> 01:02.333
Each session of my Bible study 
begins with a prayer,

01:02.333 --> 01:06.420
“Please help me recognize 
it is counsel for me,

01:06.420 --> 01:10.215
and then give me the strength 
to work on it.”

01:10.215 --> 01:11.592
I have a color-coded system,

01:11.592 --> 01:14.011
so I know what certain things stand for.

01:15.220 --> 01:17.139
I have a particular color

01:17.139 --> 01:22.102
for Jehovah’s good hand in people’s lives;

01:22.102 --> 01:26.649
I have another color for warning examples;

01:26.649 --> 01:30.986
I have another for fine examples to imitate.

01:42.998 --> 01:45.668
You have to get behind the information,

01:45.668 --> 01:49.254
not just focus on one verse or one chapter.

01:49.254 --> 01:51.924
See who’s involved, the time,

01:51.924 --> 01:55.177
the conditions, how many people are there,

01:55.177 --> 01:57.763
and then you’ll get 
the true meaning of the verse.

01:58.472 --> 02:00.474
John 1:1,

02:00.474 --> 02:01.725
who is “the Word”?

02:03.227 --> 02:05.646
We can go to verse 18.

02:05.646 --> 02:07.648
“Begotten” meant

02:07.648 --> 02:10.317
he had a beginning, 
a time when he started

02:10.317 --> 02:12.653
—when he began—

02:12.653 --> 02:14.863
in heaven with his Father.

02:14.863 --> 02:16.907
That’s where he was.

02:18.033 --> 02:22.287
Philippians 4:6, 7 is a scripture 
that I’ve read many times over.

02:22.287 --> 02:24.707
“The peace of God that excels all thought.”

02:24.707 --> 02:26.750
OK, how do you get that?

02:26.750 --> 02:30.879
It’s from having 
a good relationship with Jehovah.

02:30.879 --> 02:34.633
How is it that God’s peace 
‘guards your heart’?

02:34.633 --> 02:37.177
“By means of Christ Jesus” our Lord.

02:37.177 --> 02:41.056
And I said: “Why by Jesus?

02:41.056 --> 02:44.435
“Because Jesus paid the ransom;

02:44.435 --> 02:49.523
that ransom is what makes possible 
a relationship with Jehovah.”

02:49.523 --> 02:51.525
So it almost goes full circle.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.845
I attended a School for Congregation Elders

03:19.845 --> 03:24.016
that had Gilead graduates as instructors.

03:24.016 --> 03:26.977
One of the methods is to analyze

03:26.977 --> 03:30.189
a certain Bible account 
from different perspectives.

03:30.189 --> 03:33.400
We can’t see 
the whole picture from one angle.

03:35.069 --> 03:37.237
I share my research results 
with Bible students,

03:37.237 --> 03:39.448
and that helps them 
to know Jehovah better,

03:39.448 --> 03:41.742
and it helps them to see 
that what they’re studying

03:41.742 --> 03:44.328
is of practical value.

03:44.328 --> 03:46.997
I had studied up on Jacob;

03:46.997 --> 03:49.291
he wrestled all night

03:49.291 --> 03:51.460
with an angel.

03:51.460 --> 03:55.172
And I wanted to share it 
with some of my friends.

03:55.172 --> 03:59.635
One of the brothers 
that happened to sit around

03:59.635 --> 04:04.598
when this discussion was going on 
came back to me, and he said to me:

04:04.598 --> 04:08.435
“I had concluded my arrangements

04:08.435 --> 04:10.104
“to quit full-time service.

04:10.104 --> 04:12.815
“But after listening to that discussion,

04:12.815 --> 04:15.859
I’ve decided that I’m no longer stopping.”

04:15.859 --> 04:19.947
And that was 
such a wonderful moment for me.

04:19.947 --> 04:23.867
I thanked Jehovah.

04:23.867 --> 04:26.036
When I learned that I 
was going to become a mom,

04:26.036 --> 04:29.123
I said, “Jehovah, if this little one

04:29.123 --> 04:32.793
could love you, 
then I’ll get to keep him forever.”

04:32.793 --> 04:35.963
And I began to teach everything 
I was learning to him.

04:36.797 --> 04:39.216
So it’s a matter

04:39.216 --> 04:41.218
of keeping my faith strong,

04:41.218 --> 04:43.971
and there’s no shortcut.

04:43.971 --> 04:47.724
Every session of study 
that is properly done with good meditation

04:47.724 --> 04:49.726
adds a new pillar

04:49.726 --> 04:52.354
to the strength of our faith.

04:54.857 --> 04:56.483
I look forward to those times 
when I can, you know,

04:56.483 --> 04:59.111
run upstairs by myself 
and just shut everything off,

04:59.111 --> 05:01.905
and it’s just me and Jehovah.

05:03.407 --> 05:05.742
Life today is very unpredictable,

05:05.742 --> 05:09.746
but I’ve come to see that as long as I 
keep a tight grip on God’s Word,

05:09.746 --> 05:22.824
nothing can “separate [me] from God’s love.”

Hi there. 


00:13.617 --> 00:14.244
Hi. 


00:14.243 --> 00:16.620
Can I interest you in one of our suits? 


00:16.620 --> 00:18.038
OK, that sounds good. 


00:18.038 --> 00:20.000
I think it would go great with this tie. 


01:06.587 --> 01:09.047
I wish I had listened to the elders. 


01:09.047 --> 01:12.050
I-I can’t believe the interest 
on these credit cards. 


01:12.050 --> 01:15.512
There’s just no way I can afford this. 


01:15.512 --> 01:19.684
It didn’t seem like it was that much money 
at the time when I was spending it. 


01:19.683 --> 01:24.165
Hm, maybe if I pick up a second job 


01:24.165 --> 01:27.900
or, ah, work nights, weekends, I could . . . 


01:27.900 --> 01:29.318
Hold on a second. 


01:29.318 --> 01:31.903
Wait! No. 


01:31.903 --> 01:35.073
What did the text say this morning? 


01:35.073 --> 01:40.078
“Keep your eyes open 
and guard against every sort of greed, 


01:40.078 --> 01:43.706
“because even when a person 
has an abundance, 


01:43.707 --> 01:47.335
his life does not result 
from the things he possesses.” 


01:47.335 --> 01:50.297
Guard against greed. 


01:50.297 --> 01:53.009
It didn’t feel like greed at the time. 


01:53.008 --> 01:55.926
It seemed like these were 
all things I needed. 


01:55.927 --> 02:01.000
But if it’s starting 
to crowd out time for Jehovah . . .


02:37.302 --> 02:38.595
Hey. 


02:38.595 --> 02:39.388
Hey. 


02:39.388 --> 02:40.596
You’re back for more suits? 


02:40.597 --> 02:41.599
Just this today. 


02:41.598 --> 02:42.808
All right. 
Well, you have a good day. 


02:42.808 --> 02:56.301
Thank you.

00:04.400 --> 00:06.000
Hey! Hey! 


00:17.078 --> 00:18.038
Hello! 


00:18.038 --> 00:18.996
Hi, you want us to help you? 


00:18.997 --> 00:20.124
Oh, that’d be great! 


00:20.123 --> 00:21.750
Why are you doing this alone? 


00:21.750 --> 00:23.000
Argh! 


00:41.437 --> 00:42.395
Baby! Baby! 


00:42.395 --> 00:43.855
Babe? Babe? Babe? 


00:43.855 --> 00:44.815
Say something. 


00:44.815 --> 00:46.442
Baby? 
You OK? 


00:46.442 --> 00:47.275
Talk to me. 
Say something.


00:47.275 --> 00:48.027
I think we need to . . .


00:48.027 --> 00:48.694
What’s going on? 


00:48.693 --> 00:49.193
I think we need to . . .


00:49.193 --> 00:49.820
No! 
Did you see . . .


00:49.820 --> 00:52.000
He’s not talking, Levi! 
He’s not talking! 


00:57.745 --> 00:58.620
He’s not even responding. 


00:58.620 --> 00:59.830
Levi, where are we? 


00:59.830 --> 01:00.830
He’s not responding now. 


01:00.830 --> 01:01.623
We’re way too far! 


01:01.623 --> 01:02.248
We’re on 110! 
We’re on Route 110! 


01:02.248 --> 01:04.083
Was he . . . 


01:04.083 --> 01:04.918
Mr. 
Johnson? 


01:04.918 --> 01:06.253
No, no, nothing like that! 


01:06.253 --> 01:08.000
He just fell! 


01:28.858 --> 01:29.860
Eek! 


01:29.860 --> 01:30.777
Oh! It’s OK! 


01:30.777 --> 01:32.070
It’s just a cup. 
It’s just a cup. 


01:32.070 --> 01:33.072
It’s fine, Babe. 


01:33.072 --> 01:34.490
Don’t worry about it. 
Don’t worry about it. 


01:34.490 --> 01:36.023
After the stroke, 


01:36.023 --> 01:40.276
it feels like every day 
there’s just another reminder 


01:40.277 --> 01:43.757
of what I can’t do. 


01:43.757 --> 01:48.482
I wish Jehovah 
would just give me my strength back. 


01:48.482 --> 01:53.487
Carl mentioned he’s been dealing 
with health issues for years, 


01:53.487 --> 01:55.740
so I asked him what helps him keep going. 


01:55.740 --> 02:00.912
He said his favorite scripture 
is at 1 Thessalonians 5:17: 


02:00.912 --> 02:03.949
“Pray constantly.” 


02:03.948 --> 02:05.958
He said, 


02:05.958 --> 02:10.000
“Jehovah was there in the good times, 
and he’s still there in the bad.” 


02:13.570 --> 02:15.957
In prayer, he shares all his struggles, 


02:15.957 --> 02:19.000
many of which only Jehovah can understand. 


02:20.452 --> 02:22.454
Thank you so much. 


02:22.453 --> 02:27.000
But prayer gives him strength. 


02:52.777 --> 03:04.309
“Pray constantly.”

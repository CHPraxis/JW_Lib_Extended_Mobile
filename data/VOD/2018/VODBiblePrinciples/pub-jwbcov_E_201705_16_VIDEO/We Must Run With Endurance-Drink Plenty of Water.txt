00:14 Bye, Buddy.
00:15 Bye.
01:26 How did I give her the wrong idea?
01:29 How did I let my guard down?
01:32 If I see her again,  I’ll make sure she gets the right message.
01:36 In the past,  I would have witnessed immediately
01:38 in a situation like that.
01:40 What changed?
01:44 I’ve always been busy,  but maybe I’ve let my busy life
01:47 start to crowd out the important things,
01:50 like my Bible reading.
01:56 That night I did some research,
01:59 and I found Ephesians 5:25.
02:02 “Husbands, continue loving your wives,
02:05 just as the Christ  also loved the congregation.”
02:09 I needed more though.
02:11 Verse 26 stood out to me.
02:13 There it says what Jesus  does for the congregation,
02:16 “. . . cleansing it with the bath of water
02:18 by means of the word.”
02:21 If I’m going to stay  morally and spiritually clean,
02:24 I need to read God’s Word every day.

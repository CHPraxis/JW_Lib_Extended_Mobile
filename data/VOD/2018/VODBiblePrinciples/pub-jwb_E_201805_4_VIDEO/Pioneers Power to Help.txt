00:16 It was really nice of Maria  to invite me in service.
00:23 But I already have plans with Sarah.
00:34 We have similar service schedules,
00:36 and we really enjoy working together.
00:48 I try to get most of my time  during the week, . . .
00:55 Anyone made plans to work together?
00:57 . . . though I do meet with the group  sometimes on Saturday.
01:00 Sister Martin,  can you work with Rachel today?
01:07 Thanks, everyone.
01:08 Anyone made plans to work together?
01:13 OK.  Joanna, you can work with Sarah.
01:23 Anyone made plans to work together?
01:25 Sarah, do you want to go with me  to a Bible study?
01:26 Could I work with Alisha?
01:27 Uh-huh.
01:28 OK, let’s work together.
01:29 Joanna, could you two work together, please?
01:31 Um, I’d love to.
01:34 But I’ve just arranged to work with Sarah.
01:36 I’m so sorry.
01:37 Uh-huh.  No problem.
01:40 Maria, could you work with this sister?
02:03 While doing my Bible reading that night,
02:06 I was really affected
02:07 by the words found  at 2 Corinthians 6:12, 13:
02:12 “You are restricted  in your own tender affections . . .
02:16 Open your hearts wide.”
02:24 It struck me that some in the congregation
02:27 missed out on a beautiful blessing
02:29 by drawing away from the apostle Paul.
02:36 I realized I was limiting my joy as well
02:40 by not working with more in the ministry.
02:44 I was going through the motions  of pioneering,
02:47 but I was stuck in the same routine.
02:50 How are you, Maria?
02:52 Good. And you?
02:54 Let me ask you something.
02:55 Could you join me on a Bible study Saturday?
02:57 Oh, I’d love that! Uh-huh.
02:58 That’s great.
02:59 So later we’ll make the arrangements. OK?
03:00 The meeting is starting.
03:02 We’d like to invite everyone  to take your seats
03:03 because our meeting is about to begin.
03:11 My student liked Maria and Isabelle so much.
03:15 I really learned a lot from them.
03:24 I started going out regularly  on the weekends . . .
03:29 Anyone made plans to work together?
03:32 . . . and working with different ones  in the ministry.
03:38 And I learned more about Sister Martin
03:40 after one day in the ministry
03:43 than I had in years  of seeing her at meetings.
03:48 Sarah and I still enjoy working together.
03:52 But I’ve found that by working  with a variety of friends,
03:55 my own joy has increased.
04:11 I’m so glad I ‘opened my heart wide.’

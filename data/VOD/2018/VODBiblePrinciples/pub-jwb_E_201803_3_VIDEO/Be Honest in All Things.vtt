00:14.827 --> 00:17.830
I had a secret. 


00:17.830 --> 00:21.000
Only it wasn’t mine to tell. 


00:22.752 --> 00:25.000
It was my best friend’s, Julian.


00:38.642 --> 00:42.000
This was not the Julian I knew.


00:56.785 --> 00:58.953
At the end of the meeting, 


00:58.953 --> 01:01.000
Brother Max wanted to know
if I was OK. 


01:03.167 --> 01:05.169
I shrugged it off. 


01:05.168 --> 01:09.000
I just didn’t know 
who to talk to at that point.


01:16.847 --> 01:19.000
A few years ago, 


01:20.183 --> 01:25.000
when my parents 
stopped attending meetings, 


01:31.612 --> 01:34.000
Julian was there for me.


01:55.427 --> 01:58.000
I didn’t want to lose my friend. 


02:00.348 --> 02:03.000
But did I really know him?


02:17.407 --> 02:21.000
I decided to ask Julian 
about the pictures he posted.


02:24.122 --> 02:26.334
I told him it wasn’t right. 


02:26.333 --> 02:29.836
He needed to talk to the elders. 


02:29.837 --> 02:33.000
Then he got really defensive about it. 


02:38.095 --> 02:41.000
I knew I did the right thing. 


02:42.140 --> 02:43.433
When was I supposed 
to take care of this bill?


02:43.433 --> 02:44.476
I’ve been telling you 
for the past month! 


02:44.477 --> 02:47.270
I just needed someone to talk to. 


02:47.270 --> 02:48.438
When did you tell me? 


02:48.438 --> 02:49.940
I’ve been working 
for the past couple of weeks. 


02:49.940 --> 02:51.942
Well, as if I don’t work? 


02:51.942 --> 02:54.000
Oh! Now you’re going 
to blame everything on me.


03:02.870 --> 03:07.290
Brother Max wanted to know 
how I was really doing. 


03:07.290 --> 03:10.340
He could tell something was wrong. 


03:10.340 --> 03:14.000
So I opened up.


03:23.473 --> 03:25.516
I told him everything. 


03:25.517 --> 03:27.602
I didn’t want to get my friend in trouble. 


03:27.602 --> 03:30.000
Max understood. 


03:31.148 --> 03:36.000
He asked me to read James 5:14, 15: 


03:39.238 --> 03:42.743
“Is there anyone sick among you? 


03:42.743 --> 03:46.915
“Let him call 
the elders of the congregation to him, 


03:46.915 --> 03:49.750
“and let them pray over him, 


03:49.750 --> 03:54.498
“applying oil to him 
in the name of Jehovah. 


03:54.498 --> 03:57.041
“And the prayer of faith 


03:57.042 --> 03:59.715
“will make the sick one well, 


03:59.715 --> 04:03.000
and Jehovah will raise him up.”


04:06.683 --> 04:10.353
Max showed me that the elders 
can encourage and strengthen 


04:10.353 --> 04:13.606
a spiritually weak person. 


04:13.607 --> 04:15.692
Covering up a friend’s wrongdoing 


04:15.692 --> 04:19.000
prevents him from getting 
the spiritual help he needs. 


04:21.198 --> 04:26.076
All this time, 
I was focused on Julian and his deception, 


04:26.077 --> 04:30.874
and I didn’t speak up. 


04:30.873 --> 04:33.000
I’m glad I was honest with Brother Max. 


04:34.670 --> 04:37.923
The elders are like our spiritual doctors, 


04:37.923 --> 04:40.925
and even more, they’re our friends. 


04:40.925 --> 04:43.262
They want to help us. 


04:43.262 --> 04:46.140
Julian might receive discipline, 


04:46.140 --> 04:48.600
but that’s an expression of Jehovah’s love.


04:48.600 --> 04:51.000
It could save his spiritual life. 


04:56.942 --> 05:00.000
Julian got the spiritual help he needed. 


05:09.497 --> 05:30.955
And I kept my best friend.

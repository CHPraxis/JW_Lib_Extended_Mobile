‎I promised Akil I’d go out 
in service with him after school.

00:00:31.218 --> 00:00:33.345 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Hey, we’re just waiting in the car.

00:00:36.348 --> 00:00:40.853 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And I kept my word, 

00:00:44.523 --> 00:00:48.360 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but my head just wasn’t in it. 

00:00:52.656 --> 00:00:57.244 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Akil could tell, so he tried 
to see if everything was OK. 

00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:02.124 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Honestly, at the time, 

00:01:02.124 --> 00:01:04.877 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I would have rather been playing 
video games, 

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:10.716 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but I couldn’t tell him that. 

00:01:10.716 --> 00:01:15.721 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I mean, 
he’s a pioneer, a ministerial servant. 

00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:18.641 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He wouldn’t understand.

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.621 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Later that week, 

00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:45.250 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Akil invited me 
to go mountain biking with some friends. 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.253 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It was actually really fun.

00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:52.007 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎. . . and your croissant.

00:01:52.007 --> 00:01:52.675 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Great, thanks.

00:01:52.675 --> 00:01:54.385 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Please let me know 
if there’s anything else, OK?

00:01:54.385 --> 00:01:56.470 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎All right. Thanks.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.472 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So, Danny, 
you’re obviously good at biking. 

00:01:58.472 --> 00:02:00.474 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What else do you like to do for fun?

00:02:00.474 --> 00:02:02.476 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎OK, so I have this game and it’s called . . .

00:02:02.476 --> 00:02:06.480 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Soon I was showing him my video games. 

00:02:10.776 --> 00:02:15.239 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And surprisingly, 
he liked video games too. 

00:02:16.323 --> 00:02:20.327 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But he said he chose to be selective. 

00:02:21.745 --> 00:02:26.583 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He began to describe 
the gladiators in ancient Rome. 

00:02:32.381 --> 00:02:35.009 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎People would come from all over 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:38.220 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to watch them fight to the death. 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.515 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And while the spectators 
weren’t in any physical danger, 

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:45.769 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the real danger came over time. 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.281 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Repeatedly watching 
the bloodshed and the killing, 

00:02:57.281 --> 00:03:01.410 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎it was dulling their senses, 
and they wanted more of it. 

00:03:04.747 --> 00:03:09.793 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This was a big test 
for the Christians who lived back then. 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.384 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Akil helped me to reason on the scripture

00:03:17.384 --> 00:03:19.887 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎at Romans 12:9: 

00:03:21.638 --> 00:03:26.602 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Abhor what is wicked; 
cling to what is good.”

00:03:26.602 --> 00:03:28.395 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So, Danny,

00:03:28.395 --> 00:03:30.689 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the games may have changed over time, 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:33.525 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but the violence is still the same. 

00:03:33.525 --> 00:03:35.527 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I like video games, 

00:03:36.236 --> 00:03:38.906 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but I avoid the ones 
that promote what Jehovah hates.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.413 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah’s people can still have fun. 

00:03:57.758 --> 00:04:02.096 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And, yeah, 
we can even play video games. 

00:04:02.096 --> 00:04:06.517 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I just want to make wise choices. 

00:04:09.186 --> 00:04:12.314 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I want to show Jehovah 
that I hate wickedness 

00:04:18.403 --> 00:04:21.824 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and make his heart glad.

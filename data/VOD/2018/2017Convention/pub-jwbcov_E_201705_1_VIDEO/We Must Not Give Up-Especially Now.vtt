00:01.480 --> 00:03.648
On behalf of the Governing Body,


00:03.648 --> 00:06.318
it is my pleasure to welcome all of you


00:06.318 --> 00:08.195
to this year’s “Don’t Give Up!”


00:08.195 --> 00:09.863
Regional Convention


00:09.863 --> 00:11.906
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.


00:11.907 --> 00:14.452
For some of you, 
this may be your first time 


00:14.452 --> 00:16.620
attending one of our conventions. 


00:16.620 --> 00:21.625
Perhaps you’re here 
because you received one of our invitations. 


00:21.625 --> 00:25.628
If so, 
we’re very happy to have you with us. 


00:25.628 --> 00:28.881
For the rest of us, 
it doesn’t seem possible 


00:28.882 --> 00:33.179
that an entire year has passed 
since our last convention. 


00:33.178 --> 00:35.931
And what a year it has been!


00:35.932 --> 00:39.602
Thanks to over eight million worshippers 
of Jehovah, 


00:39.602 --> 00:42.855
a tremendous witness has been given 


00:42.855 --> 00:46.358
throughout the earth 
in over eight hundred languages. 


00:46.358 --> 00:50.111
And thanks to the thousands 
of hard-working volunteers, 


00:50.112 --> 00:53.657
our new world headquarters 
was completed at Warwick, New York, 


00:53.657 --> 00:55.700
in the United States. 


00:55.700 --> 00:58.745
The surroundings are beautiful, 


00:58.745 --> 01:02.792
and many of the friends 
have already begun touring our new home.


01:02.792 --> 01:04.794
However, 


01:04.793 --> 01:07.253
other things have taken place 
in the past year 


01:07.253 --> 01:10.215
that haven’t been so positive. 


01:10.215 --> 01:12.217
As the apostle Paul 
was inspired to write 


01:12.217 --> 01:15.762
at 1 Corinthians 7:31: 


01:15.762 --> 01:18.515
“The scene of this world is changing.” 


01:18.515 --> 01:22.728
We know you have been watching 
the world scene as we have. 


01:22.728 --> 01:26.398
There have been 
natural disasters, disease epidemics, 


01:26.398 --> 01:29.526
political unrest, murderous attacks, 


01:29.527 --> 01:33.114
and terrorist strikes 
in one place after another. 


01:33.113 --> 01:38.368
Perhaps you personally have experienced 
health or economic challenges, 


01:38.368 --> 01:40.745
the loss of a loved one in death, 


01:40.745 --> 01:45.750
or opposition to the stand 
that you have taken as a true Christian. 


01:45.750 --> 01:49.505
The Governing Body 
is very much aware of all of this 


01:49.505 --> 01:51.507
and wants to help you cope 


01:51.507 --> 01:55.135
with these “critical times 
hard to deal with.”


01:55.135 --> 01:57.553
There are three qualities in particular 


01:57.553 --> 02:01.600
that we are highlighting 
on our convention programs. 


02:01.600 --> 02:03.977
First is loyalty. 


02:03.977 --> 02:06.730
Remember last year’s convention 
had the theme: 


02:06.730 --> 02:10.525
“Remain Loyal to Jehovah!” 


02:10.525 --> 02:14.000
Perhaps you recall these points 
gleaned from that program. 


02:15.280 --> 02:19.577
Drawing close to our heavenly Father 
will give us the stability 


02:19.577 --> 02:24.624
and strength to overcome 
the most daunting obstacles. 


02:24.623 --> 02:27.835
And strengthening 
our loyalty to Jehovah now 


02:27.835 --> 02:31.713
is essential to remaining 
loyal under future tests, 


02:31.713 --> 02:35.800
including the upcoming great tribulation.


02:35.800 --> 02:39.805
It was our earnest desire 
that last year’s program 


02:39.805 --> 02:44.000
would help you to cherish 
your loyalty to Jehovah all the more. 


02:45.643 --> 02:48.063
This year we are highlighting 


02:48.063 --> 02:50.315
a second quality, 


02:50.315 --> 02:52.442
that of endurance. 


02:52.442 --> 02:55.779
The convention theme 
has been taken from the words 


02:55.778 --> 02:59.031
found at Galatians 6:9: 


02:59.032 --> 03:02.494
“Let us not give up in doing what is fine.” 


03:02.493 --> 03:06.498
Hence, this year’s theme is “Don’t Give Up!” 


03:06.498 --> 03:08.625
Each day of our convention, 


03:08.625 --> 03:12.963
we will learn 
about wonderful Bible examples of endurance. 


03:12.963 --> 03:17.591
The greatest example, of course, 
is Jehovah God himself. 


03:17.592 --> 03:20.262
He has patiently endured 


03:20.262 --> 03:22.765
the reproach brought on his holy name 


03:22.765 --> 03:25.100
and the pain of watching 


03:25.100 --> 03:29.353
his beloved creation suffer 
until the appointed time.


03:29.353 --> 03:31.565
We will also learn about the endurance 


03:31.565 --> 03:33.775
of Joseph,


03:33.775 --> 03:36.153
Jephthah’s daughter,


03:36.153 --> 03:38.363
Jeremiah,


03:38.363 --> 03:41.116
the apostle John and, foremost,


03:41.117 --> 03:43.827
Jesus Christ. 


03:43.827 --> 03:46.000
Here are two key points 
that you’ll want to listen for: 


03:47.998 --> 03:53.003
Our endurance as Christians 
does not depend on favorable circumstances; 


03:53.003 --> 03:57.631
it results from reliance on Jehovah. 


03:57.632 --> 04:02.345
And our confidence that Jehovah 
will reward us in the future is strengthened 


04:02.345 --> 04:06.267
as we experience him 
answering our prayers now.


04:06.267 --> 04:11.105
Jehovah’s servants today 
are part of a long line of faithful witnesses 


04:11.105 --> 04:13.690
who have endured with his help. 


04:13.690 --> 04:18.000
We sincerely commend you 
for your loyalty and endurance. 


04:19.070 --> 04:22.950
Now, what is the third vital quality, 


04:22.950 --> 04:27.955
the one we will highlight 
during the 2018 convention program? 


04:27.955 --> 04:30.915
Well, we’ll get to that. 


04:30.915 --> 04:34.920
For now, enjoy this program on endurance 


04:34.920 --> 04:37.255
from the opening music-video presentation 


04:37.255 --> 04:40.008
to the last talk of each session. 


04:40.008 --> 04:42.886
Please, give it your closest attention. 


04:42.887 --> 04:46.000
We wish you a wonderful convention!


04:48.267 --> 04:52.229
We certainly hope 
you have enjoyed these last three days 


04:52.228 --> 04:55.773
of our “Don’t Give Up!” Regional Convention. 


04:55.773 --> 05:00.695
We encourage you to stay faithful, 
come what may in the future. 


05:00.695 --> 05:05.000
Then the latter part of Galatians 6:9 
will come true for us all: 


05:06.368 --> 05:12.098
“In due time we will reap 
if we do not tire out.” 


05:12.098 --> 05:15.058
We feel so strongly 
about the need for all of us 


05:15.058 --> 05:18.515
to strengthen our endurance 
that during this year, 


05:18.515 --> 05:23.000
the two circuit assembly programs 
are developing related themes: 


05:24.052 --> 05:28.932
“Don’t Give Up 
in Fulfilling the Law of Christ!” 


05:28.932 --> 05:32.000
and “Don’t Give Up in Doing What Is Fine!”


05:33.645 --> 05:36.648
Oh, yes, one last thing. 


05:36.648 --> 05:39.150
So we discussed the first two qualities: 


05:39.150 --> 05:41.612
loyalty and endurance. 


05:41.612 --> 05:44.239
What do you think will be the third quality 


05:44.238 --> 05:46.266
that we will emphasize 


05:46.267 --> 05:48.827
after loyalty and endurance? 


05:48.827 --> 05:51.162
It is courage. 


05:51.162 --> 05:53.249
So stay tuned! 


05:53.248 --> 05:55.583
Until then, 
dear brothers and sisters, 


05:55.583 --> 05:57.585
the Governing Body 
wants you to know 


05:57.585 --> 06:01.360
that we love you dearly 
and pray for you constantly. 


06:01.360 --> 06:04.613
And remember, 
the end is imminent, 


06:04.613 --> 06:12.580
and we must not give up, 
especially now!

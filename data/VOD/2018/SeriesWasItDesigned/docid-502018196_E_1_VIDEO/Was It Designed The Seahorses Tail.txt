00:00:08 ‎The seahorse  ‎has a very unusual feature for a fish:
00:00:12 ‎a prehensile, or grasping, tail.
00:00:15 ‎This tail can anchor  ‎the seahorse to one spot,
00:00:18 ‎resisting the ocean currents ‎that surround it.
00:00:23 ‎How does it work?
00:00:25 ‎The cross-section  ‎of the seahorse’s tail is square,
00:00:30 ‎not round like that  ‎of most other animals with gripping tails.
00:00:33 ‎In contrast with a round shape,
00:00:35 ‎this square shape  ‎allows the tail to contact a greater area
00:00:38 ‎of the surface being gripped,
00:00:40 ‎making it more difficult to dislodge.
00:00:43 ‎It can also
00:00:45 ‎twist and untwist with minimal energy.
00:00:50 ‎In addition, the tail  ‎of the seahorse is encased
00:00:52 ‎in overlapping bony plates ‎with many joints.
00:00:56 ‎When subjected  ‎to a potentially harmful force,
00:00:59 ‎the plates slide over one another,
00:01:01 ‎absorbing the energy.
00:01:04 ‎This can prevent damage  ‎to the seahorse’s spinal column.
00:01:08 ‎The design of the seahorse’s tail ‎could be applied to search-and-rescue robots,
00:01:12 ‎which need to be strong ‎and capable of bending and twisting
00:01:16 ‎in tight spaces.
00:01:17 ‎The same properties could be useful
00:01:20 ‎in some surgical equipment.
00:01:22 ‎According to Professor Ross Hatton:
00:01:25 ‎“Human engineers tend to build things
00:01:27 ‎“that are stiff  ‎so they can be controlled easily.
00:01:30 ‎“But nature makes things  ‎just strong enough not to break,
00:01:33 ‎“and then flexible enough  ‎to do a wide range of tasks.
00:01:37 ‎“That’s why we can learn  ‎a lot from animals
00:01:39 ‎that will inspire  ‎the next generations of robotics.”
00:01:42 ‎What do you think?
00:01:45 ‎Did the seahorse’s tail evolve?
00:01:47 ‎Or was it designed?

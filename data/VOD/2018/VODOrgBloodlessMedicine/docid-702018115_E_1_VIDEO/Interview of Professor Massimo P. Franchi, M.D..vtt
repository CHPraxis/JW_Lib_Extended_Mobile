In my professional career,
I thank Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:20.136 --> 00:00:23.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They made a traditional doctor like myself

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
consider the possibility and importance
of reducing the use of blood.

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:33.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I believe that you
—not you as people but as a clinical set-up—

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have greatly changed my attitude

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:40.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thereby also that of my collaborators.

00:00:44.894 --> 00:00:47.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have lengthy clinical experience
of over 30 years.

00:00:47.897 --> 00:00:49.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in my clinical experience,

00:00:49.933 --> 00:00:52.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have never had any such cases

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:54.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—neither in my experience
as a medical examiner

00:00:54.738 --> 00:00:57.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor have my colleagues ever had them.

00:00:57.173 --> 00:00:59.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t think it is correct to say

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:02.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that someone will die
because they didn’t accept blood.

00:01:02.178 --> 00:01:05.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s an exceedingly complex situation
and should be considered

00:01:05.882 --> 00:01:07.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a case-by-case basis.

00:01:07.917 --> 00:01:10.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Blood, anyway, has risks,

00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:13.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so even a transfusion carries
a high level of risk to the patient.

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:16.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to evaluate risks versus benefits.

00:01:16.893 --> 00:01:20.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a doctor, I believe
that a patient who comes well-prepared

00:01:20.697 --> 00:01:24.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a surgical operation or to give birth
has a minimal risk.

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:26.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can’t exclude it.

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:30.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then again, we can’t exclude
a death following a transfusion.

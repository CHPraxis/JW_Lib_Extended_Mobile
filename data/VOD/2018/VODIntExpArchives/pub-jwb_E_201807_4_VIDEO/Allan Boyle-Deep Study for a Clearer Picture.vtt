00:01.117 --> 00:04.888
We begin with an archived interview 
of Brother Allan Boyle.

00:04.888 --> 00:08.958
Among his many assignments, 
Brother Boyle spent 37 years

00:08.958 --> 00:11.728
in the Art Department 
at world headquarters.

00:11.728 --> 00:14.097
The beautiful and accurate illustrations

00:14.097 --> 00:16.332
produced there enhance our study,

00:16.332 --> 00:20.704
helping us to visualize 
and meditate on what we are reading.

00:20.704 --> 00:23.973
An assignment 
to create these pictures is exciting,

00:23.973 --> 00:27.143
but it requires 
that a person have spiritual qualities.

00:27.143 --> 00:29.145
Artists collaborate

00:29.145 --> 00:31.781
and must humbly listen 
to each other’s comments.

00:31.781 --> 00:35.051
They must apply direction 
from “the faithful and discreet slave”

00:35.051 --> 00:39.489
to prepare artwork 
that we can take in as spiritual food.

00:39.489 --> 00:41.825
As you’ll hear Brother Boyle describe,

00:41.825 --> 00:45.495
a person must be 
an avid student of the Bible.

00:45.495 --> 00:47.731
Listen to Brother Boyle’s story,

00:47.731 --> 00:51.601
and note what he said was needed 
for him to do his assignment well.

01:07.617 --> 01:10.120
I was born in 1933.

01:10.120 --> 01:14.224
I got to the age of 18, 
and one suppertime

01:14.224 --> 01:17.327
my mother 
had invited the company servant,

01:17.327 --> 01:20.463
as they were called back then, 
to come for supper.

01:20.463 --> 01:22.732
He asked me 
what I was going to do with my life.

01:22.732 --> 01:25.101
I said to him, 
“Well, I’m going to pioneer.”

01:25.101 --> 01:28.271
So three weeks later, 
at the convention in London,

01:28.271 --> 01:33.109
I got baptized and then 
went pioneering six months after that.

01:33.109 --> 01:35.678
I was 21 when I was in the circuit work,

01:35.678 --> 01:37.747
and that was a wonderful experience.

01:37.747 --> 01:39.916
And in those days, 
of course, you didn’t have a car.

01:39.916 --> 01:41.918
I used to have a motorbike.

01:41.918 --> 01:44.687
And I’d go around 
on the motorbike with my briefcase

01:44.687 --> 01:47.924
and my typewriter 
and my clothes in the other case on the back.

01:47.924 --> 01:49.926
Yeah, that was very exciting.

01:49.926 --> 01:53.963
I was invited to go to Gilead, 
and that was wonderfully exciting.

01:53.963 --> 01:56.032
We had 103 in the class.

01:56.032 --> 01:58.034
Little did I know at the time

01:58.034 --> 02:00.703
that I would be sent 
as a missionary to Ireland.

02:09.846 --> 02:12.415
My friend had been invited to go down

02:12.415 --> 02:15.018
to London Bethel to do the artwork there.

02:15.018 --> 02:17.187
I’d always wanted to be in Bethel.

02:17.187 --> 02:20.123
I thought, ‘Well, why don’t I just 
call him up and congratulate him?’

02:20.123 --> 02:23.560
So that’s what I did, 
and he told me that he decided not to go.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.396
So he said: “If you’re 
still interested, why don’t you go?

02:26.396 --> 02:28.398
You know, call them up and let them know.”

02:28.398 --> 02:31.835
So that’s what I did. 
The next morning, I called up London Bethel,

02:31.835 --> 02:36.072
and within a week I was 
in London Bethel doing the graphics work

02:36.072 --> 02:37.740
for the magazines, you know.

02:37.740 --> 02:39.242
It was a wonderful, thrilling experience.

02:41.845 --> 02:44.347
I was in London Bethel for a couple of years,

02:44.347 --> 02:47.984
in 1977 to 1979,

02:47.984 --> 02:51.754
and then Brother Barry invited me 
to come over to Brooklyn Bethel.

02:55.825 --> 03:00.463
You know that you’re doing 
something that’s going to be beneficial

03:00.463 --> 03:02.699
and helpful to other people,

03:02.699 --> 03:05.802
even to people in different 
languages, in different cultures.

03:05.802 --> 03:08.872
A little painting that you do 
is going to help them

03:08.872 --> 03:11.708
to get a memory of something significant.

03:13.543 --> 03:18.047
One of the most beautiful things 
about working in the Art Department

03:18.047 --> 03:22.051
and doing paintings 
is that it makes you do research.

03:22.051 --> 03:24.821
You have to investigate. 
Is this the right time of the day?

03:24.821 --> 03:26.155
Is it night? Is it day?

03:26.155 --> 03:28.157
What did the sky look like?

03:28.157 --> 03:31.995
What was it like 
before the Flood when Noah built the ark?

03:31.995 --> 03:34.697
How did he paint underneath the ark?

03:34.697 --> 03:36.332
How did he waterproof it?

03:36.332 --> 03:38.334
Because that’s 
the most important part, isn’t it?

03:38.334 --> 03:41.237
He used bitumen. 
OK, how did he get underneath the ark?

03:41.237 --> 03:42.872
Maybe he put it on stilts.

03:42.872 --> 03:46.542
You have to come up 
with all these little questions in your mind.

03:51.614 --> 03:54.784
To do the research was very rewarding.

04:16.506 --> 04:18.942
This is a little model of a boat,

04:18.942 --> 04:20.944
and underneath the deck they used to keep

04:20.944 --> 04:23.746
a ballast sack of 110 pounds (50 kg) of sand.

04:23.746 --> 04:27.317
It says in the Scriptures 
that Jesus was asleep on “a pillow.”

04:27.317 --> 04:31.087
Apparently, this was 
the ballast sack that he was asleep on.

04:31.087 --> 04:34.691
And actually, 
in the Kingdom Interlinear translation,

04:34.691 --> 04:37.126
it doesn’t say 
that he was asleep on “a pillow”;

04:37.126 --> 04:39.395
it says he was asleep on “the pillow.”

04:39.395 --> 04:42.432
So apparently, 
back 2,000 years ago in that area,

04:42.432 --> 04:44.434
everybody knew what “the pillow” was.

04:49.572 --> 04:54.043
I remember meeting 
a brother once who’d been to Siberia,

04:54.043 --> 04:58.147
and he’d taken a snapshot 
of somebody’s kitchen in Siberia.

04:58.147 --> 05:00.917
And to my amazement, on the wall

05:00.917 --> 05:03.386
—pinned with drawing pins on the wall—

05:03.386 --> 05:06.389
was one of the pages of the publications

05:06.389 --> 05:08.491
that we produced here at Brooklyn.

05:08.491 --> 05:10.493
And so, remarkably,

05:10.493 --> 05:14.430
it’s wonderful to feel 
that whatever we do here

05:14.430 --> 05:17.300
—if it’s support work, 
if it’s the painting,

05:17.300 --> 05:20.203
and, of course, we need 
a lot of support work for the paintings—

05:20.203 --> 05:22.205
all of what we do here

05:22.205 --> 05:24.440
has an effect upon the brothers and sisters

05:24.440 --> 05:27.744
out there in the world, wherever it might be.

05:27.744 --> 05:31.247
And you really feel 
that your time is well spent.

05:34.317 --> 05:36.819
You’re adorning the Word of truth.

05:36.819 --> 05:41.057
You’re helping other people 
to be taught something from the Bible,

05:41.057 --> 05:43.059
which is going to be to their benefit.

05:45.928 --> 05:49.298
It’s been very rewarding and thrilling

05:49.298 --> 05:53.069
to be in Jehovah’s service, 
and I’ve really enjoyed it.

06:11.521 --> 06:16.059
Allan Boyle finished 
his earthly course in 2016.

06:16.059 --> 06:18.861
Those in the Art Department 
who worked with him

06:18.861 --> 06:23.166
remember his enthusiasm 
and his thorough attention to detail.

06:23.166 --> 06:25.201
What Allan brought to his assignment

06:25.201 --> 06:28.504
was rooted 
in his own personal study of the Bible.

06:28.504 --> 06:30.907
He found it rewarding to do the research

06:30.907 --> 06:33.643
needed to illustrate Bible scenes.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.145
Today, the Writing Department supplies

06:36.145 --> 06:39.348
a team of researchers to assist the artists.

06:39.348 --> 06:42.852
But did you recall 
what Allan said helped his research?

06:42.852 --> 06:47.156
He asked questions 
about the scenes he was painting!

06:47.156 --> 06:50.593
These same kinds of questions 
are part of the study methods

06:50.593 --> 06:58.828
Gilead students learn in class.

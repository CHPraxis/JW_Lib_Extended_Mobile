00:07.103 --> 00:10.186
Sports—they can be good for you. 


00:10.187 --> 00:13.229
In fact, at 1 Timothy 4:8, 


00:13.228 --> 00:16.936
the Bible says that 
“physical exercise is beneficial.” (Ftn.)


00:16.937 --> 00:19.520
Sports can teach you vital skills, 


00:19.520 --> 00:22.978
including how to cooperate 
and communicate with others. 


00:22.978 --> 00:25.000
But sports can also be bad for you. 


00:26.562 --> 00:28.645
It all depends on what you play, 


00:28.645 --> 00:30.645
how you play, 


00:30.645 --> 00:33.562
and how much you play. 


00:33.562 --> 00:35.645
Consider what you play. 


00:35.645 --> 00:38.853
At Psalm 11:5, the Bible reminds us 


00:38.853 --> 00:42.020
that God “hates anyone who loves violence.” 


00:42.020 --> 00:45.103
And some sports are clearly violent. 


00:45.103 --> 00:47.186
So ask yourself, 


00:47.187 --> 00:49.187
‘Does it make sense to be entertained 


00:49.187 --> 00:52.562
by watching others get knocked around?’ 


00:52.562 --> 00:55.270
Next, consider how you play. 


00:55.270 --> 00:58.145
At Philippians 2:3, the Bible says: 


00:58.145 --> 01:01.228
“Do nothing out of contentiousness 
or out of egotism, 


01:01.228 --> 01:05.228
but with humility 
consider others superior to you.” 


01:05.228 --> 01:07.728
Of course, nearly every sport 


01:07.728 --> 01:09.728
involves a degree of competition. 


01:09.728 --> 01:12.645
But a win-at-all-costs attitude 


01:12.645 --> 01:15.312
will just take the fun out of the game. 


01:15.312 --> 01:18.229
And besides, at Proverbs 16:18, 


01:18.228 --> 01:21.228
the Bible says that 
“pride is before a crash.” 


01:21.228 --> 01:23.228
So ask yourself: 


01:23.228 --> 01:27.561
‘Do I enjoy playing with overly competitive 
and prideful people? 


01:27.562 --> 01:31.104
Then why would I want to be like that?’ 


01:31.103 --> 01:35.978
Finally, consider how much you play sports 
—or even watch. 


01:35.978 --> 01:38.811
At Philippians 1:10, the Bible says: 


01:38.812 --> 01:41.812
“Make sure of the more important things.” 


01:41.812 --> 01:45.354
That’s good advice because, let’s face it, 


01:45.353 --> 01:47.561
putting too much emphasis on sports 


01:47.562 --> 01:50.104
is like putting too much salt on your food. 


01:50.103 --> 01:53.520
If you spend too much time watching 
or playing sports, 


01:53.520 --> 01:55.895
other things in your life will suffer. 


01:55.895 --> 01:58.353
That includes your family life, 


01:58.353 --> 02:00.561
school grades, 


02:00.562 --> 02:02.770
and the time you need to devote to worship. 


02:02.770 --> 02:07.312
In the end, sports shouldn’t be 
the most important thing in your life. 


02:07.312 --> 02:10.562
Instead, think of it as the reward you get 


02:10.562 --> 02:13.729
for taking care 
of your responsibilities first. 


02:13.728 --> 02:17.103
That way, 
you really get the benefits of sports 


02:17.103 --> 02:26.708
and avoid the pitfalls.

00:01 Well, today we invited  two young people to join us in our studio.
00:04 This is Logan, and this is Aiden.
00:06 Thank you for coming.
00:07 Thanks for inviting us.
00:09 What did you think of that video?
00:10 I liked it  and that it showed a lot of families
00:14 doing stuff that involves Jehovah.
00:18 Good.
00:19 The one thing I noticed was  that they were all in a relaxed setting.
00:23 It was not like in a busy city.
00:25 They were at, like, the shore
00:27 where they were talking about the Bible,
00:30 and it was nice family time  that they were having.
00:33 Good observations, Fellas.
00:35 Now, three times in the chorus it said:
00:38 ‘We need to set time aside  for the most important things.’
00:43 Then it mentioned three important things.
00:45 What were they?
00:46 Prayer.
00:47 Study.
00:48 Godly—
00:49 —devotion.
00:50 That’s it, very good.
00:51 Good things for all of us to remember,  wouldn’t you say?
00:54 Well now, my wife and I  are in the same congregation
00:57 with Logan and Aiden  and their families.
00:59 So I know  what excellent meeting attenders they are.
01:02 And what I really appreciate  is that you participate in the meetings
01:05 and you comment in your own words.
01:07 That’s very good and sets a nice example.
01:09 Keep it up.
01:10 Speaking of the meetings,  how do you like the midweek meetings
01:13 with all the videos that we see?
01:15 It gives a diversity.
01:18 It’s not always talks.
01:19 It gives, like, a break in the meeting.
01:20 Yes.
01:21 The videos are always great,
01:26 and they go with every talk  that the videos are for.
01:30 And you know, sometimes  we even show Caleb and Sophia videos
01:34 from the Become Jehovah’s Friend series.
01:37 Now, I’ve got to ask you,
01:39 Do you have an idea for a new Caleb video?
01:42 I think I have one.
01:44 Caleb is at school;
01:46 he gets asked to go  to a birthday party at someone’s house.
01:49 He goes home and shows his parents the card,
01:51 and they discuss what he should do about it,
01:54 and then he preaches at school.
01:56 But before he does that,
01:58 Sophia gives him a couple of pointers  on preaching at school and on boldness.
02:01 Good.
02:02 How about you Aiden,  do you have an idea?
02:04 Yes, I think a good idea would be:
02:07 A new kid comes to Caleb’s class,  and it is his birthday,
02:12 and he passes out the treats.
02:15 But Caleb says, “No, thank you.”
02:17 And then he bullies him  that he doesn’t get to have fun;
02:22 he doesn’t get treats at school.
02:27 And I think  he should discuss it with the family,
02:30 and then maybe he could tell the boy
02:32 why he doesn’t celebrate birthdays.
02:35 Very nice.
02:36 Well, I’m sure the Teaching Committee  of the Governing Body
02:39 will give some thought  to your recommendations.
02:42 We brought you to the studio
02:44 because we want you  to help me with a little experiment.
02:47 And this is an experiment  that some of our viewers have seen before.
02:51 And you’ve probably seen it, too,  because it’s mentioned in Volume 2
02:54 of the book Questions Young People Ask —Answers That Work.
02:58 And the idea is to help us appreciate
03:00 how we can make time  for “the more important things.”
03:03 Now, let me explain  what we have on the table.
03:05 The two pails represent  one week in a Christian’s life.
03:10 The large rocks represent  the most important things
03:14 that we need  to accomplish during the week,
03:16 and all these little pebbles
03:18 represent the nonessential things of life
03:21 —recreation, playing games, playing sports,
03:26 going on the Internet,
03:28 working with social media,
03:30 our hobbies, taking music lessons.
03:33 They’re all fun things to do,  but, really, they’re not essential.
03:37 Now, our challenge is
03:39 to try to get all the big rocks  into the pail with the little pebbles.
03:43 So as I hand you each rock, Logan,  I want you to put it in the pail.
03:47 Now, this first one represents
03:50 the important things  that your father might have to do.
03:55 He works to support the family.
03:57 Maybe your mother  is a pioneer or has to work secularly.
04:01 Your mothers certainly have a lot of work  to do around the home caring for the family.
04:06 And you boys go to school  and have homework to do,
04:08 so that’s a big part  of your time, isn’t it?
04:13 Now, this rock represents
04:15 all the chores that everyone  in the family has to do at home:
04:19 cleaning, washing clothes, cooking,
04:22 caring for the yard,  the automobile, and so on.
04:24 That takes a lot of time.
04:31 This rock represents a third of your life
04:34 —sleeping.
04:41 Now, here are the most important things —our spiritual activities.
04:45 For instance, when we read the Bible  and meditate on what we read
04:50 and when we do  personal study and family worship.
04:55 This one represents  all the time it takes for us
04:58 to prepare for, dress for, travel to,
05:01 and attend our congregation meetings —midweek and on the weekend.
05:08 And this represents the time we spend  in the field service on the weekend.
05:16 Now, I didn’t tell you  that we can’t go above the top of the pail.
05:20 They don’t fit, do they?
05:21 No.
05:22 OK.
05:23 And when that happens in a person’s life,
05:26 some brothers and sisters  are tempted to decide:
05:30 ‘Well, maybe I’ll skip  field service this week,’
05:33 or ‘Maybe I’ll stay home  from the meetings,’
05:37 or ‘Maybe I just won’t get  my Bible reading
05:40 and studying and family worship  done this week.’
05:42 But that’s a big mistake, isn’t it?
05:44 These are the most important things of life —our spiritual activities.
05:49 So is there some way that we can get  all of this into our week’s schedule?
05:53 Here’s what we’re going to do now.
05:56 We’re going to put  the rocks in the empty pail.
05:58 So, Logan,  see if you can get them all in there.
06:23 Very good! They all fit.
06:25 Isn’t that nice?
06:26 We can get the more important things done.
06:28 But you know, we also want  a little time for recreation, don’t we?
06:31 So, Aiden,
06:33 let’s have you pour  the little pebbles into that bucket
06:37 and see how much  of that you can get in there.
06:53 You can put a lot more in.
07:06 Very good!
07:07 Look how much you got in there!
07:09 Now, you didn’t get them all in,  did you?
07:11 But that’s OK because the Bible tells us
07:14 we have to ‘buy out the time’  for the more important things.
07:17 So, no, we can’t spend all the time  that we may want to on recreation.
07:21 We want to get  the more important things done.
07:24 So, what have we learned  from this little demonstration?
07:27 Why weren’t we able to get  the big rocks in the pail the first time?
07:31 Aiden?
07:32 Because there was too much recreation.
07:35 That’s right.
07:37 Now, Logan, why were we able to get  all the rocks in the second time?
07:41 Because we put in the nonessential things
07:44 —like watching TV, playing video games— in second.
07:48 We put that in last, didn’t we?
07:50 Good.
07:51 So that teaches us:  Put the more important things first.
07:55 And it all depends  on what we fill our pail up with,
07:59 or our life with, first.
08:02 Thank you very much for your help.
08:04 I appreciate that.
08:05 And keep up your good work  as Kingdom publishers,
08:09 and I’ll see you at the Kingdom Hall  at the next meeting.

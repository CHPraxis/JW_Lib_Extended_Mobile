00:00.817 --> 00:04.721
Young ones, it’s true 
that the more you understand Jehovah,

00:04.721 --> 00:06.856
the more you love him.

00:06.856 --> 00:10.727
And what a blessing you have 
if your family worships Jehovah with you

00:10.727 --> 00:13.897
and teaches you how to draw close to him.

00:13.897 --> 00:16.633
But some young ones 
have had to build their faith

00:16.633 --> 00:19.502
without their family’s support.

00:19.502 --> 00:23.573
Listen to the experience of Ersi Royer 
from the United States.

00:23.573 --> 00:28.078
What spiritual decision did she face 
at just 14 years old?

00:28.078 --> 00:31.014
And what did she do 
that illustrates the value

00:31.014 --> 00:33.917
of deep personal study?

00:33.917 --> 00:36.553
Growing up,

00:36.553 --> 00:38.555
it wasn’t the typical,

00:38.555 --> 00:41.157
“My mom is a pioneer, my dad is an elder,

00:41.157 --> 00:43.493
and we’re doing great in the congregation.”

00:43.493 --> 00:46.329
My family life wasn’t the best,

00:46.329 --> 00:49.399
so why would I want to do this religion 
that nobody is happy

00:49.399 --> 00:52.001
in our family with?

00:52.001 --> 00:54.504
And I think that can make you feel

00:54.504 --> 00:57.340
very alone or odd

00:57.340 --> 00:59.609
or awkward or secluded.

01:01.211 --> 01:03.313
And at that time, 
I was graduating eighth grade.

01:03.313 --> 01:04.881
There were dances;

01:04.881 --> 01:07.851
friends were hanging out, going to parties.

01:07.851 --> 01:12.522
And I remember thinking: 
‘Wow, these look like really nice kids.

01:12.522 --> 01:15.358
Why aren’t I doing that?’

01:15.358 --> 01:19.362
I hadn’t really delved into the Bible enough 
to answer questions

01:19.362 --> 01:22.599
that I really needed to know.

01:22.599 --> 01:26.402
I went in prayer to Jehovah and said: 
“I’m so sorry, but today I’m not a Witness.

01:26.402 --> 01:30.073
I’m going to try to prove 
everything that I’ve been taught is wrong.”

01:30.073 --> 01:33.810
I asked him that if he’s real,

01:33.810 --> 01:35.411
to help me understand.

01:35.411 --> 01:37.280
So I went in my room

01:37.280 --> 01:38.882
and shut the door.

01:38.882 --> 01:40.984
I got every book off the shelf.

01:40.984 --> 01:43.119
I started off organized,

01:43.119 --> 01:44.454
but by the end of the evening,

01:44.454 --> 01:47.223
I had books 
all over the place with pages open.

01:47.223 --> 01:49.726
The more I kept reading about Jehovah,

01:50.660 --> 01:54.497
the more the next topic would take me 
to then connect the scriptures.

01:54.497 --> 01:56.432
Jesus is linked to Jehovah;

01:56.432 --> 01:59.502
the angels are linked to Jehovah; 
the resurrection is linked to Jehovah.

01:59.502 --> 02:03.473
So you can’t believe in one thing 
and not everything else

02:03.473 --> 02:05.675
if you really want to know the truth.

02:05.675 --> 02:08.144
And so that’s what did it for me,

02:09.012 --> 02:11.281
especially the scripture in Psalms

02:11.281 --> 02:14.184
when it said 
that ‘you saw even the embryo of me.’

02:15.919 --> 02:17.921
And it was an emotional scripture for me

02:17.921 --> 02:20.623
because I thought: 
‘Wow,

02:20.623 --> 02:23.693
‘my parents aren’t doing great 
in the truth right now.

02:23.693 --> 02:26.095
‘But Jehovah found a way to find me,

02:26.095 --> 02:28.264
‘and he knew what I could be.

02:29.933 --> 02:31.868
‘Now I have my answer. 
I don’t have an excuse.

02:31.868 --> 02:34.704
‘Jehovah gave me enough knowledge 
that now I’m responsible.

02:34.704 --> 02:38.174
I now need to act on that 
and show my love in return for him.’

02:39.809 --> 02:42.345
Within a week, I found another sister

02:42.345 --> 02:44.848
in the hall that was really helpful 
in me getting out

02:44.848 --> 02:47.016
in service quite often.

02:47.016 --> 02:50.386
I don’t think to this day she ever knew 
how much I appreciated that.

02:50.386 --> 02:54.591
Although things were declining 
in our family spiritually,

02:54.591 --> 02:56.826
I was able to get baptized.

02:56.826 --> 02:58.828
As I progressed spiritually,

02:58.828 --> 03:00.830
I could see that I did not have

03:00.830 --> 03:02.999
the support of my family,

03:02.999 --> 03:05.568
but I had to trust that Jehovah 
would help me through it.

03:05.568 --> 03:08.338
And at least by the time I got home, 
if there was an issue,

03:08.338 --> 03:11.341
I had the strength of the meeting 
and the brothers and sisters

03:11.341 --> 03:13.910
and joy that they 
couldn’t take away from me.

03:16.379 --> 03:18.748
I remember I came home one day 
with some friends.

03:18.748 --> 03:20.483
It was a nice day

03:20.483 --> 03:22.352
—encouraging, upbuilding.

03:22.352 --> 03:25.655
We pulled into our driveway; 
they dropped me off

03:25.655 --> 03:27.257
and said good-bye.

03:27.257 --> 03:30.093
My parents were really upset

03:30.093 --> 03:32.462
when they came and met me at the door.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.197
They couldn’t fully understand

03:35.164 --> 03:38.868
why I was making my decisions

03:38.868 --> 03:41.170
the way I was 
to serve Jehovah more fully.

03:43.139 --> 03:45.141
We just could not agree

03:45.141 --> 03:49.078
on where my relationship 
with Jehovah was going.

03:49.846 --> 03:54.651
And at that point, 
I left with the clothes on my back.

03:54.651 --> 03:57.320
In a matter of a few minutes,

03:57.320 --> 03:59.722
my life forever changed.

04:05.762 --> 04:08.197
I had a spiritual aunt that took me in,

04:10.133 --> 04:11.868
helped me gather myself together,

04:11.868 --> 04:15.638
and literally fed me, clothed me,

04:15.638 --> 04:18.041
helped me spiritually.

04:18.041 --> 04:21.277
And so then, my support became Jehovah

04:21.277 --> 04:25.148
and the congregation.

04:25.148 --> 04:28.084
I remember that a sister told me years ago,

04:28.084 --> 04:31.788
“Be who you needed when you were young.”

04:31.788 --> 04:34.290
And so when I look at those little ones,

04:34.290 --> 04:36.059
I look at myself and say,

04:36.059 --> 04:38.494
‘How could I have benefited

04:38.494 --> 04:42.165
from someone taking the time for me 
when I was that age?’

04:42.165 --> 04:44.167
I’ve always tried remembering the young ones

04:44.167 --> 04:47.070
—because that’s just part of who I am—

04:47.070 --> 04:50.974
and making sure that they know 
that they’re not alone.

04:50.974 --> 04:53.443
If there is a young one out there 
who isn’t sure

04:53.443 --> 04:55.845
if this is the truth or not,

04:55.845 --> 04:58.748
I would like them to know 
that Jehovah knows

04:58.748 --> 05:00.583
who they are,

05:00.583 --> 05:03.453
and he’s finding a way 
for them to know him.

05:03.453 --> 05:08.458
Jehovah is real, 
he knows them by name,

05:08.458 --> 05:12.628
he wants them to live, 
and he’s fighting for them.

05:12.628 --> 05:17.633
How amazing that young Ersi chose 
to spend an entire day studying

05:17.633 --> 05:22.138
—proving to herself 
that Jehovah knew her and loved her.

05:22.138 --> 05:25.108
But this was no onetime study marathon.

05:25.108 --> 05:28.878
From there, she worked to develop 
the study habits she needed

05:28.878 --> 05:32.648
to endure, grow, 
and become a spiritual person.

05:32.648 --> 05:34.951
She pioneered for several years,

05:34.951 --> 05:37.954
and now serves at Bethel 
with her husband, Jeff.

05:37.954 --> 05:42.658
In my conversation with Ersi, 
she expressed her love for her family

05:42.658 --> 05:45.228
and the hope that someday in the future

05:45.228 --> 05:54.397
she’ll be reunited with them spiritually.

00:00 Young ones, it’s true  that the more you understand Jehovah,
00:04 the more you love him.
00:06 And what a blessing you have  if your family worships Jehovah with you
00:10 and teaches you how to draw close to him.
00:13 But some young ones  have had to build their faith
00:16 without their family’s support.
00:19 Listen to the experience of Ersi Royer  from the United States.
00:23 What spiritual decision did she face  at just 14 years old?
00:28 And what did she do  that illustrates the value
00:31 of deep personal study?
00:33 Growing up,
00:36 it wasn’t the typical,
00:38 “My mom is a pioneer, my dad is an elder,
00:41 and we’re doing great in the congregation.”
00:43 My family life wasn’t the best,
00:46 so why would I want to do this religion  that nobody is happy
00:49 in our family with?
00:52 And I think that can make you feel
00:54 very alone or odd
00:57 or awkward or secluded.
01:01 And at that time,  I was graduating eighth grade.
01:03 There were dances;
01:04 friends were hanging out, going to parties.
01:07 And I remember thinking:  ‘Wow, these look like really nice kids.
01:12 Why aren’t I doing that?’
01:15 I hadn’t really delved into the Bible enough  to answer questions
01:19 that I really needed to know.
01:22 I went in prayer to Jehovah and said:  “I’m so sorry, but today I’m not a Witness.
01:26 I’m going to try to prove  everything that I’ve been taught is wrong.”
01:30 I asked him that if he’s real,
01:33 to help me understand.
01:35 So I went in my room
01:37 and shut the door.
01:38 I got every book off the shelf.
01:40 I started off organized,
01:43 but by the end of the evening,
01:44 I had books  all over the place with pages open.
01:47 The more I kept reading about Jehovah,
01:50 the more the next topic would take me  to then connect the scriptures.
01:54 Jesus is linked to Jehovah;
01:56 the angels are linked to Jehovah;  the resurrection is linked to Jehovah.
01:59 So you can’t believe in one thing  and not everything else
02:03 if you really want to know the truth.
02:05 And so that’s what did it for me,
02:09 especially the scripture in Psalms
02:11 when it said  that ‘you saw even the embryo of me.’
02:15 And it was an emotional scripture for me
02:17 because I thought:  ‘Wow,
02:20 ‘my parents aren’t doing great  in the truth right now.
02:23 ‘But Jehovah found a way to find me,
02:26 ‘and he knew what I could be.
02:29 ‘Now I have my answer.  I don’t have an excuse.
02:31 ‘Jehovah gave me enough knowledge  that now I’m responsible.
02:34 I now need to act on that  and show my love in return for him.’
02:39 Within a week, I found another sister
02:42 in the hall that was really helpful  in me getting out
02:44 in service quite often.
02:47 I don’t think to this day she ever knew  how much I appreciated that.
02:50 Although things were declining  in our family spiritually,
02:54 I was able to get baptized.
02:56 As I progressed spiritually,
02:58 I could see that I did not have
03:00 the support of my family,
03:02 but I had to trust that Jehovah  would help me through it.
03:05 And at least by the time I got home,  if there was an issue,
03:08 I had the strength of the meeting  and the brothers and sisters
03:11 and joy that they  couldn’t take away from me.
03:16 I remember I came home one day  with some friends.
03:18 It was a nice day
03:20 —encouraging, upbuilding.
03:22 We pulled into our driveway;  they dropped me off
03:25 and said good-bye.
03:27 My parents were really upset
03:30 when they came and met me at the door.
03:32 They couldn’t fully understand
03:35 why I was making my decisions
03:38 the way I was  to serve Jehovah more fully.
03:43 We just could not agree
03:45 on where my relationship  with Jehovah was going.
03:49 And at that point,  I left with the clothes on my back.
03:54 In a matter of a few minutes,
03:57 my life forever changed.
04:05 I had a spiritual aunt that took me in,
04:10 helped me gather myself together,
04:11 and literally fed me, clothed me,
04:15 helped me spiritually.
04:18 And so then, my support became Jehovah
04:21 and the congregation.
04:25 I remember that a sister told me years ago,
04:28 “Be who you needed when you were young.”
04:31 And so when I look at those little ones,
04:34 I look at myself and say,
04:36 ‘How could I have benefited
04:38 from someone taking the time for me  when I was that age?’
04:42 I’ve always tried remembering the young ones
04:44 —because that’s just part of who I am—
04:47 and making sure that they know  that they’re not alone.
04:50 If there is a young one out there  who isn’t sure
04:53 if this is the truth or not,
04:55 I would like them to know  that Jehovah knows
04:58 who they are,
05:00 and he’s finding a way  for them to know him.
05:03 Jehovah is real,  he knows them by name,
05:08 he wants them to live,  and he’s fighting for them.
05:12 How amazing that young Ersi chose  to spend an entire day studying
05:17 —proving to herself  that Jehovah knew her and loved her.
05:22 But this was no onetime study marathon.
05:25 From there, she worked to develop  the study habits she needed
05:28 to endure, grow,  and become a spiritual person.
05:32 She pioneered for several years,
05:34 and now serves at Bethel  with her husband, Jeff.
05:37 In my conversation with Ersi,  she expressed her love for her family
05:42 and the hope that someday in the future
05:45 she’ll be reunited with them spiritually.

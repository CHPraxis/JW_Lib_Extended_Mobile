00:01 Jehovah loves children,
00:03 and he has shown this by providing help
00:06 and guidance for them down to our day.
00:10 For example, at the 1978  “Victorious Faith” International Convention,
00:14 this release entitled  My Book of Bible Stories
00:18 was soon treasured  by young ones around the world.
00:23 Over the years,  it’s helped millions to come to love Jehovah
00:26 and become his faithful worshippers.
00:31 The story that always meant  a lot to me was that of Samson,
00:33 especially the images  that we had in the My Book of Bible Stories.
00:36 They were so vivid  —to see the strength that Jehovah gave him
00:38 and the way he supported him.
00:40 But at the same time,  the story always carried
00:42 that if you weren’t obedient to Jehovah,  you lost that blessing and that strength.
00:46 So I think that as a young one  growing up in the truth
00:48 —especially when you went to school  and you had to stand out and be different—
00:51 to remember that Jehovah could support you
00:53 and give you that kind  of extraordinary strength.
00:55 It gave you the power  that you needed to make that stand.
00:59 Even earlier,  The Watchtower began a series of articles
01:03 that became the basis for the book  Listening to the Great Teacher.
01:07 And later,  that was rewritten and reillustrated
01:10 to become Learn From the Great Teacher.
01:14 It tells us what kind  of qualities a friend should have.
01:16 I like chapter 35 called  “We Can Wake Up From Death!”
01:20 because I used to be afraid,  and now I know
01:22 that Jesus will resurrect us  no matter what,
01:24 and so I’m not afraid anymore.
01:27 In 2006,  the Awake! magazine started including
01:30 numerous activities and puzzles
01:33 for children of various ages;
01:35 jw.org expanded on this content
01:38 to include over 40 Bible-character cards,
01:42 illustrated Bible stories,  games, coloring activities,
01:45 and two series entitled
01:47 “My Bible Lessons” for younger children
01:51 and “Teach Your Children” for those slightly older.
01:54 And who can forget
01:56 the Become Jehovah’s Friend video series
01:59 with Caleb and Sophia?
02:01 The videos help me to be bold for Jehovah.
02:05 There’s this little booklet/magazine  called My Bible Lessons
02:09 that I remember when I was younger
02:11 —things to be thankful about,  like the Paradise
02:13 and what Jehovah gave us and friends.
02:17 But what has Jehovah  provided for tweens and teens?
02:21 In the early ‘70’s,
02:23 articles were written
02:24 to help those in this age group
02:26 to cope with the challenges
02:28 of becoming an adult.
02:30 These later became  the basis for the books
02:32 Your Youth  —Getting the Best out of It
02:34 and, more recently,
02:36 Questions Young People Ask  —Answers That Work.
02:40 Add to that  the ever-expanding online content,
02:44 such as Answers to 10 Questions  Young People Ask,
02:48 the video series What Your Peers Say,
02:51 as well as whiteboard animations
02:53 and feature-length films  designed to tackle serious
02:56 and sometimes emotional subjects.
03:00 When I was in middle school,  I used to be bullied, and it was harsh.
03:05 Once that video came out,  I mean, I was just amazed!
03:09 It felt like Jehovah  was literally talking to me.
03:11 Yes, Jehovah loves young ones,
03:15 and he continues to express that love
03:17 with an abundance of wonderful gifts.
03:24 People of all ages,  but especially young ones,
03:28 will enjoy this new 240-page book
03:31 containing 103 lessons.
03:35 The artwork is new
03:37 and has been extensively researched,
03:39 bringing the Bible to life
03:41 and capturing the feelings of those depicted.
03:46 Parents will appreciate  that each section starts
03:49 with a preview of the key lessons  you can emphasize.
03:52 Each lesson includes review questions
03:56 and a caption scripture that summarizes it.
03:59 For example, the caption scripture
04:02 for the lesson “Hannah Prays for a Son”
04:04 is Matthew 7:7:
04:07 “Keep on asking,  and it will be given you;
04:11 keep on seeking,  and you will find.”
04:14 This scripture serves  as the main theme of this account,
04:17 allowing you to help your child
04:20 focus on the key lesson of the story.
04:22 Our hope is that all ages
04:26 will enjoy this gift  from our loving Father, Jehovah,
04:30 as we all discover new lessons
04:32 we can learn from the Bible.

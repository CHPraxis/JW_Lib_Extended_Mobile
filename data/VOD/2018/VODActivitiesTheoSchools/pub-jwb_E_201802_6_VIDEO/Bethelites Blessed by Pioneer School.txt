00:09 It was a really great privilege  for us as Bethelites
00:12 to be able to study for six days.
00:15 The Governing Body  giving us time to study more
00:17 about Jehovah’s qualities was tremendous
00:20 to help build our spirituality.
00:22 For many Bethelites,
00:24 this was like a gift from Jehovah
00:27 because they had never attended before.
00:30 In fact, one couple
00:31 who had been 50 years in full-time service
00:34 had never attended the pioneer school before.
00:38 I’d been invited twice before,
00:41 but unfortunately,  both times I wasn’t able to go.
00:45 I felt like Jehovah  was giving me a third chance,
00:47 and this time I wouldn’t miss it.
00:51 At first, you feel a little like,
00:53 this is strange;
00:55 you’re at Bethel;  you’re not out pioneering.
00:57 But then,  when you’ve gone to the school
00:59 and you’ve seen what the school  actually does for your ministry,
01:03 it was really—
01:05 You can see why the Governing Body—
01:06 It was such a kind gift for them  to give us this privilege of coming.
01:10 You’re surrounded by people  who have been pioneers for years;
01:13 some have been to Gilead;  some have been in the traveling work;
01:16 some have conducted  pioneer schools themselves.
01:19 It’s the best.
01:22 Even though they’re  in this spiritual environment,
01:25 they need to be upbuilt.
01:27 As Bethelites,  we go out in service
01:30 not as much as we did  when we were pioneering.
01:32 So being able to have  an effective use of our time
01:35 in the ministry makes a big difference.
01:38 You learn a lot about the field ministry  in pioneer school.
01:41 So in a month when 30 hours was an option,
01:43 I applied to auxiliary pioneer
01:46 and I also tried to participate  a lot in the ministry on weekends.
01:49 This way I was able  to prepare for the school.
01:54 I think that every Christian  needs to have goals,
01:56 and even for us serving in Bethel,  we need goals.
02:00 So the main thing I learned from the school
02:02 is that even while working in Bethel,
02:04 I can do more for the congregation
02:06 and make a bigger effort in the ministry.
02:08 After the pioneer school,
02:11 I realized I needed to cultivate
02:13 more humility in my Bethel service
02:16 and the field ministry.
02:19 Because there’s so much spiritual food
02:21 available at Bethel,
02:23 it can become easy to neglect personal study.
02:25 Listening to the deeply meditated comments
02:28 from the students  and the instructors really stimulated me
02:32 to also meditate more deeply.
02:34 During the school,
02:36 I had to study more than usual,
02:38 so I had to set aside more time for reading
02:40 so as to be well-prepared for class.
02:42 It was really practical for me
02:44 to improve my ministry,
02:46 and it was really nice  because with this new school,
02:48 we had a demonstration
02:49 of what we have to avoid  and what is good to do.
02:54 There was a demonstration  about what not to do on a Bible study,
02:58 and I saw myself doing some of those things.
03:01 So I realized that I really needed
03:03 to get better at conducting Bible studies.
03:05 I remember one demonstration that taught us
03:09 how we can witness informally  in a supermarket line, for example.
03:15 That demonstration  gave me more confidence
03:17 to witness informally.
03:20 In the school, we learned a lot about Jesus
03:22 —how he was hardworking, zealous,
03:25 and showed genuine interest  in the people around him.
03:29 That example helped me  to be more hardworking and zealous,
03:31 as well as to be more approachable  to those whom I work with.
03:34 That’s why we’re here in Bethel
03:36 —it’s to support the preaching work.
03:38 So it doesn’t matter what assignment we have.
03:41 In a way, it’s connected to that.
03:42 The fruitage of the spirit  is good not just for the ministry
03:45 but it’s good for everything in everyday life  toward our brothers and sisters.
03:51 Love is such an important quality  for Bethelites.
03:55 I work in the Computer Department,
03:57 but I don’t treat computers with love.
03:59 But the school strengthened my determination
04:01 to treat my brothers and sisters with love.
04:05 Out of all the other schools I’ve attended,
04:07 this school had the most impact on my life.
04:09 In just one week,  it strengthens our faith,
04:12 widens our view of things,  trains our conscience,
04:15 and deepens our love.
04:17 It definitely
04:19 stimulated the pioneer spirit.
04:21 Even though we’re not pioneers,
04:23 it helped us to understand
04:25 the importance of the pioneer service
04:28 and how it contributes  to our overall joy
04:31 in serving Jehovah.
04:32 So that’s something  that we would never want to neglect.
04:35 We really appreciated  the emphasis that was placed on that
04:39 and how it also helps to keep  our close relationship with Jehovah.

00:00:07 ‎This was the first school
00:00:09 ‎in the Romany language in Bulgaria.
00:00:17 ‎In recent years,
00:00:19 ‎we have seen remarkable growth
00:00:21 ‎in the Romany field.
00:00:24 ‎There are many Roma people  living all over Bulgaria,
00:00:27 ‎generally in their own neighborhoods.
00:00:30 ‎The Roma came to Europe from India  with their own languages and culture.
00:00:35 ‎Roma people are happy  to talk to Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:00:38 ‎sensing no discrimination or prejudice.
00:00:42 ‎As a result,
00:00:44 ‎Romany congregations  and groups have been formed.
00:00:48 ‎At the first Memorial  held in the Romany language,
00:00:51 ‎a congregation with 26 publishers
00:00:54 ‎had 703 in attendance.
00:00:59 ‎In this rapidly growing field,
00:01:03 ‎half of the publishers serve as pioneers.
00:01:07 ‎Seeing the progress in this field,
00:01:10 ‎the branch wanted the pioneers  to be trained in their mother tongue
00:01:13 ‎so that they could apply the information  according to the needs of the territory.
00:01:18 ‎This is a wonderful gift from Jehovah,
00:01:22 ‎because when we receive it  in our own language,
00:01:24 ‎it is embedded directly into our hearts.
00:01:28 ‎I feel very happy that the school
00:01:30 ‎is in the Romany language
00:01:32 ‎because I can see not only Jehovah’s love
00:01:35 ‎but also how he spoils us.
00:01:41 ‎This has been a wonderful achievement,
00:01:44 ‎considering that we didn’t have any material
00:01:46 ‎translated for the school  in the Romany language.
00:01:49 ‎This meant  that the instructors and the students
00:01:51 ‎prepared in a different language,
00:01:54 ‎but everything was presented in Romany.
00:02:00 ‎I have to get up at 4:30 a.m.
00:02:02 ‎to go to and finish my secular work
00:02:04 ‎before the school, which starts at 8:30 a.m.
00:02:07 ‎It is a little difficult for me,
00:02:10 ‎but hearing about Jehovah  and understanding more about him
00:02:14 ‎gives me renewed energy.
00:02:18 ‎I heard an example about Jesus
00:02:20 ‎and how he showed empathy  for the young children who went to see him,
00:02:24 ‎but his apostles tried to stop them.
00:02:29 ‎However, Jesus put himself  in the place of those children.
00:02:34 ‎This really helps me  to see the people in our territory
00:02:37 ‎and to put myself in their place,
00:02:40 ‎because I too once lived like them  and know how they feel.
00:02:51 ‎When we speak about spiritual things
00:02:54 ‎—things about God—
00:02:56 ‎we want to speak in our mother tongue
00:02:59 ‎because it touches our heart.
00:03:04 ‎I personally saw  how the hearts of the pioneers
00:03:08 ‎were deeply touched by having the school in their language.
00:03:15 ‎As a Roma,
00:03:17 ‎I often feel rejected by others,
00:03:19 ‎but at the school,
00:03:20 ‎it was completely the opposite.
00:03:21 ‎I was really happy that the school
00:03:23 ‎was held in our Roma neighborhood
00:03:25 ‎and that I could speak in my language.
00:03:35 ‎Who would have imagined ten years ago,
00:03:37 ‎when the preaching work
00:03:39 ‎started in the Roma neighborhood,
00:03:41 ‎that we would have a pioneer school?
00:03:45 ‎Interestingly,
00:03:47 ‎some of those who started  to study the Bible back then
00:03:51 ‎attended the school  together with their Bible teachers.
00:03:57 ‎If someone had said that this would happen,
00:04:00 ‎we would have thought,  ‘He has a vivid imagination.’
00:04:04 ‎Jehovah made this possible!

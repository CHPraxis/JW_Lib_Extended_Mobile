00:00:07.812 --> 00:00:09.854 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This was the first school

00:00:09.895 --> 00:00:12.354 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the Romany language in Bulgaria.

00:00:17.062 --> 00:00:19.645 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In recent years,

00:00:19.645 --> 00:00:21.937 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we have seen remarkable growth

00:00:21.979 --> 00:00:24.354 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the Romany field. 

00:00:24.354 --> 00:00:27.062 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎There are many Roma people 
living all over Bulgaria,

00:00:27.062 --> 00:00:30.270 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎generally in their own neighborhoods. 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.520 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The Roma came to Europe from India 
with their own languages and culture. 

00:00:35.354 --> 00:00:38.645 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Roma people are happy 
to talk to Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:00:38.645 --> 00:00:41.729 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎sensing no discrimination or prejudice. 

00:00:42.645 --> 00:00:44.062 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As a result,

00:00:44.062 --> 00:00:48.062 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Romany congregations 
and groups have been formed. 

00:00:48.062 --> 00:00:51.062 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎At the first Memorial 
held in the Romany language,

00:00:51.062 --> 00:00:54.229 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a congregation with 26 publishers 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:57.270 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎had 703 in attendance. 

00:00:59.895 --> 00:01:03.020 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In this rapidly growing field,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.062 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎half of the publishers serve as pioneers. 

00:01:07.187 --> 00:01:10.229 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Seeing the progress in this field,

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.437 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the branch wanted the pioneers 
to be trained in their mother tongue

00:01:13.437 --> 00:01:17.437 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎so that they could apply the information 
according to the needs of the territory.

00:01:18.395 --> 00:01:21.979 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This is a wonderful gift from Jehovah,

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.770 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because when we receive it 
in our own language,

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.062 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎it is embedded directly into our hearts.

00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:30.312 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I feel very happy that the school

00:01:30.312 --> 00:01:32.354 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is in the Romany language

00:01:32.354 --> 00:01:35.270 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because I can see not only Jehovah’s love

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.979 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but also how he spoils us.

00:01:41.312 --> 00:01:44.145 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This has been a wonderful achievement,

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:46.354 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎considering that we didn’t have any material

00:01:46.354 --> 00:01:49.062 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎translated for the school 
in the Romany language. 

00:01:49.062 --> 00:01:51.520 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This meant 
that the instructors and the students

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.229 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎prepared in a different language,

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.187 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but everything was presented in Romany.

00:02:00.062 --> 00:02:02.229 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I have to get up at 4:30 a.m.

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.687 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to go to and finish my secular work

00:02:04.687 --> 00:02:07.854 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎before the school,
which starts at 8:30 a.m. 

00:02:07.854 --> 00:02:10.229 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It is a little difficult for me,

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.229 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but hearing about Jehovah 
and understanding more about him

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:17.145 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎gives me renewed energy. 

00:02:18.687 --> 00:02:20.979 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I heard an example about Jesus

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:24.812 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and how he showed empathy 
for the young children who went to see him,

00:02:24.812 --> 00:02:27.812 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but his apostles tried to stop them. 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:34.104 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎However, Jesus put himself 
in the place of those children. 

00:02:34.104 --> 00:02:37.562 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This really helps me 
to see the people in our territory

00:02:37.562 --> 00:02:40.395 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and to put myself in their place,

00:02:40.395 --> 00:02:44.812 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because I too once lived like them 
and know how they feel.

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:54.604 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When we speak about spiritual things

00:02:54.604 --> 00:02:56.979 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—things about God—

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:59.312 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we want to speak in our mother tongue

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:01.895 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because it touches our heart.

00:03:04.562 --> 00:03:08.395 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I personally saw 
how the hearts of the pioneers

00:03:08.395 --> 00:03:11.645 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎were deeply touched
by having the school in their language.

00:03:15.604 --> 00:03:17.229 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As a Roma,

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:19.270 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I often feel rejected by others,

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.395 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but at the school,

00:03:20.395 --> 00:03:21.812 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎it was completely the opposite. 

00:03:21.812 --> 00:03:23.312 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I was really happy that the school 

00:03:23.312 --> 00:03:25.354 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was held in our Roma neighborhood

00:03:25.354 --> 00:03:27.395 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and that I could speak in my language.

00:03:35.354 --> 00:03:37.895 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Who would have imagined ten years ago,

00:03:37.895 --> 00:03:39.895 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when the preaching work

00:03:39.937 --> 00:03:41.937 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎started in the Roma neighborhood,

00:03:41.937 --> 00:03:45.770 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that we would have a pioneer school? 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.770 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Interestingly,

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.562 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎some of those who started 
to study the Bible back then

00:03:51.562 --> 00:03:55.812 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎attended the school 
together with their Bible teachers. 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.979 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎If someone had said that this would happen,

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:04.812 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we would have thought, 
‘He has a vivid imagination.’ 

00:04:04.812 --> 00:04:07.145 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah made this possible!

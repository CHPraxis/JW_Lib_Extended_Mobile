00:04 Growing up in the South
00:06 during the time of segregation
00:10 —blacks and whites— we couldn’t mix.
00:13 And not only that, they had signs
00:16 to keep you knowing  where you were supposed to go.
00:19 I couldn’t understand  why we couldn’t get along.
00:23 Fifty cents.
00:25 Yes, Sir.
00:27 Thank you, Sir.
00:29 Grandma, he’s just a boy.  Why are you saying “Sir”?
00:32 Be quiet.  I want you to know your place.
00:37 I told her after we got back on the truck:
00:39 “You know what?  I’ll never hold my head down!”
00:43 My grandmother  knew I had a love for the Bible
00:45 because I would  always read the Bible as a kid.
00:50 But I couldn’t understand it.
00:57 I used to pray,  “What makes us so different?”
01:01 You know,  “Why can’t we live together?”
01:07 I met a group,
01:10 and this group was like  what I really wanted to be in.
01:15 They were about politics.
01:17 They said, “We’re fighting injustice.”
01:19 And when they said  that word “injustice,” it was like,
01:22 ‘Yeah, this is what I want to be in, right?
01:26 ‘To be part of something that can change
01:28 and make people united, right?’
01:31 That was my goal.
01:34 We started protesting about police brutality,
01:37 and I think that’s what a lot of people,
01:39 you know,  were focusing on.
01:43 I liked some of the things  that they were doing,
01:46 but they trained us every,  every day in military training.
01:49 We learned how to use weapons  and stuff like that.
01:52 And so I’m thinking:
01:54 ‘This is not what I want to be in.  This is not what I joined.’
01:57 So I started going back to God again —to reading the Bible—
02:01 because it was like  I’m not changing anything.
02:04 The Bible that I was reading  was the King James Version.
02:07 So I was reading it, reading it, reading it,
02:09 but I couldn’t understand it.
02:11 We went to Jamaica,
02:13 and we saw this Bible,  the New World Translation.
02:16 And I started reading it,  and it made so much sense!
02:19 And I could understand it,  and it wasn’t “thee” and “thou.”
02:22 I was like, ‘Wow!’
02:24 You know, like,  ‘This is the one I want to get.’
02:27 One day, two women knocked on the door.
02:30 I didn’t know they were Jehovah’s Witnesses.
02:32 All I could see was that Bible.
02:35 And I said,  “Where did you get that Bible from?”
02:38 And they said,  “OK, we’ll bring you one.”
02:40 And they did.  So they brought me the Bible,
02:42 but I didn’t know I was going to have  a Bible study that came along with it.
02:47 The first time I went  to a convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
02:50 it was like ten thousand people.
02:53 When I went in there and I saw
02:55 all these different faces  and different colors,
02:58 it was like Jehovah showing me:
02:59 “Hey, Rafika, remember you were asking me
03:02 “about all different people  getting together and being one?
03:06 See, I’m not partial;  they do get along; we are unified.”
03:10 And it just made me feel so good inside.
03:13 Yes!
03:15 This is the organization  that I want to be in.
03:18 I just see people as people, you know,
03:23 and I can preach  and be friends with anybody.
03:28 Now that I know  what the Bible really teaches,
03:31 I have a wonderful life
03:33 because I know  that only God and his government
03:37 can bring about peace.
03:40 Just like how Jehovah  unified everybody,
03:42 I want everybody  to be unified
03:45 and come to know Jehovah,  just like I know him.
03:49 Jehovah answered my prayer.

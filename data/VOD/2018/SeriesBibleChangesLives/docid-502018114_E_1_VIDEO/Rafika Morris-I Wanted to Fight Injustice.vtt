00:04.775 --> 00:06.777
Growing up in the South 


00:06.777 --> 00:08.000
during the time of segregation


00:10.113 --> 00:13.991
—blacks and whites—
we couldn’t mix. 


00:13.992 --> 00:16.412
And not only that, they had signs 


00:16.412 --> 00:19.540
to keep you knowing 
where you were supposed to go. 


00:19.540 --> 00:22.000
I couldn’t understand 
why we couldn’t get along.


00:23.460 --> 00:25.462
Fifty cents.


00:25.462 --> 00:27.380
Yes, Sir. 


00:27.380 --> 00:29.508
Thank you, Sir.


00:29.508 --> 00:32.886
Grandma, he’s just a boy. 
Why are you saying “Sir”?


00:32.887 --> 00:36.000
Be quiet. 
I want you to know your place.


00:37.515 --> 00:39.560
I told her after we got back on the truck: 


00:39.560 --> 00:43.355
“You know what? 
I’ll never hold my head down!”


00:43.355 --> 00:45.440
My grandmother 
knew I had a love for the Bible 


00:45.440 --> 00:48.000
because I would 
always read the Bible as a kid. 


00:50.028 --> 00:53.000
But I couldn’t understand it.


00:57.995 --> 01:01.040
I used to pray, 
“What makes us so different?” 


01:01.040 --> 01:04.000
You know, 
“Why can’t we live together?”


01:07.588 --> 01:10.215
I met a group, 


01:10.215 --> 01:15.178
and this group was like 
what I really wanted to be in. 


01:15.178 --> 01:17.681
They were about politics. 


01:17.682 --> 01:19.892
They said, “We’re fighting injustice.” 


01:19.892 --> 01:22.979
And when they said 
that word “injustice,” it was like, 


01:22.978 --> 01:26.565
‘Yeah, this is what I want to be in, right?


01:26.565 --> 01:28.858
‘To be part of something that can change 


01:28.858 --> 01:31.278
and make people united, right?’ 


01:31.278 --> 01:34.531
That was my goal.


01:34.532 --> 01:37.284
We started protesting about police brutality, 


01:37.283 --> 01:39.870
and I think that’s what a lot of people, 


01:39.870 --> 01:42.000
you know, 
were focusing on. 


01:43.373 --> 01:46.210
I liked some of the things 
that they were doing, 


01:46.210 --> 01:49.338
but they trained us every, 
every day in military training. 


01:49.338 --> 01:52.006
We learned how to use weapons 
and stuff like that. 


01:52.007 --> 01:54.344
And so I’m thinking: 


01:54.343 --> 01:57.595
‘This is not what I want to be in. 
This is not what I joined.’


01:57.595 --> 02:01.808
So I started going back to God again
—to reading the Bible—


02:01.808 --> 02:04.478
because it was like 
I’m not changing anything. 


02:04.478 --> 02:07.563
The Bible that I was reading 
was the King James Version. 


02:07.563 --> 02:09.733
So I was reading it, reading it, reading it, 


02:09.733 --> 02:11.943
but I couldn’t understand it. 


02:11.943 --> 02:13.903
We went to Jamaica, 


02:13.903 --> 02:16.865
and we saw this Bible, 
the New World Translation. 


02:16.865 --> 02:19.535
And I started reading it, 
and it made so much sense! 


02:19.535 --> 02:22.495
And I could understand it, 
and it wasn’t “thee” and “thou.” 


02:22.495 --> 02:24.665
I was like, ‘Wow!’ 


02:24.665 --> 02:27.000
You know, like, 
‘This is the one I want to get.’


02:27.000 --> 02:30.712
One day, two women knocked on the door. 


02:30.712 --> 02:32.715
I didn’t know they were Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


02:32.715 --> 02:35.050
All I could see was that Bible. 


02:35.050 --> 02:38.095
And I said, 
“Where did you get that Bible from?” 


02:38.095 --> 02:40.347
And they said, 
“OK, we’ll bring you one.” 


02:40.347 --> 02:42.349
And they did. 
So they brought me the Bible, 


02:42.348 --> 02:46.000
but I didn’t know I was going to have 
a Bible study that came along with it.


02:47.145 --> 02:50.690
The first time I went 
to a convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


02:50.690 --> 02:53.277
it was like ten thousand people. 


02:53.277 --> 02:55.737
When I went in there and I saw 


02:55.737 --> 02:58.199
all these different faces 
and different colors, 


02:58.198 --> 02:59.991
it was like Jehovah showing me: 


02:59.992 --> 03:02.285
“Hey, Rafika, remember you were asking me 


03:02.285 --> 03:06.373
“about all different people 
getting together and being one? 


03:06.373 --> 03:10.335
See, I’m not partial; 
they do get along; we are unified.” 


03:10.335 --> 03:13.588
And it just made me feel so good inside. 


03:13.588 --> 03:15.298
Yes! 


03:15.298 --> 03:18.801
This is the organization 
that I want to be in.


03:18.802 --> 03:23.015
I just see people as people, you know, 


03:23.015 --> 03:28.937
and I can preach 
and be friends with anybody. 


03:28.937 --> 03:31.524
Now that I know 
what the Bible really teaches, 


03:31.523 --> 03:33.233
I have a wonderful life 


03:33.233 --> 03:37.946
because I know 
that only God and his government 


03:37.947 --> 03:40.782
can bring about peace.


03:40.782 --> 03:42.952
Just like how Jehovah 
unified everybody, 


03:42.952 --> 03:45.537
I want everybody 
to be unified


03:45.537 --> 03:48.000
and come to know Jehovah, 
just like I know him. 


03:49.082 --> 04:07.330
Jehovah answered my prayer.

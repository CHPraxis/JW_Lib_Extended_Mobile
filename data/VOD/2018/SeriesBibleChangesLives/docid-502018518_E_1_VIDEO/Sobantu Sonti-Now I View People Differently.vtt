‎My name is Sobantu Sonti. 

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:16.745 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I grew up in Guguletu, Cape Town,

00:00:16.745 --> 00:00:20.207 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where I serve as a congregation elder. 

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:25.796 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I love the people I associate with now,

00:00:25.796 --> 00:00:28.674 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but I wasn’t always like this. 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.637 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I had no love for people. 

00:00:33.637 --> 00:00:35.764 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I viewed them only as a way to get rich,

00:00:35.764 --> 00:00:38.309 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎by stealing their possessions.

00:00:40.436 --> 00:00:44.607 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I was a violent person, 
always on the edge of anger. 

00:00:44.607 --> 00:00:49.236 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I used drugs, and I belonged to a gang. 

00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:55.534 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We were violent thugs. 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.457 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We lived a very destructive life.

00:01:03.792 --> 00:01:05.794 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In 1989,

00:01:05.794 --> 00:01:09.381 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎my mother started associating 
with Jehovah’s Witnesses. 

00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:13.093 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I noticed her making changes in her life. 

00:01:13.093 --> 00:01:17.640 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Previously, she sold alcohol 
in the community illegally,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.017 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but then she stopped. 

00:01:20.017 --> 00:01:24.396 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So one Thursday, 
I followed her to see where she was going.

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.944 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I was touched to see a boy there 
who read the Bible really well. 

00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:34.323 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I wanted to be able to do that too. 

00:01:34.323 --> 00:01:37.326 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So after the meeting, 
I approached a brother,

00:01:37.326 --> 00:01:40.287 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and he said 
that I first needed to study the Bible. 

00:01:40.287 --> 00:01:43.666 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And that’s how we started the Bible study.

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:49.254 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I continued studying, 
but I struggled to make changes. 

00:01:51.382 --> 00:01:54.718 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I was still involved in a lot of bad things,

00:01:54.718 --> 00:01:57.262 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and this caused me to stop the study

00:01:57.262 --> 00:02:01.308 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because I knew I had to clean up my life first.

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:13.278 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎During the years that I did not study,

00:02:13.278 --> 00:02:16.198 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I never stopped thinking about the Bible. 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.456 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Isaiah 40:8 has very touching words that say:

00:02:24.456 --> 00:02:27.960 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“The green grass dries up, the blossom withers,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.755 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but the word of our God endures forever.” 

00:02:31.755 --> 00:02:34.800 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That scripture resonated with me. 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.721 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It helped me to trust in the Bible 
and made me want to read it.

00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:43.517 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The book that helped me 
to make spiritual progress

00:02:43.517 --> 00:02:45.519 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was the Revelation Climax book,

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.731 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎which Jehovah’s Witnesses 
were studying back then. 

00:02:48.731 --> 00:02:51.066 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It thoroughly explained

00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:54.194 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the Bible book of Revelation,
and that convinced me

00:02:54.194 --> 00:02:58.073 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that whoever wrote this book
could not have done it on their own,

00:02:58.907 --> 00:03:02.953 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but they must have been influenced 
by God in order to explain it so well.  

00:03:03.871 --> 00:03:06.081 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That book helped me to change my life

00:03:06.081 --> 00:03:09.209 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and to be sure that this was the truth.

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.047 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Four years had passed 
since I stopped studying. 

00:03:13.047 --> 00:03:17.051 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But in January 1995, I made a decision. 

00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:19.636 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎One Sunday, I woke up,

00:03:19.636 --> 00:03:22.973 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I got ready, and I went to the meeting.

00:03:22.973 --> 00:03:25.142 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I made rapid progress

00:03:25.142 --> 00:03:28.437 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and was baptized in September, 1995. 

00:03:28.437 --> 00:03:30.939 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And six months later,

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:34.693 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I was appointed 
as a full-time teacher of the Bible.

00:03:34.693 --> 00:03:37.696 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now I view people differently. 

00:03:37.696 --> 00:03:41.533 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I see them as people 
who deserve a better life. 

00:03:41.533 --> 00:03:45.329 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Even if a person 
appears unable to change,

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.917 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the Bible can teach a person dignity 
and change his life for the better. 

00:03:52.711 --> 00:03:55.714 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now I view people 
as those who could be

00:03:55.714 --> 00:03:59.259 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎my spiritual friends
—my brothers.

00:00:09 On behalf of the Governing Body,
00:00:11 we warmly commend you for your desire
00:00:14 to expand your service to Jehovah
00:00:16 and your interest in submitting an application
00:00:19 to serve as a temporary volunteer
00:00:21 or as a member of the Worldwide Order
00:00:24 of Special Full-Time Servants
00:00:26 of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:00:28 By making yourself available to serve in this unique way,
00:00:32 you imitate the faithful prophet Isaiah,
00:00:35 who said at Isaiah 6:8:
00:00:37 “Here I am! Send me!”
00:00:41 Submitting your application may open a door of opportunity
00:00:45 to serve Jehovah and his organization
00:00:47 in a variety of ways.
00:00:50 Of course, there’s a place for everyone in Jehovah’s service.
00:00:54 Whether we’re working hard as a congregation publisher,
00:00:58 a regular pioneer, a Bethelite,
00:01:01 or on a theocratic construction project,
00:01:04 we have the satisfaction of knowing
00:01:07 that Jehovah treasures what we’re doing
00:01:09 because of our heartfelt love for him.
00:01:12 Hebrews 6:10 says:
00:01:15 “God is not unrighteous so as to forget your work
00:01:19 “and the love you showed for his name by ministering
00:01:23 and continuing to minister to the holy ones.”
00:01:27 Before submitting an application for expanded theocratic service,
00:01:32 it’s important to consider prayerfully
00:01:35 how you’ll respond to the questions on the application.
00:01:39 Hebrews 13:18 says:
00:01:42 “We wish to conduct ourselves
00:01:45 honestly in all things.”
00:01:48 So you should be honest
00:01:49 in answering the questions on the application,
00:01:52 especially those that have to do
00:01:54 with your physical health and spiritual health.
00:01:58 The work being done at Bethel
00:02:01 and on theocratic construction projects
00:02:04 requires good physical, emotional, and mental health.
00:02:09 However, you may have a chronic health problem
00:02:13 that requires the regular attention
00:02:15 of a physician or must be treated with medication.
00:02:19 If you have a significant limitation in this way,
00:02:24 it would be better for you to continue your faithful service
00:02:27 in the field with your local congregation
00:02:30 and, if possible, in the regular pioneer service.
00:02:35 If you’re not sure whether your health situation
00:02:38 would prevent you from submitting an application,
00:02:42 the elders in your congregation can help you.
00:02:45 They can review with you the specific application questions
00:02:49 that deal with health matters
00:02:51 so that you personally may determine
00:02:53 whether or not you should apply.
00:02:56 Regardless of where we’re serving,
00:02:59 we need Jehovah’s blessing to be successful.
00:03:03 Psalm 127:1 says:
00:03:06 “Unless Jehovah builds the house,
00:03:10 “it is in vain that its builders work hard on it.
00:03:14 “Unless Jehovah guards the city,
00:03:17 it is in vain that the guard stays awake.”
00:03:21 But as the account in Joshua chapter 7 vividly testifies,
00:03:26 it’s possible for Jehovah to withhold his blessing.
00:03:30 Do you remember what happened
00:03:32 when Achan stole from the things
00:03:34 that were supposed to be dedicated to Jehovah?
00:03:37 Israel lost God’s backing.
00:03:41 Our service to Jehovah is important.
00:03:45 We cannot afford to lose Jehovah’s blessing.
00:03:48 For this reason, the spiritual qualifications
00:03:52 for expanded service are high.
00:03:56 It’s expected that all of those offering themselves to serve at Bethel
00:04:01 or in other theocratic assignments
00:04:03 have a clean conscience before Jehovah,
00:04:06 having left behind all unclean practices
00:04:10 or immoral conduct.
00:04:12 For instance, those who have viewed pornography
00:04:15 in the past year should not apply.
00:04:18 Also, if you realize
00:04:21 that you may have become involved in unclean conduct
00:04:24 with someone of the opposite sex or the same sex,
00:04:29 Jehovah very considerately explains what we should do
00:04:33 in James 5:14, 15:
00:04:37 “Is there anyone [spiritually] sick among you?
00:04:41 “Let him call the elders of the congregation to him,
00:04:45 “and let them pray over him,
00:04:47 “applying oil to him in the name of Jehovah.
00:04:51 “And the prayer of faith will make the sick one well,
00:04:54 “and Jehovah will raise him up.
00:04:57 Also, if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.”
00:05:02 How reassuring!
00:05:05 If you have a heavy conscience because of something you’ve done,
00:05:09 you should get help to strengthen your relationship with Jehovah.
00:05:14 You can later submit an application with a clean conscience,
00:05:18 confident that Jehovah will bless your efforts.
00:05:21 So don’t hesitate to speak
00:05:23 with one of the elders in your congregation if you need help.
00:05:27 They love you and want you to progress and qualify
00:05:31 for special privileges of service in Jehovah’s organization.
00:05:36 We’ve spoken frankly to you
00:05:39 because we want you to make a success
00:05:42 of your service to Jehovah.
00:05:44 We also want to reassure you
00:05:46 that your assistance is very much needed.
00:05:50 So if you enjoy good health, both spiritually and physically,
00:05:55 and want to apply for expanded theocratic service
00:05:58 on a temporary or full-time basis,
00:06:01 ask your elders for an application
00:06:04 to serve as a temporary volunteer
00:06:07 or as a member of the Worldwide Order
00:06:11 of Special Full-Time Servants
00:06:13 of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:06:15 After completing the application, return it to your elders.
00:06:20 Then continue to allow Jehovah
00:06:23 to direct your steps wherever you may serve.
00:06:26 We love you for the willing spirit you show.
00:06:30 Please be assured of our prayers in your behalf
00:06:33 as you continue to reach out in Jehovah’s service.

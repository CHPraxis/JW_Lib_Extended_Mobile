00:03 Jehovah’s Witnesses  are known around the world
00:06 for preaching  the good news of the Kingdom.
00:11 How is this work  accomplished here in Indonesia?
00:15 It is certainly a challenging assignment.
00:18 This lifesaving message needs to be brought
00:21 to over 250 million people
00:23 living on thousands of different islands.
00:26 To support this tremendous work,
00:28 the Indonesia branch office was relocated
00:31 to the 31st floor  of the Central Park building in Jakarta
00:33 in April 2014.
00:37 A number of apartments  at an adjacent apartment tower
00:40 are being used to house the Bethel family,
00:42 which has approximately 100 members
00:45 that support the work of the branch office.
00:49 Each morning they commute to this office,  ready for their work assignments.
01:00 We call this place Bethel,  which means “House of God.”
01:05 By means of this brief video presentation,
01:08 we would like to warmly welcome you  to our branch office and Bethel home
01:12 and provide you with an overview  of what is being accomplished here.
01:17 Our day always starts  with a morning worship program at 7:20 a.m.
01:23 What is being considered?
01:26 Every day  an interesting Bible verse is being read,
01:29 commented on,
01:31 and explained  so as to make its practical value
01:34 clear to the Bethel family.
01:36 After a closing prayer,
01:38 all are ready to start working.
01:42 Would you like to know  what the Bethel family is doing?
01:44 Let’s have a look at a few  of the activities being done here.
01:49 Our receptionist welcomes  our many visitors in the main lobby
01:52 and will make arrangements for tours.
01:56 Also, all incoming calls are answered here,
01:58 and some additional secretarial work  is done whenever time permits.
02:04 An ever-growing work at our branch  is related to audio and video recordings.
02:09 In addition to Indonesian language material,
02:12 in recent years we have started recording  in many indigenous languages as well.
02:17 What is being recorded?
02:20 A wide variety  of publications in audio format,
02:23 as well as convention dramas,  videos, and Web materials.
02:28 The process is very involved.
02:30 Readers and voice participants  are auditioned,
02:33 selected, and coached.
02:36 Hours are spent doing the actual recording.
02:39 Next, the material
02:41 is reviewed and edited  to achieve the best possible quality.
02:46 When satisfied, the final product  will be uploaded to jw.org
02:50 for the benefit of you  and millions of other people
02:53 all around the world.
02:56 Producing publications  in many different languages,
03:00 whether in electronic or printed format,  requires translation.
03:05 Some of this work  is done at our branch office.
03:08 The translation process can be challenging,
03:10 but it is a very important  and rewarding work.
03:14 Teams of translators work hard every day
03:17 to keep up  with the steady flow of new material.
03:20 They are trained to translate  the English text into Indonesian.
03:25 They are also provided  with various research tools.
03:31 The English text is also made  available to local language teams
03:34 located at remote translation offices,
03:37 or RTOs, throughout the country.
03:39 It is then translated  into Indonesian Sign Language
03:42 and many other local languages.
03:45 This entire translation process
03:47 can take weeks or even months to complete,
03:50 and even then the work is not yet done.
03:53 What’s next?
03:55 The translated text is now ready  for the composition process,
03:59 where a print-ready file is created.
04:02 Most of our publications are printed
04:04 at the Japan branch office  of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
04:09 Cleanliness is also observed  in the Bethel residences and offices.
04:13 Each Bethel family member  is responsible for cleaning their own room.
04:19 Housekeepers assist the family by cleaning  each residence room once a month.
04:27 Besides the kitchen and laundry operations,
04:30 the Bethel Office is responsible  for organizing spiritual programs
04:33 and for the overall management  of all branch office properties.
04:43 Back at the office,  more work is being accomplished.
04:46 Hundreds of letters  and reports from the field
04:48 are received on a weekly basis.
04:50 Where is this correspondence handled?
04:53 Here in the Service Department,
04:55 they are responsible to communicate with
04:57 and direct the activities in the field.
04:59 They also handle the organizing  of various Bible schools,
05:02 conventions, assemblies,
05:04 and approve the formation  of new congregations and groups.
05:09 Interest shown in our Bible educational work  is followed up carefully.
05:13 When someone requests  a visit from Jehovah’s Witnesses
05:16 by filling out the form  on the jw.org website,
05:18 brothers locate  the nearest congregation and inform them
05:22 in order to send someone  as soon as possible.
05:31 All this work  would be much harder to accomplish
05:33 without the use of technology.
05:35 Therefore,  a vital part of our operation here
05:38 is the Computer Department.
05:41 Existing systems  need to be maintained and upgraded.
05:44 New equipment is bought and installed  not only at the branch office
05:48 but also at satellite locations  and remote translation offices.
05:53 As a result of the good news being preached,
05:55 there is a growing need  for more dignified places of worship.
05:59 The building of such Kingdom Halls
06:01 is organized  by the Local Design/Construction Department.
06:04 Along with new construction, the LDC is responsible for overseeing
06:08 the renovation and maintenance  of existing Kingdom Halls
06:11 as well as maintenance training.
06:14 In addition to Kingdom Hall upkeep,
06:16 this department is involved  with searching for properties
06:18 to be used as RTOs or missionary homes.
06:24 Operating our branch office facilities  requires a constant supply of various items.
06:29 The Purchasing Department  cares for this responsibility
06:32 by managing vendor accounts  and receiving shipments.
06:35 These goods are then processed
06:37 and sent to the branch facilities  where they are needed.
06:42 Some activities need to be handled  administratively and legally.
06:47 Who is doing this?
06:49 The Governing Body  appoints a Branch Committee,
06:51 who in turn receives  the support of office personnel
06:55 to see to it that guidelines and instructions
06:57 are being implemented appropriately  and in a timely manner.
07:02 This includes giving attention to those  in need when natural disasters strike.
07:07 The Legal Department  makes sure that all legal requirements
07:09 are being fulfilled.
07:15 As you have just seen,  much is being accomplished here at Bethel.
07:18 And amazingly,  all of this is being accomplished
07:20 by volunteers  who have dedicated themselves fully
07:24 to support the Kingdom  preaching work here in Indonesia.
07:27 We thank you for your visit
07:29 and sincerely hope  you will enjoy touring our branch office.

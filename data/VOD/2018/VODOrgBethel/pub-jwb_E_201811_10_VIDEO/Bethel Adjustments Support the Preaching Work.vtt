‎During the 2015 annual meeting,

00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:07.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎an announcement 
‎was given that would affect

00:00:07.736 --> 00:00:10.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Bethels around the world.

00:00:10.614 --> 00:00:12.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The Governing Body has directed

00:00:12.741 --> 00:00:15.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that a number of our branch

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and Assembly Hall 
‎construction projects worldwide

00:00:19.206 --> 00:00:23.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎be delayed, reduced in scope,

00:00:23.043 --> 00:00:26.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎or in some cases cancelled.

00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:28.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The Governing Body

00:00:28.048 --> 00:00:29.675 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎had two clear objectives

00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:31.677 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎in mind with these changes:

00:00:31.677 --> 00:00:34.513 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎Firstly, that of making the best use

00:00:34.513 --> 00:00:36.140 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎of dedicated funds

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but ultimately 
‎giving even greater emphasis

00:00:39.143 --> 00:00:41.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to the preaching 
‎and the teaching work.

00:00:41.562 --> 00:00:43.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎In fact, here in Britain,

00:00:43.397 --> 00:00:44.648 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎we were on the brink

00:00:44.648 --> 00:00:46.317 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎of starting construction

00:00:46.317 --> 00:00:47.693 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎on a new branch office,

00:00:47.693 --> 00:00:49.111 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎and we really wondered

00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:50.654 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎how these simplifications

00:00:50.654 --> 00:00:53.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎would affect 
‎the construction project.

00:00:53.198 --> 00:00:55.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎To understand 
‎why these changes were important,

00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:59.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎we first need to take a look
‎at how Bethels function.

00:00:59.955 --> 00:01:02.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The field ministry 
‎is a fundamental part

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:05.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of our worship to Jehovah.

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:07.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Bethels are there to support that work.

00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:09.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Bethels’ key departments

00:01:09.173 --> 00:01:11.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎provide tools and training needed

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to carry out the preaching work

00:01:13.302 --> 00:01:16.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and support and defend
‎our rights to do so. 

00:01:16.013 --> 00:01:17.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Some of these departments

00:01:17.973 --> 00:01:20.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎are Service, Audio/Video,

00:01:20.351 --> 00:01:22.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Local/Design Construction,

00:01:22.478 --> 00:01:24.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Translation, and Legal,

00:01:24.897 --> 00:01:26.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to mention a few.

00:01:26.523 --> 00:01:28.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎In turn, none of these could function

00:01:28.525 --> 00:01:30.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎without the support of departments

00:01:30.527 --> 00:01:33.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎such as Purchasing, Accounting,

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Computers, 
‎Maintenance, and Kitchen

00:01:36.867 --> 00:01:39.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and Home Departments,
‎which care for the welfare

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of the many volunteers working at Bethel.

00:01:42.456 --> 00:01:45.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So any simplification made to Bethel

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:49.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎would ultimately benefit the activity in the field.

00:01:50.798 --> 00:01:53.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Branch Committees around the world

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎were asked to reduce the size

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎of their Bethel families.

00:01:57.054 --> 00:01:59.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Now, this required us to rethink

00:01:59.348 --> 00:02:02.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the way we work 
‎and the way we live at Bethel.

00:02:03.102 --> 00:02:06.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Simplified meal arrangements
‎has meant that Bethelites

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎now prepare some of their own meals.

00:02:09.316 --> 00:02:12.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Likewise, in many branches
‎they are responsible

00:02:12.528 --> 00:02:14.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎for caring for their own laundry.

00:02:14.655 --> 00:02:19.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎They now 
‎also look after their own housekeeping.

00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:23.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Many more commuters
‎and remote volunteers

00:02:23.247 --> 00:02:24.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎are being used to carry out work

00:02:24.581 --> 00:02:27.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that previously would have required
‎a permanent Bethelite. 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎These and other changes

00:02:29.712 --> 00:02:32.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎have resulted 
‎in making better use of donated funds

00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:36.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎but are ultimately benefiting
‎the preaching work.

00:02:36.218 --> 00:02:39.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The Bethel family 
‎has really responded very well

00:02:39.263 --> 00:02:40.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to these changes,

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:42.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and we can see 
‎how the direction given to us

00:02:42.808 --> 00:02:44.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎from the Governing Body

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎is really benefiting 
‎our brothers and sisters in the field.

00:02:48.063 --> 00:02:50.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎And those 
‎who’ve been reassigned to the field

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:53.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎are doing really well 
‎in their assignments.

00:02:53.318 --> 00:02:55.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎So how did this announcement

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎affect the branch relocation project
‎underway in Britain?

00:02:59.033 --> 00:03:01.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎When the announcement was made in 2015,

00:03:01.326 --> 00:03:03.787 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎plans were very well advanced.

00:03:03.787 --> 00:03:05.372 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎This meant that we needed

00:03:05.372 --> 00:03:07.207 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‎to put the project on hold

00:03:07.291 --> 00:03:10.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎while new requirements 
‎for Bethel were evaluated.

00:03:10.085 --> 00:03:12.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎This effectively led to a redesign

00:03:12.963 --> 00:03:15.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and a reduction 
‎in the scope of the project.

00:03:15.215 --> 00:03:16.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎For example,

00:03:16.675 --> 00:03:18.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎the Bethel kitchen and dining spaces

00:03:18.844 --> 00:03:20.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎became more compact,

00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:22.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎as they were now largely preparing food

00:03:22.473 --> 00:03:25.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎for only one meal a day rather than three.

00:03:25.726 --> 00:03:27.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎There was no need for a central laundry,

00:03:27.186 --> 00:03:29.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎as this would be cared for by the individuals

00:03:29.188 --> 00:03:32.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎in their own private accommodations.

00:03:33.192 --> 00:03:36.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Rather than a large dining room
‎that’s only used for one hour a day

00:03:36.403 --> 00:03:39.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎or an auditorium 
‎only used one hour a week,

00:03:39.573 --> 00:03:42.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎now a large multipurpose event space

00:03:42.618 --> 00:03:47.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎was planned 
‎which could be flexibly reconfigured

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:49.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎for various uses.

00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:52.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Offices could also be reconfigured,

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:54.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎either as private offices

00:03:54.421 --> 00:03:57.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎or as large open work spaces

00:03:57.341 --> 00:04:01.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎with relatively little reconstruction required.

00:04:01.136 --> 00:04:03.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎The Governing Body was very clear

00:04:03.222 --> 00:04:06.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that as adaptive needs 
‎of the organization came about,

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:09.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎they wanted 
‎to make these changes quickly.

00:04:09.978 --> 00:04:12.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We trust that the lessons learned

00:04:12.648 --> 00:04:14.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎from our project may aid

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎in other branch projects to follow.

00:04:17.194 --> 00:04:21.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎In summary, we can see
‎that Bethels around the world

00:04:21.198 --> 00:04:23.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎support the preaching and teaching work,

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and these changes are evidence of that.

00:04:28.413 --> 00:04:32.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎Well, at Philippians 1:10, we’re told 

00:04:33.502 --> 00:04:36.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to “make sure
‎of the more important things.” 

00:04:36.922 --> 00:04:39.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎We desire to give priority to those activities

00:04:39.925 --> 00:04:42.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎that contribute the most

00:04:42.136 --> 00:04:45.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎to the spiritual welfare of God’s people

00:04:45.722 --> 00:04:49.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‎and the advancement 
‎of the global preaching work.

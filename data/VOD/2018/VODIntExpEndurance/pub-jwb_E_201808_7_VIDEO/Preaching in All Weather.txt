00:13 ‎‪The Faroe Islands are  also called the Land of Maybe.‏
00:17 ‎‪The weather is very diverse and can rapidly change.‏
00:23 ‎‪So when you begin in the ministry, the weather can be sunny.‏
00:26 ‎‪And then ten minutes later, you find yourself‏
00:28 ‎‪in a massive rain shower and everything gets wet.‏
00:32 ‎‪Wind is another challenge.‏
00:34 ‎‪We have some severe winter storms.‏
00:36 ‎‪So you have to be careful that your service partner or the car door‏
00:40 ‎‪doesn’t blow away while you’re getting out of the car.‏
00:46 ‎‪We make sure to wear clothes appropriate for the weather.‏
00:50 ‎‪And also to stay updated on the weather situation‏
00:54 ‎‪and see where in our territory the weather is most suitable, and then adapt.‏
01:00 ‎‪If the weather is nice, then we try to go from house to house.‏
01:03 ‎‪And if the weather is bad,‏
01:05 ‎‪then you can go on calls where you can go inside,‏
01:08 ‎‪meaning where they will invite you in‏
01:10 ‎‪or where the entrance is covered.‏
01:14 ‎‪And you can plan your ministry so that if the weather gets bad,‏
01:16 ‎‪you can make visits that you know will be at home that time of day.‏
01:21 ‎‪When the weather is poor, it’s good to adjust.‏
01:24 ‎‪Maybe you can do some telephone witnessing or letter writing.‏
01:28 ‎‪At a meeting for pioneers,‏
01:30 ‎‪an elder reminded us that when the weather is bad,‏
01:33 ‎‪try not to think: ‘The weather is bad again,’‏
01:36 ‎‪but instead, ‘Yay! Now people are actually at home.’‏
01:42 ‎‪It is a good idea to have a plan for whom you’d like to visit‏
01:45 ‎‪and what you’d like to talk to them about‏
01:48 ‎‪because then when it rains or the weather isn’t ideal,‏
01:51 ‎‪you focus on your plan‏
01:52 ‎‪instead of thinking that now I have been out preaching‏
01:55 ‎‪for five hours in stormy weather.‏
01:58 ‎‪I think Ecclesiastes 11:4 applies quite well to our territory:‏
02:03 ‎‪“The one who watches the wind will not sow seed,‏
02:07 ‎‪and the one who looks at the clouds will not reap.”‏
02:11 ‎‪If we have to wait for the perfect weather conditions to preach,‏
02:15 ‎‪then we wouldn’t be out that often.‏
02:17 ‎‪Something else that helps us to endure bad weather‏
02:20 ‎‪is to think of the first publishers in the Faroe Islands.‏
02:24 ‎‪They fought with seasickness, bad weather,‏
02:26 ‎‪and they had to hike over the mountains  to visit remote settlements.‏
02:30 ‎‪They overcame these obstacles,‏
02:32 ‎‪and it motivates me to overcome the challenges I am facing today.‏
02:37 ‎‪I remember when we came to the Faroe Islands,‏
02:39 ‎‪I looked out the window  and thought,‘Is it even possible‏
02:43 ‎‪to go out in the ministry in this kind of weather?’‏
02:45 ‎‪And then we arrived at the meeting for field service,‏
02:48 ‎‪and the friends with children and strollers were there‏
02:51 ‎‪and were positive and ready for field service.‏
02:54 ‎‪It made me think that if they can do it, then I can too.‏
03:00 ‎‪So we are a team of publishers, and we have the weather as our challenge.‏
03:04 ‎‪And especially when the weather is bad, we encourage one another.‏
03:10 ‎‪We really like the song “The Life of a Pioneer.”‏
03:14 ‎‪It’s an amazing song.‏
03:16 ‎‪It says: “In the work we endure, whether sunshine or rain.”‏
03:20 ‎‪It’s because we love Jehovah.‏
03:24 ‎‪We really want people to get to know Jehovah.‏
03:27 ‎‪They need to know the truth.‏
03:30 ‎‪When Jesus said that we should preach,‏
03:33 ‎‪I think that he  also would have put on a raincoat‏
03:35 ‎‪and gone out to preach the good news.‏
03:39 ‎‪We experience how Jehovah blesses our efforts when we go in the ministry.‏
03:43 ‎‪And you especially feel it when you persist in your efforts‏
03:46 ‎‪to preach when the weather isn’t good.‏
03:48 ‎‪It may be that one day you have a really nice conversation‏
03:52 ‎‪with a person about the Bible.‏
03:55 ‎‪I also feel it gives me great joy.‏
03:57 ‎‪Paul said that the one who “sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.”‏
04:02 ‎‪So if you want to sow bountifully  in the Faroe Islands,‏
04:05 ‎‪you need to preach also when the weather is bad.‏
04:08 ‎‪And we feel that we have reaped bountifully‏
04:10 ‎‪with nice return visits and Bible studies.‏
04:13 ‎‪I feel it’s worth all the effort‏
04:15 ‎‪because we see that people in the territory‏
04:18 ‎‪really appreciate what they are learning.‏
04:20 ‎‪All that we do in our ministry‏
04:22 ‎‪is motivated by love for Jehovah‏
04:25 ‎‪and the people in the territory, and it won’t be changed by bad weather.‏
04:30 ‎‪It’s an opportunity to show that our worship is wholehearted.‏
04:34 ‎‪You don’t just go in the ministry when everything is good‏
04:36 ‎‪and the sun is shining.‏
04:40 ‎‪I think we have become more enduring‏
04:43 ‎‪and flexible in our ministry.‏

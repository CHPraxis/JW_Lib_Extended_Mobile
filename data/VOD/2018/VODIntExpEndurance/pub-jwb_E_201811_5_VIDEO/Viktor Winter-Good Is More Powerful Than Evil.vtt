00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.739 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎On July 24, 1958,

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:15.077 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I got baptized; 
and on November 5, 1958, 

00:00:15.077 --> 00:00:20.082 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I already got arrested 
for refusal to do military service.

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:23.836 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The second time I was convicted was again 

00:00:23.836 --> 00:00:27.047 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎for refusal to do military service.

00:00:27.047 --> 00:00:30.467 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The next court trial took place in 1963.

00:00:31.343 --> 00:00:35.347 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I got seven years
​—⁠and five years exile. 

00:00:35.347 --> 00:00:37.600 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They added three years  

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.812 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that I did not serve 
for refusal to go to the army.

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:46.984 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I was taken to Mordovia.

00:00:46.984 --> 00:00:50.279 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This was the first camp 
where all believers were put, 

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:53.949 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎amongst them 360 of Jehovah’s Witnesses. 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.202 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The detentions were very strict 

00:00:57.202 --> 00:00:59.204 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because around this time the governments 

00:00:59.204 --> 00:01:01.457 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and party politics changed. 

00:01:01.457 --> 00:01:05.044 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They decided that prisoners must suffer hunger.

00:01:08.172 --> 00:01:11.216 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The food rations were cut. 

00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:16.013 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This was very difficult, very difficult, I must say.

00:01:16.013 --> 00:01:18.557 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And the winters can be cold. 

00:01:18.557 --> 00:01:20.809 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Even in March, it could get as cold 

00:01:20.809 --> 00:01:24.939 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as 35 degrees Celsius
​—⁠minus 35 (-31°F).

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.903 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Spiritual things were for all of us

00:01:30.903 --> 00:01:34.949 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎​—⁠the brothers in this camp​—
⁠top priority. 

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:38.410 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎First of all, all 360 people 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.038 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎were divided into four congregations, 

00:01:41.038 --> 00:01:44.333 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and every congregation was divided into groups. 

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:47.795 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Every congregation 
had responsible brothers as overseers

00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:50.172 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and so had every group. 

00:01:50.172 --> 00:01:53.175 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We conducted the study not just once a week, 

00:01:53.175 --> 00:01:55.928 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but we conducted the study every day, 

00:01:55.928 --> 00:01:58.305 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎every day. 

00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:00.808 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And brothers took this very seriously. 

00:02:00.808 --> 00:02:05.187 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We had no time for any worldly thoughts.

00:02:05.187 --> 00:02:07.523 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Every Saturday and Sunday, 

00:02:07.523 --> 00:02:11.485 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we had a very powerful choir​
—⁠men’s voices. 

00:02:11.485 --> 00:02:15.030 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When we were singing, 
we stationed guards 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.493 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎near the oversight house 
where supervisors were on duty. 

00:02:19.493 --> 00:02:23.205 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And if one of them came out, 
it was signaled 

00:02:23.205 --> 00:02:28.085 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from one brother to the next 
so that if he or they came closer, 

00:02:28.085 --> 00:02:30.462 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we would already be gone. 

00:02:30.462 --> 00:02:33.132 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But the most interesting thing 

00:02:33.132 --> 00:02:36.385 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was that we were singing in the zone. 

00:02:36.385 --> 00:02:38.762 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We were the prisoners, 

00:02:38.762 --> 00:02:41.348 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but our listeners were outside. 

00:02:41.348 --> 00:02:43.809 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They were sitting up in the trees

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:46.687 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎​—⁠the children of the supervisors, 

00:02:46.687 --> 00:02:48.772 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎officers, and guards. 

00:02:48.772 --> 00:02:52.818 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And they were listening to our choir.

00:02:52.818 --> 00:02:55.404 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎All together during that time, 

00:02:55.404 --> 00:02:58.073 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I was in seven prison camps. 

00:02:58.073 --> 00:03:00.868 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I spent about 13 years there 

00:03:00.868 --> 00:03:04.204 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and another 5 years in exile in Siberia.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.960 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But when I was convicted the last time, 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.714 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the head of the interrogation department 
came into my cell and said, 

00:03:13.714 --> 00:03:17.009 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Viktor, when you finish all your prison terms, 

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:20.721 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎you will have nothing at all​
—⁠no family, no children.” 

00:03:20.721 --> 00:03:23.223 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I smiled at him and asked: 

00:03:23.223 --> 00:03:26.143 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“How do you know this, 
Citizen Lieutenant Colonel? 

00:03:26.143 --> 00:03:30.522 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I don’t know it either, 
but I do trust in Jehovah.”

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:34.777 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Today, I do have a family 

00:03:34.777 --> 00:03:38.280 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and do have my wife and my children. 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.742 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We continue to serve Jehovah. 

00:03:41.742 --> 00:03:43.827 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And my greatest joy 

00:03:43.827 --> 00:03:46.705 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is when my six-year-old granddaughter 

00:03:46.705 --> 00:03:49.416 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎stands next to me in the Kingdom Hall 

00:03:49.416 --> 00:03:52.753 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and sings songs that praise Jehovah.

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:58.217 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, to make it simple, 
I would put it this way: 

00:03:58.217 --> 00:04:02.721 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Preserve your love 
for Jehovah and for your brothers. 

00:04:02.721 --> 00:04:07.559 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Joy in Jehovah’s service
​—⁠never lose it!

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:10.312 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We will not fear anything bad

00:04:10.312 --> 00:04:13.357 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎​—⁠neither cold nor hunger​—⁠

00:04:13.357 --> 00:04:17.361 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎nothing.

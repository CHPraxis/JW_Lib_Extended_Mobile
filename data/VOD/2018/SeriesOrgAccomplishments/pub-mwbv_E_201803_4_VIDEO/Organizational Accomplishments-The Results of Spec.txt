00:00:10 In the first century,
00:00:12 the apostle Paul received a vision
00:00:14 in which he was invited to “step over into Macedonia.”
00:00:19 Paul and his traveling companions eagerly accepted the invitation,
00:00:24 and they enjoyed Jehovah’s rich blessing
00:00:27 as evidenced in the positive results they experienced in their ministry.
00:00:32 Today, the Service Committee is as eager
00:00:35 to follow the lead of the holy spirit
00:00:37 as Paul was in the first century.
00:00:40 There are still many parts of the world
00:00:42 where branches need publishers
00:00:44 to “step over” and help them give a thorough witness.
00:00:48 To meet the need, the Service Committee has arranged for such branches
00:00:52 to receive assistance by means of special preaching campaigns.
00:00:57 Local publishers
00:00:59 and exemplary brothers and sisters
00:01:01 from other lands are invited to participate.
00:01:05 Often, such publishers who respond to the initial invitation,
00:01:10 later decide to move to these areas of need.
00:01:14 In recent years, special preaching campaigns
00:01:17 have been held in Africa, Asia,
00:01:20 Europe, and South America.
00:01:23 What have been some of the results of such special preaching campaigns?
00:01:29 In the recent past,
00:01:31 more than a million Arabic-speaking refugees
00:01:35 have fled to Europe.
00:01:37 The Service Committee arranged for the Central Europe branch
00:01:41 to hold a special preaching campaign to reach these refugees.
00:01:46 More than 600 publishers
00:01:48 from different parts  of the world participated,
00:01:51 and they distributed some 30,000 pieces of literature.
00:01:55 Many of the refugees have been very receptive to the good news,
00:01:59 even approaching publishers at the literature carts and asking:
00:02:04 “Can you help us? What does the Bible actually teach?”
00:02:10 This special campaign concluded
00:02:13 with an Arabic-language regional convention,
00:02:15 which was a milestone for the Arabic field.
00:02:18 Over 1,600 attended
00:02:22 from 43 different countries.
00:02:24 Approximately 25 percent of those in attendance
00:02:27 were interested persons.
00:02:31 Outstanding campaigns have also been held in Bulgaria.
00:02:34 In 2009,
00:02:36 Bulgaria reported a publisher-to-population ratio
00:02:40 of 1 to 4,600.
00:02:44 Since then, four special preaching campaigns have been held there
00:02:48 and 1,782 publishers
00:02:52 from countries throughout Europe participated.
00:02:55 They placed over 175,000 pieces of literature,
00:03:01 started 1,775 Bible studies,
00:03:05 and 8 congregations and 7 groups have been formed.
00:03:10 Consider one example:
00:03:12 Before 2010,
00:03:14 there were no Witnesses in the village of Karlovo.
00:03:18 That year a special preaching campaign was organized.
00:03:22 As a result, a man named Gosho was contacted.
00:03:27 From his own reading of the Bible,
00:03:29 he realized that the local churches do not teach the truth.
00:03:33 So he stopped attending church services
00:03:36 but never stopped praying.
00:03:38 During the campaign, he met Jehovah’s Witnesses on the street.
00:03:42 They wanted to talk with him about the Bible,
00:03:46 but he interrupted them and asked,
00:03:49 “Do you believe that Jesus is equal to God?”
00:03:54 The brothers answered, “No.”
00:03:57 “Do you believe that God is a trinity?
00:04:00 Do you collect a tithe?”
00:04:02 The brothers again answered, “No.”
00:04:05 “Then you are welcome in my home,” said Gosho.
00:04:09 Immediately, a Bible study was started
00:04:12 with him and his wife, Ivanka,
00:04:14 and their son, Bogomil.
00:04:16 Both Ivanka and Bogomil
00:04:19 are now baptized.
00:04:23 Senegal has a vast untouched territory.
00:04:27 In 2015,
00:04:30 the country’s publisher-to-population ratio
00:04:33 was 1 to more than 12,000.
00:04:36 In recent years, the Service Committee arranged
00:04:40 for three special preaching campaigns in Senegal.
00:04:43 One sister from Portugal asked a householder
00:04:46 if she believed that God had the power to resurrect the dead.
00:04:51 In a ridiculing way, the woman replied:
00:04:54 “You mean my dead husband
00:04:56 “who’s been dead a long time will come out of the grave?
00:05:00 Is this what you are telling me?”
00:05:02 The sister answered:
00:05:05 “That is what God has promised to do.
00:05:08 He will resurrect him alive in the flesh.”
00:05:12 Seeing that the sister was serious, the woman asked,
00:05:16 “Is it really possible?”
00:05:18 The sister answered,  “It is written in God’s Word.”
00:05:23 With great joy,
00:05:25 the woman started to dance.
00:05:27 The sister highlighted information on the resurrection
00:05:30 in the Listen to God  brochure.
00:05:32 Again, the woman started dancing with joy.
00:05:39 In Romania, there are some four and a half million people
00:05:43 who live in unassigned territories.
00:05:46 During a two-month campaign,
00:05:48 publishers covered 1,359 localities
00:05:53 with a population of 1.8 million.
00:05:56 The publishers started more than 1,000 Bible studies.
00:06:00 Here is just one experience:
00:06:03 Costel and Luminitza were very active in their Orthodox religion.
00:06:08 However, Luminitza could not find answers
00:06:11 to her Bible questions,
00:06:13 and Costel saw much hypocrisy with the priests.
00:06:16 Luminitza heard about Jehovah’s Witnesses from her neighbor
00:06:20 who studied the Bible by telephone with a Witness relative.
00:06:24 During the special campaign,
00:06:26 two brothers knocked on the couple’s door.
00:06:29 Luminitza was happy
00:06:31 that Jehovah’s Witnesses had finally come to preach in her village.
00:06:35 She immediately accepted a Bible study.
00:06:38 Eventually, Costel and their two teenage children
00:06:42 joined in the study.
00:06:44 The family immediately put into practice what they learned from the Bible.
00:06:48 After the family learned on their own
00:06:51 that Witnesses do not celebrate birthdays,
00:06:54 they told their study conductors:
00:06:56 “We don’t want to keep sinning against Jehovah.
00:07:00 “How many other things are we doing that Jehovah hates?
00:07:03 Tell us everything that we are doing wrong so that we can stop!”
00:07:08 In seven months,
00:07:10 the entire family began preaching with the congregation.
00:07:14 After one month of sharing in the ministry,
00:07:17 they had started three Bible studies in the village.
00:07:21 One year after their first contact with Jehovah’s Witnesses,
00:07:25 Costel and Luminitza were baptized
00:07:29 at their first regional convention.
00:07:31 Now Costel is a ministerial servant,
00:07:34 and both children are progressing very well spiritually.
00:07:39 Have you ever shared in preaching in seldom-worked or unassigned territories?
00:07:44 Such concerted efforts have yielded
00:07:47 great success in many countries.
00:07:49 For example,
00:07:51 the Brazil branch invited publishers throughout the branch territory
00:07:55 to participate in a preaching effort
00:07:58 that focused on the thousands living along the Amazon River.
00:08:03 More than 10,000 local brothers and sisters gave their support.
00:08:08 In one congregation’s territory,
00:08:11 some 400 people requested a Bible study.
00:08:15 Many of those who participated in the preaching effort
00:08:18 described it as “a life-changing experience,”
00:08:22 and some decided to move to the Amazon region.
00:08:27 In December 2015,
00:08:29 5 congregations in this region had a total
00:08:33 of 6 elders, 2 ministerial servants,
00:08:36 9 regular pioneers, and 50 publishers.
00:08:42 By July 2016,
00:08:44 those numbers had increased tremendously.
00:08:47 In those 5 congregations, the 6 elders
00:08:50 increased to 22,
00:08:53 the 2 ministerial servants increased to 17,
00:08:57 the 9 regular pioneers became 80,
00:09:00 and the 50 publishers grew to 177.
00:09:05 In total, over 865 publishers from Brazil
00:09:10 permanently ‘stepped over’ into the Amazon region,
00:09:14 and 7 new congregations were formed.
00:09:19 It’s clear that Jehovah is richly blessing such preaching efforts.
00:09:24 Reports such as this,
00:09:26 strengthen our resolve to do all that our circumstances allow
00:09:31 to reach as many as possible with the good news.

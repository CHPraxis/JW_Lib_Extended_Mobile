00:01.317 --> 00:04.587
When we’re faced 
with challenging assignments,

00:04.587 --> 00:09.159
reliance on Jehovah is of utmost importance.

00:09.159 --> 00:12.862
In what ways can we show that reliance?

00:12.862 --> 00:16.466
I have the pleasure of introducing you 
to a friend of mine,

00:16.466 --> 00:20.870
Shane Brady, who is presently serving 
along with his wife, Iolanda,

00:20.870 --> 00:23.039
at the branch in Finland.

00:23.039 --> 00:25.709
Brother Shane Brady and I 
previously worked together

00:25.709 --> 00:27.577
at the Canada branch.

00:27.577 --> 00:31.081
Shane has been involved 
in legally defending our brothers

00:31.081 --> 00:34.784
for the past 22 years in many countries,

00:34.784 --> 00:39.189
including Armenia, Kazakhstan, 
and Kyrgyzstan.

00:40.290 --> 00:43.626
Shane, it’s good to see you. 
How are you doing?

00:43.626 --> 00:46.196
I’m doing very well. 
It’s great to see you too, Mark.

00:46.196 --> 00:47.797
Shane, we want to ask you,

00:47.797 --> 00:49.966
What have been some of the challenges

00:49.966 --> 00:52.635
that you’ve faced 
in accepting these assignments

00:52.635 --> 00:54.771
in various countries in the world?

00:54.771 --> 00:58.141
Well, there certainly have been 
a few challenges.

00:58.141 --> 01:00.243
One is frequent travel.

01:00.243 --> 01:02.245
Another is language;

01:02.245 --> 01:05.448
each country that we assist 
has its own language.

01:05.448 --> 01:08.785
Some court cases are very stressful,

01:08.785 --> 01:11.721
and at times, we’ve faced firsthand

01:11.721 --> 01:13.857
the hatred of our opposers.

01:15.725 --> 01:18.261
Yes. And you know, Shane, 
in spite of all that,

01:18.261 --> 01:21.798
you and your wife have always been willing 
to go on these assignments.

01:21.798 --> 01:24.300
We appreciate your spirit so much.

01:24.300 --> 01:27.971
Is there an experience 
that you can share with us

01:27.971 --> 01:30.974
that would give us a taste 
of the kinds of situations

01:30.974 --> 01:33.243
that you’ve had to deal with 
in these countries?

01:33.243 --> 01:35.445
Well, there have been many experiences.

01:35.445 --> 01:37.447
But one experience comes to mind.

01:37.447 --> 01:40.583
A few months ago, 
there was a special pioneer,

01:40.583 --> 01:42.585
and a case was started against him.

01:42.585 --> 01:46.656
And if the decision was negative, 
it could have had very serious consequences

01:46.656 --> 01:48.658
for our work in that country.

01:48.658 --> 01:52.028
So we did our best 
to present a strong defense.

01:52.028 --> 01:53.897
But as the trial progressed,

01:53.897 --> 01:57.033
things didn’t seem to be going so well.

01:57.033 --> 02:00.637
But on the last day of the trial, 
everything changed.

02:00.637 --> 02:02.806
We presented a motion,

02:02.806 --> 02:06.142
and we asked the judge 
to terminate the case against the brother.

02:06.142 --> 02:08.812
Personally, I didn’t think 
it would actually work.

02:08.812 --> 02:11.047
But one older brother who we’ve worked with

02:11.047 --> 02:12.682
over the years always told us,

02:12.682 --> 02:14.951
“We need to give Jehovah something to bless.”

02:14.951 --> 02:19.956
And so we did, and the results 
were quite unexpected.

02:19.956 --> 02:23.226
When we made the motion, the judge turned 
to the prosecutor and asked,

02:23.226 --> 02:24.961
“Well, what’s your opinion?”

02:24.961 --> 02:28.398
And to our surprise, 
the prosecutor agreed with our request,

02:28.398 --> 02:30.466
and he even went beyond what we asked.

02:30.466 --> 02:33.269
He said to the judge 
that the government official

02:33.269 --> 02:36.472
that started the case 
against our brother should be punished.

02:36.472 --> 02:40.276
Well, the judge agreed; 
the case was terminated.

02:40.276 --> 02:42.679
When we were walking out of the courtroom,

02:42.679 --> 02:45.548
I looked at the other brothers with me 
and we all said the same thing,

02:45.548 --> 02:47.317
“What happened?”

02:47.317 --> 02:49.719
It was obvious
—Jehovah had intervened.

02:49.719 --> 02:52.088
That’s wonderful, Shane.

02:52.088 --> 02:54.657
I wish we had more time 
to hear many more experiences.

02:54.657 --> 02:57.227
But could you just share 
at least one more with us?

02:57.227 --> 02:58.995
Sure.

02:58.995 --> 03:03.099
In another land where our work 
is not recognized,

03:03.099 --> 03:06.436
on the night of the Memorial,
a number of the brothers were arrested

03:06.436 --> 03:09.672
for so-called illegal religious activity.

03:09.672 --> 03:11.674
They were all convicted at trial.

03:11.674 --> 03:14.911
So arrangements were made 
to appeal each of those cases,

03:14.911 --> 03:18.514
and they were heard 
before a different appeal court judge.

03:18.514 --> 03:22.852
What at first seemed quite negative, 
the loss at trial,

03:22.852 --> 03:25.288
turned out to be an amazing result.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.557
Let me give you just one example.

03:27.557 --> 03:30.627
In one of the appeals, 
as we were presenting the appeal,

03:30.627 --> 03:34.664
not long into the case, 
the appeal court judge stopped us,

03:34.664 --> 03:38.701
and he began to ask us 
many questions about the Bible

03:38.701 --> 03:40.803
and about what Jehovah’s Witnesses believe.

03:40.803 --> 03:44.207
So for quite some time, 
we answered these Biblical questions,

03:44.207 --> 03:46.209
and then the case continued.

03:46.209 --> 03:49.279
And then after some minutes, 
the judge stopped us again.

03:49.279 --> 03:52.749
And this time the judge said, 
“I remember reading in the Bible”—

03:52.749 --> 03:55.818
The judge said this, 
“I remember reading in the Bible

03:55.818 --> 03:59.188
“that Jesus said: 
‘If they have persecuted me,

03:59.188 --> 04:01.324
they will persecute you also.’”

04:01.324 --> 04:05.094
So we said to the judge: 
“Yes, indeed. Jesus said that.”

04:05.094 --> 04:08.498
The judge asked, 
“Do you think that’s the reason why

04:08.498 --> 04:11.734
Jehovah’s Witnesses 
are having problems in this region?”

04:11.734 --> 04:15.371
Well, what could we say 
but agree with the judge.

04:15.371 --> 04:16.806
But that wasn’t the end of it.

04:16.806 --> 04:21.044
As the case continued a few minutes more, 
the judge stopped us again.

04:21.044 --> 04:24.847
And this time the judge said: 
“You know, I’m not sure if Jesus said this.

04:24.847 --> 04:27.483
“It’s in the Bible where he said:

04:27.483 --> 04:30.153
“‘Where there are two or three 
gathered together,

04:30.153 --> 04:32.155
there I am in your midst.’”

04:32.155 --> 04:35.058
And we assured the judge, 
“Indeed, those are Jesus’ words.”

04:35.058 --> 04:37.560
The judge looked out at this old courtroom,

04:37.560 --> 04:40.363
which was filled 
with our brothers and sisters, and he said,

04:40.363 --> 04:44.233
“Well, Jesus must be in our midst today.”

04:44.233 --> 04:46.703
We felt like breaking into applause.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.705
At the end of the court hearing,

04:48.705 --> 04:51.040
the judge ruled in our favor 
and acquitted the brother,

04:51.040 --> 04:54.911
and the judges in all of the other cases 
also acquitted our brothers.

04:54.911 --> 04:57.180
It was just a thrilling experience!

04:57.180 --> 04:59.415
Oh, that’s wonderful; 
that’s wonderful, Shane.

04:59.415 --> 05:01.684
Thank you so much 
for sharing those experiences.

05:01.684 --> 05:05.254
You know, despite the challenges 
that you’ve had to face,

05:05.254 --> 05:09.058
how do you feel about the way 
you and Iolanda have benefited

05:09.058 --> 05:12.061
from being involved in accepting 
these challenging assignments

05:12.061 --> 05:14.063
in various parts of the world?

05:14.063 --> 05:17.967
Well, we have benefited 
in so many ways, Mark.

05:17.967 --> 05:21.371
Our relationship with Jehovah has deepened.

05:21.371 --> 05:23.373
Certainly, our trust in Jehovah

05:23.373 --> 05:25.608
has been strengthened.

05:25.608 --> 05:28.478
And we’ve experienced firsthand the love

05:28.478 --> 05:31.247
of the amazing worldwide brotherhood.

05:31.247 --> 05:33.316
Could I just share one experience about that?

05:33.316 --> 05:35.318
Please, please do.

05:35.318 --> 05:37.787
Two years ago, we were involved in a case

05:37.787 --> 05:41.357
where police had raided 
a congregation meeting in one country.

05:41.357 --> 05:44.594
They had brutally beaten the brothers 
and threatened the sisters.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.596
It was just terrible!

05:46.596 --> 05:48.898
Some weeks later in the court case

05:48.898 --> 05:51.467
that started against the brothers

05:51.467 --> 05:52.969
(that the police brought 
against the brothers),

05:52.969 --> 05:55.972
during that court case, 
the police repeatedly tried

05:55.972 --> 05:58.341
to arrest me and another brother 
I was working with.

05:58.341 --> 06:01.044
Over two days they were trying to arrest us.

06:01.044 --> 06:04.580
Even in the courthouse, 
they tried to detain and arrest us.

06:04.580 --> 06:09.218
And all through this, my wife, Iolanda, 
was watching what was happening.

06:09.218 --> 06:11.587
But do you know what was so remarkable?

06:11.587 --> 06:14.223
It was that despite the brutal treatment

06:14.223 --> 06:16.993
our brothers and sisters 
had endured just a few weeks earlier

06:16.993 --> 06:19.562
at the hands 
of these very same police officers,

06:19.562 --> 06:23.132
those dear brothers and sisters 
came to our aid.

06:23.132 --> 06:26.169
They were like a wall 
of protection around us,

06:26.169 --> 06:30.139
and they would not leave our side 
until the ordeal was done.

06:30.139 --> 06:32.542
It was love in action.

06:32.542 --> 06:35.812
So to answer your question, 
we have benefited in so many ways.

06:35.812 --> 06:40.817
We don’t regret for a moment 
accepting this thrilling assignment.

06:40.817 --> 06:43.586
Well, thank you so much, Shane.

06:43.586 --> 06:46.022
Please give our love to Iolanda as well.

06:46.022 --> 06:49.058
We appreciate the tremendous work 
that you’re accomplishing,

06:49.058 --> 06:51.828
and may Jehovah’s spirit 
continue to be with you.

06:51.828 --> 06:52.829
It’s our privilege.

06:52.829 --> 07:02.465
We look forward to continuing 
to work with you, Mark.

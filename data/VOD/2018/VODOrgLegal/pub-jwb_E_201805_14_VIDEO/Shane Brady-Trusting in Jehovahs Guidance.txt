00:01 When we’re faced  with challenging assignments,
00:04 reliance on Jehovah is of utmost importance.
00:09 In what ways can we show that reliance?
00:12 I have the pleasure of introducing you  to a friend of mine,
00:16 Shane Brady, who is presently serving  along with his wife, Iolanda,
00:20 at the branch in Finland.
00:23 Brother Shane Brady and I  previously worked together
00:25 at the Canada branch.
00:27 Shane has been involved  in legally defending our brothers
00:31 for the past 22 years in many countries,
00:34 including Armenia, Kazakhstan,  and Kyrgyzstan.
00:40 Shane, it’s good to see you.  How are you doing?
00:43 I’m doing very well.  It’s great to see you too, Mark.
00:46 Shane, we want to ask you,
00:47 What have been some of the challenges
00:49 that you’ve faced  in accepting these assignments
00:52 in various countries in the world?
00:54 Well, there certainly have been  a few challenges.
00:58 One is frequent travel.
01:00 Another is language;
01:02 each country that we assist  has its own language.
01:05 Some court cases are very stressful,
01:08 and at times, we’ve faced firsthand
01:11 the hatred of our opposers.
01:15 Yes. And you know, Shane,  in spite of all that,
01:18 you and your wife have always been willing  to go on these assignments.
01:21 We appreciate your spirit so much.
01:24 Is there an experience  that you can share with us
01:27 that would give us a taste  of the kinds of situations
01:30 that you’ve had to deal with  in these countries?
01:33 Well, there have been many experiences.
01:35 But one experience comes to mind.
01:37 A few months ago,  there was a special pioneer,
01:40 and a case was started against him.
01:42 And if the decision was negative,  it could have had very serious consequences
01:46 for our work in that country.
01:48 So we did our best  to present a strong defense.
01:52 But as the trial progressed,
01:53 things didn’t seem to be going so well.
01:57 But on the last day of the trial,  everything changed.
02:00 We presented a motion,
02:02 and we asked the judge  to terminate the case against the brother.
02:06 Personally, I didn’t think  it would actually work.
02:08 But one older brother who we’ve worked with
02:11 over the years always told us,
02:12 “We need to give Jehovah something to bless.”
02:14 And so we did, and the results  were quite unexpected.
02:19 When we made the motion, the judge turned  to the prosecutor and asked,
02:23 “Well, what’s your opinion?”
02:24 And to our surprise,  the prosecutor agreed with our request,
02:28 and he even went beyond what we asked.
02:30 He said to the judge  that the government official
02:33 that started the case  against our brother should be punished.
02:36 Well, the judge agreed;  the case was terminated.
02:40 When we were walking out of the courtroom,
02:42 I looked at the other brothers with me  and we all said the same thing,
02:45 “What happened?”
02:47 It was obvious —Jehovah had intervened.
02:49 That’s wonderful, Shane.
02:52 I wish we had more time  to hear many more experiences.
02:54 But could you just share  at least one more with us?
02:57 Sure.
02:58 In another land where our work  is not recognized,
03:03 on the night of the Memorial, a number of the brothers were arrested
03:06 for so-called illegal religious activity.
03:09 They were all convicted at trial.
03:11 So arrangements were made  to appeal each of those cases,
03:14 and they were heard  before a different appeal court judge.
03:18 What at first seemed quite negative,  the loss at trial,
03:22 turned out to be an amazing result.
03:25 Let me give you just one example.
03:27 In one of the appeals,  as we were presenting the appeal,
03:30 not long into the case,  the appeal court judge stopped us,
03:34 and he began to ask us  many questions about the Bible
03:38 and about what Jehovah’s Witnesses believe.
03:40 So for quite some time,  we answered these Biblical questions,
03:44 and then the case continued.
03:46 And then after some minutes,  the judge stopped us again.
03:49 And this time the judge said,  “I remember reading in the Bible”—
03:52 The judge said this,  “I remember reading in the Bible
03:55 “that Jesus said:  ‘If they have persecuted me,
03:59 they will persecute you also.’”
04:01 So we said to the judge:  “Yes, indeed. Jesus said that.”
04:05 The judge asked,  “Do you think that’s the reason why
04:08 Jehovah’s Witnesses  are having problems in this region?”
04:11 Well, what could we say  but agree with the judge.
04:15 But that wasn’t the end of it.
04:16 As the case continued a few minutes more,  the judge stopped us again.
04:21 And this time the judge said:  “You know, I’m not sure if Jesus said this.
04:24 “It’s in the Bible where he said:
04:27 “‘Where there are two or three  gathered together,
04:30 there I am in your midst.’”
04:32 And we assured the judge,  “Indeed, those are Jesus’ words.”
04:35 The judge looked out at this old courtroom,
04:37 which was filled  with our brothers and sisters, and he said,
04:40 “Well, Jesus must be in our midst today.”
04:44 We felt like breaking into applause.
04:46 At the end of the court hearing,
04:48 the judge ruled in our favor  and acquitted the brother,
04:51 and the judges in all of the other cases  also acquitted our brothers.
04:54 It was just a thrilling experience!
04:57 Oh, that’s wonderful;  that’s wonderful, Shane.
04:59 Thank you so much  for sharing those experiences.
05:01 You know, despite the challenges  that you’ve had to face,
05:05 how do you feel about the way  you and Iolanda have benefited
05:09 from being involved in accepting  these challenging assignments
05:12 in various parts of the world?
05:14 Well, we have benefited  in so many ways, Mark.
05:17 Our relationship with Jehovah has deepened.
05:21 Certainly, our trust in Jehovah
05:23 has been strengthened.
05:25 And we’ve experienced firsthand the love
05:28 of the amazing worldwide brotherhood.
05:31 Could I just share one experience about that?
05:33 Please, please do.
05:35 Two years ago, we were involved in a case
05:37 where police had raided  a congregation meeting in one country.
05:41 They had brutally beaten the brothers  and threatened the sisters.
05:44 It was just terrible!
05:46 Some weeks later in the court case
05:48 that started against the brothers
05:51 (that the police brought  against the brothers),
05:52 during that court case,  the police repeatedly tried
05:55 to arrest me and another brother  I was working with.
05:58 Over two days they were trying to arrest us.
06:01 Even in the courthouse,  they tried to detain and arrest us.
06:04 And all through this, my wife, Iolanda,  was watching what was happening.
06:09 But do you know what was so remarkable?
06:11 It was that despite the brutal treatment
06:14 our brothers and sisters  had endured just a few weeks earlier
06:16 at the hands  of these very same police officers,
06:19 those dear brothers and sisters  came to our aid.
06:23 They were like a wall  of protection around us,
06:26 and they would not leave our side  until the ordeal was done.
06:30 It was love in action.
06:32 So to answer your question,  we have benefited in so many ways.
06:35 We don’t regret for a moment  accepting this thrilling assignment.
06:40 Well, thank you so much, Shane.
06:43 Please give our love to Iolanda as well.
06:46 We appreciate the tremendous work  that you’re accomplishing,
06:49 and may Jehovah’s spirit  continue to be with you.
06:51 It’s our privilege.
06:52 We look forward to continuing  to work with you, Mark.

‎How did 15 years go by so fast?

00:00:27.798 --> 00:00:31.135 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We were so young when we got married

00:00:31.135 --> 00:00:33.304 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—maybe too young.

00:00:34.847 --> 00:00:37.099 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We had so little in common.

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:53.324 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When I started studying the Bible,

00:00:53.324 --> 00:00:57.328 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I thought Thomas would be as excited 
as I was to learn the truth.

00:01:10.424 --> 00:01:13.093 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But every conversation we had on the subject

00:01:13.093 --> 00:01:16.096 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎seemed to turn into an argument.

00:01:22.895 --> 00:01:27.483 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Looking back, 
I really wish I’d handled it better.

00:01:29.944 --> 00:01:31.946 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As the years went by,

00:01:31.946 --> 00:01:35.741 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎he did become more open to discussion.

00:01:51.256 --> 00:01:54.301 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But it’s been hard worshipping God alone. 

00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:58.305 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Others in the congregation 
are able to serve Jehovah together

00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:01.392 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and even reach out for theocratic goals

00:02:01.392 --> 00:02:04.103 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎like the School for Kingdom Evangelizers,

00:02:04.103 --> 00:02:06.814 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎something I would love to do.

00:02:06.814 --> 00:02:11.151 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Why can’t I have a husband 
who loves Jehovah like I do?

00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:14.363 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Abigail probably felt the same way

00:02:14.363 --> 00:02:16.907 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but with more reason.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.999 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Her husband was a bully and a drunkard

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:28.210 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and was despised by his entire household.

00:02:47.146 --> 00:02:50.274 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎At that time, 
many marriages were arranged,

00:02:50.274 --> 00:02:54.611 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎so Abigail had very little control 
over her circumstances.

00:02:56.196 --> 00:02:58.198 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But her words and actions

00:02:58.198 --> 00:03:00.200 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎showed that she was a spiritual woman

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.786 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎who didn’t focus 
on what she could not control

00:03:02.786 --> 00:03:05.581 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but on what she could.

00:03:05.581 --> 00:03:08.125 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I determined to do the same. 

00:03:08.125 --> 00:03:12.504 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I meditated on Jesus’ words
at Matthew 19:6:

00:03:12.504 --> 00:03:17.509 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“What God has yoked together,
let no man put apart.”

00:03:18.343 --> 00:03:21.221 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎To Jehovah, marriage is permanent

00:03:22.014 --> 00:03:24.266 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—even my marriage to an unbeliever.

00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:28.145 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So instead of dwelling on changing
my husband or my marriage,

00:03:28.145 --> 00:03:30.397 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I focused on changing myself.

00:03:31.523 --> 00:03:33.692 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Thomas does not love Jehovah,

00:03:33.692 --> 00:03:36.320 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but he’s not a “Nabal” either. 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.281 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He is loyal, and he loves me. 

00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:43.077 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He is entitled to the respect that the Bible 
commands wives to show to their husbands.

00:03:43.077 --> 00:03:47.956 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So I’m making an effort 
to be more respectful and loving to him.

00:03:47.956 --> 00:03:52.628 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Thomas hasn’t developed an interest
in the truth or started studying. 

00:03:52.628 --> 00:03:57.382 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But I have the satisfaction of knowing
my God is pleased with me,

00:03:57.382 --> 00:04:01.678 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and I have the same view
of marriage that he does.

00:04.942 --> 00:07.235
My name is Narangerel. 


00:07.235 --> 00:11.000
I was born and raised 
in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.


00:12.282 --> 00:17.162
My father, my younger brother 
and I were in the army.


00:17.162 --> 00:19.207
During that time, 


00:19.207 --> 00:22.167
I had money 
to buy whatever I wanted 


00:22.167 --> 00:25.004
and enjoyed going drinking 
with my friends, 


00:25.003 --> 00:28.131
which made me feel better


00:28.132 --> 00:31.260
—at times even satisfied and happy. 


00:31.260 --> 00:35.000
But my stressful life quickly returned.


00:37.515 --> 00:40.477
One of my best friends started to study 


00:40.477 --> 00:42.689
the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


00:42.688 --> 00:44.856
She used to give me tracts 


00:44.857 --> 00:47.025
and talk about Jehovah often. 


00:47.025 --> 00:49.653
But I never read them.


00:49.653 --> 00:54.000
One day when I was feeling 
really down, 


00:55.783 --> 00:58.815
I wondered what was in those tracts 


00:58.815 --> 01:01.000
and decided to read them.


01:13.552 --> 01:16.000
I really liked what I read.


01:21.060 --> 01:23.520
I wanted to know more about it, 


01:23.520 --> 01:25.647
so I called my friend and said, 


01:25.647 --> 01:27.859
“Can you please 
teach me about the Bible?” 


01:27.858 --> 01:30.610
Then I started to study the Bible 


01:30.610 --> 01:32.697
and go to the meetings.


01:32.697 --> 01:34.740
At one meeting, 
I heard, 


01:34.740 --> 01:38.202
“Jehovah God listens and answers 
his servant’s prayers.” 


01:38.202 --> 01:41.497
This truth touched my heart. 


01:41.497 --> 01:44.417
I decided to learn more about God 


01:44.417 --> 01:47.502
and to cultivate 
a close relationship with him 


01:47.502 --> 01:50.755
and to worship him.


01:50.755 --> 01:55.260
I told my father about my decision 
to retire from the military. 


01:55.260 --> 01:57.763
Of course, 
he didn’t want to accept it; 


01:57.763 --> 02:01.433
he tried everything to stop me.


02:01.433 --> 02:06.000
I felt bad that I was 
letting my family down. 


02:07.397 --> 02:10.000
But I really loved Jehovah.


02:13.070 --> 02:16.000
I never looked back.


02:18.075 --> 02:22.453
But I had another obstacle 
to overcome.


02:22.453 --> 02:26.958
I lived with my boyfriend. 


02:26.958 --> 02:30.545
He never accepted the Bible truths.


02:30.545 --> 02:34.550
I loved both Jehovah and him. 


02:34.550 --> 02:37.385
I didn’t want to lose either of them.


02:37.385 --> 02:39.513
So I prayed to Jehovah, 


02:39.513 --> 02:43.475
“Please help me 
that he legally marries me 


02:43.475 --> 02:46.145
and let me be a servant of you.” 


02:46.145 --> 02:49.188
I did everything I could do.


02:49.188 --> 02:53.985
But he said, 
“If you don’t leave this religion, 


02:53.985 --> 02:56.000
I will never marry you.”


02:58.198 --> 03:00.575
Later, he told me, 


03:00.575 --> 03:04.000
“I am going abroad; 
come with me.”


03:05.622 --> 03:07.665
To be honest, 


03:07.665 --> 03:11.087
I thought I could go 
with him and get married


03:11.087 --> 03:14.000
—then become a servant of God.


03:16.007 --> 03:18.094
But I prayed to Jehovah, 


03:18.093 --> 03:22.096
“Please help me 
to make the right decision.”


03:22.097 --> 03:24.140
Then I realized 


03:24.140 --> 03:26.768
that I had to cut off the relationship 


03:26.768 --> 03:29.000
with him who didn’t want to marry me.


03:36.612 --> 03:40.000
I cried until I had no tears left.


03:42.325 --> 03:44.662
I really loved him.


03:44.662 --> 03:49.000
But my love for Jehovah 
was much stronger.


03:50.542 --> 03:55.000
I was surprised at myself 
that I made this decision.


03:58.592 --> 04:02.262
In March 2008 I was baptized, 


04:02.262 --> 04:06.000
and I started regular pioneering 
from that December.


04:07.683 --> 04:12.521
I was appointed to be 
a special pioneer in August 2010, 


04:12.522 --> 04:17.000
and I’m joyfully serving 
in the city of Darkhan.


04:25.243 --> 04:27.245
I’m still single, 


04:27.245 --> 04:30.457
but now I have many friends 


04:30.457 --> 04:33.000
who love Jehovah and care for me.


04:34.920 --> 04:38.000
I have more self-respect than before.


04:59.612 --> 05:04.617
For me, 
the real satisfaction and happiness 


05:04.617 --> 05:22.405
come from working 
with Jehovah and serving him.

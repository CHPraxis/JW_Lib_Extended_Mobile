00:05 ‎I lived in the north,  with the glorious dark, starlit sky
00:08 ‎and the beauty of fir trees.
00:10 ‎I thought it was  the most wonderful place in the world.
00:13 ‎My mom was always drawing  my attention to the beauty of creation.
00:16 ‎And she always told me,
00:19 ‎“My daughter, it’s so important  to live your life in the right way.”
00:22 ‎And the questions  that stayed with me were:
00:24 ‎‘So why are we alive?
00:26 ‎Why is there so much  suffering, injustice, pain?’
00:30 ‎When I was 18,  I took up a form of karate
00:33 ‎known as Kyokushinkai.
00:37 ‎Just imagine a large number  of people in kimonos, standing in rows
00:41 ‎bravely and without a shadow of fear,
00:43 ‎working on improving their blows  and striving to progress.
00:46 ‎I thought: ‘This is it!  This is what I’ve been looking for!’
00:49 ‎I set the goal of reaching  the next world championships,
00:51 ‎winning a high place,
00:53 ‎and immortalizing myself  so that my name would remain
00:56 ‎and generations would remember me.
01:03 ‎Among those sportsmen, although I saw  a lot of nice words and slogans,
01:06 ‎not everything was  as pure as I’d hoped for.
01:11 ‎And then on one occasion,  I was sitting down
01:15 ‎and feelings of emptiness
01:17 ‎just wouldn’t leave me alone.
01:20 ‎And for the first time in my life,
01:22 ‎I talked to God.
01:24 ‎And then I prayed:
01:26 ‎“I don’t understand you.
01:29 ‎“Why is there  so much beauty in the world
01:32 ‎“and yet so much suffering?
01:36 ‎“Is that really what you want
01:38 ‎—for us to live like this?”
01:40 ‎I prayed, I guess,  for about four hours.
01:43 ‎You know, the strongest feeling  of emptiness and loneliness
01:47 ‎is that of a creation
01:50 ‎without its Creator.
01:51 ‎And I was so lonely at that time.
01:56 ‎And a while afterwards,  there was a knock at my door.
02:00 ‎It was Jehovah’s Witnesses.
02:06 ‎I started studying the Bible.
02:08 ‎It was so wonderful!
02:11 ‎On one occasion,  the sister who studied with me
02:14 ‎looked up at me,  and when she looked at those bruises
02:17 ‎and those beaten-up knuckles,
02:21 ‎she took a deep breath  and shook her head.
02:24 ‎I said, “Is there something wrong?”
02:26 ‎She said,  “You know, I’m in great pain.”
02:29 ‎I said, “Why are you in pain?”
02:32 ‎She said: “Well,
02:33 ‎“I’m looking at  your hands, your elbows,
02:36 ‎“your battered legs, all of that.
02:38 ‎Doesn’t it hurt?”
02:41 ‎I said, “Well, yes.”
02:43 ‎And she said, “You know,  it hurts me to see you in pain.”
02:48 ‎And I started to understand  that Jehovah is the true God
02:52 ‎and that this really was the truth.
02:55 ‎It was difficult.
02:57 ‎The pressure from relatives  and friends was very strong.
03:01 ‎But the most difficult thing
03:03 ‎that I had to battle with  was my strong attachment to karate.
03:07 ‎Just a year remained  until the world championships.
03:10 ‎I had prepared for them.
03:11 ‎I had been working  toward that goal for five years.
03:16 ‎Glory can seem really sweet
03:19 ‎when you are the victor,  when your opponents fall to the ground.
03:28 ‎So I flew to the world championships.
03:29 ‎When I made it to the last four winners
03:32 ‎and I had to fight for third place,
03:35 ‎I wanted to ask my trainer  to let me stop. Why?
03:37 ‎Because I couldn’t feel  a single place on my body
03:41 ‎—everything was beaten up.
03:43 ‎But he said:
03:44 ‎“You know, we love you so much.  Go for it!”
03:48 ‎And at that moment,  it felt as though I was weighing love
03:52 ‎—the world’s love
03:54 ‎and the love of Jehovah’s organization.
03:56 ‎It seemed to me  that the world was saying:
03:59 ‎“We love you.  Now just go and die!”
04:02 ‎But the love in the organization says,
04:05 ‎“It hurts me to see you in pain.”
04:07 ‎I realized that the world  can’t give you what it doesn’t have.
04:11 ‎It doesn’t know how to love.
04:13 ‎But, nevertheless, I went to the fight
04:15 ‎and became the bronze medalist.
04:20 ‎And when I stood  on the podium of glory,
04:24 ‎I understood that glory  among people who don’t love you
04:28 ‎weighs no more than emptiness.
04:31 ‎If a person dedicates his life
04:34 ‎to glorifying himself, he will always meet
04:36 ‎with disappointment and emptiness.
04:39 ‎So I made the firm decision  to escape from karate.
04:43 ‎I started preaching,  and I was baptized in 2005
04:45 ‎at the summer convention in Kurgan.
04:50 ‎Later, I started full-time service.
04:53 ‎I learned the Tatar language  so that I could serve in that territory.
04:59 ‎Now, when in the evenings
05:01 ‎I look up at the starry sky,  I feel not hopelessness,
05:05 ‎but tremendous joy
05:07 ‎because I know who is behind it all:
05:10 ‎our loving Creator, Jehovah God.

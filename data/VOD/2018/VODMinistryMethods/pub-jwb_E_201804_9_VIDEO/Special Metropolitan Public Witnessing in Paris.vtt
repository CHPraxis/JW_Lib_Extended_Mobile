00:02.660 --> 00:06.660
Over 2.2 million people 
live in the city of Paris.

00:06.660 --> 00:09.100
And in 2016,

00:09.100 --> 00:12.100
around 45 million tourists 
visited the French capital.

00:13.860 --> 00:18.300
To reach all these people 
with the message contained in the Bible,

00:18.300 --> 00:23.060
special metropolitan public witnessing 
was set up in Paris in 2012.

00:23.060 --> 00:25.060
Each month,

00:25.060 --> 00:28.580
1,300 Jehovah’s Witnesses 
preach with the help

00:28.580 --> 00:31.980
of mobile displays 
placed in 12 strategic locations.

00:32.860 --> 00:35.060
These carts may be in place

00:35.060 --> 00:39.060
for up to 14 hours a day, 7 days a week.

00:39.060 --> 00:42.700
Because they are highly visible 
and are in the right place at the right time,

00:43.580 --> 00:46.860
almost 3,000 publications

00:46.860 --> 00:49.540
in 27 languages are placed each month,

00:49.540 --> 00:52.500
and many Bible studies are started.

00:56.580 --> 00:59.700
It’s more and more difficult 
to meet people at home.

00:59.700 --> 01:00.980
Sometimes you need a code

01:00.980 --> 01:05.180
to enter the first door, 
then a second one inside.

01:05.180 --> 01:08.220
In addition to the Parisians, 
there are lots of commuters

01:08.220 --> 01:10.540
coming every day to the capital to work,

01:10.540 --> 01:13.380
so these people 
are not available at their homes.

01:13.380 --> 01:15.380
Moreover, in Paris,

01:15.380 --> 01:17.380
they can be completely anonymous.

01:17.940 --> 01:19.940
They do not have to worry 
about their neighbors.

01:20.420 --> 01:21.300
We are always here.

01:21.300 --> 01:22.180
We witness.

01:22.180 --> 01:25.940
And even if the doors are closed, 
we find another way to preach.

01:27.300 --> 01:31.180
One thing that I particularly like 
about this form of witnessing

01:31.180 --> 01:33.900
is the questions that are on the posters.

01:33.900 --> 01:35.900
Even if people don’t come

01:35.900 --> 01:37.700
and help themselves from the cart,

01:37.700 --> 01:39.460
I say to myself,

01:39.460 --> 01:42.980
‘They still take the questions 
away with them.’

01:42.980 --> 01:45.980
These questions do have an impact on people.

01:45.980 --> 01:50.460
We feel that they make them think 
by giving them food for thought.

01:52.300 --> 01:54.660
There’s a really interesting population.

01:54.660 --> 01:57.380
People who are eager 
to learn more about the Bible

01:57.380 --> 02:00.940
want to have discussions 
and are asking questions.

02:00.940 --> 02:03.620
And through the jw.org website, 
we can answer their questions.

02:04.340 --> 02:06.500
I use videos a lot 
because people are very attracted

02:06.500 --> 02:10.660
by the beautiful images 
produced by the organization,

02:10.660 --> 02:14.500
and they are really very surprised, 
and they leave truly satisfied.

02:16.700 --> 02:18.700
A new challenge for me 
was to use

02:18.700 --> 02:21.980
the new technology and, 
for example,

02:21.980 --> 02:23.940
the Why Study the Bible? video.

02:23.940 --> 02:25.940
So during this campaign,

02:25.940 --> 02:28.700
I had the opportunity to use this video

02:28.700 --> 02:31.820
for the first time to show it to someone 
who approached the cart.

02:33.220 --> 02:37.300
So it’s true that before we use 
the new tools, we need to prepare

02:37.300 --> 02:41.460
—especially for the videos.

02:42.020 --> 02:46.020
People who stop at the stand 
really take the time to talk to us.

02:46.900 --> 02:50.660
It is not like other forms of service 
where we have less time to spend with them.

02:50.660 --> 02:54.060
I’ve had conversations 
that lasted 20 to 30 minutes,

02:54.060 --> 02:56.500
sharing several Bible scriptures.

02:57.420 --> 03:01.500
And we feel that these people are looking for 
and need to hear the comforting message

03:01.500 --> 03:03.500
of God’s Word.

03:05.780 --> 03:10.020
I think it is an activity 
that actually honors people,

03:10.020 --> 03:12.220
particularly in France,

03:12.220 --> 03:14.540
because they are given the freedom to choose.

03:14.540 --> 03:17.700
They feel that they have control 
over the situation.

03:19.340 --> 03:22.940
When I go back to my congregation, 
often the brothers and sisters ask me

03:22.940 --> 03:24.740
if we were successful.

03:24.740 --> 03:26.260
I always say, “Yes.”

03:26.260 --> 03:28.700
Because we were there; 
we were obedient,

03:28.700 --> 03:32.420
and for sure we were seen 
by many people in the streets of Paris.

03:34.780 --> 03:36.500
We do the cart witnessing until 8:00 p.m.,

03:36.500 --> 03:39.660
and at 8:00 p.m., people are still outside.

03:39.660 --> 03:41.660
These people
—we do not find them at home.

03:41.660 --> 03:44.420
And here, they quickly get a glimpse
of the Bible’s message,

03:44.420 --> 03:46.420
and they help themselves.

03:46.420 --> 03:47.340
So it works.

03:48.300 --> 03:51.820
Many people tell us, 
“We saw the cart in London;

03:51.820 --> 03:56.820
we saw it in New York; 
we saw it in Italy, in Rome.”

03:56.820 --> 03:59.220
A person stopped recently,

03:59.220 --> 04:01.420
and I just heard him say in Italian,

04:01.420 --> 04:03.860
“We have the same thing back home!”

04:06.300 --> 04:10.100
So this international aspect is
—for a Jehovah’s Witness—

04:10.100 --> 04:13.140
what makes our organization unique.

04:13.140 --> 04:16.420
We are a true international family.

04:16.420 --> 04:21.460
Hearing other people say it, it’s amazing.

04:25.820 --> 04:28.860
I feel like I’m sharing in a unique program

04:28.860 --> 04:31.500
that has never taken place before.

04:31.500 --> 04:35.220
In fact, we follow the example 
of our brothers and sisters

04:35.220 --> 04:37.020
who do the same everywhere in the world.

04:37.020 --> 04:39.460
So I feel like I’m a small part

04:39.460 --> 04:42.540
of a big family.

04:48.100 --> 04:51.460
Personally, I have known Jehovah now 
for six years,

04:51.460 --> 04:54.020
and I’m truly grateful to know

04:54.020 --> 04:57.180
that Jehovah himself thinks of everyone.

04:57.180 --> 04:59.700
And I feel privileged to be able

04:59.700 --> 05:02.780
to carry this wonderful message to all those

05:02.780 --> 05:11.683
who still don’t know him.

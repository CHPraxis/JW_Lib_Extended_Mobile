00:02 In the book of Romans,  the first chapter, verse 20,
00:04 it talks about how you  can perceive Jehovah’s creative power
00:08 by what we see in creation around us.
00:11 When you’re in a national park  and you see the beauty of these parks,
00:15 you immediately think of that scripture.
00:19 We have individuals driving
00:21 from an hour and a half
00:22 to over three hours one-way
00:23 to share in this form of witnessing.
00:27 National parks generally have
00:29 what is called a freeness of speech area.
00:31 So that allows us  to be able to get permission
00:34 to go into the parks  to set up our carts there.
00:37 It’s just a nice place to come and relax,
00:40 and when people are relaxed,  they’re wanting to talk.
00:44 They already kind of have  a sense of closeness with God;
00:47 it kind of gets them thinking  about their spirituality,
00:50 and then when they see our cart  displayed so nicely about that,
00:53 it kind of draws them toward that.
00:56 You will find visitors  from all parts of the world.
01:00 Many cultures are represented.
01:03 And quite often,  we will have literature in their language.
01:07 There are many that benefit  from our work at the carts.
01:11 But especially noteworthy are those
01:14 who do not have access to Bible literature.
01:18 A Chinese couple came up, and they said,
01:20 “Thank you for giving us  the Bible in our language.”
01:25 That made our day.
01:26 It was fabulous!
01:28 They may not stop.
01:29 They may not talk to us.
01:30 But they see it,  and that registers in their mind
01:33 —that they’ve seen this  at an airport or in their city.
01:35 And now they’re going to look into it  or go to the website and wonder:
01:38 ‘What was that all about?  What were those people doing there?’
01:41 We sit here sometimes
01:44 thinking we need to pinch ourselves
01:46 because it’s so beautiful  that we’ve been given the privilege
01:48 of doing the cart work  in a location like this.
01:53 Very soon,  these national parks will not just be
01:56 isolated places that we have to travel to
01:58 —the entire world will be that national park.
02:02 And what a joy it will be
02:03 when every single person alive
02:05 can enjoy that beautiful painting  that our Creator has made for us!

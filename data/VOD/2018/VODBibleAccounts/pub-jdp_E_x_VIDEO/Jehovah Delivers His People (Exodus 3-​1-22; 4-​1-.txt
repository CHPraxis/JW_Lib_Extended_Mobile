00:01 At the age of 40,
00:03 a man of the royal house of Egypt
00:05 becomes a shepherd.
00:07 Forty years later,
00:09 that shepherd leaves his flock
00:11 to shepherd people,
00:13 a nation of slaves
00:14 numbering in the millions.
00:17 Moses is that 80-year-old shepherd.
00:20 He leads the people of Israel
00:22 out of the hands  of their cruel master, Egypt,
00:25 after they have resided in that land
00:27 for more than two centuries.
00:31 When Moses was 40 years of age,
00:34 he thought he was qualified
00:36 to break Egypt’s iron grip over his people.
00:39 How did he show this?
00:42 Moses witnessed an incident  of terrible injustice,
00:47 “an Egyptian beating a Hebrew,  one of his brothers.”
00:51 He was eager to act,
00:53 so “he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.”
00:58 Commenting on this,  the Christian disciple Stephen said:
01:02 “He thought  that his brothers would grasp
01:05 “that God was giving them  salvation by his hand,
01:08 but they did not grasp it.”
01:11 His own people branded him a killer.
01:15 Fearing for his life,
01:17 Moses fled Egypt
01:19 and journeyed  across the wilderness to Midian.
01:23 During those 40 years,
01:25 Moses would cultivate patience, meekness,
01:29 humility, mildness of temper, self-control,
01:33 and the ability to wait on Jehovah.
01:37 Who of us has not experienced  challenges similar to Moses?
01:41 Have we had to overcome shyness
01:45 or stand up to bullying?
01:48 How do we react when faced with injustice
01:51 or opposition from family or from government?
01:55 Do we tend to get impatient
01:57 as we wait on Jehovah to make things right?
02:00 Or do we put too much confidence in ourselves
02:04 and too little in Jehovah?
02:07 If so,  then we can learn a lesson in endurance
02:11 from the example of Moses.
02:13 Let us start by reading Exodus 3:1-10.
04:53 Moses now had a divine commission.
04:56 The time had come  for Jehovah to free his people.
05:00 The time had come for Moses
05:02 to be a faithful leader who does not give up.
05:05 Would he accept this assignment,
05:08 one that he had been only too eager
05:11 to take up 40 years earlier in Egypt?
05:14 Let’s pick up the Bible account  at Exodus 3:11-22.
08:40 What a dramatic change
40 years has brought to Moses!
08:44 Here is a different Moses,
08:46 one who is uncertain, shy.
08:49 Moses has serious doubts  about his own qualifications.
08:53 He believes that his commission  is too much for him.
08:57 In effect, he says: “Oh, no!
09:00 Please don’t ask me to do this!”
09:03 Can you put yourself in Moses’ sandals?
09:07 Have you ever been given an assignment
09:09 that you feel is beyond your ability?
09:12 Yet, you don’t give up.
09:14 Earnest prayer helps restore your confidence.
09:18 You obey.
09:20 What about Moses?
09:22 Jehovah reassures him by saying:
09:25 “I will prove to be with you.”
09:28 Yet, Moses is still hesitant.
09:30 Will he give up
09:32 and ask Jehovah to find someone else?
09:35 Note what Exodus 4:1-9 says:
11:42 Moses needs reassurance.
11:45 So Jehovah gives Moses, not just one,
11:48 but three signs to show the older men
11:51 proof of divine backing.
11:53 And what powerful credentials these are!
11:56 For the first time,
11:58 a human is empowered to perform miracles.
12:01 As the rest of Exodus chapter 4 shows,
12:04 Moses feels inadequate to speak to Pharaoh.
12:08 He pleads that he is “slow of tongue,”
12:11 even asking Jehovah
12:13 to excuse him from the task.
12:15 Jehovah gives him help.
12:17 Jehovah assigns Aaron
12:20 as Moses’ mouthpiece.
12:22 Both men proceed to meet Pharaoh.
12:25 Listen to what is said to Pharaoh
12:28 as found at Exodus 5:1-9:
14:31 Pharaoh defiantly says no to Jehovah.
14:35 He is angry at the Hebrews.
14:38 In turn, the people are angry at Moses.
14:41 They blame him for their hardship.
14:43 Moses feels sorry for the people
14:46 and asks Jehovah:
14:48 “Why have you sent me?”
14:50 Jehovah patiently gives Moses
14:52 a reassuring message,
14:54 beginning at Exodus 6:1.
16:41 Jehovah backs up his promise of deliverance
16:44 by means of his unique name.
16:46 Moses, therefore, does not give up.
16:49 He obeys Jehovah,
16:52 and he and Aaron prepare
16:53 to meet Pharaoh again.
16:56 Let’s read Exodus 7:1-7.
18:18 Moses now can be confident  of Jehovah’s backing
18:21 because Moses is doing  things Jehovah’s way
18:24 and at a time that fits  Jehovah’s prophetic timetable.
18:29 Jehovah is about to use ten plagues
18:31 to bring Pharaoh to his knees.
18:34 These disasters will show
18:36 that Jehovah’s sovereignty is real
18:39 and that he is worthy of worship.
18:42 The Ten Plagues will also expose
18:45 the Egyptian gods as nothing
18:48 —as mere unreality.
18:50 The first three plagues
18:52 strike both the Egyptians and the Hebrews.
18:56 However, the next seven plagues
18:59 do not touch the Hebrews
19:01 —proof that Jehovah can set apart
19:03 and protect his worshippers
19:05 if they do not give up their trust in him.
19:08 Now let’s summarize the Ten Plagues
19:10 listed at Exodus 7:14–11:10.
19:17 Plague 1:  Water is turned into blood.
19:21 Plague 2:  Frogs invade the land and houses.
19:27 Plague 3:  Gnats pester man and beast.
19:33 Plague 4:  Gadflies swarm and bite only the Egyptians.
19:39 Plague 5:  Livestock die.
19:43 Plague 6:  Boils fester on man and beast.
19:49 Plague 7:  Hail strikes man, beast, and vegetation.
19:55 Plague 8:  Locusts swarm and eat all vegetation
19:59 left after the hailstorm.
20:02 Plague 9:  Thick darkness
20:06 blankets Egypt for three days.
20:09 Plague 10:  The firstborn of man and livestock is killed.
20:14 Pharaoh sees his firstborn dead.
20:18 He hears great outcries of bitter grief
20:22 rise from the houses of all the Egyptians
20:25 because they too see their firstborn dead.
20:29 Pharaoh quickly summons Moses and Aaron
20:32 and tells them to go, to hurry away.
20:35 Will Pharaoh’s heart soften?
20:38 Let’s have Exodus 14:5-10 answer.
22:04 Will Jehovah hear their cry for help?
22:07 Let’s read Exodus 14:13-31.
26:43 Are the Hebrews happy that they endured
26:46 to see the salvation of Jehovah?
26:48 Yes!
26:50 They break out in a joyful victory song.
26:53 Listen to them sing!
26:55 You too can stand and sing along.
26:58 Song number 149 represents what is found
27:02 at Exodus 15:1-21.
27:06 If you can,
27:08 let us all stand and sing song 149.
29:34 Please be seated.
29:37 The account we just read
29:39 vividly illustrates Jehovah’s use of power
29:42 in a way that serves notice  on all who defy him.
29:47 Thus, what can we take away  from our Bible reading?
29:51 The fact that the Hebrews suffered in Egypt
29:54 and Jehovah delivered them is concrete proof
29:58 that our hope for deliverance  from Satan’s world
30:01 is not an empty one.
30:03 When you seem trapped  in a corner by life’s problems,
30:07 do not give up!
30:10 The God who parted the Red Sea
30:12 can provide escape for you too.
30:15 If, during the coming great tribulation,
30:18 you feel trapped by Satan’s hoards,
30:21 remember: Endure to the end!
30:24 Jehovah will provide escape for you
30:27 and for all his worshippers
30:29 who don’t give up!

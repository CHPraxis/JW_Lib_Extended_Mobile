00:06.652 --> 00:11.490
In 1946, the first missionaries 
arrived in Peru,

00:11.490 --> 00:15.578
and the good news spread quickly 
in the Spanish field.

00:15.578 --> 00:20.207
However, centuries of mistreatment 
caused many Quechua-speaking people

00:20.207 --> 00:24.378
to regard outsiders 
with reservation and mistrust.

00:24.378 --> 00:27.006
Over the decades,

00:27.006 --> 00:30.885
interested ones had to study in Spanish 
in order to learn the truth,

00:30.885 --> 00:33.846
even if it wasn’t their first language.

00:33.846 --> 00:38.809
It’s true that many Quechua speakers 
also understand Spanish;

00:38.809 --> 00:43.647
it’s the language commonly used 
in business and taught in school.

00:43.647 --> 00:48.360
However, it was noted that although 
they understood the words we were teaching,

00:48.360 --> 00:52.448
the Bible’s message 
didn’t easily reach the heart.

00:53.532 --> 00:55.534
The good news still had to be preached

00:55.534 --> 00:57.995
not only in every nation

00:57.995 --> 01:01.999
but to all “tribes and peoples and tongues.”

01:01.999 --> 01:06.253
In 1992, the branch office 
in Peru received permission

01:06.253 --> 01:08.213
to translate literature into Quechua

01:08.213 --> 01:13.177
and to start a preaching initiative 
to test the response in the field.

01:13.177 --> 01:15.179
When Quechua speakers were approached

01:15.179 --> 01:17.139
with a warm greeting and presentation

01:17.139 --> 01:18.641
in their own language,

01:18.641 --> 01:20.392
it made a remarkable difference.

01:29.318 --> 01:32.821
People started responding favorably 
to the message,

01:32.821 --> 01:35.032
and many Bible studies were started.

01:50.673 --> 01:54.510
Gradually, translators realized 
that it was necessary

01:54.510 --> 01:57.137
to translate into other Quechua languages.

01:57.137 --> 02:00.474
Just as there are a variety 
of cultures within Peru,

02:00.474 --> 02:04.436
there are also a variety 
of Quechua languages spoken.

02:04.436 --> 02:07.690
Translation teams were established 
where three of these languages are spoken

02:07.690 --> 02:12.069
—in Ayacucho, Cuzco, and Huaraz.

02:15.406 --> 02:19.326
In 2013, permission was granted to build

02:19.326 --> 02:21.412
two new remote translation offices

02:21.412 --> 02:24.373
—one in Cuzco and another in Ayacucho.

02:24.373 --> 02:27.126
Many local and international brothers

02:27.126 --> 02:30.421
volunteered to help on the building projects.

02:30.421 --> 02:32.798
Whether rain or shine,

02:32.798 --> 02:34.800
they worked together with a joyful spirit.

02:45.352 --> 02:49.690
By early 2016, 
the new offices were ready to operate.

02:51.650 --> 02:54.862
On May 1, 2016,

02:54.862 --> 02:57.865
Brother Geoffrey Jackson 
of the Governing Body

02:57.865 --> 03:00.617
delivered the dedication talk 
of these new facilities

03:00.617 --> 03:02.619
to a delighted audience

03:02.619 --> 03:04.788
from around the country.

03:04.788 --> 03:08.709
We promise to use 
these buildings exclusively

03:08.709 --> 03:12.504
for Jehovah’s praise and glory.

03:12.504 --> 03:15.090
Do you accept our resolution?

03:26.060 --> 03:30.314
These facilities are like gifts from Jehovah.

03:32.775 --> 03:36.528
Not only are the new offices 
clean and beautiful

03:36.528 --> 03:40.032
but they are specifically designed 
for the translation work.

03:41.867 --> 03:45.037
One of the most important features 
of the new offices, therefore,

03:45.037 --> 03:47.956
is the audio recording studio,

03:47.956 --> 03:50.626
equipped with a special soundproof room

03:52.503 --> 03:55.547
where high-quality recordings are produced.

04:11.563 --> 04:13.690
Children and older ones alike

04:13.690 --> 04:18.028
are captivated 
by videos of Juancito and Anita,

04:18.028 --> 04:22.658
the Quechua version of Caleb and Sophia.

04:22.658 --> 04:25.869
Just as when a tree grows and flourishes

04:25.869 --> 04:28.872
when provided with an ample supply of water,

04:28.872 --> 04:32.251
congregations 
have been growing and being fortified

04:32.251 --> 04:34.670
by an increasing flow of spiritual food

04:34.670 --> 04:37.422
in their own language.

04:38.924 --> 04:41.885
This great ingathering of the Quechua people

04:41.885 --> 04:44.346
to Jehovah’s organization

04:44.346 --> 04:49.101
truly contributes to the fulfillment 
of the prophecy at Revelation 7:9:

04:49.101 --> 04:52.146
“Look! A great crowd, . . . 
out of all nations

04:52.146 --> 04:54.773
“and tribes and peoples and tongues,

04:54.773 --> 04:57.276
“standing before the throne

04:57.276 --> 05:07.726
and before the Lamb.”

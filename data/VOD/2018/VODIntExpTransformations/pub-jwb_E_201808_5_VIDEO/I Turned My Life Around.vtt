00:01.063 --> 00:03.691
‘Turn your life around,

00:03.691 --> 00:05.901
‘so that seasons of refreshing

00:05.901 --> 00:08.112
may come from Jehovah himself.’

00:10.114 --> 00:12.157
Those words changed my life,

00:12.157 --> 00:15.536
and they saved the life of my little girl.

00:15.536 --> 00:17.788
I was raised in a Witness family.

00:21.834 --> 00:25.838
But I chose

00:25.838 --> 00:29.258
a dark underworld

00:29.258 --> 00:33.220
of practically everything
that Jehovah hates.

00:33.220 --> 00:35.848
After about 15 years,

00:35.848 --> 00:38.642
although financially secure,

00:38.642 --> 00:43.606
I was confronted with the failure
that my life had become.

00:47.818 --> 00:52.823
I was trying to raise a child
while addicted to drugs.

00:53.908 --> 00:56.827
I just didn’t want
to live like that anymore,

00:56.827 --> 01:00.289
and I wanted to be a good mother.

01:00.289 --> 01:02.875
So for the first time in years,

01:02.875 --> 01:06.795
I prayed to Jehovah.

01:06.795 --> 01:10.799
The knock came on my door
the very next day.

01:15.346 --> 01:18.349
I began studying with a vengeance.

01:19.975 --> 01:22.478
I had 15 years to catch up on.

01:24.355 --> 01:26.982
I had a lot of help.

01:28.150 --> 01:30.319
I progressively changed my lifestyle,

01:30.319 --> 01:32.863
I changed my associates,

01:32.863 --> 01:35.407
and I conquered my addiction.

01:35.407 --> 01:37.785
I slowly began to overcome

01:37.785 --> 01:41.163
feelings of worthlessness.

01:42.331 --> 01:44.959
So none of these changes were easy to make,

01:44.959 --> 01:46.669
but it made me feel

01:46.669 --> 01:48.379
clean and happy

01:48.379 --> 01:51.340
knowing that Jehovah was pleased.

01:51.340 --> 01:54.301
My burning desire at that point 
really was to begin sharing

01:54.301 --> 01:57.388
with other people what I was learning,

01:57.388 --> 02:01.100
but I didn’t qualify
to engage in the public ministry

02:01.100 --> 02:04.561
because I was still living
with my boyfriend at the time.

02:04.561 --> 02:08.190
And he didn’t understand
some of the changes I was making.

02:08.190 --> 02:10.317
I was determined

02:10.317 --> 02:13.570
to turn my life around
and overcome this last hurdle

02:13.570 --> 02:16.115
that was preventing me
from serving Jehovah fully.

02:20.202 --> 02:22.204
Two weeks later,

02:22.204 --> 02:24.623
I found out I was pregnant.

02:25.457 --> 02:27.459
I was devastated.

02:27.459 --> 02:31.922
I didn’t know what all those people
who had helped me would think

02:31.922 --> 02:35.926
and how Jehovah
felt about what was happening.

02:38.178 --> 02:41.015
I was so ashamed.

02:41.015 --> 02:45.394
I actually blamed Jehovah
for letting it happen.

02:45.394 --> 02:48.147
I was so confused.

02:48.147 --> 02:50.024
My first inclination

02:50.024 --> 02:53.318
was just to get an abortion.

02:54.319 --> 02:57.072
But deep down,
I knew that was wrong.

02:57.072 --> 02:59.533
I thought, ‘Now everyone will know

02:59.533 --> 03:01.702
‘that I’m still the worthless person

03:01.702 --> 03:05.539
that I always knew I was.’

03:05.539 --> 03:07.666
At that point,
I just felt like giving up.

03:10.335 --> 03:13.088
I told my aunt and uncle,

03:13.088 --> 03:16.550
who are Jehovah’s Witnesses,
about my situation.

03:16.550 --> 03:18.844
They didn’t judge me at all,

03:18.844 --> 03:21.764
but they did offer a curious suggestion:

03:21.764 --> 03:25.809
They invited me up to Bethel for a visit.

03:25.809 --> 03:29.313
They introduced me to an elder
who was very kind,

03:29.313 --> 03:32.483
and I talked to him
about my situation.

03:32.483 --> 03:34.485
I was shocked

03:34.485 --> 03:36.487
by how loving he was.

03:36.487 --> 03:40.991
So he shared with me Acts 3:19.

03:40.991 --> 03:45.120
“Repent, therefore, and turn around

03:45.120 --> 03:47.623
“so as to get your sins blotted out,

03:47.623 --> 03:50.167
“that seasons of refreshing

03:50.167 --> 03:54.004
may come from the person of Jehovah.”

03:54.004 --> 03:56.006
Well, he told me

03:56.006 --> 03:59.927
I had already sinned,
but why should I sin a second time?

03:59.927 --> 04:02.137
Why should this innocent child pay

04:02.137 --> 04:04.181
for what I had done wrong?

04:04.181 --> 04:07.267
He suggested I teach my baby

04:07.267 --> 04:10.312
about Jehovah and raise the child up

04:10.312 --> 04:14.066
to know Him and have a friendship with Him.

04:14.066 --> 04:16.693
I loved that he took something that was

04:17.945 --> 04:20.989
sad and depressing for me

04:20.989 --> 04:23.283
and turned it into something beautiful.

04:23.283 --> 04:25.285
Well, I had a new plan now.

04:25.285 --> 04:28.080
I was really determined
to do everything I had to do

04:28.080 --> 04:31.250
to turn my life around
in order to please Jehovah.

04:31.250 --> 04:35.337
So eventually I qualified to become
an unbaptized publisher,

04:35.337 --> 04:39.383
and later I was baptized in 2010.

04:39.383 --> 04:41.677
I gave birth to a healthy baby girl.

04:42.761 --> 04:46.181
I already dedicated my life to Jehovah.

04:46.181 --> 04:50.227
So two of my goals 
are to get baptized and pioneer.

04:50.227 --> 04:54.857
I’m as determined as ever
to raise Jolie up to love Jehovah

04:54.857 --> 05:09.227
and to avoid the traps
that almost cost us our lives.

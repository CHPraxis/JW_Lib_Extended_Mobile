00:04.358 --> 00:07.653
My whole life I wanted to be a teacher. 


00:07.653 --> 00:10.530
It was very gratifying, 


00:10.530 --> 00:15.035
but yet there was something that was 


00:15.035 --> 00:17.663
empty in my life. 


00:17.663 --> 00:21.541
I would see children that were disabled 


00:21.542 --> 00:25.337
—not because they had done anything wrong—


00:25.337 --> 00:28.049
they were just born that way. 


00:28.048 --> 00:29.716
And I thought to myself: 


00:29.717 --> 00:33.720
‘That doesn’t make sense to me. 


00:33.720 --> 00:36.265
‘God is a God of love. 


00:36.265 --> 00:40.018
‘I knew God could fix all these things. 


00:40.018 --> 00:42.395
Why hasn’t he?’ 


00:42.395 --> 00:46.650
And then it was a child in my school 


00:46.650 --> 00:50.000
that successfully got me 
the answers to my questions. 


00:51.197 --> 00:54.284
She asked me the questions: 


00:54.283 --> 00:57.578
“Do you know I’m one of Jehovah’s Witnesses? 


00:57.578 --> 01:01.456
Would you like to know more 
about Jehovah’s Witnesses?” 


01:01.457 --> 01:03.584
And I thought to myself: 


01:03.583 --> 01:06.336
‘I do. 
I really do.’ 


01:06.337 --> 01:08.714
“Why don’t you come over 
and visit me someday 


01:08.713 --> 01:12.926
and tell me about Jehovah’s Witnesses.” 


01:12.927 --> 01:16.389
When she came back the next week, 
I sat there and listened 


01:16.388 --> 01:18.390
and she taught me things. 


01:18.390 --> 01:22.518
She taught me how to look into my own Bible 


01:22.518 --> 01:25.000
to find the answers to questions. 


01:26.315 --> 01:29.000
And all of a sudden, 


01:30.527 --> 01:34.907
I’m getting answer after answer after answer, 


01:34.907 --> 01:39.000
which for 25 years 
I couldn’t find these answers anywhere. 


01:40.453 --> 01:43.081
And it was amazing to me. 


01:43.082 --> 01:48.420
And I said, 
“Yes, this is the way it should be.”


01:48.420 --> 01:52.007
How do you get a close relationship with God? 


01:52.007 --> 01:54.677
First thing, you learn his name. 


01:54.677 --> 01:57.095
And after you know his name, 


01:57.095 --> 02:01.517
that is when the relationship gets closer. 


02:01.517 --> 02:03.852
And then you get to know him more and more 


02:03.852 --> 02:07.000
as you go through the Bible, 
as you learn scriptures.


02:08.273 --> 02:12.276
And now that emptiness that I had felt prior 


02:12.277 --> 02:16.032
was beginning to fill up. 


02:16.032 --> 02:18.825
And as you come to know Jehovah, 


02:18.825 --> 02:22.000
then you not only have your emptiness filled, 


02:23.163 --> 02:25.790
you’re beginning to bubble over, 


02:25.790 --> 02:33.737
and now you want to share it with others.

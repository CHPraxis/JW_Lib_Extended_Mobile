00:04 My whole life I wanted to be a teacher.
00:07 It was very gratifying,
00:10 but yet there was something that was
00:15 empty in my life.
00:17 I would see children that were disabled
00:21 —not because they had done anything wrong—
00:25 they were just born that way.
00:28 And I thought to myself:
00:29 ‘That doesn’t make sense to me.
00:33 ‘God is a God of love.
00:36 ‘I knew God could fix all these things.
00:40 Why hasn’t he?’
00:42 And then it was a child in my school
00:46 that successfully got me  the answers to my questions.
00:51 She asked me the questions:
00:54 “Do you know I’m one of Jehovah’s Witnesses?
00:57 Would you like to know more  about Jehovah’s Witnesses?”
01:01 And I thought to myself:
01:03 ‘I do.  I really do.’
01:06 “Why don’t you come over  and visit me someday
01:08 and tell me about Jehovah’s Witnesses.”
01:12 When she came back the next week,  I sat there and listened
01:16 and she taught me things.
01:18 She taught me how to look into my own Bible
01:22 to find the answers to questions.
01:26 And all of a sudden,
01:30 I’m getting answer after answer after answer,
01:34 which for 25 years  I couldn’t find these answers anywhere.
01:40 And it was amazing to me.
01:43 And I said,  “Yes, this is the way it should be.”
01:48 How do you get a close relationship with God?
01:52 First thing, you learn his name.
01:54 And after you know his name,
01:57 that is when the relationship gets closer.
02:01 And then you get to know him more and more
02:03 as you go through the Bible,  as you learn scriptures.
02:08 And now that emptiness that I had felt prior
02:12 was beginning to fill up.
02:16 And as you come to know Jehovah,
02:18 then you not only have your emptiness filled,
02:23 you’re beginning to bubble over,
02:25 and now you want to share it with others.

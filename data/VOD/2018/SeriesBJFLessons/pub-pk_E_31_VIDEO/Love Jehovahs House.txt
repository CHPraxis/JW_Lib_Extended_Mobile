00:08 Oh, Caleb, do you remember  where Samuel served?
00:12 Uh,
00:13 the tabernacle?
00:15 Good!
00:17 That was like his house.
00:19 But it was also Jehovah’s house.
00:22 How do you think he treated it?
00:24 Oh, he kept it clean!
00:27 That’s right!
00:30 The Kingdom Hall is like Jehovah’s house too.
00:33 How should we treat it?
00:35 Mmm, oh!
00:56 Whew!
00:57 Nice job, Caleb!
00:58 When we keep the Kingdom Hall clean,
01:00 we show Jehovah that we love him.

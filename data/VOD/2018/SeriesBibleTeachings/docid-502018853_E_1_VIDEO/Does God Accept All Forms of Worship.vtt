Many people believe that it doesn’t matter

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which religion you choose,

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:13.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that religions are
like different roads that lead

00:00:13.993 --> 00:00:16.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the same destination

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:18.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—lasting blessings from God.

00:00:19.456 --> 00:00:21.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But can that be true?

00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:24.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does God accept all forms of worship?

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible itself
describes worship as two roads:

00:00:30.426 --> 00:00:33.053 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
One is spacious with many people on it.

00:00:33.053 --> 00:00:35.055 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The other is cramped

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:37.099 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with only a few finding it.

00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:39.768 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Only the cramped road

00:00:39.768 --> 00:00:41.812 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
represents acceptable worship,

00:00:41.812 --> 00:00:44.607 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
leading to life and blessings from God.

00:00:45.316 --> 00:00:46.692 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
How can we tell

00:00:46.692 --> 00:00:48.903 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
if we are on the correct path?

00:00:51.614 --> 00:00:53.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine that you’re lost.

00:00:53.824 --> 00:00:56.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You stop someone to ask for directions.

00:00:57.786 --> 00:01:01.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One person says to head east;

00:01:01.248 --> 00:01:03.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
another says to go west.

00:01:04.877 --> 00:01:07.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, someone with a map shows you

00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:10.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the destination is actually north.

00:01:12.927 --> 00:01:15.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which one would you believe?

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:20.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible is like that map,

00:01:20.976 --> 00:01:24.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
leading us to blessings from God.

00:01:24.563 --> 00:01:27.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why are there so many conflicting beliefs?

00:01:29.777 --> 00:01:31.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:34.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many religions teach that the human soul

00:01:34.657 --> 00:01:37.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lives eternally in a spiritual realm,

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while others believe that they are reborn

00:01:41.747 --> 00:01:43.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in another body or form.

00:01:47.127 --> 00:01:49.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is just one example

00:01:49.421 --> 00:01:52.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the many religious beliefs
in conflict with one another.

00:01:53.634 --> 00:01:56.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could all religions
really be teaching the truth?

00:01:57.888 --> 00:01:59.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
According to the “map,”

00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:04.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the dead know nothing at all.

00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:09.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In due time,
God will restore them to life

00:02:09.316 --> 00:02:13.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and righteous ones
will live forever on earth.

00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:19.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the Bible is clear on this teaching,

00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:22.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what about other matters,
such as our personal conduct?

00:02:23.664 --> 00:02:26.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may belong to a religion,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but if our conduct offends God,

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:30.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our worship may be futile.

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:35.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible teaches that many people today

00:02:35.384 --> 00:02:37.928 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
would be “without self-control,

00:02:37.928 --> 00:02:39.972 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“fierce,

00:02:39.972 --> 00:02:42.599 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
without love of goodness.”

00:02:44.893 --> 00:02:47.521 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
However, it also says

00:02:47.521 --> 00:02:49.231 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that true worshippers of God

00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:51.859 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
would be peaceable,

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:55.195 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
controlling their speech

00:02:55.195 --> 00:02:57.197 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and actions.

00:02:58.615 --> 00:03:00.284 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Rather than saying

00:03:00.284 --> 00:03:03.120 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
there are many religions that please God,

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.621 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Bible says

00:03:04.621 --> 00:03:06.623 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
there is only one faith.

00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:10.169 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
True worship leads a person

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:12.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a good relationship with God

00:03:12.963 --> 00:03:15.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and everlasting life.

00:03:15.966 --> 00:03:17.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may wonder:

00:03:17.968 --> 00:03:21.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How can you find the true religion?

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:26.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Must you belong to an organized religion
to please God?’

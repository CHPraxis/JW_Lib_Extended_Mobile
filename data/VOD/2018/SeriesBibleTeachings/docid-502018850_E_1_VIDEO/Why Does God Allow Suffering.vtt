00:00:12.575 --> 00:00:15.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why does God allow suffering?

00:00:17.705 --> 00:00:21.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah God didn’t intend
for humans to suffer.

00:00:22.752 --> 00:00:24.754 line:10% position:50% align:center
On the contrary,

00:00:24.754 --> 00:00:26.964 line:10% position:50% align:center
he gave the first human couple

00:00:26.964 --> 00:00:28.966 line:10% position:50% align:center
a wonderful start.

00:00:32.386 --> 00:00:35.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Satan, a rebel angel,

00:00:35.056 --> 00:00:37.058 line:10% position:50% align:center
called God a liar

00:00:37.058 --> 00:00:39.060 line:10% position:50% align:center
and influenced the first humans

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.062 line:10% position:50% align:center
to reject God’s authority.

00:00:42.688 --> 00:00:45.107 line:10% position:50% align:center
When Adam and Eve disobeyed God,

00:00:45.107 --> 00:00:47.193 line:10% position:50% align:center
they chose to follow Satan.

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:50.071 line:10% position:50% align:center
They rebelled against Jehovah

00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:52.073 line:10% position:50% align:center
and decided for themselves

00:00:52.073 --> 00:00:54.075 line:10% position:50% align:center
what was right and wrong.

00:00:56.285 --> 00:00:58.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was Satan correct?

00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:01.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could humans rule themselves successfully

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:03.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
without help from God?

00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:05.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Time would be needed to settle

00:01:05.753 --> 00:01:08.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
the crucial issues raised by the rebels.

00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:12.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
To illustrate:

00:01:12.135 --> 00:01:14.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
A rebellious student claims

00:01:14.303 --> 00:01:17.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the teacher’s method of instruction
is wrong.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
He insists that he knows a much better way.

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some students think that he is right,

00:01:25.315 --> 00:01:27.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they also become rebellious.

00:01:29.444 --> 00:01:31.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
What should the teacher do?

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:36.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has the authority
to reprimand the rebellious students.

00:01:36.284 --> 00:01:38.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what effect would that choice have

00:01:38.703 --> 00:01:40.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the other students?

00:01:40.747 --> 00:01:43.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
They may lose respect for the teacher,

00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:46.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
thinking that he is afraid
of being proved wrong.

00:01:47.295 --> 00:01:49.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
But suppose the teacher allows

00:01:49.297 --> 00:01:51.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
the student to show the class <i>his</i>  method.

00:01:53.051 --> 00:01:55.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then it would be proved to all present

00:01:55.762 --> 00:01:57.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is qualified to teach.

00:02:06.815 --> 00:02:09.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has done something similar

00:02:09.234 --> 00:02:11.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
to what the teacher does.

00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:14.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Satan challenged Jehovah,

00:02:14.531 --> 00:02:17.284 line:10% position:50% align:center
millions of angels were watching.

00:02:17.284 --> 00:02:19.869 line:10% position:50% align:center
How Jehovah handled the rebellion

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:22.998 line:10% position:50% align:center
would greatly affect all those angels

00:02:22.998 --> 00:02:26.167 line:10% position:50% align:center
and eventually all intelligent creation.

00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:29.379 line:10% position:50% align:center
Knowing this, Jehovah allowed Satan

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.382 line:10% position:50% align:center
to rule this world for a time.

00:02:32.382 --> 00:02:34.676 line:10% position:50% align:center
Satan’s rule has caused

00:02:34.676 --> 00:02:37.137 line:10% position:50% align:center
untold pain and suffering.

00:02:37.137 --> 00:02:38.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
However,

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
once Jehovah’s right and ability to rule

00:02:41.141 --> 00:02:44.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
is established beyond any doubt,

00:02:44.144 --> 00:02:46.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will undo

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.608 line:10% position:50% align:center
all the damage caused by Satan’s rebellion.

00:02:50.442 --> 00:02:52.444 line:10% position:50% align:center
At that time,

00:02:52.444 --> 00:02:53.862 line:10% position:50% align:center
only people who choose

00:02:53.862 --> 00:02:55.489 line:10% position:50% align:center
to follow God’s standards

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.491 line:10% position:50% align:center
will inhabit the earth.

00:02:59.034 --> 00:03:01.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Until then,

00:03:01.036 --> 00:03:03.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
how can you cope with suffering?

00:03:04.873 --> 00:03:07.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where can you find comfort?

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.673 line:90% position:50% align:center

00:01.785 --> 00:03.853
This is a report of the branch visit 


00:03.853 --> 00:07.656
to the Central America branch and Cuba, 


00:07.657 --> 00:09.225
in April. 


00:09.225 --> 00:11.393
My wife, Jean, and I 


00:11.393 --> 00:13.596
had the privilege to visit the Bethel 


00:13.597 --> 00:16.265
in Mexico City and then, after that, 


00:16.265 --> 00:19.535
the Bethel in Havana. 


00:19.535 --> 00:24.440
At Haggai 2:7 the words of Jehovah state: 


00:24.440 --> 00:27.743
“‘And I will shake all the nations, 


00:27.743 --> 00:30.346
“‘and the precious things 


00:30.347 --> 00:33.215
“‘of all the nations will come in; 


00:33.215 --> 00:36.018
and I will fill this house with glory,’ 


00:36.018 --> 00:39.321
says Jehovah of armies.” 


00:39.322 --> 00:41.590
In this part of the world, 


00:41.590 --> 00:44.560
hundreds of thousands of people 


00:44.560 --> 00:47.230
are flocking to Jehovah. 


00:47.230 --> 00:51.600
And currently, 
there are over one million preachers 


00:51.600 --> 00:54.903
who regularly bring glory to His house. 


00:54.903 --> 00:57.373
These two branches are responsible 


00:57.373 --> 01:00.943
to care for the spiritual needs of people 


01:00.943 --> 01:05.248
in Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, 


01:05.248 --> 01:09.151
Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, 


01:09.152 --> 01:13.000
Panama, Mexico, and Cuba.


01:14.223 --> 01:16.960
In all these places, there are many people 


01:16.960 --> 01:19.462
who are really precious to Jehovah. 


01:19.462 --> 01:21.899
What makes them precious? 


01:21.898 --> 01:24.500
They are fully devoted to Jehovah, 


01:24.500 --> 01:27.870
and they display 
qualities that he appreciates 


01:27.870 --> 01:30.673
—qualities that mean a lot to him. 


01:30.673 --> 01:34.043
Let us introduce you to some of them. 


01:34.043 --> 01:36.045
Each experience is summarized 


01:36.045 --> 01:39.215
by one of the qualities precious to Jehovah. 


01:39.215 --> 01:43.787
Please note them 
as we briefly relate their stories.


01:43.787 --> 01:46.755
The first experience 
is about the brothers and sisters 


01:46.755 --> 01:50.260
in the Rio Coco Miskito congregation, 
in Asang. 


01:50.260 --> 01:54.297
The publishers in that village 
wanted to go up the river 


01:54.297 --> 01:58.735
to preach to people 
in that very remote part of Nicaragua. 


01:58.735 --> 02:02.172
But they did not have 
the money to buy a boat. 


02:02.172 --> 02:05.175
They found a big tree that had fallen, 


02:05.175 --> 02:10.680
cut it up, hollowed it out, 
and made a boat out of it. 


02:10.680 --> 02:15.685
It took 50 of them 
just to move this boat into the water. 


02:15.685 --> 02:19.522
Then they went up the river 
into those remote villages 


02:19.522 --> 02:21.859
to preach to the people. 


02:21.858 --> 02:24.426
Guess what they used? 


02:24.427 --> 02:25.962
—electronic tablets. 


02:25.962 --> 02:28.197
Wherever they went they showed the people 


02:28.197 --> 02:30.200
the new video publications 


02:30.200 --> 02:34.170
in the Miskito language using their tablets. 


02:34.170 --> 02:37.007
They gave a tremendous witness. 


02:37.007 --> 02:41.144
So even though they 
used ancient technology to travel 


02:41.143 --> 02:43.145
to these remote places, 


02:43.145 --> 02:45.215
they used the latest technology 


02:45.215 --> 02:47.217
to preach once they got there. 


02:47.217 --> 02:49.885
These brothers and sisters are very creative, 


02:49.885 --> 02:52.455
and they make the most of their resources 


02:52.455 --> 02:55.325
to accomplish what needs to be done. 


02:55.325 --> 02:59.162
The next story is a story of determination. 


02:59.162 --> 03:02.365
In Mexico there is a young girl, 8 years old, 


03:02.365 --> 03:05.602
named Zurisadai Moreno Humarán. 


03:05.602 --> 03:07.904
She was diagnosed with leukemia 


03:07.903 --> 03:10.840
and went through a tortuous path of going 


03:10.840 --> 03:14.077
to many different doctors and hospitals 


03:14.077 --> 03:17.480
where people tried to force blood on her. 


03:17.480 --> 03:22.418
Of course, the Hospital Liaison Committee 
was working hard to help. 


03:22.418 --> 03:25.355
Zuri was flown all over the country 


03:25.355 --> 03:28.758
looking for a doctor to treat her, 


03:28.758 --> 03:32.528
and eventually she was able 
to get the right treatment. 


03:32.528 --> 03:35.531
She made a strong stand for Jehovah, 


03:35.532 --> 03:37.800
defending her faith. 


03:37.800 --> 03:41.537
She was going 
to obey Jehovah no matter what. 


03:41.537 --> 03:43.840
While all of this was happening, 


03:43.840 --> 03:46.075
she decided to get baptized. 


03:46.075 --> 03:50.247
She could not do all of this 
without her parents and family. 


03:50.247 --> 03:54.000
Her face gleams with determination, 
doesn’t it?


03:55.485 --> 03:57.787
A circuit overseer in El Salvador 


03:57.787 --> 04:00.657
told this experience: 


04:00.657 --> 04:03.000
“One time after I finished accompanying 
publishers on Bible studies, 


04:04.560 --> 04:08.000
“we said good-bye, 
and I went down another street. 


04:09.198 --> 04:11.935
“A group of gang members 
came out of a house. 


04:11.935 --> 04:16.940
“I immediately went into the nearest house 
to avoid a confrontation. 


04:16.940 --> 04:21.343
“I was so glad that the householder 
kindly told me to come inside. 


04:21.343 --> 04:23.411
“I began to preach to her. 


04:23.412 --> 04:25.615
“The lady patiently listened to me. 


04:25.615 --> 04:30.420
“About an hour later, 
they either got bored or tired and left. 


04:30.420 --> 04:35.758
So I took advantage 
of the opportunity and left right away.”


04:35.758 --> 04:39.561
The following experience 
illustrates how the fear of God 


04:39.562 --> 04:42.899
can motivate us to do the right thing. 


04:42.898 --> 04:45.033
In a small village in Mexico, 


04:45.033 --> 04:47.170
about 2,000 people got together 


04:47.170 --> 04:50.507
and expelled 
the Witnesses from their village. 


04:50.507 --> 04:53.075
They were forced out of their homes 


04:53.075 --> 04:55.277
and were not allowed 
to bring their possessions. 


04:55.277 --> 04:57.947
Among them were grandparents, parents, 


04:57.947 --> 05:00.484
little children, and even babies. 


05:00.483 --> 05:03.051
They were forced into cars and trucks 


05:03.052 --> 05:05.054
and driven out of the village 


05:05.053 --> 05:07.156
and dropped off in the mountains. 


05:07.157 --> 05:09.259
That night was a cold night. 


05:09.258 --> 05:12.261
They were shivering; they had no food, 


05:12.262 --> 05:15.432
but they trusted in Jehovah.


05:15.432 --> 05:17.434
I have felt fear, 


05:17.433 --> 05:19.668
but it’s a fear of not doing Jehovah’s will, 


05:19.668 --> 05:21.970
because many lives would be lost. 


05:21.970 --> 05:24.640
Many people 
would remain in spiritual darkness. 


05:24.640 --> 05:27.410
They would not come to know Jehovah. 


05:27.410 --> 05:30.913
So the next day, 
he and his family went back to the village 


05:30.913 --> 05:32.948
they had been thrown out of 


05:32.948 --> 05:35.183
and spoke to the leading men there. 


05:35.183 --> 05:38.586
These men agreed that they could come back. 


05:38.587 --> 05:41.090
The brothers all came home, 


05:41.090 --> 05:44.427
and now the congregation 
is flourishing in this village, 


05:44.427 --> 05:48.000
and the brothers 
freely preach from door to door.


05:49.498 --> 05:51.900
Many young people have left behind 


05:51.900 --> 05:54.770
opportunities for higher education. 


05:54.770 --> 05:58.273
They’ve stepped out of the boat 
and walked on water. 


05:58.273 --> 06:02.045
They left behind 
so-called security and safety, 


06:02.045 --> 06:04.313
and they put their lives in Jehovah’s hands. 


06:04.313 --> 06:06.815
Even though they’ve chosen to give up 


06:06.815 --> 06:10.152
some comforts of life 
to serve in remote areas, 


06:10.152 --> 06:15.000
they are happy and live fulfilling lives.


06:16.892 --> 06:19.229
Having our minds focused on the ministry 


06:19.228 --> 06:21.896
has helped us as a young couple. 


06:21.897 --> 06:24.767
It’s helped us 
not to set materialistic goals, 


06:24.767 --> 06:28.604
which would enslave us 
to work toward financial goals, 


06:28.603 --> 06:31.006
but rather to think about the ministry. 


06:31.007 --> 06:34.727
I learned that if you put 
all your energies into this world, 


06:34.727 --> 06:37.000
the world will only use 
them to its convenience. 


06:39.248 --> 06:41.350
But if you use it for Jehovah, 


06:41.350 --> 06:45.765
he will help you feel full 
and he will give meaning to your life.


06:45.765 --> 06:49.225
Next, we went to Cuba. 


06:49.225 --> 06:51.677
Cuba is a beautiful place. 


06:51.677 --> 06:54.180
Although, at this time, 
Cuba may not be known 


06:54.180 --> 06:56.415
for its physical riches, 


06:56.415 --> 07:00.987
it is full 
of the most amazing spiritual riches 


07:00.987 --> 07:04.974
—what Jehovah calls 
‘the precious things of the nations.’ 


07:04.973 --> 07:08.000
Most of our brothers 
do not have much in a material way, 


07:09.378 --> 07:12.981
but they are happy 
as they work hard to give Jehovah 


07:12.982 --> 07:15.000
their very best. 


07:15.000 --> 07:17.903
Spiritually, they are rich. 


07:17.903 --> 07:22.425
Despite many challenges, 
they have around 96,000 publishers, 


07:22.425 --> 07:25.978
and many more are coming into the truth. 


07:25.978 --> 07:30.000
While they cannot have Kingdom Halls, 
they do have meeting places. 


07:31.983 --> 07:35.000
The following pictures 
show the outside of a meeting place, 


07:36.288 --> 07:38.373
and then a view of the inside. 


07:38.373 --> 07:41.743
It might not be impressive 
from the physical perspective, 


07:41.743 --> 07:46.731
but all of them are precious to Jehovah. 


07:46.732 --> 07:48.869
The amazing thing is that even though 


07:48.868 --> 07:51.736
these brothers do not have much materially, 


07:51.737 --> 07:55.525
they are able to offer 
part of their property as a meeting place. 


07:55.525 --> 07:57.777
Under Cuban law, you inherit property 


07:57.777 --> 08:00.980
from your parents, and so on. 


08:00.980 --> 08:03.215
Sometimes it’s just a hallway, a room, 


08:03.215 --> 08:06.000
or an attachment at the back of the house. 


08:07.730 --> 08:11.273
Fifty or sixty publishers 
can fit into these small places. 


08:11.273 --> 08:14.793
But the point 
is that they have meeting places, 


08:14.793 --> 08:18.000
and they are able 
to have all the meetings. 


08:19.432 --> 08:22.017
A remarkable feature of Cuba 


08:22.017 --> 08:26.689
is that vintage cars 
are used as taxis and family cars. 


08:26.688 --> 08:28.690
But the brothers 


08:28.690 --> 08:30.877
are up-to-date with JW Broadcasting 


08:30.877 --> 08:32.879
and convention videos. 


08:32.878 --> 08:34.180
For example, 


08:34.180 --> 08:37.833
at the weekly Christian Life 
and Ministry meetings, 


08:37.833 --> 08:40.570
the videos are used as normal. 


08:40.570 --> 08:42.572
They have it all. 


08:42.572 --> 08:45.000
How do they do that 
without much Internet access? 


08:46.242 --> 08:48.244
This is how: 


08:48.243 --> 08:50.813
The few brothers 
who do have some Internet access 


08:50.813 --> 08:52.815
make copies of the programs. 


08:52.815 --> 08:56.385
Then they copy them 
from phone, to phone, to phone. 


08:56.385 --> 08:59.372
Everybody seems to have a cell phone. 


08:59.372 --> 09:02.375
Maybe some of the phones don’t have video, 


09:02.375 --> 09:04.377
but at least they have sound. 


09:04.377 --> 09:08.030
When they go to the meeting, 
they play the program on the TV screen, 


09:08.030 --> 09:12.000
and everyone gets 
the full benefit of the program.


09:13.997 --> 09:17.490
Among Jehovah’s precious people in Cuba 


09:17.490 --> 09:19.992
are six brothers and sisters 


09:19.992 --> 09:22.745
who are both deaf and blind. 


09:22.745 --> 09:25.147
Two deaf and blind sisters 


09:25.147 --> 09:27.750
came to Bethel for an interview. 


09:27.750 --> 09:30.352
It was amazing to watch 


09:30.352 --> 09:34.000
when they met for the first time. 


09:35.147 --> 09:38.317
The brothers translate 
the study edition of The Watchtower 


09:38.317 --> 09:40.897
into Cuban Sign Language. 


09:40.897 --> 09:44.380
One local census taken 
by our brothers suggests 


09:44.380 --> 09:47.880
that about 1 in 5 deaf people 
that we have encountered 


09:47.880 --> 09:52.097
is studying the Bible 
with Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


09:52.097 --> 09:57.197
This couple, 
who assist with translation, are both deaf.


09:57.197 --> 10:00.935
The “precious things” 
of Central America and Cuba 


10:00.935 --> 10:03.668
are indeed praising Jehovah. 


10:03.668 --> 10:06.871
They are fully devoted to serving Jehovah, 


10:06.872 --> 10:09.575
and they always seem to be smiling. 


10:09.575 --> 10:12.110
At meetings and at larger gatherings, 


10:12.110 --> 10:16.347
it is evident that they know who they are 


10:16.347 --> 10:21.954
and that they represent Jehovah worthily. 


10:21.953 --> 10:25.240
These precious ones truly appreciate 


10:25.240 --> 10:29.162
all the provisions 
from Jehovah’s temple arrangement. 


10:29.162 --> 10:32.532
And currently, they are helping 


10:32.532 --> 10:36.735
about one and a half million Bible students 


10:36.735 --> 10:39.772
to bring praise and glory to Jehovah’s name. 


10:39.772 --> 10:42.459
And the brothers 
at these two branches asked us 


10:42.458 --> 10:52.751
to bring to you 
their love and deep affection.

00:00:05 ‎Many people live their entire lives
00:00:08 ‎without ever being affected  by a natural disaster.
00:00:12 ‎It can be easy to forget
00:00:15 ‎that your life  can literally change overnight.
00:00:40 ‎Recently, here in California,  our brothers and sisters in numerous areas
00:00:45 ‎have had to flee for their lives
00:00:47 ‎because of firestorms
00:00:49 ‎coming in right behind them.
00:00:51 ‎Literally, for some, it was within minutes
00:00:53 ‎—racing for their lives
00:00:55 ‎either in their car, some on foot—
00:00:57 ‎with flames, towering flames
00:01:00 ‎and intense heat right behind them.
00:01:04 ‎I’ve never seen anything like it.
00:01:07 ‎When I left the house,
00:01:09 ‎the roar of the fire coming over the hill
00:01:14 ‎was unbelievable.
00:01:17 ‎One of our close friends  stepped out onto his balcony
00:01:20 ‎and noticed a glow on the hillside,
00:01:23 ‎and he gave my wife a call and said,
00:01:24 ‎“Did you know that there’s a fire?”
00:01:53 ‎After the fire, a dear friend said:
00:01:56 ‎“Don’t worry about anything.
00:01:59 ‎We’re going to give you all that you need.”
00:02:01 ‎And I broke down in tears,
00:02:03 ‎just knowing what was about to happen.
00:02:08 ‎Because we have Jehovah as our Shepherd,
00:02:10 ‎he will give us everything we need.
00:02:12 ‎And we have seen that.
00:02:13 ‎Those words have come true because our brothers and sisters
00:02:15 ‎have cared for us so beautifully,
00:02:17 ‎beyond anything we ever expected.
00:02:21 ‎I’m a builder myself,
00:02:23 ‎and I feel like I just want to get  in there and do something.
00:02:26 ‎But the friends need spirituality,
00:02:29 ‎and so if we help them with that,
00:02:31 ‎they’ll get through the rest of it.
00:02:34 ‎Well, the United States branch office
00:02:36 ‎is very concerned
00:02:37 ‎for our brothers and sisters spiritually
00:02:40 ‎and making sure that they can get back  to their worship to Jehovah God.
00:02:43 ‎So today we’re here to encourage them,
00:02:45 ‎to really acknowledge  what they’ve gone through,
00:02:47 ‎and to make sure that they’re getting  the spiritual attention they need
00:02:50 ‎—the encouragement that, really,
00:02:52 ‎the organization  and their brothers want to give them.
00:02:57 ‎Just like a literal shepherd
00:02:59 ‎would want to care  for the needs of their sheep
00:03:02 ‎—especially an injured one—
00:03:04 ‎we want to do the same thing  for the members of our congregation,
00:03:08 ‎but we take it a step further.
00:03:10 ‎We want to care for them emotionally,
00:03:12 ‎spiritually, and physically.
00:03:16 ‎Jehovah has made us a people
00:03:19 ‎who care for one another.
00:03:22 ‎And generally speaking,  the comfort he provides
00:03:24 ‎and the things we need  are almost always delivered by people.
00:03:30 ‎And it’s at the congregation that we can have
00:03:31 ‎that kind of comfort and support
00:03:34 ‎given to us that’s going to help us recover.
00:03:46 ‎Working in disaster relief efforts,
00:03:49 ‎you really begin to see
00:03:51 ‎just how much Jehovah cares  for the human race
00:03:56 ‎—how much he cares for people.
00:03:59 ‎You’ll see people who will drop anything
00:04:02 ‎to come and rally to the aid
00:04:05 ‎of brothers and sisters  of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:04:08 ‎But they’ll rally to the aid  of someone next door too,
00:04:11 ‎and that’s a manifestation
00:04:13 ‎of the way Jehovah feels about people.
00:04:19 ‎Being prepared for a natural disaster,
00:04:22 ‎ourselves and our families,
00:04:24 ‎is not just a matter of personal safety.
00:04:27 ‎This gets to the core of our spirituality.
00:04:31 ‎How much do we truly value life?
00:04:34 ‎How much do we truly value  what Jehovah has given us?
00:04:40 ‎In a disaster, you hear people say,  “I’ve lost everything”
00:04:44 ‎—not among Jehovah’s people.
00:04:46 ‎We never lose everything.
00:04:48 ‎We may lose material possessions;  we may even lose loved ones;
00:04:52 ‎but when we have Jehovah,  we never lose everything.

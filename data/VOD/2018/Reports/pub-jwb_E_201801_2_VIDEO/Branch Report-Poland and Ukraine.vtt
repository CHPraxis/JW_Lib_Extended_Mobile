00:01.772 --> 00:05.860
We departed JFK Airport 
on the evening of April 22 


00:05.860 --> 00:08.695
and arrived in Warsaw, Poland, 
the next day.


00:08.695 --> 00:11.323
Though parts of Warsaw date back 


00:11.323 --> 00:14.660
to the medieval period 
in the 13th and 14th centuries, 


00:14.660 --> 00:17.747
it is very much a modern city. 


00:17.747 --> 00:21.625
Shiny, new skyscrapers have mushroomed.


00:21.625 --> 00:23.710
As in every large city, 


00:23.710 --> 00:28.173
Warsaw’s inhabitants have to deal 
with heavy traffic and noise. 


00:28.173 --> 00:31.676
So how refreshing it was 
to arrive at the branch office 


00:31.677 --> 00:36.000
located in a small village 
a few miles southwest of Warsaw! 


00:37.348 --> 00:41.000
It is an attractive complex of buildings 
with a beautifully designed courtyard.


00:42.187 --> 00:47.000
It was a pleasure to meet the 148 members 
of the Bethel family in their departments


00:48.818 --> 00:51.363
—such as the Laundry Department, 


00:51.363 --> 00:54.198
the sign-language department, 


00:54.198 --> 00:57.035
and the Broadcasting Department.


00:57.035 --> 01:00.497
The Translation Department 
has been very busy 


01:00.497 --> 01:03.125
translating in three new languages 


01:03.125 --> 01:07.128
—Kashubian, Silesian, and Romany. 


01:07.128 --> 01:12.008
They produced the video Why Study the Bible? 
in these local languages. 


01:12.008 --> 01:16.263
It was thrilling to see people 
watching the video in their mother tongue 


01:16.263 --> 01:18.848
with tears in their eyes. 


01:18.848 --> 01:21.560
In March 2016, 


01:21.560 --> 01:25.480
publishers in a small town preached 
among the community of Roma people, 


01:25.480 --> 01:28.108
inviting them to the Memorial. 


01:28.108 --> 01:32.821
Twenty-four of them came, 
or every fourth person in the town. 


01:32.822 --> 01:35.657
The talk given in Romany was transmitted 


01:35.657 --> 01:38.327
from a congregation in London. 


01:38.327 --> 01:39.912
They were touched. 


01:39.912 --> 01:42.247
One young Roma man told the brothers: 


01:42.247 --> 01:44.417
“This has reached my heart. 


01:44.417 --> 01:48.000
I would like to become God’s servant, 
to be God’s child.”


01:50.130 --> 01:53.633
Though a large percentage 
of the Bethel family is young in years, 


01:53.633 --> 01:55.635
the old-timers are treasured 


01:55.635 --> 01:59.000
for their very rich history 
of faithfulness under trial.


02:00.432 --> 02:03.810
Here are two widows, from left to right, 


02:03.810 --> 02:06.855
Zofia Scheider and Aniela Adach. 


02:06.855 --> 02:10.233
They were able to assist Alice 
to identify brothers and sisters 


02:10.233 --> 02:14.321
in a photo of the Bethel family 
taken in 1992. 


02:14.322 --> 02:17.867
Both sisters’ husbands 
had taken the lead 


02:17.867 --> 02:20.000
in the Polish field 
for many decades while under ban.


02:21.578 --> 02:24.956
Sister Adach herself 
was imprisoned three times. 


02:24.957 --> 02:29.000
How did she keep herself strong 
during those difficult times? 


02:31.130 --> 02:35.133
She persistently prayed, and when she 
was permitted to go to the library, 


02:35.133 --> 02:37.635
she eagerly read the Bible there 


02:37.635 --> 02:40.888
and would even memorize whole chapters. 


02:40.888 --> 02:45.435
You could not help but be inspired 
by these loyal, humble sisters 


02:45.435 --> 02:48.605
whose faith conquered the world.


02:48.605 --> 02:50.607
On Saturday, April 30, 


02:50.607 --> 02:54.000
we traveled to the Warsaw Assembly Hall 
for the special meeting. 


02:55.028 --> 03:00.033
Practically the whole country 
was tied in by streaming via the Internet. 


03:00.033 --> 03:06.915
The total attendance was 118,725. 


03:06.915 --> 03:10.418
Has the newer generation 
of Witnesses in Poland 


03:10.418 --> 03:15.006
fully entered the ‘door of activity’ 
opened to them in May 1989 


03:15.007 --> 03:18.344
when Witnesses were legally recognized? 


03:18.343 --> 03:22.263
The Branch Committee confirmed that in 1989 


03:22.263 --> 03:25.266
there were 91,000 Kingdom publishers. 


03:25.267 --> 03:29.270
Today, there are over 122,000. 


03:29.270 --> 03:31.690
There is good potential for further growth, 


03:31.690 --> 03:35.985
since 191,524 


03:35.985 --> 03:38.000
attended the last Memorial. 


03:39.197 --> 03:44.119
Also, many young ones are being taught 
to love Jehovah by their God-fearing parents. 


03:44.118 --> 03:46.996
Young ones 
are mustering up boldness to witness, 


03:46.997 --> 03:49.249
as this experience illustrates.


03:49.248 --> 03:51.585
Natalie, a regular pioneer, 


03:51.585 --> 03:57.423
studies the Bible with a woman 
who has an 11-year-old daughter, Michelle. 


03:57.423 --> 03:59.801
At school, Michelle was assigned to prepare 


03:59.802 --> 04:02.847
a presentation on a religion of her choice. 


04:02.847 --> 04:07.059
Well, her mother and father 
grew up in families of Witnesses 


04:07.058 --> 04:09.478
but never progressed to baptism. 


04:09.478 --> 04:13.106
Still, Michelle felt this was her religion. 


04:13.107 --> 04:16.819
She prepared slides 
and videos from our website. 


04:16.818 --> 04:19.530
Michelle’s teacher was so impressed 


04:19.530 --> 04:23.200
that she arranged for Natalie 
to come to further explain things. 


04:23.200 --> 04:26.495
Natalie conducted 
a question-and-answer session 


04:26.495 --> 04:30.582
based on the Awake! article 
in the first issue of 2016, 


04:30.582 --> 04:34.000
entitled “What Do You Know 
About Jehovah’s Witnesses?” 


04:35.170 --> 04:37.172
After the presentation, 


04:37.172 --> 04:41.009
all were invited to come 
to the Kingdom Hall for a guided tour. 


04:41.008 --> 04:45.013
Twenty children and two teachers 
came to the Kingdom Hall. 


04:45.013 --> 04:47.056
They were shown all its features. 


04:47.057 --> 04:50.852
They saw the video 
What Happens at a Kingdom Hall? 


04:50.852 --> 04:52.939
The children were allowed to use 


04:52.938 --> 04:55.000
the microphones to see 
what it’s like to give a comment. 


04:56.858 --> 05:00.945
Since they had also visited 
a mosque and a church, 


05:00.945 --> 05:03.157
they were asked 
what differences they noticed 


05:03.157 --> 05:06.785
between those places and the Kingdom Hall. 


05:06.785 --> 05:08.828
Their personal comments were very touching, 


05:08.828 --> 05:10.871
including one boy who stated, 


05:10.872 --> 05:14.042
“You’re so open to others.” 


05:14.042 --> 05:17.295
At the end, much literature was placed. 


05:17.295 --> 05:20.423
Eleven-year-old Michelle 
was very proud and happy. 


05:20.423 --> 05:24.000
Some students told her 
that her religion is “really cool.”


05:25.095 --> 05:29.000
It was time to say goodbye 
to the Poland Bethel family. 


05:30.142 --> 05:33.145
Our next stop was Lviv, Ukraine. 


05:33.145 --> 05:38.150
Lviv is considered 
Ukraine’s most cultural and elegant city. 


05:38.150 --> 05:43.863
Being more than 750 years old, 
it has a lot of history behind it.


05:43.863 --> 05:47.910
Just three miles north of Lviv, 
in the midst of a picturesque pine forest, 


05:47.910 --> 05:52.580
is the lovely Ukraine branch office. 


05:52.580 --> 05:56.000
The beautiful grounds are well maintained 
by commuters and Bethelites.


05:57.085 --> 05:59.170
We knew we were in for a wonderful visit 


05:59.170 --> 06:03.967
by the warm welcome 
that we received on our arrival. 


06:03.967 --> 06:05.969
The Branch Committee is thrilled to see 


06:05.968 --> 06:08.000
how Jehovah has blessed 
the work in this country.


06:09.263 --> 06:12.850
In 1991, 
we were officially registered in Ukraine. 


06:12.850 --> 06:16.772
The door had swung wide open 
for the preaching work. 


06:16.772 --> 06:20.775
At that time, 
there were about 25,000 publishers. 


06:20.775 --> 06:25.655
Have the brothers vigorously entered 
that ‘door of activity’ since that year? 


06:25.655 --> 06:27.657
They surely have. 


06:27.657 --> 06:32.037
Today, there are 141,000 publishers. 


06:32.037 --> 06:37.042
The 2016 Memorial attendance 
was over 242,000.


06:37.042 --> 06:39.670
Here you see the happy missionaries. 


06:39.670 --> 06:41.672
They have reason to be joyful, 


06:41.672 --> 06:44.424
considering the fertile territory 
in which they work.


06:44.423 --> 06:48.720
At the special meeting 
that originated in the Bethel auditorium, 


06:48.720 --> 06:52.598
Brother Calisto gave a report 
on the activity of the branch. 


06:52.598 --> 06:57.145
Especially noteworthy 
were his comments about eastern Ukraine.


06:57.145 --> 07:00.815
You likely remember that in 2014, 


07:00.815 --> 07:03.527
a conflict broke out in this region. 


07:03.527 --> 07:07.447
A cease-fire was declared in 2015, 


07:07.447 --> 07:11.410
but there is still 
much civil unrest and tension. 


07:11.410 --> 07:15.580
How have the almost 
10,000 publishers in this region fared?


07:15.580 --> 07:19.668
Brother Calisto interviewed 
one of the six courageous circuit overseers 


07:19.668 --> 07:21.670
who serve in eastern Ukraine, 


07:21.670 --> 07:26.675
Brother Ivan Nebera, 
and his equally courageous wife, Anna. 


07:26.675 --> 07:28.760
Brother Nebera informed us 


07:28.760 --> 07:31.347
that for the first time 
in two and a half years, 


07:31.347 --> 07:33.932
they were able to hold 
a meeting with the pioneers. 


07:33.932 --> 07:36.935
Look at those happy faces!


07:36.935 --> 07:39.103
Even though some of our dear brothers 


07:39.103 --> 07:43.150
must travel long distances 
to meet at their Kingdom Hall, 


07:43.150 --> 07:46.277
they do so to keep themselves built up. 


07:46.277 --> 07:50.115
For example, 
during Brother Nebera’s visit, 


07:50.115 --> 07:52.617
this 91-year-old sister, 


07:52.617 --> 07:55.120
though living far from the Kingdom Hall, 


07:55.120 --> 07:58.457
was present 
at all the morning groups for service 


07:58.457 --> 08:01.335
and then would go out again 
in the afternoons. 


08:01.335 --> 08:04.880
Her faithfulness 
is a blessing to the brothers.


08:04.880 --> 08:08.000
Many brothers live in areas 
where there is much devastation. 


08:09.633 --> 08:13.888
Ruined buildings and fences 
riddled with bullet holes 


08:13.888 --> 08:17.975
remind them 
of the presence of the military.


08:17.975 --> 08:20.562
Preaching from house to house has resumed, 


08:20.562 --> 08:25.734
and in some areas, 
public witnessing is possible. 


08:25.733 --> 08:28.861
Well, we were all encouraged by this report. 


08:28.862 --> 08:31.657
The special meeting talks 


08:31.657 --> 08:35.452
were translated simultaneously 
into five languages 


08:35.452 --> 08:38.580
and were transmitted 
to all the congregations 


08:38.580 --> 08:41.165
—including those in eastern Ukraine. 


08:41.165 --> 08:43.168
We were pleased to hear 


08:43.168 --> 08:45.920
that the final attendance figure 
for the special meeting 


08:45.920 --> 08:50.842
was 144,944.


08:50.842 --> 08:55.722
The spirit of the Ukraine Bethel family 
is outstanding! 


08:55.722 --> 08:59.184
There are many young ones, 
some relatively new in the truth 


08:59.183 --> 09:03.605
and others whose family members 
were exiled to Siberia 


09:03.605 --> 09:05.898
during Stalin’s time. 


09:05.898 --> 09:10.000
The special meal 
with the family included a chorus 


09:15.200 --> 09:18.912
and traditional Ukrainian folk dancing. 


09:18.912 --> 09:21.999
It was a happy time for all.


09:21.998 --> 09:25.501
So the day arrived for us to leave. 


09:25.502 --> 09:37.327
It was hard to leave these dear friends.

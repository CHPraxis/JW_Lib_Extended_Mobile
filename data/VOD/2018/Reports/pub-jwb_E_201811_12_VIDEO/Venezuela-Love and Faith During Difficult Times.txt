00:00:02 Welcome to this special news update
00:00:04 regarding our brothers in Venezuela.
00:00:07 As reported in the JW News section
00:00:10 of jw.org in August 2017,
00:00:14 our brothers in Venezuela are enduring difficult economic conditions.
00:00:19 Sadly, the overall situation continues to worsen.
00:00:24 Basic needs, like food and medicine,
00:00:27 are hard to obtain.
00:00:29 Violence and crime is on the increase.
00:00:32 Things are chaotic.
00:00:35 Because we love our worldwide brotherhood,
00:00:38 this difficult situation affects all of us.
00:00:42 As Paul said at 1 Corinthians 12:26:
00:00:47 “If one member suffers,
00:00:50 “all the other members suffer with it;
00:00:53 “or if a member is glorified,
00:00:55 all the other members rejoice with it.”
00:00:59 No doubt you pray regularly for our brothers in Venezuela.
00:01:04 Despite these difficult times,
00:01:07 how are our brothers doing spiritually?
00:01:10 We’re sure you’ll find the following report
00:01:12 to be sobering and encouraging.
00:01:16 Notice how, despite these difficult times,
00:01:19 our brothers in Venezuela are showing love and faith.
00:01:25 May this report  motivate all of us to continue having
00:01:29 “unity of mind, fellow feeling,
00:01:33 brotherly affection, [and] tender compassion,”
00:01:37 as 1 Peter 3:8 says.
00:01:56 It’s amazing to see how far the situation has gone,
00:01:59 and we are still at it.
00:02:01 So people in general have a lot of endurance,
00:02:05 and the brothers
00:02:07 —they endure.
00:02:09 They’re still cheerful.
00:02:11 They have to trust one another;
00:02:14 they have to rely on one another.
00:02:16 We gathered some statistics two months ago,
00:02:21 and we found out that in only three years,
00:02:23 7,000 publishers
00:02:26 —among them many elders, many pioneers—
00:02:30 have left the country because of the dangers.
00:02:33 They have felt threatened; some had been kidnapped,
00:02:37 let go, and then they left the country;
00:02:40 family members have been killed, and so on.
00:03:01 So one of the things we had to do with the local congregations
00:03:06 —which most of them  have quite a few Bethelite elders—
00:03:11 is move their meeting time on the weekdays
00:03:15 to an earlier hour so that the brothers can go to the meeting with daylight,
00:03:21 and sometimes they can go home after the meeting with some daylight.
00:03:26 If you go to some congregations that are well-to-do
00:03:30 (I’ve been to the place), you don’t see anyone at the meeting
00:03:33 with their cell phones or tablets.
00:03:36 And I said, “Why is that?”
00:03:38 Well, it’s not because they are afraid to lose it,
00:03:42 but they just don’t want to attract criminals into the Kingdom Hall.
00:03:46 And so for one tablet, all might suffer.
00:03:48 So you see, they’re learning to be streetwise even more,
00:03:53 because in Venezuela, you had to be streetwise
00:03:56 for a long time in the past,
00:03:58 but now it’s getting worse.
00:04:00 But the brotherhood in general don’t complain.
00:04:04 At least in my congregation,
00:04:06 you have to ask and you have to show real interest
00:04:10 so that the brothers and sisters can tell you what they’re going through.
00:04:14 I knocked on the door,
00:04:17 and the door opened just a little crack.
00:04:20 And the young man, when he saw me, opened the door wide, and we talked.
00:04:25 I asked him, “Have you ever read the Bible?”
00:04:27 He said, “Oh, when I was in prison, I read it a lot.”
00:04:31 He probably said that to see my reaction.
00:04:35 Well, we just kept talking and talking.
00:04:38 Behind him was another young man; he had a pistol in his hand.
00:04:43 I saw that, and I didn’t react.
00:04:45 He put the gun in his pocket,
00:04:48 and we kept talking for about 15-20 minutes.
00:04:51 When we went away, the brother that was with me was quite upset.
00:04:54 He said, “Do you know who that was?”
00:04:56 I said, “No.”
00:04:58 “That was one of the gang leaders.
00:05:00 He has killed a lot of people.”
00:05:03 I said: “Well, what I noticed is that he’s a human being just like the rest.
00:05:08 He needs the message.”
00:05:10 We have noticed, too, in the last few years,
00:05:14 an increase not only in publishers
00:05:18 but pioneers.
00:05:20 And who are starting to pioneer?
00:05:22 Well, as usual, mostly sisters, but many brothers,
00:05:26 many elders.
00:05:28 They may have had a good job;
00:05:31 they lost their job because the company closed down and left the country.
00:05:35 So many brothers have mentioned to me:
00:05:38 “Well, I lost my job; I have no job. Now I can pioneer.”
00:05:42 So they start pioneering.
00:05:44 And I think that’s very good, and it helps them to keep going.
00:05:48 I’m sure the brothers are happy to see that everybody cares
00:05:53 —everybody in the brotherhood worldwide.
00:05:55 The Governing Body is informed
00:05:59 and is doing all they physically can to help us
00:06:02 with their prayers.
00:06:04 So when you feel part of the worldwide brotherhood
00:06:08 —then you are not alone— that has a calming effect on you.
00:06:13 Your confidence, or faith,
00:06:15 in Jehovah’s organization
00:06:17 as a physical, visible organization, grows.
00:06:22 So we know we’re part of something bigger than just a country.
00:06:26 But this is putting to the test
00:06:29 how strong we will have faith in Bible principles.
00:06:32 We think they work,
00:06:35 but when they’re put to the test, then you’re convinced that they work.
00:06:39 And then I’m convinced that I will come out of this stronger.
00:06:43 That’s what James said
00:06:45 —that endurance needs to go to work in each one of us.
00:06:49 So if you view it that way,
00:06:51 then that gives you hope
00:06:53 that this sad and hard and difficult time
00:06:56 will make us better.
00:06:58 Nehemiah 8:10 says:
00:07:01 “Do not feel sad,
00:07:04 for the joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.”
00:07:07 So where is our strength?
00:07:10 In “the joy of Jehovah.”
00:07:12 I think we should always be positive,
00:07:15 not negative —not concentrate on the negative.
00:07:19 Like I quoted before, Nehemiah 8:10,
00:07:22 “the joy of Jehovah” —that’s what we see among the brothers.
00:07:26 The numbers came down because of the 7,000 that have left,
00:07:31 but the congregations keep reporting.
00:07:34 And the circuit overseers,  in their reports, keep showing us
00:07:37 that new people are still coming into the truth
00:07:39 —many new ones.
00:07:41 So that’s positive.
00:07:44 They’re not paralyzed because of that.
00:07:47 They keep focused on the Kingdom,
00:07:49 Jesus the King, and they keep going in that direction.
00:07:53 Anytime anyone looks to the side and looks at the storm,
00:07:57 he stops in his tracks;
00:07:59 he starts missing meetings;
00:08:02 he starts thinking about his wallet —his money, his bank account.
00:08:08 So that is not good.
00:08:10 Keep focused on the Kingdom.
00:08:20 We’re proud of you brothers in Venezuela
00:08:23 for keeping focused on spiritual things
00:08:26 and maintaining a positive spirit during these difficult times.
00:08:31 The reports show that of the 140,000 publishers in Venezuela,
00:08:36 over 30,000 are regular pioneers
00:08:39 and 9,000 are auxiliary pioneers.
00:08:43 On average, publishers spend 15 hours
00:08:47 in the ministry each month.
00:08:50 They’re conducting close to 200,000 Bible studies.
00:08:55 To illustrate the spirit of our brothers in Venezuela,
00:08:58 note these two comments from circuit overseers:
00:09:03 “Our brothers live in an area of extreme poverty and insecurity.
00:09:08 “Meeting attendance is excellent,
00:09:10 “although most of our brothers live far from the Kingdom Hall
00:09:14 “and have to walk for more than an hour.
00:09:17 The regularity in service is 100 percent.”
00:09:22 Another circuit overseer reported:
00:09:25 “Fifty percent of the publishers are regular pioneers.
00:09:29 “There are only two elders, but they are hardworking,
00:09:32 “humble, well-organized,
00:09:35 and a good example in the preaching and shepherding work.”
00:09:40 We’re encouraged by the love and faith that you brothers in Venezuela show.
00:09:47 Please know that we love you all very much.
00:09:54 We’re going to hear more about our brothers in Venezuela
00:09:58 in another special report that will be released
00:10:00 on Video on Demand on November 12, 2018.
00:10:04 The video is entitled Surviving Trials in Venezuela.
00:10:09 It’s an interview with a couple from Venezuela
00:10:13 who recently attended the 144th class of Gilead.
00:10:18 This is JW Broadcasting
00:10:20 from the world headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:01 Colombia is situated
00:03 in the northwest of South America.
00:06 Its territory encompasses
00:08 the Amazon rain forest,
00:10 tropical grassland, the Andes mountain range,
00:14 and the Caribbean and Pacific coastlines.
00:18 It’s known for growing high-quality coffee.
00:21 But what is even more impressive there
00:23 is the spiritual growth  among Jehovah’s people.
00:27 Colombians are very friendly and hospitable,
00:30 and our brothers show these qualities  in an outstanding way.
00:35 In March, we had a new all-time peak
00:39 in the number of publishers.
00:41 We had 172,028
00:44 who shared in the preaching work
00:46 in this special month of activity.
00:49 As a result, on April 11,
00:52 we had an all-time peak  in the number of the Memorial attendees,
00:57 with 515,800 in attendance
01:02 —three times the number of publishers.
01:05 Because of the geography of the country,
01:08 there are some areas of Colombia
01:10 where it is not easy  to reach with the good news.
01:13 For this reason,
01:15 from time to time —once a year—
01:17 some special campaigns are organized.
01:19 The last campaign was organized
01:22 from November 2016 to January 2017.
01:28 Seven thousand four hundred  and fifty-six publishers shared
01:32 in this campaign,
01:34 including several members  of our Bethel family.
01:38 I would like to share with you  some encouraging experiences
01:41 that the brothers had during this campaign.
01:45 A regular pioneer couple wanted to share
01:48 in the campaign with other friends.
01:51 Unfortunately,  no one was available to go with them.
01:55 In addition to that, the territory  where they were assigned was far away,
02:00 the climate was cold,
02:02 and there were  no known Jehovah’s Witnesses there.
02:06 At first, this made the couple worried,
02:09 but they took courage  and they went to the assigned territory.
02:14 The very day they started to preach there,
02:17 they met a man who,
02:19 after listening carefully  to their introduction, said:
02:23 “I know what you are talking about.
02:25 In fact, when I was a child,  I used to preach as you do.”
02:29 Then he added,
02:32 “I tell my neighbors  that we are Jehovah’s Witnesses.”
02:35 The couple was quite surprised,
02:37 especially because from what they knew,
02:39 there were  no Jehovah’s Witnesses in the area.
02:43 So they asked the man to explain more.
02:46 The man told them that as a child,
02:49 he lived in a different part of the country
02:52 and that his grandmother  was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses
02:55 and used to take him in service with her.
02:58 Later, because of unrest and violence,
03:01 he had to leave his hometown,
03:03 and he moved to his current place.
03:06 He’s now very happy to study again,
03:09 along with his wife and five children.
03:13 In the special campaign,  a special effort is made
03:17 to reach the numerous  indigenous communities
03:20 that are present in Colombia.
03:22 In one of them,  two sisters met a man
03:26 while walking toward the territory  and preached to him.
03:29 He kindly told them
03:31 that he was the chief of the community.
03:33 At the moment, he was very busy,
03:35 but he was giving them permission  to preach to all in the community.
03:40 After they preached to all in the community,
03:43 the sisters met this man again.
03:46 He exclaimed:  “The people of God finally arrived!
03:50 “Come on in.  Please teach us.
03:52 We were waiting for you.”
03:54 A great witness was given.
03:57 A week later, when the Witnesses called back,
04:01 they met 30 people waiting  for them in the chief’s house,
04:05 with the Listen to God brochure  in their hands,
04:08 ready to learn about Jehovah.
04:11 Yes, as these experiences illustrate,
04:15 in Colombia  ‘the fields are white for harvesting.’
04:19 It is a great pleasure for me  to convey the love and greetings
04:23 of all of our brothers  and sisters in Colombia,
04:26 including the 255 members  of our Bethel family.

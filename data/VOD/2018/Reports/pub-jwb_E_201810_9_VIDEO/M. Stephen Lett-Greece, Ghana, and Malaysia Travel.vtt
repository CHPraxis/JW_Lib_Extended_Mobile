00:00:01.117 --> 00:00:02.886 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We had the privilege

00:00:02.886 --> 00:00:04.421 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the latter part of October

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:06.423 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and beginning of November

00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:08.658 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to visit our dear brothers

00:00:08.658 --> 00:00:11.761 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in Greece, Ghana, and Malaysia. 

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:16.332 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎On Friday, October 20, 
we arrived in Athens, Greece. 

00:00:16.332 --> 00:00:18.401 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The next day, we had a special program

00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:23.073 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎during which the New World Translation 
was released in Greek,

00:00:23.073 --> 00:00:26.576 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and I tried to read it, 
but it was all Greek to me. 

00:00:28.645 --> 00:00:33.650 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The original Greek New World Translation
was released in 1993. 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.586 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But now, 24 years later,

00:00:36.586 --> 00:00:39.089 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎they received the revised version,

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:41.858 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and they were “nothing but joyful,”

00:00:41.858 --> 00:00:45.395 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎just like the Israelites during their festivals. 

00:00:45.395 --> 00:00:47.797 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The brothers commented profusely

00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:51.401 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎about how much more understandable 
their Bible is now. 

00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:54.804 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And that reminds us of thoughts we still hear 

00:00:54.804 --> 00:00:58.508 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎about the revised English New World Translation. 

00:00:58.508 --> 00:01:00.343 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How we love it! 

00:01:00.343 --> 00:01:04.914 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We had more than 31,000 
in attendance for the program,

00:01:04.914 --> 00:01:07.350 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎including those at the Assembly Hall

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.919 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and those tied in with us,

00:01:09.919 --> 00:01:14.224 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and all of them received 
their beautiful new gray Bibles

00:01:14.224 --> 00:01:16.926 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎immediately after the release talk. 

00:01:16.926 --> 00:01:18.695 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The following video

00:01:18.695 --> 00:01:22.298 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎describes well the joy of that occasion. 

00:01:22.298 --> 00:01:23.566 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Look at this video.

00:02:11.514 --> 00:02:15.285 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The Governing Body 
is so happy to be able to release

00:02:15.285 --> 00:02:19.756 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the revised Greek New World Translation.

00:03:23.086 --> 00:03:27.790 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎After spending two additional days
with the Greece Bethel family,

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.228 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we left for Ghana, located in western Africa. 

00:03:32.228 --> 00:03:34.464 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎On Friday, October 27,

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:37.200 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we held a combined dedication program

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.637 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎for the renovated expanded branch facility,

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:43.740 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the Ewe remote translation office,

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.611 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and the theocratic school facility,
located not far from the branch,

00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:52.515 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎which will primarily be used for SKE classes. 

00:03:52.515 --> 00:03:56.019 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎On Saturday, we had 
a special program in the Assembly Hall. 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.690 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And during this program, 
the entire New World Translation 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.793 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was released in the Ga language

00:04:03.793 --> 00:04:08.164 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and the Christian Greek Scriptures 
of the New World Translation

00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:11.334 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was released in the Dangme language. 

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:14.304 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎More than 16,000 were in attendance

00:04:14.304 --> 00:04:17.140 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎at the Assembly Hall and tied in. 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.142 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The Dangme-speaking brothers

00:04:19.142 --> 00:04:21.177 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎were on one side of the Assembly Hall

00:04:21.177 --> 00:04:23.179 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and the Ga-speaking brothers

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:25.915 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎on the other side 
of the double Assembly Hall. 

00:04:25.915 --> 00:04:29.385 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Then on Sunday, 
we had a program in the Assembly Hall

00:04:29.385 --> 00:04:31.955 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎for the entire branch territory

00:04:31.955 --> 00:04:36.559 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎with a talk interpreted into the Twi language,

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:38.561 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the biggest language

00:04:38.561 --> 00:04:42.799 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎among the more than 130,000 publishers
in the country. 

00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:45.802 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Here’s a video that captures the spirit

00:04:45.802 --> 00:04:50.039 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of all three events there in Ghana.

00:05:08.091 --> 00:05:12.862 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The program will be streamed 
from here to all these three locations.

00:05:18.668 --> 00:05:23.306 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Do you want to dedicate 
these expanded facilities here at Bethel? 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.011 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎If so, say, “Yes!”

00:06:18.895 --> 00:06:22.532 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Then on Monday, October 30,

00:06:22.532 --> 00:06:27.570 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we left Ghana
for our final assignment in Malaysia.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.040 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Then on Wednesday,
after morning worship and a brief tour

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.844 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the small but very attractive Bethel facility,

00:06:34.844 --> 00:06:38.981 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we headed to the airport 
for a two-and-a-half-hour flight

00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:43.086 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to Kota Kinabalu on the island of Borneo. 

00:06:43.086 --> 00:06:45.888 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And the next day, Thursday, November 2,

00:06:45.888 --> 00:06:48.424 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we held the dedication program

00:06:48.424 --> 00:06:52.095 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎for the new Malay remote translation office.

00:06:52.728 --> 00:06:57.133 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What a beautiful, 
well-constructed new building this is,

00:06:57.133 --> 00:07:00.570 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and it will be used 
to Jehovah’s honor and praise! 

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.572 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Then Friday through Sunday,

00:07:02.572 --> 00:07:04.574 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we had the privilege to attend

00:07:04.574 --> 00:07:07.610 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the Malay regional convention 
with our dear brothers. 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.312 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The first day of the convention,

00:07:09.312 --> 00:07:14.117 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the New World Translation 
in the Malay language was released.

00:07:14.117 --> 00:07:16.152 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Three years earlier,

00:07:16.152 --> 00:07:18.521 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎they had received
the Christian Greek Scriptures

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:22.692 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but now were ecstatic to receive

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:27.697 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎their new beautiful, understandable gray Bibles

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:32.702 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎conveying the very sayings of Jehovah

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:34.904 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in their mother tongue. 

00:07:34.904 --> 00:07:37.540 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We have just one more brief video

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:42.378 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to show you highlights of our visit to Malaysia.

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:19.775 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, what a privilege it was
to be able to be used

00:09:19.775 --> 00:09:22.511 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as a tool in Jehovah’s hand

00:09:22.511 --> 00:09:26.782 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to strengthen our brothers
in these distant lands!

00:09:26.782 --> 00:09:31.487 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And every trip we take
just convinces us even more

00:09:31.487 --> 00:09:33.889 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the power of Jehovah’s holy spirit

00:09:33.889 --> 00:09:37.293 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and the fact that we truly have the truth.

00:09:37.293 --> 00:09:39.295 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Everywhere we went,

00:09:39.295 --> 00:09:41.697 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the brothers wanted to make sure

00:09:41.697 --> 00:09:45.001 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that we brought back the love and affection

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:47.436 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that they have for the Governing Body

00:09:47.436 --> 00:09:50.439 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and the entire Bethel family.

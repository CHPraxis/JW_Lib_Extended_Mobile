00:00:01 ‎We had the privilege
00:00:02 ‎in the latter part of October
00:00:04 ‎and beginning of November
00:00:06 ‎to visit our dear brothers
00:00:08 ‎in Greece, Ghana, and Malaysia.
00:00:11 ‎On Friday, October 20,  we arrived in Athens, Greece.
00:00:16 ‎The next day, we had a special program
00:00:18 ‎during which the New World Translation  was released in Greek,
00:00:23 ‎and I tried to read it,  but it was all Greek to me.
00:00:28 ‎The original Greek New World Translation was released in 1993.
00:00:33 ‎But now, 24 years later,
00:00:36 ‎they received the revised version,
00:00:39 ‎and they were “nothing but joyful,”
00:00:41 ‎just like the Israelites during their festivals.
00:00:45 ‎The brothers commented profusely
00:00:47 ‎about how much more understandable  their Bible is now.
00:00:51 ‎And that reminds us of thoughts we still hear
00:00:54 ‎about the revised English New World Translation.
00:00:58 ‎How we love it!
00:01:00 ‎We had more than 31,000  in attendance for the program,
00:01:04 ‎including those at the Assembly Hall
00:01:07 ‎and those tied in with us,
00:01:09 ‎and all of them received  their beautiful new gray Bibles
00:01:14 ‎immediately after the release talk.
00:01:16 ‎The following video
00:01:18 ‎describes well the joy of that occasion.
00:01:22 ‎Look at this video.
00:02:11 ‎The Governing Body  is so happy to be able to release
00:02:15 ‎the revised Greek New World Translation.
00:03:23 ‎After spending two additional days with the Greece Bethel family,
00:03:27 ‎we left for Ghana, located in western Africa.
00:03:32 ‎On Friday, October 27,
00:03:34 ‎we held a combined dedication program
00:03:37 ‎for the renovated expanded branch facility,
00:03:40 ‎the Ewe remote translation office,
00:03:43 ‎and the theocratic school facility, located not far from the branch,
00:03:48 ‎which will primarily be used for SKE classes.
00:03:52 ‎On Saturday, we had  a special program in the Assembly Hall.
00:03:56 ‎And during this program,  the entire New World Translation
00:04:00 ‎was released in the Ga language
00:04:03 ‎and the Christian Greek Scriptures  of the New World Translation
00:04:08 ‎was released in the Dangme language.
00:04:11 ‎More than 16,000 were in attendance
00:04:14 ‎at the Assembly Hall and tied in.
00:04:17 ‎The Dangme-speaking brothers
00:04:19 ‎were on one side of the Assembly Hall
00:04:21 ‎and the Ga-speaking brothers
00:04:23 ‎on the other side  of the double Assembly Hall.
00:04:25 ‎Then on Sunday,  we had a program in the Assembly Hall
00:04:29 ‎for the entire branch territory
00:04:31 ‎with a talk interpreted into the Twi language,
00:04:36 ‎the biggest language
00:04:38 ‎among the more than 130,000 publishers in the country.
00:04:42 ‎Here’s a video that captures the spirit
00:04:45 ‎of all three events there in Ghana.
00:05:08 ‎The program will be streamed  from here to all these three locations.
00:05:18 ‎Do you want to dedicate  these expanded facilities here at Bethel?
00:05:24 ‎If so, say, “Yes!”
00:06:18 ‎Then on Monday, October 30,
00:06:22 ‎we left Ghana for our final assignment in Malaysia.
00:06:27 ‎Then on Wednesday, after morning worship and a brief tour
00:06:31 ‎of the small but very attractive Bethel facility,
00:06:34 ‎we headed to the airport  for a two-and-a-half-hour flight
00:06:38 ‎to Kota Kinabalu on the island of Borneo.
00:06:43 ‎And the next day, Thursday, November 2,
00:06:45 ‎we held the dedication program
00:06:48 ‎for the new Malay remote translation office.
00:06:52 ‎What a beautiful,  well-constructed new building this is,
00:06:57 ‎and it will be used  to Jehovah’s honor and praise!
00:07:00 ‎Then Friday through Sunday,
00:07:02 ‎we had the privilege to attend
00:07:04 ‎the Malay regional convention  with our dear brothers.
00:07:07 ‎The first day of the convention,
00:07:09 ‎the New World Translation  in the Malay language was released.
00:07:14 ‎Three years earlier,
00:07:16 ‎they had received the Christian Greek Scriptures
00:07:18 ‎but now were ecstatic to receive
00:07:22 ‎their new beautiful, understandable gray Bibles
00:07:27 ‎conveying the very sayings of Jehovah
00:07:32 ‎in their mother tongue.
00:07:34 ‎We have just one more brief video
00:07:37 ‎to show you highlights of our visit to Malaysia.
00:09:16 ‎Well, what a privilege it was to be able to be used
00:09:19 ‎as a tool in Jehovah’s hand
00:09:22 ‎to strengthen our brothers in these distant lands!
00:09:26 ‎And every trip we take just convinces us even more
00:09:31 ‎of the power of Jehovah’s holy spirit
00:09:33 ‎and the fact that we truly have the truth.
00:09:37 ‎Everywhere we went,
00:09:39 ‎the brothers wanted to make sure
00:09:41 ‎that we brought back the love and affection
00:09:45 ‎that they have for the Governing Body
00:09:47 ‎and the entire Bethel family.

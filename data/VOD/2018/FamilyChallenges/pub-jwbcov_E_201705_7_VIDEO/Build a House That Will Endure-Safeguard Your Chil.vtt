00:02.998 --> 00:05.021
At times, 


00:05.022 --> 00:08.024
it can be difficult 
to talk to Emilien about sex 


00:08.023 --> 00:12.628
because Emilien is a young boy, 
and I am a single mother. 


00:12.628 --> 00:14.763
I’ve been a widow for nine years. 


00:14.763 --> 00:18.000
And I find sexual education 
a difficult topic to talk about. 


00:25.375 --> 00:27.843
In our culture, 
talking about sex is taboo, 


00:27.843 --> 00:31.000
so much so that our parents 
do not talk to us about it. 


00:34.115 --> 00:37.837
It is hard to know how much information 
we should give to our children. 


00:37.837 --> 00:40.000
Children are naturally curious. 


00:41.207 --> 00:45.000
Our fear is: 
What if they get wrong thoughts?


00:49.032 --> 00:51.302
It is not easy to bring up children 


00:51.302 --> 00:55.000
in the last days of this system of things. 


00:57.500 --> 01:01.160
It is very difficult 
to train children in a blended family, 


01:01.160 --> 01:03.162
but with the help of Jehovah, 


01:03.162 --> 01:06.000
it is Jehovah 
who has helped us to train them. 


01:15.192 --> 01:18.227
It’s true that Jehovah 
has given us an incredible task 


01:18.227 --> 01:20.230
to raise our children in the truth, 


01:20.230 --> 01:22.465
but I am calm and confident 


01:22.465 --> 01:26.368
because thanks to his organization, 
we always have what we need, 


01:26.368 --> 01:31.698
in due time, 
to successfully carry out this task. 


01:31.698 --> 01:35.328
I use the videos provided 
by “the faithful and discreet slave” 


01:35.328 --> 01:38.213
that relate to the topics 
Emilien wants to talk about, 


01:38.213 --> 01:41.918
in particular, 
the video Protect Your Children, 


01:41.918 --> 01:43.986
which speaks about sexual predators, 


01:43.987 --> 01:48.000
is a good starting point 
for a discussion on this. 


01:52.965 --> 01:56.398
Even before Satan’s world 
can teach our children about sex, 


01:56.398 --> 01:58.518
we can teach them. 


01:58.518 --> 02:01.220
Learn From the Great Teacher, chapter 32, 


02:01.220 --> 02:03.723
has beautiful questions. 


02:03.723 --> 02:06.843
It helps us to understand 
what is in their hearts 


02:06.843 --> 02:09.000
and how much information 
they already know. 


02:10.980 --> 02:13.000
Since we have already spoken 
to them about sex at this age, 


02:14.867 --> 02:20.000
we can talk about any serious matters 
in the future without feeling awkward. 


02:29.498 --> 02:32.685
We lean on the counsel 
from the Bible regarding sexuality, 


02:32.685 --> 02:36.000
and this has helped 
the children to fear Jehovah.


02:38.798 --> 02:42.298
Every time that we go out 
to the fields to do our work, 


02:42.298 --> 02:44.631
we are talking all the time 
with the children. 


02:44.632 --> 02:47.265
I see that Jehovah 
has blessed these efforts. 


02:47.265 --> 02:58.845
We do not have any problems 
amongst the children or with others.

00:02.485 --> 00:04.820
Despite the advice 


00:04.820 --> 00:08.658
and counsel that the organization had given, 


00:08.658 --> 00:11.160
we decided the safe course with social media 


00:11.160 --> 00:14.030
was just to forbid everything. 


00:14.030 --> 00:16.065
This didn’t work. 


00:16.065 --> 00:18.468
It caused some friction. 


00:18.468 --> 00:22.000
We didn’t show a great deal of understanding. 


00:26.108 --> 00:28.210
Well, personally for me, 


00:28.210 --> 00:30.213
raising my children is very difficult 


00:30.213 --> 00:32.948
because my husband is not a Witness. 


00:32.948 --> 00:35.485
With my oldest son, 


00:35.485 --> 00:38.153
I had a problem 
when he started dating a girl. 


00:38.153 --> 00:41.490
When I found out, 
I was very irritated with him 


00:41.490 --> 00:44.193
because I had taught him well 
and we always talked. 


00:44.193 --> 00:48.000
And now suddenly, 
he was acting differently. 


00:56.005 --> 00:58.742
We decided to flee because of the war. 


00:58.742 --> 01:02.000
That is why we went to the refugee camp. 


01:03.278 --> 01:05.715
The problem we had was that my son 


01:05.715 --> 01:08.183
started to imitate the bad conduct 


01:08.183 --> 01:11.888
of the non-Witness young ones, our neighbors. 


01:11.888 --> 01:16.000
So he needed a lot of help. 


01:20.163 --> 01:23.500
We’ve really benefited 


01:23.500 --> 01:26.102
from taking to heart 
the counsel that the brothers have given 


01:26.102 --> 01:28.137
—to be reasonable with our children, 


01:28.137 --> 01:30.174
to try to understand their point of view, 


01:30.173 --> 01:33.208
and to try to help them 
to draw close to Jehovah. 


01:33.208 --> 01:37.380
It’s no good just trying to say 


01:37.380 --> 01:39.382
what they should do all the time 


01:39.382 --> 01:42.052
without listening to their needs. 


01:42.052 --> 01:44.387
And so we agreed that, OK, 


01:44.387 --> 01:46.824
if we stay within the boundaries 


01:46.823 --> 01:49.725
of Bible principles, 


01:49.725 --> 01:52.562
she could use some forms of social media. 


01:52.562 --> 01:55.000
And, of course, the reaction was good. 


02:00.470 --> 02:04.240
For me, James 1:19 helped me a lot 


02:04.240 --> 02:06.275
because there it mentions 


02:06.275 --> 02:08.277
that we should “be quick to listen, 


02:08.277 --> 02:10.780
slow to speak,” and “slow to anger.” 


02:10.780 --> 02:15.385
So I realized 
that I should have listened to my son first 


02:15.385 --> 02:19.000
and calmed myself down 
and not gotten upset like I did.


02:23.827 --> 02:27.364
It’s good to apologize 
when we make mistakes as parents 


02:27.363 --> 02:30.633
because it will help our children in return 


02:30.633 --> 02:33.570
to realize the mistakes they are making. 


02:33.570 --> 02:36.105
We are closer, 
and we feel more comfortable 


02:36.105 --> 02:39.000
talking to each other about things.


02:42.132 --> 02:44.614
There were other activities in the camp, 


02:44.613 --> 02:49.098
but we always found time 
to have our family study. 


02:49.098 --> 02:51.520
We had a few older books and magazines 


02:51.520 --> 02:54.023
that we had taken when we fled the war, 


02:54.023 --> 02:56.025
and we used these older publications 


02:56.025 --> 02:59.000
during our family study. 


03:00.095 --> 03:03.633
Usually what we do, 
my wife and I, 


03:03.633 --> 03:05.635
is if there is a problem, 
we discuss it together 


03:05.635 --> 03:08.000
and prepare how we 
can teach our children. 


03:11.975 --> 03:14.243
The problem we had was that my son 


03:14.243 --> 03:17.446
started to imitate the bad conduct 


03:17.447 --> 03:20.049
of the non-Witness young ones, our neighbors. 


03:20.048 --> 03:22.985
So he needed a lot of help. 


03:22.985 --> 03:25.355
But after meditating on this, 


03:25.355 --> 03:28.190
I realized instead of punishing him, 


03:28.190 --> 03:42.757
I needed to reason 
with him patiently to explain the dangers.

00:02 Despite the advice
00:04 and counsel that the organization had given,
00:08 we decided the safe course with social media
00:11 was just to forbid everything.
00:14 This didn’t work.
00:16 It caused some friction.
00:18 We didn’t show a great deal of understanding.
00:26 Well, personally for me,
00:28 raising my children is very difficult
00:30 because my husband is not a Witness.
00:32 With my oldest son,
00:35 I had a problem  when he started dating a girl.
00:38 When I found out,  I was very irritated with him
00:41 because I had taught him well  and we always talked.
00:44 And now suddenly,  he was acting differently.
00:56 We decided to flee because of the war.
00:58 That is why we went to the refugee camp.
01:03 The problem we had was that my son
01:05 started to imitate the bad conduct
01:08 of the non-Witness young ones, our neighbors.
01:11 So he needed a lot of help.
01:20 We’ve really benefited
01:23 from taking to heart  the counsel that the brothers have given
01:26 —to be reasonable with our children,
01:28 to try to understand their point of view,
01:30 and to try to help them  to draw close to Jehovah.
01:33 It’s no good just trying to say
01:37 what they should do all the time
01:39 without listening to their needs.
01:42 And so we agreed that, OK,
01:44 if we stay within the boundaries
01:46 of Bible principles,
01:49 she could use some forms of social media.
01:52 And, of course, the reaction was good.
02:00 For me, James 1:19 helped me a lot
02:04 because there it mentions
02:06 that we should “be quick to listen,
02:08 slow to speak,” and “slow to anger.”
02:10 So I realized  that I should have listened to my son first
02:15 and calmed myself down  and not gotten upset like I did.
02:23 It’s good to apologize  when we make mistakes as parents
02:27 because it will help our children in return
02:30 to realize the mistakes they are making.
02:33 We are closer,  and we feel more comfortable
02:36 talking to each other about things.
02:42 There were other activities in the camp,
02:44 but we always found time  to have our family study.
02:49 We had a few older books and magazines
02:51 that we had taken when we fled the war,
02:54 and we used these older publications
02:56 during our family study.
03:00 Usually what we do,  my wife and I,
03:03 is if there is a problem,  we discuss it together
03:05 and prepare how we  can teach our children.
03:11 The problem we had was that my son
03:14 started to imitate the bad conduct
03:17 of the non-Witness young ones, our neighbors.
03:20 So he needed a lot of help.
03:22 But after meditating on this,
03:25 I realized instead of punishing him,
03:28 I needed to reason  with him patiently to explain the dangers.

00:01.480 --> 00:05.233
It is my pleasure to introduce 
to this marriage gathering 


00:05.233 --> 00:08.000
Brother and Sister Calou. 


00:55.540 --> 01:00.015
I finally told the elders everything. 


01:00.015 --> 01:03.482
We’re always arguing; 
there’s no peace in my house; 


01:03.482 --> 01:05.374
no one is happy. 


01:05.373 --> 01:07.481
We just feel that it’s best at this point 


01:07.482 --> 01:10.174
if we just go our separate ways. 


01:10.173 --> 01:12.181
They patiently listened. 


01:12.182 --> 01:14.449
Then they reasoned that Jehovah can help us 


01:14.448 --> 01:17.243
even if we feel 
like we’re in a loveless marriage. 


01:17.243 --> 01:21.000
One of the brothers shared Isaiah 48:17: 


01:22.393 --> 01:27.253
“I, Jehovah, am your God, 
the One teaching you to benefit yourself, 


01:27.253 --> 01:30.776
the One guiding you 
in the way you should walk.” 


01:30.777 --> 01:35.032
After reading the scripture, 
they explained that obeying God’s laws 


01:35.032 --> 01:37.034
—it really isn’t that difficult. 


01:37.033 --> 01:39.578
They lovingly offered some Bible principles 


01:39.578 --> 01:42.000
to help me as the head of my family. 


02:00.765 --> 02:03.685
What is God’s name? 


02:03.685 --> 02:06.438
Sister Karen . . .


02:06.438 --> 02:08.065
Jehovah. 


02:08.065 --> 02:10.223
Very good.


02:10.223 --> 02:11.641
Marriage can be challenging, 


02:11.642 --> 02:14.070
especially with two 
imperfect people involved. 


02:14.070 --> 02:17.992
But if we obey, 
we stick with our mate, 


02:17.992 --> 02:19.972
and we don’t give up, 


02:19.972 --> 02:21.995
in the end we benefit ourselves 


02:21.995 --> 02:36.990
and things will get better.

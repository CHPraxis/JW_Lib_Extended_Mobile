00:00:01 In the past few graduation programs,
00:00:04 we’ve had a new feature entitled
00:00:09 The Inside Story,
00:00:11 and we’re going to have another “inside story.”
00:00:15 One of the instructors, Brother Trent Lippold,
00:00:17 is now going to present that to us.
00:00:49 From far in the North Atlantic to the islands of the South Pacific,
00:00:52 you will meet some cool and colorful brothers
00:00:54 and sisters in this 145th class.
00:00:57 They serve on 5 continents, represent 31 countries,
00:01:01 and speak more than 45 individual, or different, languages.
00:01:05 So let’s meet our first guest,
00:01:07 and he’s from the Central European branch, Brother Alex Scholz.
00:01:12 Welcome, Alex. Good.
00:01:20 Alex, I understand in your assignment,
00:01:22 you have quite, how shall we say, quite an expansive assignment.
00:01:26 Well, I work with a team that helps foreign-language circuits.
00:01:30 OK, very nice.
00:01:31 So foreign-language circuits in Germany?
00:01:34 Not just Germany.
00:01:36 Farther.
00:01:38 Foreign-language circuits in the Central European branch.
00:01:41 Even a little farther, Trent.
00:01:42 OK. Alex, you’re going to have to help me out with this.
00:01:44 What exactly does your assignment involve?
00:01:46 Well, our team in the Central Europe branch
00:01:49 works with 22 other branch offices
00:01:52 to form and coordinate
00:01:54 foreign-language circuits that span the continent
00:01:57 in languages that are assigned to the project
00:01:59 by the Service Committee of the Governing Body.
00:02:01 Wow, that sounds huge.
00:02:03 There must be a good reason for it.
00:02:04 Yeah. Sure, there is.
00:02:06 I mean, as we know, normally a circuit
00:02:09 consists of a group of congregations
00:02:11 and perhaps a few groups within one branch territory.
00:02:15 Now, in Europe, we know we have quite a number of countries
00:02:18 and also a number of branch territories.
00:02:21 So, what happened in the past is that in some languages,
00:02:24 there were foreign-language congregations or groups that had to be visited
00:02:28 by a local circuit overseer who didn’t speak the language.
00:02:32 And that was simply because perhaps in this branch territory,
00:02:35 they didn’t have a circuit overseer who speaks the language
00:02:38 or they didn’t have enough congregations
00:02:41 to form their own foreign-language circuit
00:02:43 in that branch territory.
00:02:45 And that, of course, poses a challenge if the CO doesn’t speak that language
00:02:49 or he’s not so familiar with the territory or that language field.
00:02:53 Sure, I can see that.
00:02:54 Then it would be difficult for him to really give specific direction to the congregation.
00:02:58 That’s the thing.
00:02:59 And some publishers in these groups perhaps felt isolated.
00:03:02 Besides, they didn’t necessarily have circuit assemblies
00:03:06 or pioneer meetings in their language or in their vicinity.
00:03:09 Right. But I know the Governing Body made a change about that.
00:03:12 Yeah, and that was excellent.
00:03:14 I mean, it’s a beautiful project.
00:03:16 Since 2016, we now have what we call
00:03:19 foreign-language circuits that span branch territories in Europe.
00:03:23 OK. Well, how does this work now?
00:03:26 Well, imagine Europe, or perhaps it’s best we take a look at a map.
00:03:30 We have a map of Europe?
00:03:31 OK. We have a map.
00:03:32 Super. Very good.
00:03:33 So this is how we look at Europe in this project
00:03:36 —Europe without borders.
00:03:38 OK.
00:03:39 All we want to see is,
00:03:41 Where are the foreign-language congregations and groups?
00:03:43 And maybe it’s best we can see this in one example with the Chinese field.
00:03:47 Wow.
00:03:47 So we look at all the congregations and groups
00:03:50 (we see them depicted here),
00:03:52 and simply what we do is we group them together
00:03:56 by a number of parameters into circuits.
00:03:59 But this is regardless of any national borders.
00:04:03 And what results is all these groups and congregations are in actual circuits.
00:04:08 They have their circuit events,
00:04:11 they have their pioneer meetings,
00:04:13 they have their circuit overseer who speaks their language,
00:04:16 and they meet together for circuit assemblies.
00:04:19 More people come together from various countries.
00:04:22 It’s a wonderful atmosphere.
00:04:23 Very nice. That’s incredible.
00:04:25 So this is the Chinese circuit.
00:04:26 That’s Chinese.
00:04:27 We have Russian here with . . .
00:04:29 OK.
00:04:30 . . . the 20 circuits that we have right now that span Europe.
00:04:33 And here’s the Romany field with growing circuits in Europe.
00:04:37 Very interesting.
00:04:39 I mean, how many are we talking about, Alex?
00:04:41 Right now we have in the project 115 circuits
00:04:45 with more than 4,000 congregations and groups involved.
00:04:48 Wow.
00:04:49 And to date, 18 languages have been assigned to the project.
00:04:52 That is remarkable.
00:04:54 So, what would you say?
00:04:55 How have the brothers and sisters
00:04:57 in these foreign-language congregations and circuits been affected?
00:04:59 Well, we have very positive reflections from the field.
00:05:03 The publishers often appreciate the fact that they now receive
00:05:08 theocratic care by a circuit overseer
00:05:11 who speaks their language, and that’s a beautiful aspect.
00:05:14 Besides that, because of this  now theocratically borderless Europe,
00:05:18 if we want to call it this way,
00:05:20 we as branch offices have more opportunity to work together
00:05:24 —to organize conventions in these languages,
00:05:27 circuit assemblies, schools, pioneer meetings.
00:05:31 And all of this furthers the preaching work, and that’s amazing to see.
00:05:35 Well, that’s the benefit, isn’t it? That’s tremendous.
00:05:37 You know, Alex, for us in Gilead,
00:05:39 most of the instructors of Gilead, we’ve been in the circuit work.
00:05:43 So circuit work is close to our hearts.
00:05:45 As I’m looking at these huge circuits,
00:05:47 I’m asking myself,
00:05:49 ‘How do these circuit overseers care for such huge territories?’
00:05:53 What is it like?
00:05:54 You know, that’s a very good question
00:05:56 because these brothers and sisters work so hard in these fields.
00:05:59 Actually, we have a little video
00:06:01 that follows one traveling couple, Brother and Sister Dietrich.
00:06:05 They are traveling in one of the Albanian circuits
00:06:08 that span branch territories in Europe.
00:06:10 And if you’d like, we could take a look at the video and see how they’re doing.
00:06:12 Excellent. Let’s look at the video now then.
00:06:18 Today, many Albanian Witnesses are settled
00:06:22 in different countries,
00:06:24 but they are not isolated.
00:06:31 Edlira and I are serving
00:06:34 one of three Albanian circuits in Europe
00:06:36 that span branch territories.
00:06:39 Serving a multinational circuit
00:06:43 takes extra effort and planning.
00:06:47 But seeing Jehovah’s care for his people,
00:06:50 no matter the situation, is worth it.
00:06:58 We’re a small congregation in a foreign country.
00:07:02 Our circuit is now supported by Albanian-speaking brothers
00:07:05 from several European countries,
00:07:07 and we feel the unity  in our brotherhood even more.
00:07:19 At this regional convention,
00:07:21 brothers and sisters  are attending from Germany,
00:07:25 Austria, Belgium, Great Britain,
00:07:28 and Switzerland.
00:07:31 We have met many friends who speak our language.
00:07:33 We are learning a lot about them
00:07:35 and are encouraged by their examples of faith.
00:07:47 In the circuit, those in northern Italy
00:07:50 are together with others  in Germany, Austria, and Slovenia.
00:07:56 They are united across national borders
00:08:01 with others who speak Albanian.
00:08:11 That’s beautiful, Alex
00:08:13 —united in the spiritual paradise— no borders.
00:08:15 Absolutely. That’s true.
00:08:16 I think about this, though, Alex.
00:08:17 You know, some say that language actually divides.
00:08:21 I mean, that goes back to the Tower of Babel.
00:08:24 And some might feel that, well, by grouping people into language groups,
00:08:29 you’re actually dividing people.
00:08:31 How would you answer that?
00:08:33 Well, you know language  definitely has the potential to divide
00:08:36 —no question.
00:08:38 But, honestly, by the way the organization is using language,
00:08:42 I see the opposite effect taking place.
00:08:45 You know, this project is not about promoting
00:08:49 particular cultures or particular languages.
00:08:53 What this project allows us to do
00:08:56 is to reach across man-made borders
00:08:59 to unite our brothers and sisters by using their local language
00:09:04 to teach the true and pure language.
00:09:08 And that is unity, as we’ve seen in the video.
00:09:11 Well, we look forward to hearing about more of those details.
00:09:13 Thank you.
00:09:14 Just maybe in conclusion, Alex, one final thought.
00:09:16 Thinking about your assignment, is there one particular thought from Gilead
00:09:21 (I know there’s probably many), but is there one particular thought
00:09:24 that you would like to especially apply in your assignment?
00:09:27 Yeah, you’re right. There are many.
00:09:29 Maybe just one that was repeatedly mentioned in class
00:09:32 is how Jesus worked with others
00:09:35 —never as a superior, but as a friend, as a confidant—
00:09:40 open, trusted communication.
00:09:42 And that’s a beautiful example.
00:09:44 And I just hope that I can pick up a little bit of this wonderful example
00:09:49 when I have the privilege to talk to the circuit overseers
00:09:52 out there in this huge field.
00:09:54 Or when we talk to the other responsible brothers
00:09:56 in the other branch offices, that it is this open, trusted communication
00:10:01 as friends and as fellow workers.
00:10:04 We all have the same goal —furthering the preaching work.
00:10:07 That’s a goal I have.
00:10:09 Very nice. It’s a valuable point for all of us.
00:10:11 Well, Alex, may Jehovah richly bless you and your wife, Tabitha, in your assignment.
00:10:15 Thank you very much.
00:10:16 Thank you.
00:10:24 Let’s welcome our next guest,
00:10:26 and it’s Brother Thomas Bohnfeldt from Greenland.
00:10:31 Hi, Thomas.
00:10:32 Hi.
00:10:33 Hey, welcome Thomas.
00:10:34 Thank you.
00:10:39 You look very comfortable.
00:10:40 Oh, thank you. I am.
00:10:43 So, what do you call that?
00:10:44 This is an anorak.
00:10:46 You know, it’s all about staying warm in Greenland.
00:10:50 So, actually, this is traditional formal wear,
00:10:54 and it is used for special occasions.
00:10:56 So many brothers wear it at the conventions on the day of baptism.
00:11:00 This is very special.
00:11:01 Well, I like Greenland already; I can tell you that.
00:11:04 When I think of Greenland, though, I’m not thinking green land;
00:11:07 I’m thinking ice, snow.
00:11:11 Yeah, you are right. It is really a land of ice and snow.
00:11:15 Most of Greenland lies within the Arctic Circle.
00:11:18 The biggest part of the land is the Greenland Ice Sheet,
00:11:22 and it’s up to 3,000 meters thick in the center.
00:11:25 And from there, huge icebergs break off out to the sea.
00:11:29 Icebergs like this one.
00:11:31 Yes.
00:11:33 Yeah, that definitely sounds cool to me.
00:11:38 So, what I wonder though is,
00:11:40 What are the people like in Greenland?
00:11:42 Ah, that’s where the warmth is.
00:11:44 People in Greenland are very kind and warmhearted.
00:11:48 Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark.
00:11:50 So many speak Danish,
00:11:53 but the majority —the native Inuit—
00:11:56 speak Greenlandic.
00:11:58 Greenlandic—when I think of Greenlandic, the only thing that comes to mind is long words.
00:12:03 Yes, that’s the first thing many people notice about Greenlandic.
00:12:07 For example, we have the title of The Watchtower on two lines.
00:12:15 Can you say it?
00:12:17 Ah, I don’t think I can, actually.
00:12:20 But you said it so well.
00:12:22 As I look at that, though, I wonder,
00:12:24 Do you have spelling contests in Greenland?
00:12:26 No, we don’t have time for that.
00:12:30 You and Peninna, do you speak Greenlandic?
00:12:33 Yes, we do now. But we are still learning.
00:12:36 Of course. How did you learn Greenlandic?
00:12:38 So we are originally from Denmark and brought up in Denmark.
00:12:43 But, interestingly,
00:12:45 my parents actually were special pioneers
00:12:48 when they were young in Greenland
00:12:50 and helped form a congregation.
00:12:52 Well, that’s very interesting. That’s a nice spiritual heritage to have.
00:12:55 And some years ago, we visited Greenland as a family,
00:12:58 and we see pictures here.
00:13:00 You still look relaxed, Thomas.
00:13:03 Actually, back then I remembered, ‘Perhaps I could serve in Greenland sometime.’
00:13:07 But that thought just—
00:13:09 Really?
00:13:09 I forgot that thought.
00:13:10 Really?
00:13:11 Yeah, but then years passed.
00:13:13 I began to court Peninna, and when we were engaged to marry,
00:13:16 we asked the branch where we could serve.
00:13:19 And to our surprise, they asked us to start learning Greenlandic.
00:13:24 So we moved to Copenhagen and took some language courses.
00:13:28 And after three years, we were sent to Greenland as special pioneers
00:13:32 and helped support the translation office.
00:13:34 That’s amazing.
00:13:35 So it’s almost like you were following in your parents’ footsteps, then, to Greenland.
00:13:39 Yes.
00:13:40 So was it an easy adjustment?
00:13:41 Denmark? Greenland?
00:13:43 No. Denmark and Greenland are very different.
00:13:47 But with the help from Jehovah
00:13:51 and also with support from brothers, we adapted.
00:13:55 Yeah, it looks like you’ve fully adapted, actually.
00:13:57 I understand that your assignment has changed a little bit over the years.
00:14:01 So now we are at the RTO in Nuuk, in the Greenlandic RTO.
00:14:06 There are four of us full-time, and we have more than ten part-time commuters.
00:14:12 OK, so that’s more than 14 in the RTO but still a small group.
00:14:16 That’s a lot of work for a translation office.
00:14:20 Are there benefits?
00:14:21 Have you seen the benefits from the work you’re doing?
00:14:23 Yes, definitely.
00:14:25 So in Greenlandic, there’s not much published secularly
00:14:31 but our publications have been published for many years.
00:14:33 And they are very well-known.
00:14:35 So people really love when they see our literature.
00:14:39 And besides that, our videos in Greenlandic are a great support
00:14:43 for many of the need-greaters coming to support the ministry in Greenlandic.
00:14:46 Right.
00:14:47 Now, I wondered what the ministry was like.
00:14:49 Now, we did a little homework on Greenland.
00:14:51 I know there are five congregations in Greenland,
00:14:54 about 170 publishers,
00:14:56 and around 56,000 people that live in Greenland.
00:15:00 But we also understand that a lot of them live in very remote villages.
00:15:04 So how do you reach  those people in these isolated areas?
00:15:08 Yes, well, that’s all about timing.
00:15:10 Timing?
00:15:11 Yeah.
00:15:12 But to help you understand it, we have a video
00:15:15 from a congregation far north of Nuuk
00:15:18 in the village of Ilulissat, meaning “icebergs.”
00:15:23 Well, let’s have a look, and let’s visit the icebergs.
00:15:34 For about seven months of the year,
00:15:36 Greenland looks like this.
00:15:43 But when the ice melts,
00:15:46 signs of life begin to emerge
00:15:54 and the brothers and sisters get moving!
00:16:00 The Danish congregation in the town of Ilulissat also preaches
00:16:04 to Greenlandic-speaking people.
00:16:06 It’s the northernmost congregation
00:16:09 in Greenland.
00:16:11 They travel to many remote villages
00:16:14 to spread the good news
00:16:16 in Greenlandic.
00:16:34 Their territory spans hundreds of miles.
00:16:36 Today, they are preaching in the village of Oqaatsut.
00:16:48 It’s good to be out of the boat after their long journey,
00:16:51 but their work is just beginning.
00:16:59 They’ve had good results in these villages before.
00:17:03 This is Sara from a village farther north.
00:17:07 She wanted to study,
00:17:09 but she lived too far away for a regular visit.
00:17:12 So a sister in Ilulissat
00:17:14 studied with her over the phone.
00:17:21 She would tie in to the meetings during the long, cold months of winter,
00:17:28 but she felt that wasn’t enough.
00:17:31 So she moved some 300 miles to Ilulissat.
00:17:35 She remembers the tears at her first meeting.
00:17:39 Sara was now with her spiritual family.
00:17:43 In time, she was baptized.
00:17:49 The weather and distances make it difficult for the brothers and sisters,
00:17:54 but they return to these villages year after year,
00:17:59 searching for more ‘friends of peace’
00:18:03 in the vast and isolated regions
00:18:06 of northern Greenland.
00:18:21 That was fantastic, Thomas.
00:18:23 But it looks like there is a lot of work to do in Greenland.
00:18:25 Yes, there is.
00:18:27 And arrangements have been made so that Sarah and other native speakers
00:18:31 can tie in to the Greenlandic meetings in Nuuk for some parts of the meeting.
00:18:36 And besides that, at our meetings in Nuuk,
00:18:39 we also use simultaneous translation
00:18:42 using headphones and radio
00:18:44 so that whether you speak Danish or Greenlandic,
00:18:46 you can participate and benefit.
00:18:48 Wow!
00:18:49 That is absolutely amazing.
00:18:50 How do you say “wow” in Greenlandic?
00:18:58 I’ll leave that for you.
00:19:01 Thank you very much for being with us, Thomas.
00:19:02 And, again, for you  and your wife Peninna as well,
00:19:05 we wish you Jehovah’s blessing in your assignment.
00:19:14 Well, so far we’ve been talking about unity and language.
00:19:18 And some of the students have prepared a song that addresses just those themes.
00:19:22 So let’s enjoy the song that they’ve prepared to sing to their classmates.
00:22:42 That was a beautiful song sung in the 24 languages
00:22:45 of the heart of their classmates but with one voice.
00:22:48 Let’s welcome our next guests,
00:22:50 Meraf and Yohannes Gorems from Ethiopia.
00:22:57 Welcome, Johnny.
00:22:58 Welcome, Meraf.
00:23:00 Thank you.
00:23:01 Please.
00:23:06 I understand they call you Johnny, actually.
00:23:09 Johnny, you and Meraf have a different assignment.
00:23:12 Could you explain what your assignment is?
00:23:14 We are not Bethelites.
00:23:16 We serve in the circuit work.
00:23:19 But you like Bethelites?
00:23:20 I like.
00:23:23 Good.
00:23:25 So, what is the circuit work like in Ethiopia?
00:23:29 What are the people in Ethiopia like?
00:23:31 Ethiopian people are generally kind, warm,
00:23:35 hospitable, open to talking,
00:23:39 and most are religious people.
00:23:42 It is easy to start conversations because they love spiritual matters.
00:23:47 OK.
00:23:48 Is there maybe one experience, one special experience,
00:23:51 that stands out to you?
00:23:54 We were assigned a circuit in the southern part of Ethiopia.
00:23:58 Two special pioneers served there.
00:24:01 One of them asked me if I would go with him.
00:24:06 He had a return visit.
00:24:09 Two years ago, he met this man
00:24:11 and now he wanted to go back again.
00:24:15 Wait, so this is after two years.
00:24:18 He had a nice call; he studied with people there;
00:24:20 and now two years later, he wants to go back.
00:24:22 So why did he wait so long?
00:24:24 Because it was too remote.
00:24:26 How remote was it?
00:24:27 It takes three days from a nearby city to get there.
00:24:32 We started by bus, and we arrived in one small city.
00:24:37 Then we took a truck, seven to nine hours.
00:24:41 Sometimes we spent all night on that road.
00:24:47 So sleeping on the road —OK, there is a picture.
00:24:50 Yeah, but I slept well.
00:24:53 So I presume you took a truck because there were no more buses.
00:24:57 So the buses end, and now you take the truck.
00:24:59 After the truck, you walked?
00:25:01 I walked the rest of the way.
00:25:03 Short walk?
00:25:05 Depends what you call short.
00:25:09 If 11 hours is short to you, then yes.
00:25:16 Eleven hours?
00:25:17 So, what was it like walking 11 hours to this village?
00:25:22 When we walked in the jungle, I got scared.
00:25:27 I think I was thinking,
00:25:30 ‘If something happens here, how could I get out of this jungle?’
00:25:34 How could you get out?
00:25:36 Yeah, so I prayed.
00:25:38 Immediately, my thoughts changed from fear to boldness.
00:25:43 I was thinking that this is a privilege, like the apostles.
00:25:47 Interesting.
00:25:48 Now, Meraf, you were not with Yohannes.
00:25:51 So, what were you thinking while he was gone?
00:25:53 I mean, this is three days already he was gone.
00:25:55 That was the hardest part of my life
00:25:58 because there was no network to contact him.
00:26:01 I didn’t know whether he was alive, wounded, or lost.
00:26:04 I had no idea.
00:26:05 And we were in a circuit visit,
00:26:07 so I should look strong in front of others.
00:26:11 So I couldn’t say anything, but I was praying and crying a lot.
00:26:18 So you reached the village after your 11-hour walk.
00:26:21 You found the interested person?
00:26:23 Uh-huh. He had other Bible students.
00:26:27 The interested person had Bible students?
00:26:29 The interested person.
00:26:30 How long did you stay?
00:26:32 My plan was one or two days to spend there, but I couldn’t.
00:26:37 Because of the interest, you couldn’t leave?
00:26:38 Yeah, because of two things.
00:26:40 The first thing: They were very interested, so I had to stay there.
00:26:47 The other thing was our legs were like wood.
00:26:52 Like wood?
00:26:53 Yeah.
00:26:54 From 11 hours of walking?
00:26:56 Eleven hours, yeah.
00:26:57 But when we arrived there, we became strong.
00:27:02 Our tiredness was lifted
00:27:04 because the interested person really enjoyed that conversation.
00:27:08 When did you leave the village?
00:27:09 Sunday —Sunday morning.
00:27:14 Your legs were feeling better?
00:27:16 Yeah, we spent nine hours.
00:27:18 We got to one area
00:27:21 where we had a telephone,
00:27:24 so I could call her.
00:27:26 So you walked nine hours to get to a telephone.
00:27:30 What was that phone call like, Meraf?
00:27:32 As I told you, I wanted to cry because I was so worried.
00:27:35 And he called and said my name.
00:27:38 So I was so happy, and I started to cry.
00:27:42 What’s happened since then, after that visit?
00:27:44 Do you know what’s happened to them?
00:27:46 Most of them now have gotten baptized.
00:27:50 Recently, one circuit overseer
00:27:54 and one special pioneer visited them.
00:27:56 I have a video.
00:27:58 Maybe you would like to see them?
00:28:01 No maybe. Let’s have a look at the video, please.
00:28:06 Our journey begins here in Sodo.
00:28:09 Sodo has a thriving Amharic congregation
00:28:13 and three congregations in Wolaita.
00:28:17 And yet, the brothers travel to support the search,
00:28:20 even in villages far away.
00:28:23 Today, their destination  is the small village of Salaysh.
00:28:28 The journey is long, but the brothers settle in
00:28:32 and enjoy the beautiful countryside.
00:28:43 The first stop is Sawla, where our brothers
00:28:46 and sisters are waiting for them.
00:28:49 This is the end of the line for the bus ride.
00:28:53 How nice it will be to have a good night’s rest.
00:28:58 It is time to start walking,
00:29:02 unless you can catch a ride on one of these.
00:29:10 Today, they cross valleys,
00:29:12 mountains,
00:29:15 and rivers —some small
00:29:18 and some not so small.
00:29:20 Here, the brothers  have to wade through the river first;
00:29:24 then the drivers bring the motorbikes across.
00:29:28 I wish I had this option on my first trip.
00:29:35 One more stop;
00:29:36 time for a delicious meal in Layha with the local brothers.
00:29:41 I can still smell
00:29:43 the fresh roasted coffee.
00:29:51 Finally, they make it to Salaysh.
00:29:54 How I miss these brothers and sisters!
00:29:58 I met this brother years ago on my first visit.
00:30:09 There are ten publishers now in Salaysh.
00:30:13 They conduct 24 Bible studies,
00:30:16 and many are attending the meetings.
00:30:18 To think this all started  with just one interested person.
00:30:25 How do our brothers feel  to be part of God’s organization?
00:30:30 Jehovah loved us.
00:30:31 Because of his love, he drew us to him.
00:30:34 He made us a part of the international brotherhood.
00:30:37 We are very happy, and we thank Jehovah.
00:30:42 We thank him from our heart.
00:30:45 And I am thankful to Jehovah
00:30:47 that he included these dear friends
00:30:49 to join him in the search for more sheep.
00:31:04 You must be very happy to see those faces.
00:31:06 Yeah.
00:31:07 Just thinking about that trip,
00:31:09 when you were out there walking in the jungle,
00:31:11 going all of that way,
00:31:13 what did you learn from that?
00:31:15 I saw Jehovah’s hand
00:31:18 during that difficult trip.
00:31:21 Jehovah carried me.
00:31:23 We didn’t fear, because we saw Jehovah’s hand.
00:31:27 We felt we were in Jehovah’s hand.
00:31:29 Beautiful.
00:31:30 What about you, Meraf?
00:31:31 Waiting alone, not knowing what was happening to Yohannes,
00:31:34 what did you learn from that experience?
00:31:37 At that time, I was thinking,
00:31:40 ‘I know that Jehovah can protect him.’
00:31:42 So I was telling myself this, and that kept me strong.
00:31:46 Doing Jehovah’s will, Jehovah can protect him.
00:31:49 Very nice.
00:31:50 Yohannes and Meraf, thank you so much
00:31:52 for your experiences and being with us on The Inside Story.
00:31:55 Thank you.
00:32:01 Every one of the students has a story.
00:32:03 You have a story, and maybe one day,
00:32:06 we’ll all get to hear them.
00:32:08 But for today, we’ve just scratched the surface.
00:32:10 It’s been so encouraging to see the lengths
00:32:13 that our brothers and sisters will go to find ‘friends of peace.’
00:32:16 And it has been very touching to hear the lengths
00:32:19 that Jehovah will go to find his “little sheep” to bring them back.
00:32:23 We look forward to seeing you again on another episode of The Inside Story.
00:32:27 And that’s all for this time from the 145th class.
00:32:51 Well, we’d like to thank all those involved with producing The Inside Story.
00:32:55 It truly was appreciated by each one of us.

00:00:01 Now we come to the principal talk
00:00:04 of the graduation.
00:00:06 It’s going to be delivered by a member
00:00:08 of the Governing Body,  Brother Stephen Lett.
00:00:10 And the very interesting theme  he has selected is
00:00:15 “We Can Learn Much From Peter!”
00:00:25 Dear Gilead students,
00:00:28 let me ask you, Who is your favorite Bible character?
00:00:34 Well, during Gilead,
00:00:36 you’ve examined many Bible characters;
00:00:39 you’ve learned positive and negative lessons from them.
00:00:43 And perhaps your favorite character changed,
00:00:46 remained the same,
00:00:48 or now you have  several favorite Bible characters.
00:00:52 But no matter who your favorite character is,
00:00:55 during this talk, we’re going to learn
00:00:58 some of the many lessons to be learned
00:01:02 from the very interesting Bible character Peter.
00:01:06 Now first, let’s learn some things
00:01:09 we can learn about Jehovah and Jesus from Peter.
00:01:14 One thing we definitely learn
00:01:16 is that Jehovah and Jesus allow for
00:01:21 —in fact, apparently relish—
00:01:23 different personalities among their servants.
00:01:26 Now, to illustrate this,
00:01:28 let’s contrast the personality of Peter
00:01:32 with that of some of the other apostles.
00:01:34 Open up to John chapter 20,
00:01:37 and here’s a very interesting little scripture
00:01:40 highlighting two different personalities.
00:01:43 John 20:3:
00:01:48 “Then Peter and the other disciple [who would be John]
00:01:53 “set out for the tomb.
00:01:55 “The two of them began running together,
00:01:58 “but the other disciple ran faster than Peter  and reached the tomb first.
00:02:03 “Stooping forward, he saw the linen cloths lying there,
00:02:08 “but he did not go in.
00:02:11 “Then Simon Peter also came, following him,
00:02:15 “and he went into the tomb.
00:02:20 And he saw the linen cloths lying there.”
00:02:23 So John looked inside; Peter rushed inside.
00:02:28 Now, here’s another example:
00:02:30 When the mob came to arrest Jesus in Gethsemane,
00:02:35 John 18:10
00:02:38 says that Peter drew his sword
00:02:41 and cut the right ear of the slave of the high priest off.
00:02:47 Now, let’s think about this.
00:02:49 Do you think that Peter was going for that right ear?
00:02:54 I mean, that would truly be impressive —wouldn’t it?—
00:02:57 to go for that right ear and precisely take it off.
00:03:02 But remember, Peter was not a swordsman;
00:03:06 he was a fisherman.
00:03:09 Obviously, he was going for the man’s head, wasn’t he?
00:03:13 But he missed and took the ear off.
00:03:15 But what an impetuous,
00:03:18 you could say, personality he had there!
00:03:22 Here’s one more example:
00:03:24 The resurrected Jesus
00:03:26 is on the shore of the Sea of Galilee;
00:03:29 and the disciples are in the boat;
00:03:32 and John says to Peter, “It is the Lord.”
00:03:36 Well, upon hearing this, Peter put his garment on
00:03:38 and plunged into the sea.
00:03:40 The other disciples came in the boat.
00:03:43 So notice,
00:03:45 John spoke; Peter plunged.
00:03:50 The other disciples came in the boat; Peter came swimming.
00:03:55 Very different personalities
00:03:57 —but, as we said, Jehovah and Jesus relish
00:04:00 these different personalities among their servants.
00:04:04 But now, what’s the lesson for us?
00:04:06 Well, in imitation of Jehovah and Jesus,
00:04:09 we’re obligated
00:04:11 to “have love for the whole association of [our] brothers.”
00:04:15 —1 Peter 2:17.
00:04:17 And “whole” means 100 percent.
00:04:19 And that certainly includes those with very different personalities from ourselves
00:04:24 —ones from different cultures and backgrounds.
00:04:28 We’re obligated to receive these ones
00:04:32 into our company, into our homes, into our hearts.
00:04:37 Now, you’ve done a lot of this in the last five months,
00:04:40 you Gilead students.
00:04:42 Well, you want to keep doing this
00:04:44 and, of course, all of us want to do this.
00:04:47 But now, here’s another thing we learn about Jehovah and Jesus from Peter.
00:04:51 Jehovah and Jesus are very forgiving.
00:04:55 Now, let’s think about Jesus’ words
00:04:58 at Matthew 10:33.
00:05:01 In plain words
00:05:03 —and our publications have said
00:05:05 probably plain Hebrew words, it would have been—
00:05:09 Jesus said:
00:05:11 “Whoever disowns me before men,
00:05:14 “I will also disown him
00:05:16 before my Father who is in the heavens.”
00:05:19 Not once, not twice, but three times Peter did it, didn’t he?
00:05:24 But yet Jehovah and Jesus completely forgave him
00:05:27 because he was truly repentant.
00:05:29 In fact, to somewhat counterbalance what Peter had done,
00:05:33 Jesus allowed Peter
00:05:35 to reaffirm his love for Jesus three times.
00:05:39 Well, what’s the lesson for us?
00:05:41 We must imitate Jehovah and Jesus
00:05:44 in being very forgiving.
00:05:46 In fact, Jehovah makes it clear that He will forgive us
00:05:50 in direct proportion to how we forgive others.
00:05:54 If we don’t forgive others, Jehovah won’t forgive us.
00:05:57 Where does that leave us?
00:05:59 Doomed.
00:06:01 But let’s say we do forgive,
00:06:03 but we’re pretty tight; we’re pretty stingy.
00:06:06 It’s kind of hard to squeeze a little forgiveness out of us.
00:06:09 Well, the indication is that Jehovah puts
00:06:11 that same ruler on us that we put on others.
00:06:15 On the other hand, if we’re very generous in forgiving,
00:06:19 now Jehovah can be  very generous in forgiving us.
00:06:22 So if someone hurt you deeply
00:06:24 —has sinned against you—
00:06:26 don’t view this as a bad thing;
00:06:29 view this as a big opportunity.
00:06:32 You’ve got a big opportunity
00:06:35 to get a lot of forgiveness from Jehovah,
00:06:38 so cash in on that opportunity.
00:06:43 But now, in addition to what we can learn
00:06:46 about Jehovah and Jesus from Peter,
00:06:48 there are many lessons (positive and negative)
00:06:51 that we can learn from Peter himself.
00:06:53 So let’s do that.
00:06:54 Now, here’s a negative lesson:
00:06:56 At times, Peter spoke too quickly.
00:07:00 He had what has been called hoof-and-mouth disease.
00:07:06 What is that?
00:07:07 Open mouth; insert foot.
00:07:09 And some of us have the same problem, don’t we?
00:07:13 But here’s an example in Matthew chapter 16.
00:07:16 Jesus was explaining that he would have to go to Jerusalem,
00:07:20 suffer many things, and be killed.
00:07:23 Well, quickly Peter spoke up,
00:07:25 and he actually rebuked Jesus
00:07:27 —if you can imagine that.
00:07:30 “Be kind to yourself, Lord;
00:07:33 you will not have this happen to you at all.”
00:07:36 It was hoof-and-mouth disease —wasn’t it?—
00:07:39 followed by, as you could expect,
00:07:42 some correction, humiliation:
00:07:45 “Get behind me, Satan!”
00:07:48 But the indication is
00:07:51 that even though Peter had this problem, he overcame it.
00:07:55 He overcame this.
00:07:57 Several times he spoke too quickly.
00:07:59 But at 1 Peter 3:10,
00:08:02 he was able to write  with freeness of speech,
00:08:05 we know, and he would have lived up to this:
00:08:07 “Whoever would love life and see good days
00:08:12 must guard his tongue.”
00:08:14 So he learned.
00:08:16 It took time.
00:08:17 He learned just like we’re all learning.
00:08:20 But now, what’s the lesson for us?
00:08:22 Well, it’s summed up nicely here in Proverbs chapter 18.
00:08:25 Please go there.
00:08:26 Proverbs 18:13:
00:08:29 “When anyone replies to a matter before he hears the facts,
00:08:34 it is foolish and humiliating.”
00:08:38 So none of us can perfectly bridle our tongues.
00:08:42 But we do well to try to restrain our lips,
00:08:46 at least until we’ve heard the facts.
00:08:49 Now, here’s another negative lesson:
00:08:52 At times, Peter was overconfident.
00:08:55 The most notorious example
00:08:58 —Matthew chapter 26:
00:09:00 “Although all the others are stumbled in connection with you,
00:09:05 “I will never be stumbled!
00:09:08 “Even if I should have to die with you,
00:09:11 I will by no means disown you.”
00:09:14 Well, that was overconfidence, wasn’t it?
00:09:16 And we know it was ‘pride before the crash.’
00:09:20 Well, what was his problem?
00:09:22 He was relying, at this point, on himself
00:09:26 rather than Jehovah.
00:09:28 But again, the indication is very strong
00:09:30 that he overcame that weakness.
00:09:33 And later, he was able to write at 1 Peter 5:6:
00:09:36 “Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God.”
00:09:41 So don’t rely on yourself.
00:09:43 Be humble under Jehovah’s hand.
00:09:46 Now, what’s the lesson for us?
00:09:48 Well, like we learned at our convention
00:09:50 —the last talk on Saturday—
00:09:53 that true courage is not self-reliance.
00:09:57 True courage must be based
00:10:01 on modest reliance on Jehovah.
00:10:05 When we lean on ourselves, or rely on ourselves,
00:10:08 it’s like leaning, you could say, on a rubber crutch.
00:10:13 Did you ever lean on a rubber crutch?
00:10:16 You’re going to fall, aren’t you?
00:10:18 But at Deuteronomy 32:4, Jehovah is “the Rock.”
00:10:22 If you lean on a rock, now you have something.
00:10:25 So we learn that from Peter:
00:10:28 Don’t rely on yourself; rely always on Jehovah.
00:10:32 Now, here’s one more negative lesson:
00:10:34 At times, Peter was ensnared
00:10:37 by fear of man
00:10:39 or, we could say,  in his most infamous example,
00:10:42 fear of girl.
00:10:47 Interestingly, in Matthew 26:
00:10:50 ‘Peter was sitting outside and a servant girl came up and said to him:
00:10:55 ‘“You too were with Jesus the Galilean!”
00:10:59 ‘But he denied it.
00:11:01 ‘“I do not know what you’re talking about.”
00:11:04 ‘He went out to the gatehouse; another girl noticed him.
00:11:08 ‘“This man was with Jesus.”
00:11:11 Again he denied it, even with an oath.’
00:11:15 So his first two denials, you could say, were fear of girl.
00:11:22 But it is obviously clear
00:11:26 that he truly overcame that weakness, that problem,
00:11:30 and he became
00:11:32 an outspoken, bold Witness of Jehovah and Jesus.
00:11:36 Think, for example, in Acts chapter 5,
00:11:40 where Peter and the other apostles were in front of the Sanhedrin,
00:11:45 and the high priest said: ‘We ordered you
00:11:48 to quit teaching about this Jesus.’
00:11:51 Peter said: “We must obey God as ruler rather than men.”
00:11:57 ‘And furthermore, this Jesus, God has raised him from the dead.
00:12:02 This one that you killed.’
00:12:06 Wow!
00:12:08 No fear of man there, was there?
00:12:11 He obviously overcame this problem.
00:12:14 Now, what’s the lesson for us?
00:12:16 We want to do our utmost to never be ensnared
00:12:20 by fear of men, women, or girls.
00:12:26 And, of course, always remembering
00:12:28 that it’s Jehovah’s rating of us that counts will help us.
00:12:32 Humans can’t add five seconds to their life, can they?
00:12:35 Jehovah can add or subtract eternity.
00:12:39 But now, we’re going to move
00:12:41 to some positive lessons we can learn from Peter.
00:12:44 And by far, his positive qualities
00:12:46 outweigh the negative qualities that he displayed at times.
00:12:51 Now here’s one: Peter waited on Jehovah.
00:12:57 And a wonderful example of this is in John chapter 6.
00:13:01 Jesus had stated that unless you eat my flesh
00:13:05 and drink my blood,
00:13:07 you will not have everlasting life.
00:13:10 And the Bible says that many of the disciples were shocked;
00:13:14 they were stumbled; they quit following Jesus.
00:13:16 And Jesus said to Peter, ‘Do you want to leave also, Peter?’
00:13:21 Do you remember those beautiful words coming out of Peter’s mouth?
00:13:25 “Lord, whom shall we go away to?
00:13:29 You have [the] sayings of everlasting life.”
00:13:33 Now, if you think about it, Peter didn’t understand Jesus’ words
00:13:36 at this point any more than the rest did,
00:13:39 but he was willing to wait on Jehovah for further enlightenment.
00:13:43 And in time, he learned that those words
00:13:47 have to be understood figuratively
00:13:49 —that we have to exercise faith
00:13:51 in Jesus’ flesh and blood.
00:13:54 Well, what’s the lesson for us?
00:13:56 Like Peter, we must show
00:13:59 a waiting attitude for the “God of [our] salvation.”
00:14:03 —Micah 7:7.
00:14:05 Now, here are just a few examples:
00:14:07 Are we willing to wait —and this was touched on earlier in our program—
00:14:11 willing to wait with the right attitude
00:14:14 for any theocratic appointment,
00:14:17 or privilege of service?
00:14:20 Here’s another example:
00:14:22 Are we willing to wait uncomplainingly on Jehovah to correct
00:14:27 —in his way, his time—
00:14:29 any injustice that we perceive in the congregation?
00:14:34 Or what about this?
00:14:36 Are we willing to wait patiently
00:14:38 —and this could apply    to some of the single ones—
00:14:40 Are you willing to wait patiently on Jehovah
00:14:43 to provide you a suitable marriage mate,
00:14:47 even if you have to wait until the new world?
00:14:50 Yes, like Peter, let’s have a waiting attitude.
00:14:55 But now, here’s another positive lesson from Peter:
00:14:58 In order to make progress spiritually,
00:15:01 he was willing to move out of his comfort zones.
00:15:06 Now, let’s get some examples.
00:15:08 When invited, he promptly left a life of pursuing material things
00:15:13 for a life of storing up treasure in heaven.
00:15:17 And apparently, he was an older man when he did this.
00:15:21 But he did not put financial security ahead of following the Christ.
00:15:26 Or here’s another example:
00:15:28 He went from being an unlettered, ordinary fisherman,
00:15:31 probably talking primarily to hired men and fish merchants,
00:15:36 to being a bold Witness
00:15:39 of an unpopular message before thousands.
00:15:44 One more example:
00:15:46 He went from being very prejudiced
00:15:48 against Samaritans and Gentiles
00:15:52 to truly loving his Samaritan and Gentile brothers.
00:15:58 Well, what’s the lesson for us?
00:16:00 Are we willing to move out of our comfort zones
00:16:03 in order to make spiritual progress?
00:16:05 Now, all of you, you know where your comfort zones are.
00:16:08 But are you willing to move out in order to make spiritual progress?
00:16:13 What about, in some cases, especially if you’re given an assignment,
00:16:18 are you willing to go where the need is greater,
00:16:20 where Jehovah wants you to go?
00:16:23 Or what about reaching out for various forms of the ministry
00:16:26 that you may not right now feel so comfortable with
00:16:29 —maybe public witnessing or working business territory?
00:16:33 What about being more courageous in informal witnessing,
00:16:38 even though you may be a quiet and shy type of person?
00:16:43 Well, let’s get another positive lesson from Peter.
00:16:46 He allowed discipline
00:16:49 to mold rather than stumble him.
00:16:54 Of all the apostles, he was the most outspoken, wasn’t he?
00:16:59 But that was matched by his being the most frequently corrected,
00:17:03 reproved, rebuked.
00:17:06 But beautifully, he didn’t quit.
00:17:10 He never gave up, did he?
00:17:12 For example, we touched on this before, when Jesus said, “Get behind me, Satan!”
00:17:16 We don’t read that he pouted for weeks or months
00:17:19 because of that strong correction.
00:17:22 In fact, the Bible indicates that six days later,
00:17:25 Jesus took Peter, James, and John
00:17:28 up into a mountain to experience the transfiguration.
00:17:31 Or what about after Peter denied Jesus?
00:17:35 The Bible tells us  that Jesus looked straight at Peter
00:17:39 —in effect, indirect discipline.
00:17:42 Peter recalled what Jesus said.
00:17:45 He went outside, and he wept bitterly.
00:17:48 But yet you don’t read that he kept beating himself
00:17:52 —he kept being depressed over his serious sin of denying Jesus.
00:17:57 He knew Jehovah and Jesus had forgiven him.
00:18:00 So he put it behind him —didn’t he?—
00:18:02 and he moved ahead.
00:18:04 Well, the lesson for us?
00:18:06 Jehovah disciplines those he loves.
00:18:09 But don’t ever let  that discipline harden or embitter you.
00:18:13 Let it soften you into a better person.
00:18:17 If we’ve committed sins in the past,
00:18:20 even serious sins, like Peter,
00:18:22 let’s put them behind us and move ahead.
00:18:26 Well, one more positive lesson we’re going to talk about from Peter:
00:18:31 He gained and then he maintained
00:18:35 true humility.
00:18:37 Now, it’s true that he  had to really work hard to gain it, didn’t he?
00:18:41 He had to work at it because he and the other apostles
00:18:44 had been taught from infancy
00:18:46 to strive to be the greatest —seek prominence.
00:18:50 It was really indoctrinated into their minds and hearts.
00:18:53 And up until the very last night of Jesus’ life on the earth,
00:18:58 Peter still had a problem —didn’t he?—
00:19:00 and the other apostles too.
00:19:01 He had a problem.
00:19:03 Jesus was washing the feet.
00:19:06 John chapter 13 —Peter had not volunteered to do this
00:19:11 even after Jesus started washing the feet.
00:19:14 Have you ever thought about that?
00:19:16 Sometimes you don’t think of something until someone else starts doing it,
00:19:19 and you think, ‘Oh, well, let me help you with that.’
00:19:22 Did Peter say: ‘Oh. Oh, Lord.
00:19:24 ‘I see you’re washing these feet here.
00:19:26 Let me help you. Let me catch a couple of feet for you.’
00:19:31 No.  Neither he nor any of the apostles volunteered.
00:19:36 They still had a problem at this point.
00:19:39 But with Jehovah’s help and effort on his part,
00:19:43 in time, he truly developed true humility.
00:19:47 He went from the one striving to be the greatest
00:19:50 to the humbled man who lifted up Cornelius
00:19:54 when Cornelius tried to bow down to him.
00:19:57 Remember that account in Acts chapter 10?
00:20:00 “Peter lifted him up, saying:
00:20:03 ‘Rise; I too am just a man.’”
00:20:08 Or what about his genuine humility
00:20:10 when the apostle Paul corrected him publicly
00:20:14 in front of the whole congregation?
00:20:16 Now, if he would have still had pride—
00:20:18 ‘Well, who are you, Paul, to give me correction?
00:20:22 ‘I’ve been in the truth a lot longer than you have.
00:20:25 ‘When you were persecuting the Christians,
00:20:27 ‘I was an apostle.
00:20:29 ‘And furthermore, you could have at least talked to me privately,
00:20:33 not in front of the whole congregation.’
00:20:35 But no, he knew he was clearly wrong.
00:20:39 He deserved the counsel no matter how it was given.
00:20:42 He made the correction,
00:20:44 and he harbored no grudge.
00:20:48 And the indication is very powerful
00:20:50 that he remained humble
00:20:53 despite his many privileges.
00:20:55 I mean, looking back over his life, he had had many, many privileges.
00:21:00 Isn’t that true?
00:21:01 He walked on water, at least for a few minutes;
00:21:06 he saw Jesus transfigured;
00:21:09 he performed many miracles, including personally resurrecting Dorcas;
00:21:14 he received and used “the keys of the Kingdom”;
00:21:18 he helped many people into the truth.
00:21:20 But yet he remained truly humble
00:21:23 and could write with freeness of speech
00:21:26 in his inspired letter,
00:21:28 at 1 Peter 5:5,
00:21:31 these beautiful words that we read very often.
00:21:35 He said: “But all of you clothe yourselves
00:21:40 “with humility toward one another,
00:21:43 “because God opposes the haughty ones,
00:21:47 but he gives undeserved kindness to the humble ones.”
00:21:51 And where is Peter right now?
00:21:54 An immortal spirit
00:21:56 serving as one of the “12 foundation stones”
00:22:00 of the Messianic Kingdom.
00:22:03 So, what is the lesson for us?
00:22:06 We must gain true humility like Peter did.
00:22:10 Otherwise, if you think about it, we’re absolutely unusable by Jehovah.
00:22:15 And then, we must remain humble
00:22:18 no matter what privileges we may or may not receive,
00:22:23 and then Jehovah will never oppose us.
00:22:27 Rather, we will continue to receive undeserved kindness from him.
00:22:33 Well, our discussion has highlighted
00:22:36 just a few of the many lessons to be learned from Peter.
00:22:41 I’m sure that if you Gilead students —soon-to-be graduates—
00:22:44 make Peter a study project,
00:22:47 you could learn many, many more valuable lessons
00:22:51 and, of course, that’s true of many other Bible characters.
00:22:55 But unquestionably, there is so much to learn
00:22:59 from the faithful, colorful, human apostle Peter.
00:23:10 So now we come  to the point where we’re going to make
00:23:15 the presentation of the diplomas,
00:23:17 and Brother Ronald Curzan  is with me here.

00:28:38 Well, thank you very much,  Brother Curzan.
00:28:41 You did very well with those names.
00:28:43 Although, you did have me worried.
00:28:45 I thought we were sending  Brother Lett somewhere else, but,
00:28:49 anyway, I got over the shock.
00:28:53 Well, we’d like to introduce to you now
00:28:56 the graduates  of the 145th class of Gilead.
00:29:19 So at this point,  we’re going to have a class letter
00:29:23 read to us by Brother Krish Naidoo.
00:29:34 Wow, it’s amazing how  your friends can take your breath away.
00:29:41 “September 8, 2018.
00:29:43 “To the Governing Body  and the Bethel Family.
00:29:47 “Dear Brothers: Five months ago,
00:29:50 “we arrived with excitement  from the four corners of the earth.
00:29:54 “We anxiously waited  to be molded into the people
00:29:57 “that our Father, Jehovah,  knew we could become.
00:30:00 “Despite denied visas,  health issues, and insecurities,
00:30:05 “we were prepared  to be taught by our Grand Instructor.
00:30:09 “Even after enrollment,  further challenges presented themselves.
00:30:13 “As a class, we fought measles,
00:30:17 “endured quarantine, survived tornadoes,
00:30:21 “nursed broken bones,
00:30:24 “and comforted each other  in the face of bereavement.
00:30:27 “However, these hurdles  did not hamper us;
00:30:31 “they drew us closer together as siblings
00:30:34 “and to our Father, Jehovah.
00:30:36 “Isaiah gave us a glimpse  into a heavenly school
00:30:39 “when he described the training Jesus  was then receiving from Jehovah
00:30:43 “to prepare him for his earthly assignment.
00:30:46 “Isaiah 50:4 describes  Jesus’ special education saying:
00:30:50 “‘He awakens me morning by morning;
00:30:53 “‘he awakens my ear  to listen like the taught ones.’
00:30:58 “Jesus knew very well  the purpose of his training:
00:31:01 “‘So that [he] may know how to answer  the tired one with the right word.’
00:31:06 “Out of deep love and appreciation,
00:31:09 “he became  the perfect reflection of his Father.
00:31:12 “We too know very well  the purpose of the loving training
00:31:16 “we have received here at Gilead
00:31:18 “—to answer the tired one,  not out of our own thoughts,
00:31:22 “but with the words  taught to us through God’s Word.
00:31:26 “Many in the brotherhood  are like a smoldering wick
00:31:29 “and at times feel crushed in spirit.
00:31:31 “Jesus loved and cared for such ones.
00:31:34 “We are determined  to reflect the love Jesus developed
00:31:37 “through his schooling and bring true comfort
00:31:40 “and refreshment to our brothers.
00:31:42 “Words fail to express the depth of our gratitude
00:31:45 “for all that has been done for us.
00:31:48 “The Bethel family  welcomed us into their home
00:31:50 “and showed hospitality  to a degree that we never imagined.
00:31:54 “Our dear instructors became like fathers,
00:31:57 “teaching us with grace and dignity.
00:31:59 “They showed us how to honor  one another through their example.
00:32:03 “They took the time  to comfort us in the face of trials.
00:32:06 “The winsome words  we received through the curriculum
00:32:10 “were as soothing oil on our souls,
00:32:12 “healing and strengthening us  for the days ahead.
00:32:15 “For this, we wish to deeply thank our instructors
00:32:19 “as well as you dear brothers on the Governing Body.
00:32:22 “It is now clearer than ever to us that Jehovah is using you mightily
00:32:26 “in fulfilling your weighty assignment of overseeing the preaching work.
00:32:30 “Above all, we must thank
00:32:33 “our Father, Jehovah, from the bottom of our hearts
00:32:35 “for this precious and unforgettable gift.
00:32:38 “Jehovah truly has given us
00:32:40 “‘more than superabundantly  beyond all the things we ask.’
00:32:45 “At the end of this life-defining experience,
00:32:48 “we know our molding is far from complete.
00:32:52 “Our learning will continue.
00:32:54 “Our gratitude compels us to do our utmost
00:32:58 “to support you in all that we do.
00:33:01 “Our hearts overflow with excitement to work harder than ever before.
00:33:05 “May Jehovah continue to richly bless the marvelous provision of Gilead
00:33:10 “to the benefit of the worldwide brotherhood
00:33:12 “and the praise and honor of our most wonderful God, Jehovah.
00:33:16 Your brothers and sisters, the 145th Class of Gilead.”
00:33:26 Well, this is my opportunity
00:33:28 to say just a few final words to you.
00:33:31 There have been so many wonderful points
00:33:34 mentioned on our program today.
00:33:36 Remember how we started with our discussion
00:33:39 about the need to always bring glory to Jehovah
00:33:43 and not to be concerned about our own glory.
00:33:45 You remember we started off by mentioning
00:33:48 that maybe it could be tempting
00:33:50 to accept glory from others if they praise us.
00:33:53 But then on the other hand, if we get criticized,
00:33:56 it may also be tempting for us to try and justify ourselves
00:34:00 and inadvertently bring glory to ourselves.
00:34:04 But there is another way too that we may have to be careful
00:34:08 about not bringing glory to ourselves.
00:34:11 And we can see this
00:34:13 from the example of the apostle Paul.
00:34:15 Now, I know you didn’t bring your Bibles up.
00:34:17 All you have to do is listen.
00:34:19 It’s one scripture, 1 Corinthians chapter 2
00:34:23 —1 Corinthians 2:1, 2.
00:34:26 It’s a vital lesson that we learn from the apostle Paul.
00:34:29 Here he’s speaking about when he went to Corinth.
00:34:33 And as we realize, Corinth was a seat of learning.
00:34:36 The Greeks loved learning.
00:34:38 And what did he say?
00:34:40 In verses 1 and 2:
00:34:42 “So when I came to you, brothers,
00:34:44 “I did not come with extravagant speech
00:34:48 or wisdom declaring  the sacred secret of God to you.”
00:34:52 So Paul didn’t use
00:34:54 “extravagant speech” to impress people.
00:34:58 He says in verse 2: “For I decided.”
00:35:01 Yes, he made a decision.
00:35:03 What was it?
00:35:04 “I decided not to know anything
00:35:07 among you except Jesus Christ.”
00:35:10 And then if we look at verse 5,
00:35:12 he says: “So that your faith [may] be,
00:35:15 not in men’s wisdom, but in God’s power.”
00:35:19 What a wonderful example Paul set
00:35:22 with regard to not drawing attention
00:35:24 to his own wisdom and ability,
00:35:27 even though some in Corinth because of this
00:35:30 felt he wasn’t a very good speaker.
00:35:33 When we look at how Paul defended the good news
00:35:36 before audiences large and small,
00:35:39 he certainly was a very, very good orator.
00:35:43 He had that ability, but he decided
00:35:46 to tone it down
00:35:48 because he knew the brothers there had a weakness.
00:35:51 Now, what weaknesses were prevalent at that time?
00:35:55 Well, among the Jewish people
00:35:57 —and there were some Jewish people there in Corinth as well—
00:36:00 they loved to quote great rabbis
00:36:04 and scholars.
00:36:06 And, of course, the Greeks loved to quote the philosophers.
00:36:11 So, what lesson do you think we learn from this?
00:36:15 Well, now as you go to your assignments,
00:36:17 perhaps you might be tempted to say:
00:36:21 “Oh! The instructor
00:36:24 or a Governing Body member said this.”
00:36:30 But why should we follow
00:36:32 the example of the apostle Paul?
00:36:34 Well, you see, if we have something worthwhile
00:36:37 to convey to the brothers and sisters,
00:36:39 find it in God’s Word as you’ve been searching.
00:36:42 Look in the library—Watchtower Library.
00:36:45 Find something there, but don’t rely
00:36:48 upon the “rabbis,”
00:36:51 the “gurus,”
00:36:54 to show that you have some inside knowledge
00:36:57 that cannot be verified by other mere mortals.
00:37:01 Rather, rely upon God’s Word.
00:37:05 Yes, rely on his Word and the publications
00:37:08 that we have through his organization,
00:37:10 and in that way, you can be sure
00:37:12 you will bring glory to Jehovah
00:37:15 and not to yourselves.

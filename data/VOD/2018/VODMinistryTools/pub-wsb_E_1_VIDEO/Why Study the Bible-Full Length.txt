00:06 From the moment we can talk,  we ask questions.
00:13 Why is the sky blue?
00:16 What are the stars made of?
00:20 Why do bad things happen?
00:26 Where do we come from?
00:31 Why do people die?
00:36 People go to great lengths  to find answers.
00:41 Today, there is more information  available than ever before.
00:48 But the big questions —questions about life,
00:52 suffering, and death—still remain.
00:57 Where can we find answers?
01:02 What if the answers  have been there all along in the Bible?
01:11 A lot of people say,
01:13 the Bible is full of myths and legends.
01:18 That it’s outdated.
01:22 Or it’s just too hard to understand.
01:28 But is the Bible really the problem,
01:31 or is it what people think they  know about the Bible?
01:37 People think the Bible says  that God controls the world.
01:41 But how could that be?
01:44 This world is out of control!
01:50 It’s full of pain and suffering,
01:56 sickness and death,
02:00 poverty and disaster.
02:03 How could a loving God  be responsible for all of this?
02:07 What the Bible says may surprise you.
02:12 It says: “The Evil One  controls the whole world.”
02:17 In other words,  there’s an evil power
02:21 behind the world’s problems,
02:23 someone who’s pulling  the strings behind the scenes.
02:28 That’s why, no matter how hard we try,
02:32 humans just cannot solve  the world’s problems.
02:37 The good news is:
02:39 The Bible says things  will not always be like this!
02:43 It tells us why we’re in this situation,
02:47 how God will fix it,
02:49 and how we can deal with it  in the meantime.
02:54 The Bible is providing answers  to life’s big questions
02:58 for millions of people around the world.

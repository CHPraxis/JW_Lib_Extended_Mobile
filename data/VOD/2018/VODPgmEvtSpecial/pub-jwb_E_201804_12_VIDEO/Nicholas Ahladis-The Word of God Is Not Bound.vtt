00:02.218 --> 00:04.220
Jesus called the apostle Paul 


00:04.220 --> 00:06.288
“a chosen vessel.” 


00:06.288 --> 00:08.891
He was among the most dynamic ministers 


00:08.892 --> 00:10.694
who ever lived. 


00:10.693 --> 00:11.861
But when he wrote 


00:11.862 --> 00:13.764
his second letter to Timothy, 


00:13.763 --> 00:15.798
he was in prison bonds, 


00:15.798 --> 00:18.468
which severely limited 
what he could personally do 


00:18.468 --> 00:20.670
to spread the good news. 


00:20.670 --> 00:24.573
But that situation did not dishearten him. 


00:24.573 --> 00:27.876
His letter refers to what others were doing. 


00:27.877 --> 00:32.182
Luke was there 
with him in Rome but still free. 


00:32.182 --> 00:36.352
Aquila and Priscilla 
were still working hard in Ephesus. 


00:36.352 --> 00:40.890
He asked for Mark to come 
to assist him with the ministry and, 


00:40.890 --> 00:45.662
of course, he gave instructions 
to his beloved son Timothy. 


00:45.662 --> 00:47.864
But most important, 
notice what he said 


00:47.863 --> 00:52.000
at 2 Timothy 2:8, 9. 


01:01.243 --> 01:06.000
Second Timothy 2:8, 9: 


01:07.983 --> 01:10.653
“Remember that Jesus Christ was raised up 


01:10.653 --> 01:13.456
“from the dead and was David’s offspring, 


01:13.457 --> 01:15.792
“according to the good news I preach, 


01:15.792 --> 01:19.629
“for which I am suffering 
and being imprisoned as a criminal. 


01:19.628 --> 01:24.133
Nevertheless, the word of God is not bound.” 


01:24.133 --> 01:28.103
Yes, Paul was in chains, 
limiting what he could do, 


01:28.103 --> 01:30.106
but “the word of God” 


01:30.107 --> 01:32.609
—the message that he 
and others had been proclaiming— 


01:32.608 --> 01:34.610
was not bound. 


01:34.610 --> 01:37.580
It was alive; it was in the hearts 
of thousands of people 


01:37.580 --> 01:39.582
that they had preached to. 


01:39.582 --> 01:41.584
And it was to be recorded 


01:41.583 --> 01:44.853
in countless copies 
of the Scriptures in time. 


01:44.853 --> 01:47.790
Once this message was unleashed, 


01:47.790 --> 01:50.000
the power of it could never be bound again. 


01:52.095 --> 01:56.098
I’ll just read Hebrews 4:12, the first part. 


01:56.098 --> 01:58.100
It connects with this scripture. 


01:58.100 --> 01:59.902
It says: 


01:59.902 --> 02:04.107
“For the word of God 
is alive and exerts power.” 


02:04.107 --> 02:07.310
Now, on the second expression 
“exerts power,” 


02:07.310 --> 02:10.112
the Greek word 
according to the Kingdom Interlinear 


02:10.112 --> 02:13.382
says that it is “living” and “energetic.” 


02:13.382 --> 02:18.387
In fact, we derive 
the English word “energy” from this word. 


02:18.387 --> 02:23.025
But the context shows, 
both in Hebrews and in 2 Timothy, 


02:23.025 --> 02:25.595
that “the word of God” refers to the message 


02:25.595 --> 02:28.263
or expression of God’s purpose. 


02:28.263 --> 02:32.301
And, of course, that message 
is closely connected to the Bible today 


02:32.302 --> 02:36.000
because that’s the book 
that contains that message for us.


02:37.073 --> 02:39.075
And through the centuries, 


02:39.075 --> 02:42.445
opponents have tried 
to lessen the power, or energy, 


02:42.445 --> 02:46.548
of the Bible in these three ways: 


02:46.548 --> 02:51.000
first, by removing God’s name 
from copies of the Bible; 


02:52.122 --> 02:56.960
second, by destroying copies 
of the Scriptures in past centuries and, 


02:56.960 --> 03:01.000
more recently, by making it difficult 
to obtain in many languages; 


03:02.098 --> 03:07.603
and third, 
by means of inaccurate translation 


03:07.603 --> 03:10.240
and dead language. 


03:10.240 --> 03:14.977
These three developments have been 
like a short circuit in an electric line. 


03:14.977 --> 03:19.000
The power is hindered 
from reaching its destination. 


03:20.048 --> 03:22.051
Jehovah’s organization has moved 


03:22.052 --> 03:25.054
in the opposite direction 
on these three fronts. 


03:25.053 --> 03:30.025
And tonight, we’re going to consider 
three roles of the New World Translation 


03:30.025 --> 03:34.397
in ensuring that the power 
of Jehovah’s Word is not bound: 


03:34.397 --> 03:38.935
first, by making 
God’s name known earth wide; 


03:38.935 --> 03:43.840
second, by making 
the Scriptures freely available to all; 


03:43.840 --> 03:47.177
and third, by making God’s message 


03:47.177 --> 03:50.580
accurate, clear, and alive. 


03:50.580 --> 03:52.582
And we’re also going to discuss 


03:52.582 --> 03:55.285
the role of the worldwide Bethel family 


03:55.285 --> 03:58.453
in this regard. 


03:58.453 --> 04:01.991
So first, we’re going to consider 
the role of the New World Translation 


04:01.992 --> 04:06.129
in making God’s name known earth wide. 


04:06.128 --> 04:08.496
Before Christ’s brothers began work 


04:08.497 --> 04:11.300
on the New World Translation in the 1940’s, 


04:11.300 --> 04:15.070
English Bibles 
like American Standard Version, Rotherham, 


04:15.070 --> 04:19.475
and others had already restored 
the divine name in the Hebrew Scriptures 


04:19.475 --> 04:24.180
based on the strong manuscript evidence 
that they found. 


04:24.180 --> 04:29.018
Translations like The Emphatic Diaglott 
even used it in the Greek Scriptures. 


04:29.018 --> 04:32.588
But these translations 
were like the proverbial “dead lion” 


04:32.588 --> 04:35.190
of Ecclesiastes 9:4. 


04:35.190 --> 04:38.662
In the 1940’s, 
people almost exclusively read 


04:38.662 --> 04:40.897
the archaic King James Version 


04:40.897 --> 04:44.667
with its four occurrences of Jehovah’s name. 


04:44.667 --> 04:49.605
The first real challenge to the dominance 
of the King James Version in English 


04:49.605 --> 04:54.443
was the Revised Standard Version, 
which was published in 1952. 


04:54.443 --> 04:57.880
But the committee of that version 
strongly rejected 


04:57.880 --> 05:01.817
the American Standard Bible policy 
of using the divine name, 


05:01.817 --> 05:05.220
and they substituted it everywhere 
with “Lord.” 


05:05.220 --> 05:09.558
And today, almost all English Bibles 
follow that policy. 


05:09.558 --> 05:13.361
There are a few exceptions, 
but this is the mainstream. 


05:13.362 --> 05:14.730
In fact, 


05:14.730 --> 05:16.465
here are the five 


05:16.465 --> 05:18.533
best-selling English Bibles, 


05:18.533 --> 05:22.705
according 
to the Christian Booksellers Association. 


05:22.705 --> 05:25.173
The total occurrences of the name Jehovah 


05:25.173 --> 05:26.675
in these five Bibles 


05:26.675 --> 05:28.343
are the four occurrences 


05:28.343 --> 05:30.346
in the King James Version 


05:30.347 --> 05:32.949
plus the seven occurrences of Yahweh 


05:32.948 --> 05:35.418
in The New Living Translation. 


05:35.418 --> 05:37.186
There are no occurrences 


05:37.187 --> 05:39.422
in any of the other three Bibles: 


05:39.422 --> 05:40.957
New International Version, 


05:40.957 --> 05:42.625
New King James Version, 


05:42.625 --> 05:45.562
and English Standard Version. 


05:45.562 --> 05:48.497
That means 
that all of these popular Bibles say: 


05:48.497 --> 05:51.967
“I am the Lord, that is my name,” 


05:51.967 --> 05:55.000
or “The name of the Lord 
is a strong tower.” 


05:57.807 --> 06:00.377
Consider Exodus 6:3 in the popular, 


06:00.377 --> 06:03.079
actually, 
the best-selling New International Version; 


06:03.078 --> 06:05.915
it’s even passed the King James Version: 


06:05.915 --> 06:08.417
“I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, 


06:08.417 --> 06:10.987
“and to Jacob as God Almighty, 


06:10.987 --> 06:12.989
“but by my name the LORD 


06:12.988 --> 06:16.000
I did not make myself fully known to them.” 


06:18.060 --> 06:21.130
There are four names here in the Hebrew text: 


06:21.130 --> 06:24.067
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, 


06:24.067 --> 06:27.137
and the Tetragrammaton, Jehovah. 


06:27.137 --> 06:29.205
Now, a primary reason given 


06:29.205 --> 06:32.275
in the Revised Standard Version 
and many other Bibles 


06:32.275 --> 06:34.577
for substituting “LORD” 


06:34.577 --> 06:38.480
is because “Jehovah” 
is not the original pronunciation 


06:38.480 --> 06:41.350
or that it should be “Yahweh.” 


06:41.350 --> 06:45.153
But the fact is we don’t pronounce 
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob 


06:45.153 --> 06:48.223
the same way that the ancient Jews did. 


06:48.223 --> 06:51.793
We probably don’t know 
exactly how they pronounced it. 


06:51.793 --> 06:55.330
It may have varied over the centuries. 


06:55.330 --> 06:57.333
But following their reasoning, 


06:57.333 --> 07:00.770
their translation should say: 


07:00.770 --> 07:03.172
‘I appeared to your forefather, 


07:03.172 --> 07:04.440
‘and to his son, 


07:04.440 --> 07:07.443
‘and to his grandson as God Almighty, 


07:07.443 --> 07:09.445
‘but by my name the LORD 


07:09.445 --> 07:13.548
I did not make myself fully known to them.’ 


07:13.548 --> 07:16.718
Now, this is obviously 
an unreasonable approach 


07:16.718 --> 07:20.188
to translating the first three names, 
don’t you agree? 


07:20.188 --> 07:23.691
But that’s exactly what they did 
with the fourth name. 


07:23.692 --> 07:25.995
They said, 
‘We don’t pronounce it the same way, 


07:25.995 --> 07:28.397
so we’re not going to translate it.’ 


07:28.397 --> 07:30.900
But taking this even a step further, 


07:30.900 --> 07:34.537
if they were so concerned that “Jehovah” 


07:34.537 --> 07:37.707
is not the exact pronunciation of God’s name, 


07:37.707 --> 07:40.242
what about the name Jesus? 


07:40.242 --> 07:42.379
Acts 4:12 says: 


07:42.378 --> 07:46.281
‘There is no other name that has been given 
by which we must get saved.’ 


07:46.282 --> 07:50.252
So is its pronunciation equally important? 


07:50.252 --> 07:52.655
In fact, scholars don’t even agree 


07:52.655 --> 07:57.560
on whether Jesus and his disciples 
spoke Hebrew or Aramaic, 


07:57.560 --> 07:59.995
which would affect the pronunciation. 


07:59.995 --> 08:02.565
Hebrew would be something like Ye·shuʹa‛; 


08:02.565 --> 08:05.702
Aramaic, Ye·shuʹ 
—something like that. 


08:05.702 --> 08:08.304
But what about 
the poor Greek-speaking disciples 


08:08.303 --> 08:10.806
who didn’t have the “s-h” sound? 


08:10.807 --> 08:13.275
They said I·e·sousʹ. 


08:13.275 --> 08:18.713
But that was the form 
recorded in the inspired Scriptures. 


08:18.713 --> 08:23.385
The most corrupted pronunciation 
is “Jesus” in English. 


08:23.385 --> 08:27.657
It’s nothing like they would have said it 
in the first century, 


08:27.657 --> 08:31.927
but that doesn’t prevent 
its use some 900 times 


08:31.927 --> 08:35.064
or even more in all of these Bibles. 


08:35.063 --> 08:38.133
So their position on removing God’s name 


08:38.133 --> 08:41.536
on the grounds of pronunciation 
is indefensible. 


08:41.537 --> 08:46.000
In legal terms, the Legal Department 
would call it a crime of omission. 


08:47.843 --> 08:51.146
But the situation 
regarding God’s name is the same 


08:51.147 --> 08:54.284
and even worse in other languages. 


08:54.283 --> 08:57.051
Well, you ask, ‘How could it be worse?’ 


08:57.052 --> 09:01.590
When God’s name is substituted 
with the name of a local god. 


09:01.590 --> 09:05.595
That was done 
with the Chichewa Bible in Malawi. 


09:05.595 --> 09:08.830
This journal, 
it’s called The Bible Translator, 


09:08.830 --> 09:11.533
sets policies for translators 


09:11.533 --> 09:15.036
of the United Bible societies worldwide, 


09:15.037 --> 09:18.474
and it explains why Jehovah’s name 


09:18.473 --> 09:21.000
was replaced with the name Chauta. 


09:22.345 --> 09:24.013
Here they give the reason: 


09:24.013 --> 09:27.716
“In this respect the important revelation 


09:27.717 --> 09:29.752
“for Chewa people today 


09:29.752 --> 09:32.522
“is that the foreign deity Yehova 


09:32.522 --> 09:34.590
“is really Chauta, 


09:34.590 --> 09:36.158
“the God they’ve always known 


09:36.158 --> 09:37.191
“and worshipped 


09:37.192 --> 09:39.362
“and the God whom their ancestors 


09:39.362 --> 09:41.464
“also turned to for help 


09:41.463 --> 09:44.400
in the time of trouble!” 


09:44.400 --> 09:46.968
It’s incredible reasoning, isn’t it? 


09:46.968 --> 09:51.273
No wonder our Chichewa brothers 
refuse to use this Bible, 


09:51.273 --> 09:54.110
even though it was far easier to understand 


09:54.110 --> 09:56.845
than their previous Bible. 


09:56.845 --> 09:58.000
This is one of the so-called solutions 


09:59.048 --> 10:01.083
found in this special issue 


10:01.083 --> 10:05.153
of The Bible Translator from October 1992 


10:05.153 --> 10:09.725
on the topic translating the names of God. 


10:09.725 --> 10:12.227
And these policies are still current 


10:12.227 --> 10:15.597
among translators today. 


10:15.597 --> 10:17.700
The editor’s opening comments give an idea 


10:17.700 --> 10:19.702
of the direction given. 


10:19.702 --> 10:22.972
“It has become clear in recent years . . . 


10:22.972 --> 10:26.075
“that no one solution to the problems 


10:26.075 --> 10:29.212
“we face in translating the names of God 


10:29.212 --> 10:32.782
will meet all situations.” 


10:32.782 --> 10:34.417
First, their wording gives the impression 


10:34.417 --> 10:37.654
that God has a number of personal names. 


10:37.653 --> 10:41.323
Also, these consultants 
frequently call it a “problem” 


10:41.323 --> 10:44.326
because for them it is a genuine problem. 


10:44.327 --> 10:46.429
They know that God’s name 


10:46.428 --> 10:49.798
is the most frequently occurring name 
in the whole Bible. 


10:49.798 --> 10:52.735
It occurs thousands of times 
in the Hebrew text. 


10:52.735 --> 10:56.805
And they also know 
why others include it in the Bible. 


10:56.805 --> 10:58.000
In fact, on page 409 


10:59.375 --> 11:01.143
of this journal, 


11:01.143 --> 11:03.145
there’s a quote from the foreword 


11:03.145 --> 11:05.180
of the American Bible Society, 


11:05.180 --> 11:08.450
of the American Standard Bible Society: 


11:08.450 --> 11:11.920
“This personal name [Jehovah], 


11:11.920 --> 11:14.657
“with its wealth of sacred associations, 


11:14.657 --> 11:17.025
“is now restored to the place 


11:17.025 --> 11:19.095
“in the sacred text to which it has 


11:19.095 --> 11:21.230
an unquestionable claim.” 


11:21.230 --> 11:23.732
And that’s 
what the American Standard Bible did, 


11:23.732 --> 11:25.735
and it sounds reasonable. 


11:25.735 --> 11:27.803
But notice the conclusion: 


11:27.803 --> 11:29.805
“It cannot be denied 


11:29.805 --> 11:31.807
“that this [American Standard] view 


11:31.807 --> 11:33.242
“influenced the thinking 


11:33.242 --> 11:35.477
“of scores of evangelical missionaries 


11:35.477 --> 11:37.880
“who were sent out to various places 


11:37.880 --> 11:40.817
“in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. . . . 


11:40.817 --> 11:43.319
“Consequently, the name “Jehovah” 


11:43.318 --> 11:45.320
“was mistakenly introduced 


11:45.320 --> 11:47.723
“as a translation of the name of God, 


11:47.723 --> 11:50.391
“a name which would remain undisputed 


11:50.392 --> 11:52.562
“and be considered unchangeable 


11:52.562 --> 11:55.664
for many years to come.” 


11:55.663 --> 11:58.800
So they viewed “Jehovah” as a mistake. 


11:58.800 --> 12:01.270
They don’t say “Jesus” was a mistake, 


12:01.270 --> 12:05.942
even though, as we saw, 
the same pronunciation issues apply. 


12:05.942 --> 12:10.780
But this so-called mistake 
led to an interesting situation. 


12:10.780 --> 12:13.648
As they say, scores of Bibles were produced 


12:13.648 --> 12:15.650
by those missionary translators, 


12:15.650 --> 12:18.653
and they used the name thousands of times. 


12:18.653 --> 12:21.656
But many of those missionaries 
who translated those Bibles 


12:21.657 --> 12:23.659
were not native speakers, 


12:23.658 --> 12:28.030
so their translations 
were often difficult to understand. 


12:28.030 --> 12:30.867
In the latter half of the 20th century, 


12:30.867 --> 12:33.802
translators like Eugene Nida led a movement 


12:33.802 --> 12:36.372
to revise many of those older Bibles 


12:36.372 --> 12:39.275
to make them more understandable. 


12:39.275 --> 12:41.710
But Nida, whom The New York Times 


12:41.710 --> 12:46.015
refers to as “the father 
of modern Bible translation,” 


12:46.015 --> 12:50.685
expresses his view 
about the divine name in his book 


12:50.685 --> 12:54.957
The Theory and Practice of Translation. 


12:54.957 --> 12:56.959
He says: 


12:56.958 --> 13:00.028
“There is a kind of divine ambiguity 


13:00.028 --> 13:02.263
“in the use of the same term 


13:02.263 --> 13:07.035
to apply both to God and to Jesus Christ.” 


13:07.035 --> 13:11.807
Ambiguity, yes, but not divine. 


13:11.807 --> 13:14.677
Such statements 
are repeated in other references 


13:14.677 --> 13:18.814
—for example, by consultants 
for the Wycliffe Bible Society. 


13:18.813 --> 13:23.318
And they show the real reason 
why so-called Christian translators 


13:23.318 --> 13:27.088
are so ready to omit the name Jehovah: 


13:27.088 --> 13:29.090
because it creates confusion 


13:29.090 --> 13:33.862
between Jehovah and his Son, Jesus Christ. 


13:33.862 --> 13:35.865
Because of these developments, 


13:35.865 --> 13:39.602
brothers in fields 
like Chichewa, Hindi, Thai, and others 


13:39.602 --> 13:41.804
were left with a choice: 


13:41.803 --> 13:46.041
either use a hard-to-understand Bible 
containing God’s name 


13:46.042 --> 13:49.412
or a readable one that omitted the name. 


13:49.412 --> 13:51.747
What do you think the brothers did? 


13:51.747 --> 13:56.085
In almost every case, 
they chose the difficult Bible, 


13:56.085 --> 13:59.755
even if it was harder for them 
to read and understand, 


13:59.755 --> 14:02.925
because it had Jehovah’s name in it. 


14:02.925 --> 14:04.000
To understand the frustration, 


14:05.460 --> 14:08.063
imagine this sister in India 


14:08.063 --> 14:11.066
trying to explain 
why we are called Jehovah’s Witnesses 


14:11.067 --> 14:13.069
to this householder. 


14:13.068 --> 14:15.436
She could read Isaiah 43:10, 


14:15.437 --> 14:17.439
but if her Bible said, 


14:17.438 --> 14:20.508
“‘You are my witnesses,’ declares the Lord,” 


14:20.508 --> 14:23.011
she might have to explain that in Hebrew 


14:23.012 --> 14:27.182
there are four letters here 
that should say “Jehovah.” 


14:27.182 --> 14:30.519
The woman might ask: 
‘What is Hebrew? 


14:30.518 --> 14:33.321
What does Hebrew have to do with this?’ 


14:33.322 --> 14:36.092
After explaining, she might ask our sister, 


14:36.092 --> 14:39.000
‘So do you know Hebrew 
so that you can explain this to me?’ 


14:40.228 --> 14:42.631
Some brothers have been so frustrated 


14:42.632 --> 14:44.934
that they would read “Jehovah” 


14:44.933 --> 14:47.535
even when their Bibles said “Lord.” 


14:47.535 --> 14:49.605
But when the householder 


14:49.605 --> 14:51.607
would see that they 
were reading something different, 


14:51.607 --> 14:54.175
they would become suspicious. 


14:54.175 --> 14:59.047
But it’s interesting 
talking about the context of India. 


14:59.047 --> 15:03.619
This Bible Translator has an article 
about the reaction in Christendom 


15:03.618 --> 15:06.088
—not among our brothers, 
but in Christendom— 


15:06.088 --> 15:08.156
where Jehovah’s name was replaced 


15:08.157 --> 15:13.000
by the word Prabhu or “Lord” 
in Hindi and Nepali Bibles. 


15:14.830 --> 15:15.897
The article entitled 


15:15.897 --> 15:17.432
“What Is His Name? 


15:17.432 --> 15:22.470
Translation of Divine Names 
in Indian Languages” explains: 


15:22.470 --> 15:24.840
“Not all Christians are happy 


15:24.840 --> 15:26.542
“with this solution however. . . . 


15:26.542 --> 15:28.977
“[He’s talking about Christians 
in Christendom.] 


15:28.977 --> 15:31.747
“The first reason is an emotional one: 


15:31.747 --> 15:34.350
“the readers have been so used to reading 


15:34.350 --> 15:36.852
“and hearing the transliteration Jehovah 


15:36.852 --> 15:38.854
“that they have come to attach 


15:38.853 --> 15:41.656
“some kind of sacred significance to it. 


15:41.657 --> 15:43.459
“[Poor people.] 


15:43.458 --> 15:44.993
“They have become 


15:44.993 --> 15:46.861
“so emotionally attached to the name 


15:46.862 --> 15:48.864
“that no amount of argument 


15:48.863 --> 15:51.000
“can make them change their minds. 


15:52.267 --> 15:53.535
“The second reason . . . , 


15:53.535 --> 15:56.505
“as some Nepali Christians told me, 


15:56.505 --> 15:58.207
“they are often asked by Hindus 


15:58.207 --> 16:00.342
for the name of the Christian God. 


16:00.342 --> 16:02.679
“The Hindus claim that all Hindu gods 


16:02.678 --> 16:04.680
“and goddesses have a personal name 


16:04.680 --> 16:07.048
“such as Ram, Krishna, Brahma, . . . 


16:07.048 --> 16:08.750
“and when they know the names 


16:08.750 --> 16:10.385
“of the gods and goddesses 


16:10.385 --> 16:13.888
they can relate themselves to the deities.” 


16:13.888 --> 16:16.725
Now since Prabhu or “Lord” can be used 


16:16.725 --> 16:19.962
for “husband,” “master,” and “god,” 


16:19.962 --> 16:23.799
Hindus will not accept it 
as being God’s name. 


16:23.798 --> 16:26.000
So he continues in his article: 


16:27.502 --> 16:29.505
“Hindus are not interested 


16:29.505 --> 16:31.340
“in the title of God; 


16:31.340 --> 16:32.675
“they want to know 


16:32.675 --> 16:34.377
“the personal name of God, 


16:34.377 --> 16:36.379
“and unless they know the name, 


16:36.378 --> 16:38.446
“they cannot relate themselves 


16:38.447 --> 16:40.749
to the one who bears it.” 


16:40.748 --> 16:42.000
Now notice his conclusion: 


16:44.152 --> 16:46.255
“Having said all that, however, 


16:46.255 --> 16:49.458
“and having argued in favour of translating 


16:49.458 --> 16:52.160
“the name YHWH by [LORD], . . . 


16:52.160 --> 16:53.895
“I must concede 


16:53.895 --> 16:56.032
“that in the light of recent studies . . . 


16:56.032 --> 16:59.067
“a new approach may become necessary. 


16:59.067 --> 17:01.337
“That means that the last word 


17:01.337 --> 17:02.637
“has not been said 


17:02.637 --> 17:04.072
“on the question of rendering 


17:04.072 --> 17:06.642
“the ‘Tetragrammaton’ YHWH in North Indian 


17:06.642 --> 17:09.044
(and other) languages.” 


17:09.043 --> 17:11.146
Well happily, 
this is the last statement 


17:11.147 --> 17:13.849
we’re going to read 
from The Bible Translator, 


17:13.848 --> 17:16.818
and it’s the only one we agree with. 


17:16.818 --> 17:20.221
In fact, the last word 
for some languages of India 


17:20.222 --> 17:23.559
was spoken one month ago. 


17:23.558 --> 17:28.563
On September 4, 2016, 
a video of Brother Herd was broadcast 


17:28.563 --> 17:31.400
throughout India, in Sri Lanka 


17:31.400 --> 17:34.202
and to brothers in other locations, 


17:34.202 --> 17:36.305
as he announced the release 


17:36.305 --> 17:38.940
of the complete 
New World Translation in Hindi, 


17:38.940 --> 17:41.000
Malayalam, and Tamil 


17:42.043 --> 17:46.000
and the Christian Greek Scriptures 
in Marathi and Telugu. 


17:47.750 --> 17:48.950
The whole New World Bible 


17:48.950 --> 17:50.952
was already available in Sinhala; 


17:50.952 --> 17:52.220
in the Greek Scriptures, 


17:52.220 --> 17:53.988
in Kannada, Gujarati, 


17:53.988 --> 17:55.856
Nepali, and Punjabi. 


17:55.857 --> 17:57.760
So our brothers in India, 


17:57.760 --> 17:59.428
Nepal, and Sri Lanka 


17:59.428 --> 18:02.296
have all these Bibles available 


18:02.297 --> 18:04.299
to make Jehovah’s name known 


18:04.298 --> 18:09.000
in that vast field of 1.3 billion people. 


18:10.972 --> 18:14.409
Jehovah says at Ezekiel 38:23: 


18:14.408 --> 18:18.580
“I will certainly magnify myself 
and sanctify myself 


18:18.580 --> 18:22.785
“and make myself known 
before the eyes of many nations; 


18:22.785 --> 18:27.322
and they will have to know 
that I am Jehovah,” 


18:27.322 --> 18:30.325
—not ‘that I am the Lord,’ 


18:30.325 --> 18:35.330
not ‘that I am Prabhu, 
or Señor, or Chauta,’ 


18:35.330 --> 18:38.533
but Jehovah. 


18:38.533 --> 18:42.103
The undeniable trend 
in Bible translation worldwide 


18:42.103 --> 18:44.573
is to omit God’s name. 


18:44.573 --> 18:48.576
And Jehovah is countering that 
by using the New World Translation 


18:48.577 --> 18:51.380
to figuratively unchain his people 


18:51.380 --> 18:55.750
from Bibles that fail 
to honor and sanctify his name. 


18:55.750 --> 18:59.922
And we’re happy 
that 95 percent of our brothers in India 


18:59.922 --> 19:02.557
and over 90 percent worldwide 


19:02.557 --> 19:06.929
have a modern translation 
of at least the Christian Greek Scriptures 


19:06.928 --> 19:09.000
that uses the name Jehovah. 


19:11.700 --> 19:14.837
Second, we’re going to discuss 
the role of the New World Translation 


19:14.837 --> 19:18.000
in making the Scriptures freely available. 


19:19.273 --> 19:23.978
In the past, 
opponents like Roman Emperor Diocletian 


19:23.978 --> 19:25.980
and the clergy of the Middle Ages 


19:25.980 --> 19:29.183
gathered and burned copies of the Scriptures. 


19:29.183 --> 19:32.921
The Bible survived, 
and copies are freely available 


19:32.922 --> 19:37.659
in languages like English, 
French, Spanish, and others. 


19:37.658 --> 19:40.461
But today, economic and copyright issues 


19:40.462 --> 19:44.465
have made the Bible 
difficult to obtain in many languages. 


19:44.465 --> 19:46.702
A South American missionary wrote: 


19:46.702 --> 19:51.374
“The Bible societies translate 
into many Amerindian languages, 


19:51.373 --> 19:55.210
“but it seems like every
new translation is just a trophy. 


19:55.210 --> 20:00.115
“It is translated, printed in a few copies, 
and then forgotten. 


20:00.115 --> 20:04.620
“Usually these translations 
are expensive, complicated, 


20:04.620 --> 20:08.957
and simply not available 
to the people who need them.” 


20:08.957 --> 20:11.894
A request was made 
to translate the New World Translation 


20:11.893 --> 20:13.895
into a language of the Pacific 


20:13.895 --> 20:18.733
because the only Bible 
had removed the divine name completely, 


20:18.733 --> 20:21.236
and it is not readily available, 


20:21.237 --> 20:25.440
since only small quantities 
of this Bible were originally printed, 


20:25.440 --> 20:28.000
and it is not currently being reprinted. 


20:29.343 --> 20:31.980
Yes, it’s true 
that the Bible has been translated 


20:31.980 --> 20:36.252
whole or in part 
into 2,800 or more languages, 


20:36.252 --> 20:40.855
but it is readily available 
in just a fraction of those languages. 


20:40.855 --> 20:45.027
And Bibles are especially poor in areas 


20:45.027 --> 20:49.632
where the population 
doesn’t have money to spend on Bibles, 


20:49.632 --> 20:51.900
printing is unprofitable, 


20:51.900 --> 20:55.537
and it’s often in areas 
where we have great increases. 


20:55.537 --> 20:57.739
In some languages, 


20:57.738 --> 21:01.476
a Bible may cost up to a monthly salary. 


21:01.477 --> 21:05.180
And the copies that brothers get 
for their monthly salary 


21:05.180 --> 21:08.850
are often missing pages 
—sometimes whole Bible books— 


21:08.850 --> 21:12.000
and sometimes they are 
just roughly-bound photo copies. 


21:14.088 --> 21:18.826
When a branch office 
tries to obtain Bibles at reduced cost 


21:18.827 --> 21:23.032
or even offers to reprint 
the Bible in such languages, 


21:23.032 --> 21:26.602
they’re often rebuffed 
by the copyright holders. 


21:26.602 --> 21:29.004
In Malawi, for example, 
our brothers were told 


21:29.003 --> 21:32.773
not even to quote 
the Bible in our publications 


21:32.773 --> 21:36.000
so that the sales of their Bible 
would not be threatened. 


21:37.412 --> 21:39.715
Visitors to some African lands 


21:39.715 --> 21:42.917
have been shocked 
to see over a hundred brothers 


21:42.917 --> 21:46.455
sharing two or three Bibles 
in the congregation. 


21:46.455 --> 21:48.457
A brother wrote: 


21:48.457 --> 21:52.660
“Most Tshiluba-speaking brothers
in Congo did not own a Bible. 


21:52.660 --> 21:55.997
“Each copy was passed around 
like a microphone 


21:55.997 --> 21:58.734
when a ‘read’ scripture was called.” 


21:58.733 --> 22:03.738
Otetela congregations in Congo 
often just had one or two copies. 


22:03.738 --> 22:08.000
Brothers used to go to the Kingdom Hall 
to practice their talks with the Bible. 


22:10.612 --> 22:13.115
Well, this makes these images 
of Brother Lösch in Congo 


22:13.115 --> 22:15.283
releasing the Christian Greek Scriptures 


22:15.283 --> 22:20.000
in Tshiluba, Kongo, 
and Otetela even more meaningful. 


22:21.055 --> 22:24.927
This brother’s reaction 
may seem dramatic to us, 


22:24.927 --> 22:29.765
but it may have been 
his first personal copy of the Bible. 


22:29.765 --> 22:34.668
And you see this crowd 
carefully studying their new Bibles. 


22:34.668 --> 22:38.240
I notice they’re not comparing it 
with their previous copy, 


22:38.240 --> 22:43.645
likely because for many of them, 
there was no previous copy. 


22:43.645 --> 22:47.982
Think also: If brothers had 
such a hard time getting a Bible, 


22:47.982 --> 22:52.620
how easy would it be 
for a Bible student to get a copy? 


22:52.620 --> 22:56.425
The Rwanda branch 
wrote that 18 Bible students 


22:56.425 --> 22:58.727
there in an isolated group 


22:58.727 --> 23:01.697
hesitated to start preaching 


23:01.697 --> 23:04.565
because no one in their group had a Bible. 


23:04.565 --> 23:08.337
When they received 
the Kinyarwanda Christian Greek Scriptures, 


23:08.337 --> 23:12.000
they felt confident 
to begin their public ministry. 


23:14.242 --> 23:17.245
In other language fields 
where Bibles were scarce, 


23:17.245 --> 23:20.848
they would not sell them 
to Jehovah’s Witnesses 


23:20.848 --> 23:22.883
even if they had the money. 


23:22.883 --> 23:26.988
When Kyrgyz brothers 
tried to buy Bibles at a religious bookstore, 


23:26.988 --> 23:30.658
they would be asked, 
“What is God’s name?” 


23:30.658 --> 23:33.000
If they gave the answer, no Bible. 


23:34.863 --> 23:39.466
Similar situations 
used to exist for Albanian, Isoko, 


23:39.467 --> 23:43.872
Malagasy, Tzotzil, and many other fields. 


23:43.872 --> 23:47.975
Now the tables have turned 
in many of these places. 


23:47.975 --> 23:52.000
The easiest way to get a Bible 
is to go visit a Kingdom Hall. 


23:53.415 --> 23:56.785
An elderly man 
from the mountains of East Timor 


23:56.785 --> 24:00.788
traveled down to the capital 
in search of a Tetun Bible. 


24:00.788 --> 24:02.790
The closest thing he could find 


24:02.790 --> 24:07.795
was an Indonesian Bible 
at the store for 45 U.S. dollars 


24:07.795 --> 24:09.898
—two weeks’ salary for him— 


24:09.898 --> 24:11.966
not even in his language. 


24:11.967 --> 24:16.170
The storekeeper said, 
“You should go and find Jehovah’s Witnesses.” 


24:16.170 --> 24:20.342
Well, after searching all day that day 
and most of the next day, 


24:20.342 --> 24:22.344
he finally found the brothers, 


24:22.343 --> 24:26.113
and he was delighted 
to receive Bibles, Bible literature, 


24:26.113 --> 24:28.450
and also have a discussion with them. 


24:28.450 --> 24:31.052
He said it was the answer to his prayers. 


24:31.052 --> 24:34.622
The brother said he now sends 
text messages from the mountains 


24:34.622 --> 24:38.000
with questions about what he’s reading 
in his Tetun Bible. 


24:39.895 --> 24:43.232
A Hiligaynon-speaking brother 
from the Philippines wrote: 


24:43.232 --> 24:46.602
“People now ask, 
‘What will happen to your organization 


24:46.602 --> 24:49.370
“‘since you 
are freely distributing this Bible?’ 


24:49.370 --> 24:52.540
“They’re worried 
about us running out of money. 


24:52.540 --> 24:54.542
“The usual answer: 


24:54.542 --> 24:58.714
“‘It is Jehovah’s will 
to let all people know his name. 


24:58.713 --> 25:01.616
Do you think he will let the funds run out?’” 


25:01.617 --> 25:06.000
And the brothers always say 
good conversations are generated from that. 


25:07.488 --> 25:10.058
It’s true that the generous contributions 


25:10.058 --> 25:13.761
of Jehovah’s people 
in more prosperous lands make this possible. 


25:13.762 --> 25:17.432
But it also makes us think of Isaiah 55:1, 


25:17.432 --> 25:21.000
and let’s turn there to Isaiah 55:1. 


25:28.710 --> 25:29.945
It says there: 


25:29.945 --> 25:33.815
“Come, all you thirsty ones, 
come to the water! 


25:33.815 --> 25:36.918
“You with no money, 
come, buy and eat! 


25:36.918 --> 25:42.000
Yes, come, buy wine and milk 
without money and without cost.” 


25:43.292 --> 25:45.594
Now, if you read further in this chapter, 


25:45.593 --> 25:48.763
it’s clear that this is a Messianic prophecy. 


25:48.763 --> 25:51.331
And we have no doubt that Jesus Christ 


25:51.332 --> 25:54.002
is the one orchestrating this campaign 


25:54.002 --> 25:59.007
of distribution of millions of Bibles, 
along with Bible literature, 


25:59.007 --> 26:02.877
to the poor and the humble people 
of the earth. 


26:02.877 --> 26:05.580
He won’t allow the power of God’s Word 


26:05.580 --> 26:10.000
to be bound by economic or copyright issues. 


26:12.320 --> 26:15.757
Next, we’re going to discuss 
the role of the New World Translation 


26:15.757 --> 26:19.000
in making the Bible’s message 
clear and alive. 


26:20.428 --> 26:24.731
The existence of thousands 
of languages and their subtle differences 


26:24.732 --> 26:28.504
is a natural obstacle to communication. 


26:28.503 --> 26:33.375
To illustrate, a Brazilian Bethelite 
was asked where a visitor was. 


26:33.375 --> 26:36.945
He responded, “He passed away.” 


26:36.945 --> 26:40.582
When he saw the shocked reaction 
of the brother, he said: 


26:40.582 --> 26:43.250
“No, no, no. He passed out.” 


26:43.250 --> 26:45.253
The other brother was still concerned. 


26:45.253 --> 26:48.000
And he finally pointed, 
and he said, “He went that way.” 


26:49.323 --> 26:54.028
Obviously, this brother struggled 
with the nuances of English. 


26:54.028 --> 26:56.530
Now, think about Bible translation. 


26:56.530 --> 26:59.267
It involves understanding the nuances 


26:59.267 --> 27:02.237
of what was written thousands of years ago 


27:02.237 --> 27:06.340
in ancient Hebrew, in Aramaic, and in Greek 


27:06.340 --> 27:11.045
and translating those thoughts 
into English and hundreds of other languages. 


27:11.045 --> 27:13.882
It is an enormous challenge. 


27:13.882 --> 27:18.252
But remember that many Bibles 
previously used by our brothers 


27:18.252 --> 27:23.190
were translated by individuals 
who knew that God’s name was in the Bible, 


27:23.190 --> 27:25.693
and they refused to put it in the text. 


27:25.693 --> 27:28.930
Now, imagine these same individuals 


27:28.930 --> 27:32.233
who believed that God 
and Jesus are the same person 


27:32.233 --> 27:35.236
or that the dead 
live on in heaven and hell. 


27:35.237 --> 27:37.772
How do you think it affects their translation 
 


27:37.772 --> 27:42.144
of difficult doctrinal passages? 


27:42.143 --> 27:44.145
As an example, 


27:44.145 --> 27:48.450
the traditional Thai Bible 
says at Ecclesiastes 9:10: 


27:48.450 --> 27:52.687
“There is no work 
nor planning nor knowledge 


27:52.687 --> 27:57.000
nor wisdom in ghost city 
where you are going.” 


27:59.627 --> 28:04.499
At Acts 2:27, 
the Chinese Union Version says about Jesus: 


28:04.498 --> 28:08.736
“You will not leave my spirit 
[or it can be understood as “ghost”] 


28:08.737 --> 28:12.240
in the yin world” 
—that is, the netherworld. 


28:12.240 --> 28:14.242
Now, this actually reflects 


28:14.242 --> 28:17.412
what many Chinese people 
think happens to the dead. 


28:17.412 --> 28:19.847
And it’s why they offer food and objects 


28:19.847 --> 28:23.350
that they think people 
will need in “the yin world.” 


28:23.350 --> 28:26.387
But it’s interesting 
that even a word-by-word translation 


28:26.387 --> 28:30.292
of the pre-2013 English New World Translation 


28:30.292 --> 28:32.927
was confusing in Chinese. 


28:32.927 --> 28:37.465
The previous word for “soul” 
sounded like “spirit ghost.” 


28:37.465 --> 28:40.968
And “Hades” 
sounded like a geographical location, 


28:40.968 --> 28:43.738
like “Haiti” might sound to us. 


28:43.738 --> 28:45.740
So saying, ‘You will not leave 


28:45.740 --> 28:50.112
my hún [or soul ghost] in Hades,’ 


28:50.112 --> 28:55.117
sounded like Jesus’ “ghost” 
was stuck in a place called Hades. 


28:55.117 --> 28:59.720
The Chinese translators 
were the first to receive approval to say: 


28:59.720 --> 29:02.823
“You will not leave me in the Grave.” 


29:02.823 --> 29:05.726
Straightforward. 
This set a pattern. 


29:05.727 --> 29:10.299
Almost all languages 
following the Chinese used this solution. 


29:10.298 --> 29:12.300
Then, in 2013, 


29:12.300 --> 29:15.470
the English New World Translation 
did the same. 


29:15.470 --> 29:20.142
But translating such verses 
as ancient Bible writers understood them 


29:20.142 --> 29:24.145
has lifted a huge burden 
from the shoulders of our brothers. 


29:24.145 --> 29:29.017
They used to try 
to explain the correct meaning 


29:29.017 --> 29:32.000
using a Bible 
that distorted the meaning. 


29:33.420 --> 29:37.592
But the need for clarity 
goes beyond doctrinal issues. 


29:37.592 --> 29:43.000
Let’s consider the challenge 
of translating verses like Matthew 5:3. 


29:47.568 --> 29:49.570
It says there: 


29:49.570 --> 29:51.572
“Happy are those conscious 


29:51.572 --> 29:53.307
“of their spiritual need, 


29:53.307 --> 29:55.009
“since the Kingdom of the heavens 


29:55.008 --> 29:57.011
belongs to them.” 


29:57.012 --> 29:59.114
The original Greek literally says: 


29:59.113 --> 30:02.350
“Happy the poor as to the spirit,” 


30:02.350 --> 30:04.385
which makes no sense in English 


30:04.385 --> 30:06.553
or even in modern Greek. 


30:06.553 --> 30:09.090
The English rendering beautifully expresses 


30:09.090 --> 30:10.492
the idea of being aware 


30:10.492 --> 30:12.494
of one’s spiritual poverty. 


30:12.493 --> 30:14.861
But since a word-for-word translation 


30:14.862 --> 30:16.865
of the English or Greek 


30:16.865 --> 30:19.800
is often impossible in other languages, 


30:19.800 --> 30:22.337
Bible translation teams have submitted 


30:22.337 --> 30:26.607
37 questions on this verse alone. 


30:26.607 --> 30:30.612
For example, is “happy” better expressed 


30:30.612 --> 30:35.184
by “elated,” “jubilant,” or “blessed”? 


30:35.183 --> 30:37.351
Can “conscious of” be better expressed 


30:37.352 --> 30:39.687
by “recognize,” “thirst for,” 


30:39.687 --> 30:41.622
or “hunger for”? 


30:41.622 --> 30:43.490
Saying “belongs to them” 


30:43.490 --> 30:45.092
or “the Kingdom belongs to them” 


30:45.092 --> 30:47.062
sounds like they own the Kingdom. 


30:47.062 --> 30:48.964
Is that the idea? 


30:48.963 --> 30:51.866
Or is it better to say “meant for them”? 


30:51.867 --> 30:54.702
Then the expression “spiritual need” 


30:54.702 --> 30:57.000
is a problem in many languages. 


30:58.172 --> 31:00.309
Translated literally, it could sound 


31:00.308 --> 31:04.211
like the philosophical need in some languages 


31:04.212 --> 31:09.217
or in other languages, 
like their need for wicked spirits or ghosts. 


31:09.217 --> 31:12.320
One African trainer observed: 


31:12.320 --> 31:14.322
“In many African languages, 


31:14.322 --> 31:16.824
“there is only one vernacular equivalent 


31:16.823 --> 31:20.461
“for ‘spiritual,’ ‘wind,’ ‘air,’ 


31:20.462 --> 31:24.299
‘oxygen,’ ‘gas,’ and ‘spiritism.’” 


31:24.298 --> 31:26.800
So a literal translation is confusing 


31:26.800 --> 31:30.170
and often gives a completely wrong meaning. 


31:30.170 --> 31:35.510
It could sound like, 
‘Happy are those who know they need oxygen.’ 


31:35.510 --> 31:40.080
So translation teams 
might test out many different variations 


31:40.080 --> 31:43.752
before finalizing such a verse. 


31:43.752 --> 31:45.954
Another example 


31:45.953 --> 31:48.221
is Ecclesiastes 8:9: 


31:48.222 --> 31:50.325
“All of this I have seen, 


31:50.325 --> 31:54.662
“and I applied my heart to every work 
that has been done under the sun, 


31:54.662 --> 31:59.667
during the time that man 
has dominated man to his harm.” 


31:59.667 --> 32:03.672
Now, we often focus 
on the part after the comma. 


32:03.672 --> 32:05.874
But in languages where the heart 


32:05.873 --> 32:09.243
is simply an organ 
of the body that doesn’t think, 


32:09.243 --> 32:13.046
saying “applied my heart” 
makes no sense at all. 


32:13.047 --> 32:15.884
Saying “under the sun” 
gives a strange picture 


32:15.883 --> 32:18.518
of things happening directly below 


32:18.518 --> 32:22.223
where the sun is located at a certain time. 


32:22.223 --> 32:25.058
So before even reaching 
the main point of the verse, 


32:25.058 --> 32:28.061
there are a number 
of linguistic stumbling blocks 


32:28.062 --> 32:30.465
that the translators have to address. 


32:30.465 --> 32:32.667
In some languages, 


32:32.667 --> 32:36.037
like Hindi, 
this verse might read: 


32:36.037 --> 32:39.974
“All of this I have seen, 
and I have paid attention 


32:39.973 --> 32:42.510
“to all the things happening in the world 


32:42.510 --> 32:44.512
“[not under the sun] 


32:44.512 --> 32:46.514
“and seen that during this time 


32:46.513 --> 32:49.350
“man has only brought problems to man 


32:49.350 --> 32:51.952
by ruling over him.” 


32:51.952 --> 32:56.357
Now, you can imagine 
each project involves a lot of research, 


32:56.357 --> 32:59.560
long discussions, and fervent prayer 


32:59.560 --> 33:03.000
to ensure an accurate and clear translation. 


33:04.832 --> 33:09.837
Now, another issue that arises 
has to do with the language registry. 


33:09.837 --> 33:13.174
Some think that Bible language should sound, 


33:13.173 --> 33:17.778
somehow, loftier or holier 
than everyday language. 


33:17.778 --> 33:22.716
For centuries, the Catholic Church 
kept the Bible in the dead Latin language. 


33:22.717 --> 33:27.722
Greek Orthodox clergymen today 
still chant the Bible in ancient Greek 


33:27.722 --> 33:31.559
—a beautiful language 
that hardly anyone understands. 


33:31.558 --> 33:36.463
And many are still enamored 
by the archaic King James Version. 


33:36.463 --> 33:40.635
And this kind of thinking 
has affected Bibles in other languages. 


33:40.635 --> 33:43.070
For example, a lot of the Bibles in India 


33:43.070 --> 33:46.907
use terms that are derived from Sanskrit 


33:46.907 --> 33:49.444
—terms that people hardly know. 


33:49.443 --> 33:52.380
The previous Maltese, Myanmar, 


33:52.380 --> 33:56.817
Twi, and Vietnamese Bibles all use 
—among many others— 


33:56.817 --> 34:00.120
very difficult-to-understand vocabulary. 


34:00.120 --> 34:03.825
So just using simple, everyday language 


34:03.825 --> 34:07.095
greatly enhances Bible reading. 


34:07.095 --> 34:10.097
For example, previous Thai Bibles 


34:10.097 --> 34:13.100
used the literary royal style. 


34:13.100 --> 34:16.537
Now, in Thai, pronouns can take many forms 


34:16.537 --> 34:20.775
depending on who is speaking 
and who is being spoken to.  


34:20.775 --> 34:24.845
For example, kings like David 
would require one pronoun, 


34:24.845 --> 34:28.048
nobles another, 
the common people a different one, 


34:28.048 --> 34:30.050
God a different one. 


34:30.050 --> 34:35.055
There are 17 different ways 
to say “I” in Thai, 


34:35.055 --> 34:37.758
if you could imagine, 
and some of those ways 


34:37.758 --> 34:40.193
are never used in everyday speech. 


34:40.193 --> 34:42.330
And that’s why one sister wrote and said: 


34:42.330 --> 34:45.332
“I like how the Thai New World Translation 


34:45.332 --> 34:49.137
“uses pronouns that we use in daily life. 


34:49.137 --> 34:52.507
“In Psalm 5, when David 
expressed his feelings to Jehovah 


34:52.507 --> 34:55.644
“using the pronoun ‘I’ that we use, 


34:55.643 --> 34:58.745
“I can now see David as a real person 


34:58.745 --> 35:02.817
“and can feel how depressed 
David felt at that time. 


35:02.817 --> 35:05.554
“I read that chapter with a tear in my eye 


35:05.553 --> 35:07.555
“and felt like I was David, 


35:07.555 --> 35:11.558
expressing my feelings 
and problems to Jehovah.” 


35:11.558 --> 35:15.563
All that from using normal pronouns. 


35:15.563 --> 35:17.898
The Armenia branch wrote: 


35:17.898 --> 35:21.335
“Prior to its release, 
readers put lots of effort 


35:21.335 --> 35:23.805
“into understanding what they read 


35:23.805 --> 35:26.840
“from their archaic Armenian Bibles. 


35:26.840 --> 35:30.000
Now they put 
that same effort into studying it.” 


35:31.245 --> 35:35.448
A Turkish brother said 
about the New World Translation in Turkish, 


35:35.448 --> 35:41.000
“The apostle Paul, especially, 
finally speaks understandable Turkish.” 


35:44.725 --> 35:48.930
Now the following video 
is going to show how the ASL Bible 


35:48.930 --> 35:51.565
has enhanced Bible study 


35:51.565 --> 35:55.000
for thousands 
of our deaf brothers and sisters. 


35:59.373 --> 36:01.408
I would always think: 


36:01.408 --> 36:04.945
‘I want to be able to read 
the Bible from start to finish too! 


36:04.945 --> 36:07.315
I should read the Bible every day.’ 


36:07.315 --> 36:10.017
And so I decided to do just that. 


36:10.017 --> 36:12.520
However, whenever I started, 


36:12.520 --> 36:15.322
I would read a bit and eventually stop. 


36:15.322 --> 36:18.525
I would try again only to stop. 


36:18.525 --> 36:20.595
I could never get far. 


36:20.595 --> 36:25.533
It was very difficult to feel moved 
or to see Jehovah as a real person 


36:25.533 --> 36:28.001
when reading the Bible in English. 


36:28.002 --> 36:31.439
Then something very special happened. 


36:31.438 --> 36:34.375
It was at a district convention in 2005. 


36:34.375 --> 36:36.377
I’ll never forget this. 


36:36.377 --> 36:38.745
They announced 
that the Christian Greek Scriptures 


36:38.745 --> 36:42.650
would be translated 
into American Sign Language! 


36:42.650 --> 36:46.420
Everyone, including myself, was thrilled. 


36:46.420 --> 36:48.422
A few months later, 


36:48.422 --> 36:51.292
the Bible book of Matthew 
was released on DVD. 


36:51.292 --> 36:55.362
I remember the first time 
putting the DVD into the player 


36:55.362 --> 36:58.132
and watching the signer on the screen. 


36:58.132 --> 37:00.334
I was astounded. 


37:00.333 --> 37:02.703
I could see the facial expressions, 


37:02.703 --> 37:06.540
the emotions, 
the signs all coming to life 


37:06.540 --> 37:10.110
and helping me to understand 
what was being said in the Bible! 


37:10.110 --> 37:12.413
I watched it all the way through 


37:12.413 --> 37:16.016
again and again and again. 


37:16.017 --> 37:18.419
And I would do this every time 


37:18.418 --> 37:22.121
until another Bible book was released in ASL. 


37:22.122 --> 37:25.325
The Bible presented in my language 


37:25.325 --> 37:27.995
helps me to see Jehovah. 


37:27.995 --> 37:31.098
I can see his love for me. 


37:31.098 --> 37:34.401
I see him counseling me like a father. 


37:34.402 --> 37:37.839
He encourages me and cherishes me. 


37:37.838 --> 37:39.840
I can see all this, 


37:39.840 --> 37:42.310
not when I am reading the Bible in English, 


37:42.310 --> 37:44.312
but in sign language. 


37:44.312 --> 37:48.000
I always thank Jehovah for this gift. 


38:03.463 --> 38:06.066
Her comments help us to see 


38:06.067 --> 38:08.335
how Jehovah is fulfilling his word 


38:08.335 --> 38:14.000
at Deuteronomy 30:13, 14. 


38:19.680 --> 38:23.550
Deuteronomy 30:13, 14: 


38:23.550 --> 38:26.453
“Nor is it on the other side of the sea, 


38:26.453 --> 38:28.488
“so that you have to say, 


38:28.488 --> 38:30.958
“‘Who will cross over 
to the other side of the sea 


38:30.958 --> 38:35.095
“‘and get it for us, 
so that we may hear it and observe it?’ 


38:35.095 --> 38:38.232
“For the word is very near you, 


38:38.232 --> 38:41.469
“in your own mouth 
and in your own heart, 


38:41.468 --> 38:43.803
so that you may do it.” 


38:43.803 --> 38:47.441
Previously, for many brothers 
to understand the Bible, 


38:47.442 --> 38:49.910
it was like crossing the sea. 


38:49.910 --> 38:54.915
It was such an effort in study 
and in understanding what the Bible said. 


38:54.915 --> 38:57.485
But now, with the New World Translation 


38:57.485 --> 38:59.820
in such an understandable style, 


38:59.820 --> 39:02.222
it’s penetrating people’s hearts 


39:02.222 --> 39:06.360
and enhancing the effect 
of God’s Word on their mouth 


39:06.360 --> 39:10.597
by making their preaching 
of the good news more effective. 


39:10.597 --> 39:15.202
Jehovah today is ensuring 
that his inspired message 


39:15.202 --> 39:19.000
is not bound by language differences. 


39:20.742 --> 39:25.312
Now we’re going to briefly consider 
the role of the worldwide Bethel family 


39:25.312 --> 39:30.084
in this effort to produce 
the New World Translation. 


39:30.083 --> 39:33.553
In 1989, 
the Governing Body established 


39:33.553 --> 39:35.555
a world headquarters department 


39:35.555 --> 39:39.860
to support 
the New World Translation development, 


39:39.860 --> 39:43.630
and at that time, 
it was available in 11 languages 


39:43.630 --> 39:45.900
—in whole or in part. 


39:45.900 --> 39:47.100
This chart 


39:47.100 --> 39:49.170
shows that the number of languages 


39:49.170 --> 39:51.438
will reach 148 


39:51.438 --> 39:53.606
by December of this year, 


39:53.607 --> 39:56.644
including 8 sign languages. 


39:56.643 --> 39:59.580
And you see that the increase is dramatic, 


39:59.580 --> 40:02.215
especially since 2005, 


40:02.215 --> 40:03.650
because that was the year 


40:03.650 --> 40:04.818
when the Governing Body 


40:04.818 --> 40:06.353
made Bible translation 


40:06.353 --> 40:09.223
a higher priority. 


40:09.223 --> 40:12.660
Just in 2016, by the end of the year, 


40:12.660 --> 40:16.663
we will have had 21 releases. 


40:16.663 --> 40:19.433
Over 500 Bethelites serve 


40:19.433 --> 40:24.271
on some 100 Bible translation 
or revision teams. 


40:24.272 --> 40:28.209
As we saw, 
translators carefully study each verse 


40:28.208 --> 40:30.376
to make sure that they 
get the right understanding 


40:30.377 --> 40:32.379
and render it correctly. 


40:32.378 --> 40:35.748
And there is 
a full-time staff at headquarters 


40:35.748 --> 40:37.751
to field their questions. 


40:37.752 --> 40:38.952
Over the years, 


40:38.952 --> 40:42.122
more than 100,000 questions 
have been asked. 


40:42.122 --> 40:44.959
In 2015 alone, 


40:44.958 --> 40:49.095
8,500 questions were answered. 


40:49.095 --> 40:51.565
But besides Bible translators, 


40:51.565 --> 40:54.668
outside readers review the text; 


40:54.668 --> 40:59.540
others do proofreading, 
composition, digital publishing. 


40:59.540 --> 41:03.377
The brothers in Thailand 
even created a beautiful new font 


41:03.377 --> 41:08.215
for their Thai New World Translation 
to make it easier to read. 


41:08.215 --> 41:11.052
Over the years, 
MEPS programming has developed 


41:11.052 --> 41:15.722
a specialized computer system 
for Bible translation. 


41:15.722 --> 41:19.827
The U.S. and Japan printeries 
have worked two and three shifts 


41:19.827 --> 41:22.162
to make sure that release dates were met, 


41:22.162 --> 41:24.965
including that of the English revision. 


41:24.965 --> 41:26.967
Bindery workers, for example, 


41:26.967 --> 41:31.539
with this Thai Bible, 
have to hand-feed each copy of the Bible 


41:31.538 --> 41:34.140
because of the extra pages needed 


41:34.140 --> 41:36.643
to make the font big enough to be legible. 


41:36.643 --> 41:40.113
This Bible is over 2,300 pages. 


41:40.113 --> 41:43.716
It’s much bigger 
than our English New World Translation. 


41:43.717 --> 41:47.354
But the brothers in Japan 
willingly and happily do that 


41:47.353 --> 41:49.490
for their Asian brothers. 


41:49.490 --> 41:53.360
Each Bible requires 
the united effort of hundreds. 


41:53.360 --> 41:57.565
Each one has a story 
involving training, long hours, 


41:57.565 --> 42:01.202
problem solving, and great sacrifices. 


42:01.202 --> 42:05.907
For example, 
an experienced translator and father of ten 


42:05.907 --> 42:08.842
was in his 60’s 
when he was asked to work on 


42:08.842 --> 42:11.379
the translation in his language. 


42:11.378 --> 42:14.815
He commuted two hours a day for years 


42:14.815 --> 42:17.083
to work on that project. 


42:17.083 --> 42:19.085
Two elderly couples moved 


42:19.085 --> 42:21.655
from their comfortable homes 
in Central Europe 


42:21.655 --> 42:26.527
to work and live on, 
basically, a construction site 


42:26.527 --> 42:31.532
for years in barracks 
until their project was finished. 


42:31.532 --> 42:34.802
A brother in the final stages 
of Parkinson’s disease 


42:34.802 --> 42:37.672
checked every verse for accuracy. 


42:37.672 --> 42:41.000
These are just a few of the hundreds 
of examples we could mention.


42:43.210 --> 42:46.047
Like the apostle Paul languishing in prison, 


42:46.047 --> 42:49.817
many of us are now limited 
in what we can personally accomplish 


42:49.817 --> 42:51.819
in Jehovah’s service, 


42:51.818 --> 42:55.755
but our worldwide Bethel family 
can feel great satisfaction 


42:55.755 --> 42:59.260
to see God’s Word 
and publications based on it 


42:59.260 --> 43:03.000
being made freely available 
throughout the earth.


43:06.133 --> 43:09.135
Jehovah is the one 
who confused the languages, 


43:09.135 --> 43:14.140
but he foretold that his message 
would not be bound by languages. 


43:14.140 --> 43:17.878
He is causing it 
to penetrate language barriers. 


43:17.878 --> 43:21.481
A Hindi brother 
wrote about the recent release: 


43:21.482 --> 43:24.919
“My wife and I just read 
the book of Proverbs. 


43:24.918 --> 43:28.588
“It is very, very encouraging 
to hear Jehovah’s voice 


43:28.588 --> 43:31.391
“in a tongue that touches our hearts. 


43:31.392 --> 43:36.697
“I previously felt as if the Bible 
was covered over by a net. 


43:36.697 --> 43:41.335
“Though we were able to read it, 
we could not see everything clearly. 


43:41.335 --> 43:46.073
Now I feel as if everything 
is happening right before my eyes.” 


43:46.073 --> 43:48.375
A Tamil reader said, 


43:48.375 --> 43:51.745
“Thank you 
for completely changing our opinion 


43:51.745 --> 43:54.782
“that the Bible 
can never be understood and, 


43:54.782 --> 43:59.420
in fact, for making it 
so easily understandable.” 


43:59.420 --> 44:02.088
A Rwandan Witness said: 


44:02.088 --> 44:05.025
“I now understand the feelings of Jehovah 


44:05.025 --> 44:07.627
“and of persons mentioned in the Bible. 


44:07.627 --> 44:10.730
“Jehovah now speaks Kinyarwanda, 


44:10.730 --> 44:14.000
and it seems 
that the Hebrews were Rwandans.” 


44:16.403 --> 44:21.000
Such comments make all the hard work 
of the translators worthwhile. 


44:22.575 --> 44:27.000
Now let’s read Philippians 2:13. 


44:41.762 --> 44:45.065
Philippians 2:13 says: 


44:45.065 --> 44:50.070
“For God is the one who for the sake 
of his good pleasure energizes you, 


44:50.070 --> 44:55.008
giving you both the desire 
and the power to act.” 


44:55.008 --> 44:58.478
This reminds us of Paul’s words 
in Hebrews 4:12, 


44:58.478 --> 45:03.483
where it said that “the word of God 
is alive and [energetic or] exerts power.” 


45:03.483 --> 45:05.818
But the difference here in Philippians 


45:05.818 --> 45:09.723
is that God himself 
is the subject of the sentence. 


45:09.723 --> 45:12.458
He is the One who exerts power. 


45:12.458 --> 45:14.728
He is the One that provides the energy 


45:14.728 --> 45:17.530
and the motivation to his people. 


45:17.530 --> 45:21.402
And there is no doubt 
that Jehovah is the one who energized 


45:21.402 --> 45:25.905
and moved his anointed servants 
to embark on this campaign 


45:25.905 --> 45:29.375
of Bible translation and distribution. 


45:29.375 --> 45:33.947
He has also energized members 
of the great crowd to support that work. 


45:33.947 --> 45:36.384
And what has been the result? 


45:36.383 --> 45:39.786
First, millions of Jehovah’s people 


45:39.787 --> 45:43.957
daily use a Bible that honors his name. 


45:43.957 --> 45:48.862
Second, God’s people have been given 
the energy and motivation 


45:48.862 --> 45:52.065
to distribute Bibles and Bible literature 


45:52.065 --> 45:56.068
so that even the poor 
are hearing the good news 


45:56.068 --> 45:59.038
in harmony with Matthew 11:5. 


45:59.038 --> 46:03.243
And third, 
Jehovah is breaking the language barrier 


46:03.243 --> 46:07.680
so that his people 
are enjoying unprecedented clarity 


46:07.680 --> 46:09.683
in their Bible study. 


46:09.683 --> 46:13.820
And we’re especially grateful 
to have all the new Bibles and revisions 


46:13.820 --> 46:18.000
based on the simple, clear 2013 revision. 


46:20.693 --> 46:22.996
It is exciting to see how Jehovah 


46:22.997 --> 46:25.699
is already using the New World Translation 


46:25.698 --> 46:29.001
to communicate his will 
to millions of his sheep 


46:29.002 --> 46:31.905
in over 140 languages. 


46:31.905 --> 46:36.277
The result of this great effort 
has been enhanced spirituality, 


46:36.277 --> 46:39.345
unity of thought as an organization, 


46:39.345 --> 46:45.252
and a powerful tool to carry on 
the greatest preaching campaign in history. 


46:45.252 --> 46:50.124
We can’t help but echo 
the words of Psalm 118:23: 


46:50.123 --> 46:55.128
“This has come from Jehovah; 
it is wonderful in our eyes.” 


46:55.128 --> 47:00.066
We now look forward to seeing 
how Jehovah will use this translation 


47:00.067 --> 47:05.072
to sanctify his great name 
before all of earth’s population. 


47:05.072 --> 47:09.510
Yes, we’re grateful to Jehovah 
for the New World Translation 


47:09.510 --> 47:12.512
—a translation 
that strengthens our conviction 


47:12.512 --> 47:28.210
that the power of his Word 
can never be bound.

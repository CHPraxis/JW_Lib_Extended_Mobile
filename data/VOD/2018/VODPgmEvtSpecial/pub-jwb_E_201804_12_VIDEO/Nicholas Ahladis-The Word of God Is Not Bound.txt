00:02 Jesus called the apostle Paul
00:04 “a chosen vessel.”
00:06 He was among the most dynamic ministers
00:08 who ever lived.
00:10 But when he wrote
00:11 his second letter to Timothy,
00:13 he was in prison bonds,
00:15 which severely limited  what he could personally do
00:18 to spread the good news.
00:20 But that situation did not dishearten him.
00:24 His letter refers to what others were doing.
00:27 Luke was there  with him in Rome but still free.
00:32 Aquila and Priscilla  were still working hard in Ephesus.
00:36 He asked for Mark to come  to assist him with the ministry and,
00:40 of course, he gave instructions  to his beloved son Timothy.
00:45 But most important,  notice what he said
00:47 at 2 Timothy 2:8, 9.
01:01 Second Timothy 2:8, 9:
01:07 “Remember that Jesus Christ was raised up
01:10 “from the dead and was David’s offspring,
01:13 “according to the good news I preach,
01:15 “for which I am suffering  and being imprisoned as a criminal.
01:19 Nevertheless, the word of God is not bound.”
01:24 Yes, Paul was in chains,  limiting what he could do,
01:28 but “the word of God”
01:30 —the message that he  and others had been proclaiming—
01:32 was not bound.
01:34 It was alive; it was in the hearts  of thousands of people
01:37 that they had preached to.
01:39 And it was to be recorded
01:41 in countless copies  of the Scriptures in time.
01:44 Once this message was unleashed,
01:47 the power of it could never be bound again.
01:52 I’ll just read Hebrews 4:12, the first part.
01:56 It connects with this scripture.
01:58 It says:
01:59 “For the word of God  is alive and exerts power.”
02:04 Now, on the second expression  “exerts power,”
02:07 the Greek word  according to the Kingdom Interlinear
02:10 says that it is “living” and “energetic.”
02:13 In fact, we derive  the English word “energy” from this word.
02:18 But the context shows,  both in Hebrews and in 2 Timothy,
02:23 that “the word of God” refers to the message
02:25 or expression of God’s purpose.
02:28 And, of course, that message  is closely connected to the Bible today
02:32 because that’s the book  that contains that message for us.
02:37 And through the centuries,
02:39 opponents have tried  to lessen the power, or energy,
02:42 of the Bible in these three ways:
02:46 first, by removing God’s name  from copies of the Bible;
02:52 second, by destroying copies  of the Scriptures in past centuries and,
02:56 more recently, by making it difficult  to obtain in many languages;
03:02 and third,  by means of inaccurate translation
03:07 and dead language.
03:10 These three developments have been  like a short circuit in an electric line.
03:14 The power is hindered  from reaching its destination.
03:20 Jehovah’s organization has moved
03:22 in the opposite direction  on these three fronts.
03:25 And tonight, we’re going to consider  three roles of the New World Translation
03:30 in ensuring that the power  of Jehovah’s Word is not bound:
03:34 first, by making  God’s name known earth wide;
03:38 second, by making  the Scriptures freely available to all;
03:43 and third, by making God’s message
03:47 accurate, clear, and alive.
03:50 And we’re also going to discuss
03:52 the role of the worldwide Bethel family
03:55 in this regard.
03:58 So first, we’re going to consider  the role of the New World Translation
04:01 in making God’s name known earth wide.
04:06 Before Christ’s brothers began work
04:08 on the New World Translation in the 1940’s,
04:11 English Bibles  like American Standard Version, Rotherham,
04:15 and others had already restored  the divine name in the Hebrew Scriptures
04:19 based on the strong manuscript evidence  that they found.
04:24 Translations like The Emphatic Diaglott  even used it in the Greek Scriptures.
04:29 But these translations  were like the proverbial “dead lion”
04:32 of Ecclesiastes 9:4.
04:35 In the 1940’s,  people almost exclusively read
04:38 the archaic King James Version
04:40 with its four occurrences of Jehovah’s name.
04:44 The first real challenge to the dominance  of the King James Version in English
04:49 was the Revised Standard Version,  which was published in 1952.
04:54 But the committee of that version  strongly rejected
04:57 the American Standard Bible policy  of using the divine name,
05:01 and they substituted it everywhere  with “Lord.”
05:05 And today, almost all English Bibles  follow that policy.
05:09 There are a few exceptions,  but this is the mainstream.
05:13 In fact,
05:14 here are the five
05:16 best-selling English Bibles,
05:18 according  to the Christian Booksellers Association.
05:22 The total occurrences of the name Jehovah
05:25 in these five Bibles
05:26 are the four occurrences
05:28 in the King James Version
05:30 plus the seven occurrences of Yahweh
05:32 in The New Living Translation.
05:35 There are no occurrences
05:37 in any of the other three Bibles:
05:39 New International Version,
05:40 New King James Version,
05:42 and English Standard Version.
05:45 That means  that all of these popular Bibles say:
05:48 “I am the Lord, that is my name,”
05:51 or “The name of the Lord  is a strong tower.”
05:57 Consider Exodus 6:3 in the popular,
06:00 actually,  the best-selling New International Version;
06:03 it’s even passed the King James Version:
06:05 “I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac,
06:08 “and to Jacob as God Almighty,
06:10 “but by my name the LORD
06:12 I did not make myself fully known to them.”
06:18 There are four names here in the Hebrew text:
06:21 Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,
06:24 and the Tetragrammaton, Jehovah.
06:27 Now, a primary reason given
06:29 in the Revised Standard Version  and many other Bibles
06:32 for substituting “LORD”
06:34 is because “Jehovah”  is not the original pronunciation
06:38 or that it should be “Yahweh.”
06:41 But the fact is we don’t pronounce  Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
06:45 the same way that the ancient Jews did.
06:48 We probably don’t know  exactly how they pronounced it.
06:51 It may have varied over the centuries.
06:55 But following their reasoning,
06:57 their translation should say:
07:00 ‘I appeared to your forefather,
07:03 ‘and to his son,
07:04 ‘and to his grandson as God Almighty,
07:07 ‘but by my name the LORD
07:09 I did not make myself fully known to them.’
07:13 Now, this is obviously  an unreasonable approach
07:16 to translating the first three names,  don’t you agree?
07:20 But that’s exactly what they did  with the fourth name.
07:23 They said,  ‘We don’t pronounce it the same way,
07:25 so we’re not going to translate it.’
07:28 But taking this even a step further,
07:30 if they were so concerned that “Jehovah”
07:34 is not the exact pronunciation of God’s name,
07:37 what about the name Jesus?
07:40 Acts 4:12 says:
07:42 ‘There is no other name that has been given  by which we must get saved.’
07:46 So is its pronunciation equally important?
07:50 In fact, scholars don’t even agree
07:52 on whether Jesus and his disciples  spoke Hebrew or Aramaic,
07:57 which would affect the pronunciation.
07:59 Hebrew would be something like Ye·shuʹa‛;
08:02 Aramaic, Ye·shuʹ  —something like that.
08:05 But what about  the poor Greek-speaking disciples
08:08 who didn’t have the “s-h” sound?
08:10 They said I·e·sousʹ.
08:13 But that was the form  recorded in the inspired Scriptures.
08:18 The most corrupted pronunciation  is “Jesus” in English.
08:23 It’s nothing like they would have said it  in the first century,
08:27 but that doesn’t prevent  its use some 900 times
08:31 or even more in all of these Bibles.
08:35 So their position on removing God’s name
08:38 on the grounds of pronunciation  is indefensible.
08:41 In legal terms, the Legal Department  would call it a crime of omission.
08:47 But the situation  regarding God’s name is the same
08:51 and even worse in other languages.
08:54 Well, you ask, ‘How could it be worse?’
08:57 When God’s name is substituted  with the name of a local god.
09:01 That was done  with the Chichewa Bible in Malawi.
09:05 This journal,  it’s called The Bible Translator,
09:08 sets policies for translators
09:11 of the United Bible societies worldwide,
09:15 and it explains why Jehovah’s name
09:18 was replaced with the name Chauta.
09:22 Here they give the reason:
09:24 “In this respect the important revelation
09:27 “for Chewa people today
09:29 “is that the foreign deity Yehova
09:32 “is really Chauta,
09:34 “the God they’ve always known
09:36 “and worshipped
09:37 “and the God whom their ancestors
09:39 “also turned to for help
09:41 in the time of trouble!”
09:44 It’s incredible reasoning, isn’t it?
09:46 No wonder our Chichewa brothers  refuse to use this Bible,
09:51 even though it was far easier to understand
09:54 than their previous Bible.
09:56 This is one of the so-called solutions
09:59 found in this special issue
10:01 of The Bible Translator from October 1992
10:05 on the topic translating the names of God.
10:09 And these policies are still current
10:12 among translators today.
10:15 The editor’s opening comments give an idea
10:17 of the direction given.
10:19 “It has become clear in recent years . . .
10:22 “that no one solution to the problems
10:26 “we face in translating the names of God
10:29 will meet all situations.”
10:32 First, their wording gives the impression
10:34 that God has a number of personal names.
10:37 Also, these consultants  frequently call it a “problem”
10:41 because for them it is a genuine problem.
10:44 They know that God’s name
10:46 is the most frequently occurring name  in the whole Bible.
10:49 It occurs thousands of times  in the Hebrew text.
10:52 And they also know  why others include it in the Bible.
10:56 In fact, on page 409
10:59 of this journal,
11:01 there’s a quote from the foreword
11:03 of the American Bible Society,
11:05 of the American Standard Bible Society:
11:08 “This personal name [Jehovah],
11:11 “with its wealth of sacred associations,
11:14 “is now restored to the place
11:17 “in the sacred text to which it has
11:19 an unquestionable claim.”
11:21 And that’s  what the American Standard Bible did,
11:23 and it sounds reasonable.
11:25 But notice the conclusion:
11:27 “It cannot be denied
11:29 “that this [American Standard] view
11:31 “influenced the thinking
11:33 “of scores of evangelical missionaries
11:35 “who were sent out to various places
11:37 “in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. . . .
11:40 “Consequently, the name “Jehovah”
11:43 “was mistakenly introduced
11:45 “as a translation of the name of God,
11:47 “a name which would remain undisputed
11:50 “and be considered unchangeable
11:52 for many years to come.”
11:55 So they viewed “Jehovah” as a mistake.
11:58 They don’t say “Jesus” was a mistake,
12:01 even though, as we saw,  the same pronunciation issues apply.
12:05 But this so-called mistake  led to an interesting situation.
12:10 As they say, scores of Bibles were produced
12:13 by those missionary translators,
12:15 and they used the name thousands of times.
12:18 But many of those missionaries  who translated those Bibles
12:21 were not native speakers,
12:23 so their translations  were often difficult to understand.
12:28 In the latter half of the 20th century,
12:30 translators like Eugene Nida led a movement
12:33 to revise many of those older Bibles
12:36 to make them more understandable.
12:39 But Nida, whom The New York Times
12:41 refers to as “the father  of modern Bible translation,”
12:46 expresses his view  about the divine name in his book
12:50 The Theory and Practice of Translation.
12:54 He says:
12:56 “There is a kind of divine ambiguity
13:00 “in the use of the same term
13:02 to apply both to God and to Jesus Christ.”
13:07 Ambiguity, yes, but not divine.
13:11 Such statements  are repeated in other references
13:14 —for example, by consultants  for the Wycliffe Bible Society.
13:18 And they show the real reason  why so-called Christian translators
13:23 are so ready to omit the name Jehovah:
13:27 because it creates confusion
13:29 between Jehovah and his Son, Jesus Christ.
13:33 Because of these developments,
13:35 brothers in fields  like Chichewa, Hindi, Thai, and others
13:39 were left with a choice:
13:41 either use a hard-to-understand Bible  containing God’s name
13:46 or a readable one that omitted the name.
13:49 What do you think the brothers did?
13:51 In almost every case,  they chose the difficult Bible,
13:56 even if it was harder for them  to read and understand,
13:59 because it had Jehovah’s name in it.
14:02 To understand the frustration,
14:05 imagine this sister in India
14:08 trying to explain  why we are called Jehovah’s Witnesses
14:11 to this householder.
14:13 She could read Isaiah 43:10,
14:15 but if her Bible said,
14:17 “‘You are my witnesses,’ declares the Lord,”
14:20 she might have to explain that in Hebrew
14:23 there are four letters here  that should say “Jehovah.”
14:27 The woman might ask:  ‘What is Hebrew?
14:30 What does Hebrew have to do with this?’
14:33 After explaining, she might ask our sister,
14:36 ‘So do you know Hebrew  so that you can explain this to me?’
14:40 Some brothers have been so frustrated
14:42 that they would read “Jehovah”
14:44 even when their Bibles said “Lord.”
14:47 But when the householder
14:49 would see that they  were reading something different,
14:51 they would become suspicious.
14:54 But it’s interesting  talking about the context of India.
14:59 This Bible Translator has an article  about the reaction in Christendom
15:03 —not among our brothers,  but in Christendom—
15:06 where Jehovah’s name was replaced
15:08 by the word Prabhu or “Lord”  in Hindi and Nepali Bibles.
15:14 The article entitled
15:15 “What Is His Name?
15:17 Translation of Divine Names  in Indian Languages” explains:
15:22 “Not all Christians are happy
15:24 “with this solution however. . . .
15:26 “[He’s talking about Christians  in Christendom.]
15:28 “The first reason is an emotional one:
15:31 “the readers have been so used to reading
15:34 “and hearing the transliteration Jehovah
15:36 “that they have come to attach
15:38 “some kind of sacred significance to it.
15:41 “[Poor people.]
15:43 “They have become
15:44 “so emotionally attached to the name
15:46 “that no amount of argument
15:48 “can make them change their minds.
15:52 “The second reason . . . ,
15:53 “as some Nepali Christians told me,
15:56 “they are often asked by Hindus
15:58 for the name of the Christian God.
16:00 “The Hindus claim that all Hindu gods
16:02 “and goddesses have a personal name
16:04 “such as Ram, Krishna, Brahma, . . .
16:07 “and when they know the names
16:08 “of the gods and goddesses
16:10 they can relate themselves to the deities.”
16:13 Now since Prabhu or “Lord” can be used
16:16 for “husband,” “master,” and “god,”
16:19 Hindus will not accept it  as being God’s name.
16:23 So he continues in his article:
16:27 “Hindus are not interested
16:29 “in the title of God;
16:31 “they want to know
16:32 “the personal name of God,
16:34 “and unless they know the name,
16:36 “they cannot relate themselves
16:38 to the one who bears it.”
16:40 Now notice his conclusion:
16:44 “Having said all that, however,
16:46 “and having argued in favour of translating
16:49 “the name YHWH by [LORD], . . .
16:52 “I must concede
16:53 “that in the light of recent studies . . .
16:56 “a new approach may become necessary.
16:59 “That means that the last word
17:01 “has not been said
17:02 “on the question of rendering
17:04 “the ‘Tetragrammaton’ YHWH in North Indian
17:06 (and other) languages.”
17:09 Well happily,  this is the last statement
17:11 we’re going to read  from The Bible Translator,
17:13 and it’s the only one we agree with.
17:16 In fact, the last word  for some languages of India
17:20 was spoken one month ago.
17:23 On September 4, 2016,  a video of Brother Herd was broadcast
17:28 throughout India, in Sri Lanka
17:31 and to brothers in other locations,
17:34 as he announced the release
17:36 of the complete  New World Translation in Hindi,
17:38 Malayalam, and Tamil
17:42 and the Christian Greek Scriptures  in Marathi and Telugu.
17:47 The whole New World Bible
17:48 was already available in Sinhala;
17:50 in the Greek Scriptures,
17:52 in Kannada, Gujarati,
17:53 Nepali, and Punjabi.
17:55 So our brothers in India,
17:57 Nepal, and Sri Lanka
17:59 have all these Bibles available
18:02 to make Jehovah’s name known
18:04 in that vast field of 1.3 billion people.
18:10 Jehovah says at Ezekiel 38:23:
18:14 “I will certainly magnify myself  and sanctify myself
18:18 “and make myself known  before the eyes of many nations;
18:22 and they will have to know  that I am Jehovah,”
18:27 —not ‘that I am the Lord,’
18:30 not ‘that I am Prabhu,  or Señor, or Chauta,’
18:35 but Jehovah.
18:38 The undeniable trend  in Bible translation worldwide
18:42 is to omit God’s name.
18:44 And Jehovah is countering that  by using the New World Translation
18:48 to figuratively unchain his people
18:51 from Bibles that fail  to honor and sanctify his name.
18:55 And we’re happy  that 95 percent of our brothers in India
18:59 and over 90 percent worldwide
19:02 have a modern translation  of at least the Christian Greek Scriptures
19:06 that uses the name Jehovah.
19:11 Second, we’re going to discuss  the role of the New World Translation
19:14 in making the Scriptures freely available.
19:19 In the past,  opponents like Roman Emperor Diocletian
19:23 and the clergy of the Middle Ages
19:25 gathered and burned copies of the Scriptures.
19:29 The Bible survived,  and copies are freely available
19:32 in languages like English,  French, Spanish, and others.
19:37 But today, economic and copyright issues
19:40 have made the Bible  difficult to obtain in many languages.
19:44 A South American missionary wrote:
19:46 “The Bible societies translate  into many Amerindian languages,
19:51 “but it seems like every new translation is just a trophy.
19:55 “It is translated, printed in a few copies,  and then forgotten.
20:00 “Usually these translations  are expensive, complicated,
20:04 and simply not available  to the people who need them.”
20:08 A request was made  to translate the New World Translation
20:11 into a language of the Pacific
20:13 because the only Bible  had removed the divine name completely,
20:18 and it is not readily available,
20:21 since only small quantities  of this Bible were originally printed,
20:25 and it is not currently being reprinted.
20:29 Yes, it’s true  that the Bible has been translated
20:31 whole or in part  into 2,800 or more languages,
20:36 but it is readily available  in just a fraction of those languages.
20:40 And Bibles are especially poor in areas
20:45 where the population  doesn’t have money to spend on Bibles,
20:49 printing is unprofitable,
20:51 and it’s often in areas  where we have great increases.
20:55 In some languages,
20:57 a Bible may cost up to a monthly salary.
21:01 And the copies that brothers get  for their monthly salary
21:05 are often missing pages  —sometimes whole Bible books—
21:08 and sometimes they are  just roughly-bound photo copies.
21:14 When a branch office  tries to obtain Bibles at reduced cost
21:18 or even offers to reprint  the Bible in such languages,
21:23 they’re often rebuffed  by the copyright holders.
21:26 In Malawi, for example,  our brothers were told
21:29 not even to quote  the Bible in our publications
21:32 so that the sales of their Bible  would not be threatened.
21:37 Visitors to some African lands
21:39 have been shocked  to see over a hundred brothers
21:42 sharing two or three Bibles  in the congregation.
21:46 A brother wrote:
21:48 “Most Tshiluba-speaking brothers in Congo did not own a Bible.
21:52 “Each copy was passed around  like a microphone
21:55 when a ‘read’ scripture was called.”
21:58 Otetela congregations in Congo  often just had one or two copies.
22:03 Brothers used to go to the Kingdom Hall  to practice their talks with the Bible.
22:10 Well, this makes these images  of Brother Lösch in Congo
22:13 releasing the Christian Greek Scriptures
22:15 in Tshiluba, Kongo,  and Otetela even more meaningful.
22:21 This brother’s reaction  may seem dramatic to us,
22:24 but it may have been  his first personal copy of the Bible.
22:29 And you see this crowd  carefully studying their new Bibles.
22:34 I notice they’re not comparing it  with their previous copy,
22:38 likely because for many of them,  there was no previous copy.
22:43 Think also: If brothers had  such a hard time getting a Bible,
22:47 how easy would it be  for a Bible student to get a copy?
22:52 The Rwanda branch  wrote that 18 Bible students
22:56 there in an isolated group
22:58 hesitated to start preaching
23:01 because no one in their group had a Bible.
23:04 When they received  the Kinyarwanda Christian Greek Scriptures,
23:08 they felt confident  to begin their public ministry.
23:14 In other language fields  where Bibles were scarce,
23:17 they would not sell them  to Jehovah’s Witnesses
23:20 even if they had the money.
23:22 When Kyrgyz brothers  tried to buy Bibles at a religious bookstore,
23:26 they would be asked,  “What is God’s name?”
23:30 If they gave the answer, no Bible.
23:34 Similar situations  used to exist for Albanian, Isoko,
23:39 Malagasy, Tzotzil, and many other fields.
23:43 Now the tables have turned  in many of these places.
23:47 The easiest way to get a Bible  is to go visit a Kingdom Hall.
23:53 An elderly man  from the mountains of East Timor
23:56 traveled down to the capital  in search of a Tetun Bible.
24:00 The closest thing he could find
24:02 was an Indonesian Bible  at the store for 45 U.S. dollars
24:07 —two weeks’ salary for him—
24:09 not even in his language.
24:11 The storekeeper said,  “You should go and find Jehovah’s Witnesses.”
24:16 Well, after searching all day that day  and most of the next day,
24:20 he finally found the brothers,
24:22 and he was delighted  to receive Bibles, Bible literature,
24:26 and also have a discussion with them.
24:28 He said it was the answer to his prayers.
24:31 The brother said he now sends  text messages from the mountains
24:34 with questions about what he’s reading  in his Tetun Bible.
24:39 A Hiligaynon-speaking brother  from the Philippines wrote:
24:43 “People now ask,  ‘What will happen to your organization
24:46 “‘since you  are freely distributing this Bible?’
24:49 “They’re worried  about us running out of money.
24:52 “The usual answer:
24:54 “‘It is Jehovah’s will  to let all people know his name.
24:58 Do you think he will let the funds run out?’”
25:01 And the brothers always say  good conversations are generated from that.
25:07 It’s true that the generous contributions
25:10 of Jehovah’s people  in more prosperous lands make this possible.
25:13 But it also makes us think of Isaiah 55:1,
25:17 and let’s turn there to Isaiah 55:1.
25:28 It says there:
25:29 “Come, all you thirsty ones,  come to the water!
25:33 “You with no money,  come, buy and eat!
25:36 Yes, come, buy wine and milk  without money and without cost.”
25:43 Now, if you read further in this chapter,
25:45 it’s clear that this is a Messianic prophecy.
25:48 And we have no doubt that Jesus Christ
25:51 is the one orchestrating this campaign
25:54 of distribution of millions of Bibles,  along with Bible literature,
25:59 to the poor and the humble people  of the earth.
26:02 He won’t allow the power of God’s Word
26:05 to be bound by economic or copyright issues.
26:12 Next, we’re going to discuss  the role of the New World Translation
26:15 in making the Bible’s message  clear and alive.
26:20 The existence of thousands  of languages and their subtle differences
26:24 is a natural obstacle to communication.
26:28 To illustrate, a Brazilian Bethelite  was asked where a visitor was.
26:33 He responded, “He passed away.”
26:36 When he saw the shocked reaction  of the brother, he said:
26:40 “No, no, no. He passed out.”
26:43 The other brother was still concerned.
26:45 And he finally pointed,  and he said, “He went that way.”
26:49 Obviously, this brother struggled  with the nuances of English.
26:54 Now, think about Bible translation.
26:56 It involves understanding the nuances
26:59 of what was written thousands of years ago
27:02 in ancient Hebrew, in Aramaic, and in Greek
27:06 and translating those thoughts  into English and hundreds of other languages.
27:11 It is an enormous challenge.
27:13 But remember that many Bibles  previously used by our brothers
27:18 were translated by individuals  who knew that God’s name was in the Bible,
27:23 and they refused to put it in the text.
27:25 Now, imagine these same individuals
27:28 who believed that God  and Jesus are the same person
27:32 or that the dead  live on in heaven and hell.
27:35 How do you think it affects their translation
27:37 of difficult doctrinal passages?
27:42 As an example,
27:44 the traditional Thai Bible  says at Ecclesiastes 9:10:
27:48 “There is no work  nor planning nor knowledge
27:52 nor wisdom in ghost city  where you are going.”
27:59 At Acts 2:27,  the Chinese Union Version says about Jesus:
28:04 “You will not leave my spirit  [or it can be understood as “ghost”]
28:08 in the yin world”  —that is, the netherworld.
28:12 Now, this actually reflects
28:14 what many Chinese people  think happens to the dead.
28:17 And it’s why they offer food and objects
28:19 that they think people  will need in “the yin world.”
28:23 But it’s interesting  that even a word-by-word translation
28:26 of the pre-2013 English New World Translation
28:30 was confusing in Chinese.
28:32 The previous word for “soul”  sounded like “spirit ghost.”
28:37 And “Hades”  sounded like a geographical location,
28:40 like “Haiti” might sound to us.
28:43 So saying, ‘You will not leave
28:45 my hún [or soul ghost] in Hades,’
28:50 sounded like Jesus’ “ghost”  was stuck in a place called Hades.
28:55 The Chinese translators  were the first to receive approval to say:
28:59 “You will not leave me in the Grave.”
29:02 Straightforward.  This set a pattern.
29:05 Almost all languages  following the Chinese used this solution.
29:10 Then, in 2013,
29:12 the English New World Translation  did the same.
29:15 But translating such verses  as ancient Bible writers understood them
29:20 has lifted a huge burden  from the shoulders of our brothers.
29:24 They used to try  to explain the correct meaning
29:29 using a Bible  that distorted the meaning.
29:33 But the need for clarity  goes beyond doctrinal issues.
29:37 Let’s consider the challenge  of translating verses like Matthew 5:3.
29:47 It says there:
29:49 “Happy are those conscious
29:51 “of their spiritual need,
29:53 “since the Kingdom of the heavens
29:55 belongs to them.”
29:57 The original Greek literally says:
29:59 “Happy the poor as to the spirit,”
30:02 which makes no sense in English
30:04 or even in modern Greek.
30:06 The English rendering beautifully expresses
30:09 the idea of being aware
30:10 of one’s spiritual poverty.
30:12 But since a word-for-word translation
30:14 of the English or Greek
30:16 is often impossible in other languages,
30:19 Bible translation teams have submitted
30:22 37 questions on this verse alone.
30:26 For example, is “happy” better expressed
30:30 by “elated,” “jubilant,” or “blessed”?
30:35 Can “conscious of” be better expressed
30:37 by “recognize,” “thirst for,”
30:39 or “hunger for”?
30:41 Saying “belongs to them”
30:43 or “the Kingdom belongs to them”
30:45 sounds like they own the Kingdom.
30:47 Is that the idea?
30:48 Or is it better to say “meant for them”?
30:51 Then the expression “spiritual need”
30:54 is a problem in many languages.
30:58 Translated literally, it could sound
31:00 like the philosophical need in some languages
31:04 or in other languages,  like their need for wicked spirits or ghosts.
31:09 One African trainer observed:
31:12 “In many African languages,
31:14 “there is only one vernacular equivalent
31:16 “for ‘spiritual,’ ‘wind,’ ‘air,’
31:20 ‘oxygen,’ ‘gas,’ and ‘spiritism.’”
31:24 So a literal translation is confusing
31:26 and often gives a completely wrong meaning.
31:30 It could sound like,  ‘Happy are those who know they need oxygen.’
31:35 So translation teams  might test out many different variations
31:40 before finalizing such a verse.
31:43 Another example
31:45 is Ecclesiastes 8:9:
31:48 “All of this I have seen,
31:50 “and I applied my heart to every work  that has been done under the sun,
31:54 during the time that man  has dominated man to his harm.”
31:59 Now, we often focus  on the part after the comma.
32:03 But in languages where the heart
32:05 is simply an organ  of the body that doesn’t think,
32:09 saying “applied my heart”  makes no sense at all.
32:13 Saying “under the sun”  gives a strange picture
32:15 of things happening directly below
32:18 where the sun is located at a certain time.
32:22 So before even reaching  the main point of the verse,
32:25 there are a number  of linguistic stumbling blocks
32:28 that the translators have to address.
32:30 In some languages,
32:32 like Hindi,  this verse might read:
32:36 “All of this I have seen,  and I have paid attention
32:39 “to all the things happening in the world
32:42 “[not under the sun]
32:44 “and seen that during this time
32:46 “man has only brought problems to man
32:49 by ruling over him.”
32:51 Now, you can imagine  each project involves a lot of research,
32:56 long discussions, and fervent prayer
32:59 to ensure an accurate and clear translation.
33:04 Now, another issue that arises  has to do with the language registry.
33:09 Some think that Bible language should sound,
33:13 somehow, loftier or holier  than everyday language.
33:17 For centuries, the Catholic Church  kept the Bible in the dead Latin language.
33:22 Greek Orthodox clergymen today  still chant the Bible in ancient Greek
33:27 —a beautiful language  that hardly anyone understands.
33:31 And many are still enamored  by the archaic King James Version.
33:36 And this kind of thinking  has affected Bibles in other languages.
33:40 For example, a lot of the Bibles in India
33:43 use terms that are derived from Sanskrit
33:46 —terms that people hardly know.
33:49 The previous Maltese, Myanmar,
33:52 Twi, and Vietnamese Bibles all use  —among many others—
33:56 very difficult-to-understand vocabulary.
34:00 So just using simple, everyday language
34:03 greatly enhances Bible reading.
34:07 For example, previous Thai Bibles
34:10 used the literary royal style.
34:13 Now, in Thai, pronouns can take many forms
34:16 depending on who is speaking  and who is being spoken to.
34:20 For example, kings like David  would require one pronoun,
34:24 nobles another,  the common people a different one,
34:28 God a different one.
34:30 There are 17 different ways  to say “I” in Thai,
34:35 if you could imagine,  and some of those ways
34:37 are never used in everyday speech.
34:40 And that’s why one sister wrote and said:
34:42 “I like how the Thai New World Translation
34:45 “uses pronouns that we use in daily life.
34:49 “In Psalm 5, when David  expressed his feelings to Jehovah
34:52 “using the pronoun ‘I’ that we use,
34:55 “I can now see David as a real person
34:58 “and can feel how depressed  David felt at that time.
35:02 “I read that chapter with a tear in my eye
35:05 “and felt like I was David,
35:07 expressing my feelings  and problems to Jehovah.”
35:11 All that from using normal pronouns.
35:15 The Armenia branch wrote:
35:17 “Prior to its release,  readers put lots of effort
35:21 “into understanding what they read
35:23 “from their archaic Armenian Bibles.
35:26 Now they put  that same effort into studying it.”
35:31 A Turkish brother said  about the New World Translation in Turkish,
35:35 “The apostle Paul, especially,  finally speaks understandable Turkish.”
35:44 Now the following video  is going to show how the ASL Bible
35:48 has enhanced Bible study
35:51 for thousands  of our deaf brothers and sisters.
35:59 I would always think:
36:01 ‘I want to be able to read  the Bible from start to finish too!
36:04 I should read the Bible every day.’
36:07 And so I decided to do just that.
36:10 However, whenever I started,
36:12 I would read a bit and eventually stop.
36:15 I would try again only to stop.
36:18 I could never get far.
36:20 It was very difficult to feel moved  or to see Jehovah as a real person
36:25 when reading the Bible in English.
36:28 Then something very special happened.
36:31 It was at a district convention in 2005.
36:34 I’ll never forget this.
36:36 They announced  that the Christian Greek Scriptures
36:38 would be translated  into American Sign Language!
36:42 Everyone, including myself, was thrilled.
36:46 A few months later,
36:48 the Bible book of Matthew  was released on DVD.
36:51 I remember the first time  putting the DVD into the player
36:55 and watching the signer on the screen.
36:58 I was astounded.
37:00 I could see the facial expressions,
37:02 the emotions,  the signs all coming to life
37:06 and helping me to understand  what was being said in the Bible!
37:10 I watched it all the way through
37:12 again and again and again.
37:16 And I would do this every time
37:18 until another Bible book was released in ASL.
37:22 The Bible presented in my language
37:25 helps me to see Jehovah.
37:27 I can see his love for me.
37:31 I see him counseling me like a father.
37:34 He encourages me and cherishes me.
37:37 I can see all this,
37:39 not when I am reading the Bible in English,
37:42 but in sign language.
37:44 I always thank Jehovah for this gift.
38:03 Her comments help us to see
38:06 how Jehovah is fulfilling his word
38:08 at Deuteronomy 30:13, 14.
38:19 Deuteronomy 30:13, 14:
38:23 “Nor is it on the other side of the sea,
38:26 “so that you have to say,
38:28 “‘Who will cross over  to the other side of the sea
38:30 “‘and get it for us,  so that we may hear it and observe it?’
38:35 “For the word is very near you,
38:38 “in your own mouth  and in your own heart,
38:41 so that you may do it.”
38:43 Previously, for many brothers  to understand the Bible,
38:47 it was like crossing the sea.
38:49 It was such an effort in study  and in understanding what the Bible said.
38:54 But now, with the New World Translation
38:57 in such an understandable style,
38:59 it’s penetrating people’s hearts
39:02 and enhancing the effect  of God’s Word on their mouth
39:06 by making their preaching  of the good news more effective.
39:10 Jehovah today is ensuring  that his inspired message
39:15 is not bound by language differences.
39:20 Now we’re going to briefly consider  the role of the worldwide Bethel family
39:25 in this effort to produce  the New World Translation.
39:30 In 1989,  the Governing Body established
39:33 a world headquarters department
39:35 to support  the New World Translation development,
39:39 and at that time,  it was available in 11 languages
39:43 —in whole or in part.
39:45 This chart
39:47 shows that the number of languages
39:49 will reach 148
39:51 by December of this year,
39:53 including 8 sign languages.
39:56 And you see that the increase is dramatic,
39:59 especially since 2005,
40:02 because that was the year
40:03 when the Governing Body
40:04 made Bible translation
40:06 a higher priority.
40:09 Just in 2016, by the end of the year,
40:12 we will have had 21 releases.
40:16 Over 500 Bethelites serve
40:19 on some 100 Bible translation  or revision teams.
40:24 As we saw,  translators carefully study each verse
40:28 to make sure that they  get the right understanding
40:30 and render it correctly.
40:32 And there is  a full-time staff at headquarters
40:35 to field their questions.
40:37 Over the years,
40:38 more than 100,000 questions  have been asked.
40:42 In 2015 alone,
40:44 8,500 questions were answered.
40:49 But besides Bible translators,
40:51 outside readers review the text;
40:54 others do proofreading,  composition, digital publishing.
40:59 The brothers in Thailand  even created a beautiful new font
41:03 for their Thai New World Translation  to make it easier to read.
41:08 Over the years,  MEPS programming has developed
41:11 a specialized computer system  for Bible translation.
41:15 The U.S. and Japan printeries  have worked two and three shifts
41:19 to make sure that release dates were met,
41:22 including that of the English revision.
41:24 Bindery workers, for example,
41:26 with this Thai Bible,  have to hand-feed each copy of the Bible
41:31 because of the extra pages needed
41:34 to make the font big enough to be legible.
41:36 This Bible is over 2,300 pages.
41:40 It’s much bigger  than our English New World Translation.
41:43 But the brothers in Japan  willingly and happily do that
41:47 for their Asian brothers.
41:49 Each Bible requires  the united effort of hundreds.
41:53 Each one has a story  involving training, long hours,
41:57 problem solving, and great sacrifices.
42:01 For example,  an experienced translator and father of ten
42:05 was in his 60’s  when he was asked to work on
42:08 the translation in his language.
42:11 He commuted two hours a day for years
42:14 to work on that project.
42:17 Two elderly couples moved
42:19 from their comfortable homes  in Central Europe
42:21 to work and live on,  basically, a construction site
42:26 for years in barracks  until their project was finished.
42:31 A brother in the final stages  of Parkinson’s disease
42:34 checked every verse for accuracy.
42:37 These are just a few of the hundreds  of examples we could mention.
42:43 Like the apostle Paul languishing in prison,
42:46 many of us are now limited  in what we can personally accomplish
42:49 in Jehovah’s service,
42:51 but our worldwide Bethel family  can feel great satisfaction
42:55 to see God’s Word  and publications based on it
42:59 being made freely available  throughout the earth.
43:06 Jehovah is the one  who confused the languages,
43:09 but he foretold that his message  would not be bound by languages.
43:14 He is causing it  to penetrate language barriers.
43:17 A Hindi brother  wrote about the recent release:
43:21 “My wife and I just read  the book of Proverbs.
43:24 “It is very, very encouraging  to hear Jehovah’s voice
43:28 “in a tongue that touches our hearts.
43:31 “I previously felt as if the Bible  was covered over by a net.
43:36 “Though we were able to read it,  we could not see everything clearly.
43:41 Now I feel as if everything  is happening right before my eyes.”
43:46 A Tamil reader said,
43:48 “Thank you  for completely changing our opinion
43:51 “that the Bible  can never be understood and,
43:54 in fact, for making it  so easily understandable.”
43:59 A Rwandan Witness said:
44:02 “I now understand the feelings of Jehovah
44:05 “and of persons mentioned in the Bible.
44:07 “Jehovah now speaks Kinyarwanda,
44:10 and it seems  that the Hebrews were Rwandans.”
44:16 Such comments make all the hard work  of the translators worthwhile.
44:22 Now let’s read Philippians 2:13.
44:41 Philippians 2:13 says:
44:45 “For God is the one who for the sake  of his good pleasure energizes you,
44:50 giving you both the desire  and the power to act.”
44:55 This reminds us of Paul’s words  in Hebrews 4:12,
44:58 where it said that “the word of God  is alive and [energetic or] exerts power.”
45:03 But the difference here in Philippians
45:05 is that God himself  is the subject of the sentence.
45:09 He is the One who exerts power.
45:12 He is the One that provides the energy
45:14 and the motivation to his people.
45:17 And there is no doubt  that Jehovah is the one who energized
45:21 and moved his anointed servants  to embark on this campaign
45:25 of Bible translation and distribution.
45:29 He has also energized members  of the great crowd to support that work.
45:33 And what has been the result?
45:36 First, millions of Jehovah’s people
45:39 daily use a Bible that honors his name.
45:43 Second, God’s people have been given  the energy and motivation
45:48 to distribute Bibles and Bible literature
45:52 so that even the poor  are hearing the good news
45:56 in harmony with Matthew 11:5.
45:59 And third,  Jehovah is breaking the language barrier
46:03 so that his people  are enjoying unprecedented clarity
46:07 in their Bible study.
46:09 And we’re especially grateful  to have all the new Bibles and revisions
46:13 based on the simple, clear 2013 revision.
46:20 It is exciting to see how Jehovah
46:22 is already using the New World Translation
46:25 to communicate his will  to millions of his sheep
46:29 in over 140 languages.
46:31 The result of this great effort  has been enhanced spirituality,
46:36 unity of thought as an organization,
46:39 and a powerful tool to carry on  the greatest preaching campaign in history.
46:45 We can’t help but echo  the words of Psalm 118:23:
46:50 “This has come from Jehovah;  it is wonderful in our eyes.”
46:55 We now look forward to seeing  how Jehovah will use this translation
47:00 to sanctify his great name  before all of earth’s population.
47:05 Yes, we’re grateful to Jehovah  for the New World Translation
47:09 —a translation  that strengthens our conviction
47:12 that the power of his Word  can never be bound.

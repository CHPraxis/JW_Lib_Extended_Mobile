00:01 Imagine for a moment
00:02 that you’re going on a trip.
00:05 The tickets are a gift;
00:07 a friend has paid the price.
00:09 All you have to do is pack your bags
00:12 and get to the airport.
00:14 Now as you know, packing isn’t easy,
00:17 and dragging heavy bags  around the airport is exhausting.
00:22 Remember the days  before luggage had wheels?
00:24 How did we do that?
00:26 Heavy baggage can make even a vacation  seem like a burden.
00:32 Well, the point is this:
00:34 You and I have set out on an exciting journey
00:37 —a journey to God’s new world.
00:40 The trip is free; the ransom paid the price.
00:44 All we have to do is get there.
00:47 And that’s the hard part, right?
00:50 And why?
00:52 Because each one of us is carrying
00:54 some type of heavy baggage on this journey.
00:58 Now, it’s true our life is blessed.
01:01 As Isaiah 65:13 says, figuratively,  we’re eating and drinking
01:05 while the world goes hungry and thirsty.
01:08 Still, Acts 14:22 says:
01:12 “We must enter into the Kingdom of God
01:14 through many tribulations.”
01:16 We have anxieties.
01:19 And Proverbs 12:25 says:
01:21 ‘Anxiety in the heart can weigh it down.’
01:25 The heavy baggage we carry
01:27 can make even the journey to God’s new world
01:31 seem like a burden.
01:33 Well, the good news is that we have help.
01:36 Open your Bible to 1 Kings 8:38, 39.
01:42 Here Solomon prayed  on behalf of Jehovah’s people
01:45 at the inauguration of the temple.
01:48 And what he said in that prayer
01:50 can help us put wheels on our baggage
01:52 so it’s easier for us to carry.
01:54 At 1 Kings 8, beginning with verse 38,
01:58 Solomon says to Jehovah:
02:00 “Whatever prayer, whatever request for favor
02:04 “may be made by any man  or by all your people Israel
02:08 “(for each one knows the plague  of his own heart)
02:13 “when they spread out their hands  toward this house,
02:15 “then may you hear from the heavens,  your dwelling place,
02:19 and may you forgive and take action.”
02:22 Now let’s stop there.
02:24 Notice that phrase  “each one knows the plague of his own heart.”
02:29 In stating that, Solomon wasn’t referring  to the nation as a whole.
02:34 He was referring to private suffering
02:37 —the baggage each person had to carry,
02:41 the problems no one else might know about.
02:44 And although Solomon evidently had  a specific type of plague in mind
02:49 —one that required forgiveness—
02:51 by extension his words can apply  to any anxiety that weighs us down.
02:56 For example,  chapter 2 of the “God’s Love” book
03:00 applies Solomon’s words  to a personal weakness
03:03 we might struggle with.
03:05 The May 1, 2010, Watchtower applies it
03:09 to the grief a person feels  after losing a mate.
03:12 The point is:
03:15 Any anxiety that weighs us down
03:18 can be considered a plague of the heart.
03:23 What is the plague of your heart?
03:27 What anxiety weighs you down  on your journey to God’s new world?
03:33 Whatever baggage we carry,
03:36 the scripture we just read  confirms that we have help.
03:39 Notice, Solomon prayed that Jehovah
03:41 would not only “hear from the heavens”
03:44 but also “take action”
03:46 —if not to eliminate our load  then at least to help us carry it.
03:52 For the rest of this discussion,  we’ll see how Jehovah can do that
03:55 in three situations:
03:57 (1) when circumstances discourage us,
04:01 (2) when people upset us,
04:05 and (3) when negative emotions  overwhelm us.
04:09 In all situations,
04:11 Jehovah can help us cope  with the plague of our heart.
04:15 Let’s see how.
04:17 First, when circumstances discourage us.
04:22 Now, when it comes to circumstances,
04:24 life is unpredictable.
04:26 In this system,  things can change just like that
04:29 with one phone call,
04:32 one accident,
04:34 one diagnosis.
04:36 Let me tell you about Anny,
04:38 who was diagnosed at age 19  with pulmonary fibrosis,
04:42 and at first she felt  this was completely unfair.
04:46 Anny says: “Pulmonary fibrosis  affects heavy smokers,
04:50 “and I had never had a cigarette in my life!
04:54 “I was depressed, I wouldn’t eat,
04:57 “and I wouldn’t talk to people.
04:59 “I would just lie in bed
05:01 and think about how miserable my life was.”
05:04 Now, Anny is one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
05:08 and she was one when she got sick.
05:10 She understood the real cause of her illness,
05:15 and she knew about the new world.
05:18 Still, this discouraging circumstance  threw Anny off course.
05:22 She says, “I prayed and prayed  and prayed about it,
05:25 but it felt like I was just talking  to the wall.”
05:30 Now, regardless of our age,
05:32 we may relate to Anny’s comment.
05:35 When any of us face  a discouraging circumstance,
05:39 we pray about it repeatedly.
05:41 And if nothing changes,
05:43 we may wonder whether Jehovah cares about
05:47 or even sees what we’re going through.
05:49 A discouraging circumstance  can become a plague of our heart.
05:54 How can we cope with it?
05:56 Well, let’s look at 2 Corinthians 12:7-9.
06:01 Here the apostle Paul  faced a discouraging circumstance
06:06 —one that he calls “a thorn in the flesh.”
06:08 Now, as you realize,  we don’t know what that thorn was.
06:11 It might have been a physical affliction.
06:13 Whatever it was, as we read these verses,
06:16 try to detect two things:
06:18 (1) what Paul could not control
06:21 and (2) what he could control.
06:23 Second Corinthians 12,  beginning with verse 7:
06:27 “To keep me from becoming overly exalted,
06:31 “I was given a thorn in the flesh,  an angel of Satan,
06:35 “to keep slapping me,  so that I might not be overly exalted.
06:40 “Three times I begged the Lord about this,  that it would depart from me.
06:44 “But he said to me:
06:46 “‘My undeserved kindness  is sufficient for you,
06:49 for my power is being  made perfect in weakness.’”
06:53 Now let’s stop there  and look at our two components.
06:57 First, what couldn’t Paul control?
07:00 The answer is obvious
07:02 —the circumstance itself— his “thorn in the flesh.”
07:05 Paul even prayed about it three times,
07:08 but nothing changed.
07:10 The circumstance was beyond his control.
07:15 What could Paul control?
07:17 His response.
07:19 And part of that response  was to accept the reality
07:23 of his situation  to the point that he says in verse 9:
07:26 “Most gladly, . . .  I will boast about my weaknesses.”
07:30 Once Paul realized  that his thorn would not be removed,
07:35 he didn’t waste time doubting God’s love
07:38 or asking ‘Why me?’  or comparing himself to others
07:42 who seemed to have an easier life.
07:44 No, Paul accepted reality.
07:47 He viewed his thorn as “an angel of Satan,”
07:50 and he got about the business of endurance.
07:54 Now, Paul’s experience gives us a key
07:56 to coping with any discouraging circumstance.
07:59 First, break it down into two components:
08:02 (1) what we can’t control
08:05 and (2) what we can.
08:08 And often, like Paul,  what we can control is our response.
08:12 That is a choice.
08:15 When we face a discouraging circumstance,
08:18 we could choose to become bitter about life,
08:23 angry at God.
08:25 We could even let it stumble us as some have.
08:29 Or we can choose a better response.
08:32 And like Paul,  a better response usually involves
08:36 first accepting the reality of the situation.
08:40 Now, at first that might sound cold,
08:45 but accepting reality is vital.
08:47 Why?
08:49 Page 7 of the April 2014 Awake! says this:
08:54 “By learning to accept  what you cannot change,
08:57 “. . . you are also more likely to look  for ways to cope with the situation . . .
09:02 “You start to take a measure of control
09:05 of what seems to be  an uncontrollable situation.”
09:09 Now, Harold King is an example of that.
09:12 As you know, he was imprisoned for his faith,
09:16 confined to a four-and-a-half  by nine-foot cell.
09:19 Brother King certainly couldn’t control  his circumstance,
09:23 but he could control his response.
09:26 Once Brother King  accepted the reality of his situation,
09:30 he thought of things that he could control
09:32 —things that even prison walls  could not prevent him from doing.
09:37 For example: He prayed;
09:39 he memorized scriptures;
09:41 he wrote Kingdom songs;
09:44 he celebrated the Memorial  right there in his cell alone;
09:47 he even went out in service  by creating imaginary householders.
09:52 Once Brother King accepted reality,
09:55 he was able to take a measure of control
09:59 of what seemed to be  an uncontrollable situation.
10:03 A brother whose wife  was diagnosed with cancer
10:06 relates how they did something similar.
10:09 They couldn’t control the disease.
10:12 But what could they do?
10:15 Quoted in the August 2011 Awake!  the husband says:
10:19 “We decided that at regular intervals
10:22 “we would not talk  about the cancer for a whole day.
10:26 “Instead, we focused  on the positive aspects of our life.
10:29 “It was like taking a vacation  from the disease.
10:33 Regularly we had a cancer-free day.”
10:37 Now, that’s how this couple  took a measure of control.
10:40 Others might choose a different method,
10:43 but again the point is this:
10:45 Once we accept reality,
10:48 we’re more likely to find ways  to cope with the situation
10:52 and to even take a measure  of control over it.
10:57 But is accepting reality all we can do?
11:00 No, there’s something more.
11:03 The article  “Learning to Live with the Unchangeable”
11:06 in the March 15, 1978, Watchtower  suggests this:
11:11 “In whatever state or condition  you might find yourself,
11:15 look for its compensations or mercies.”
11:20 That’s exactly what Paul did  in connection with his thorn.
11:25 For example, look back at 2 Corinthians 12.
11:28 In verse 7, twice Paul says  that his thorn kept him
11:32 “from becoming overly exalted.”
11:34 Humility—that’s one compensation.
11:37 In verse 9, Paul says God’s power  is “made perfect in weakness.”
11:42 Increased reliance on Jehovah  —that’s a second compensation.
11:47 Here’s a third.
11:49 Let’s look at Philippians 4:11.
11:52 Now, Philippians was written  about five or six years
11:56 after Paul wrote to the Corinthians  about his thorn in the flesh.
12:01 So that thorn may have been  one of the things on Paul’s mind
12:05 as he wrote what we’re about to read.
12:08 At Philippians 4:11,  the second part of the verse,
12:13 Paul says:  “I have learned to be self-sufficient
12:17 “[or according to the footnote, “content”]
12:21 regardless of my circumstances.”
12:24 Now, with these words,
12:26 Paul expresses a vital truth
12:29 that contentment, even happiness,
12:33 does not depend  on having ideal circumstances.
12:37 You know, sometimes we talk as if it does.
12:40 We say things like:
12:42 ‘I’ll be happy  when I get a better work assignment’
12:45 or ‘I’ll be happy when I get married.’
12:47 ‘I’ll be happy when I get a better room.’
12:50 ‘I’ll be happy when I get a better roommate.’
12:53 The idea is: ‘I’ll only be happy  when my circumstances change.’
12:59 It’s been said that people who think that way
13:01 strive and strive but never arrive
13:04 because as soon as they get that circumstance
13:06 that was supposed to make them happy,
13:08 another obstacle looms up  and they’re discontent again.
13:13 Paul chose to be content,  despite his circumstances.
13:18 And notice, he says in verse 11:  “I have learned” this.
13:22 Contentment might not have been  his default position.
13:26 Perhaps like many of us,
13:28 Paul had a tendency  to veer towards negativity
13:32 when confronted with a trial.
13:35 But Paul learned to be content
13:38 even when his repeated prayers for relief
13:41 were not answered  the way he would have liked.
13:44 In fact, we could summarize  the lesson Paul learned this way:
13:47 Don’t let the blessing you’re praying for
13:50 blind you to the compensations  and mercies you have.
13:56 You know, sometimes  when we’re going through a trial,
13:58 we tend to narrow the focus  of our prayers by, in effect,
14:02 telling Jehovah how we expect to be blessed.
14:05 And yet, Jehovah may already be giving us
14:10 compensations and mercies  that we haven’t considered.
14:14 That’s what Anny, the sister  with pulmonary fibrosis, came to learn.
14:18 Remember how she said,
14:20 “I prayed and prayed and prayed,
14:22 but it felt like I was just talking  to the wall”?
14:26 Anny also admits,  “At first, I was even mad at Jehovah
14:30 for not helping me  in the way I wanted to be helped.”
14:34 How did Anny come to see  compensations and mercies
14:38 even in the midst of a serious illness?
14:40 Here’s what she says:
14:43 “My dad opened my eyes.
14:46 “While I was so upset at Jehovah,
14:48 “my dad wouldn’t stop  praying to him and thanking him
14:52 “and talking about  how good Jehovah had been to me.
14:55 “I had just been through  the worst months of my life,
14:58 “and my dad was thanking Jehovah.
15:00 “‘For what?’ I asked him.
15:02 “He told me:
15:04 “‘You have no idea  how expensive your medicine was,
15:08 “‘and I wasn’t even working.
15:10 “‘Somehow we managed  to get everything we needed.
15:13 “‘There was always food in the house.
15:15 “‘Brothers kept coming  to make sure we were eating.
15:18 Jehovah gave us the strength  to keep going and not give up.’”
15:23 And then Anny’s dad told her this:
15:26 “Just because Jehovah didn’t help you  the way you wanted to be helped
15:31 doesn’t mean he didn’t do it.”
15:33 In essence, her dad was saying,
15:36 ‘Don’t let the blessing you’re praying for
15:38 blind you to the compensations  and mercies you have.’
15:43 Anny now says:
15:45 “Jehovah helps us  in ways we can’t see at first
15:48 “because we’re so overwhelmed  by what we’re going through.
15:52 “But I’ve learned that Jehovah  has a way of doing things,
15:55 and his way is always better than my way.”
16:00 We can adopt a similar viewpoint.
16:03 If we can see the compensations  and mercies in our situation,
16:08 then we’ll be better able  to cope with a circumstance
16:11 that has become a plague of our heart.
16:15 So to review:
16:17 How can the apostle Paul’s example  lighten our load
16:20 when a discouraging circumstance  is weighing us down?
16:23 First, accept the reality of the situation.
16:26 That may open our minds  to practical ways to deal with it.
16:30 Second, look for compensations and mercies.
16:34 Don’t let the blessing you’re praying for
16:37 blind you to the blessings you have.
16:39 Those two suggestions can help us cope
16:42 with a discouraging circumstance
16:45 that has become a plague of our heart.
16:50 Now let’s move on to our second point:
16:53 when people upset us.
16:57 A sister we’ll call Helen  has been pioneering for six years.
17:02 She serves as a construction volunteer.
17:06 She helped out for an extended period  on the Warwick project.
17:10 Needless to say,  Helen has been around a lot of people
17:15 —Jehovah’s people— and that’s a blessing.
17:18 But Helen admits that at times  it’s also been a test.
17:21 Why?
17:23 She says:  “One of my greatest weaknesses
17:26 “is a critical eye toward others.
17:29 “Rarely do I have  a good first impression of a person;
17:33 “it’s always tainted  by some negative observation.
17:36 “At first, even the best of people  seem too quick to laugh,
17:40 “too popular, even too spiritual.
17:43 It’s a terrible, ugly weakness I have.”
17:47 Now, perhaps we can relate  to Helen’s comment.
17:50 We might tend to get annoyed  or even hold a grudge
17:54 when someone says or does the wrong thing.
17:57 And we think that tendency will change  when we come to Bethel, right?
18:01 ‘Finally, I’ll be around people  who are easy to get along with.’
18:04 And then at some point
18:07 —whether it’s after a few months  or a few minutes—
18:09 the bubble bursts,  and now we’re not sure
18:12 whether the brotherhood is a blessing  from Jehovah or a test from Satan.
18:18 How can we cope with that  when people upset us?
18:22 Well, let’s look at Romans 12:18.
18:25 And as we read Romans 12:18,  try to detect two things:
18:30 (1) what we can’t control
18:33 and (2) what we can control.
18:36 Romans 12:18 says:
18:39 “If possible, as far as it depends on you,
18:44 be peaceable with all men.”
18:47 Now let’s look at our two components.
18:49 First, what can’t we control?
18:52 What others say or do;
18:55 that part depends on them.
18:58 What can we control?
19:00 Again, it’s our response  —that is a choice.
19:04 When someone upsets us,  we can choose to let it grow
19:08 or we can choose to let it go.
19:10 We can choose to “be peaceable with all men.”
19:13 That part, Romans 12:18 says,
19:17 depends on each one of us.
19:20 So how can we choose to be peaceable
19:23 when someone upsets us?
19:25 Well, let’s look at Judges 8:2.
19:27 This shows us one thing we can do,  Judges 8:2.
19:31 Here Gideon avoided
19:33 what could have turned out  to be a messy conflict.
19:36 You remember the story.
19:38 Gideon and his army  had just won a battle against Midian.
19:42 And at that point,  the tribe of Ephraim starts complaining.
19:47 Now, even though they  were eventually called into the battle
19:50 and even though they captured  two Midianite princes,
19:54 the Ephraimites felt that they  should have been called in sooner
19:58 and they blamed this all on Gideon.
20:00 Judges 8:1 says that “they quarreled  bitterly with him” about this.
20:04 So now there’s a conflict.
20:06 How did Gideon handle it?
20:08 Notice what he says  to the tribe of Ephraim at Judges 8:2:
20:13 “What have I done compared with you?
20:17 Are not the gleanings of Ephraim  better than the grape harvest of Abiezer?”
20:22 What does that last question mean?
20:25 Well, Gideon was from the family of Abiezer.
20:29 So, what he’s saying to the Ephraimites is:
20:33 ‘The grapes that your tribe leaves behind
20:36 are better than the best grapes  my family can grow.’
20:40 And then he reminds the Ephraimites
20:42 that they had an important role  in the battle,
20:44 and again he asks them:
20:46 “What have I done compared with you?”
20:48 Verse 3 says that after that  the Ephraimites “calmed down.”
20:54 Problem solved—and how?
20:57 What did Gideon do here?
20:59 In the face of a conflict  with the Ephraimites,
21:01 he did not put them down.
21:03 He raised them up.
21:05 He found something good about them
21:07 —in this case, their grape harvest,  something totally unrelated to the conflict—
21:12 and for the sake of peace,  he praised them for it.
21:17 Now, we can take a similar approach.
21:21 When someone upsets us,  look for the “grape harvest.”
21:25 Even if it’s just to ourselves,
21:27 we can find something good  about the person,
21:30 perhaps something totally unrelated  to the conflict we’re having.
21:34 Now, that’s what Helen,  the sister I quoted earlier, is trying to do.
21:39 She says: “For every bad thought  I have toward a person,
21:44 “I try to make myself  find something good about them.
21:47 “When I take that step back,
21:50 it’s easier for me to get to know a person  from a loving standpoint.”
21:55 We can do the same thing.
21:57 When someone upsets us,  take that step back;
22:00 look for the “grape harvest.”
22:02 Find the good in that person.
22:04 That’s the first thing we can do.
22:06 Now, a second thing we can do  is identified in Galatians chapter 2.
22:10 Let’s look at that.
22:12 And before we read from this chapter,  Galatians 2,
22:14 consider this question:
22:17 Who are we most likely to get upset at?
22:21 Probably someone who wrongs us,  wouldn’t you think?
22:25 But you know, there’s one type of person
22:27 we might be even more prone to get upset at.
22:29 You know who it is?
22:31 Not someone who wrongs us,
22:33 but someone who “rights” us  by giving us correction when we need it.
22:38 And in Galatians 2,  we’re going to see an example of that.
22:41 Here Peter was given correction,  and he needed it.
22:45 But notice how the correction was given,
22:48 and then we’ll see why, in this case,
22:50 it might have been exceptionally hard  for Peter to accept it.
22:54 At Galatians 2:11,
23:00 Paul writes: “However, when Cephas  [that’s Peter] came to Antioch,
23:04 “I resisted him face-to-face,
23:06 because he was clearly in the wrong.”
23:09 Paul is upset at Peter, and why?
23:12 In verse 12, he tells us:
23:14 “For before certain men from James arrived  [those who were Jewish Christians],
23:18 “[Peter] used to eat  with people of the nations;
23:21 “but when they arrived, he stopped doing this  and separated himself,
23:25 fearing those of the circumcised class.”
23:28 Now, what’s Paul saying here?
23:30 That Peter would change how he acted  depending on who was watching,
23:34 and Paul called him out on this.
23:36 He says: “I resisted [Peter] face-to-face.”
23:39 And then in verse 14,  Paul really gives it to Peter.
23:42 He tells him straight out:
23:44 ‘You act one way  when the Jewish Christians are watching
23:46 and another way  when their backs are turned.’
23:49 In verse 13, Paul calls this a “pretense,”
23:52 or as the footnote renders it “hypocrisy.”
23:58 Imagine: Paul is calling Peter a hypocrite.
24:03 And he does this not privately  but “before them all,” verse 14 says.
24:07 Can this get any worse?
24:09 Yes, and it did.
24:12 Under inspiration,  Paul wrote about this incident
24:16 in his letter to the Galatians,  which we just read from.
24:20 Now, to make a comparison:
24:23 Today, Internet messages spread  from one person to the next.
24:28 And when a message  circulates rapidly and widely,
24:33 people say it went viral.
24:35 Now, they didn’t have the Internet  in the first century, of course,
24:38 but they did have letters  —and letters circulated.
24:43 And this one, Galatians,
24:45 did more than just circulate  from one person to the next
24:48 or even one congregation to the next.
24:50 No, under Jehovah’s supervision,  this one ended up in the Bible
24:54 —billions of copies down  through the centuries still being printed,
24:58 translated into thousands of languages.
25:00 Now the whole world can read  about Peter’s hypocrisy, as we just did.
25:06 Now, the Bible doesn’t tell us  Peter’s immediate reaction.
25:11 Initially, he may have been upset  at Paul, for all we know.
25:15 But in the end,
25:17 Peter chose to be peaceable.
25:19 How do we know that?
25:21 Well, in his second letter,  which was written about 12 to 14 years later,
25:25 Peter called Paul “our beloved brother,”
25:29 and he even said  that Paul had God-given wisdom.
25:32 That’s at 2 Peter 3:15.
25:35 So in the end,
25:37 Peter looked up to Paul,  and for good reason.
25:40 As he acknowledged,  Paul had God-given wisdom
25:44 to see not only into Scripture  but also into people.
25:48 He could even see into Peter.
25:51 And instead of viewing that as a threat,
25:54 Peter saw it as a benefit.
25:57 And that’s because he chose to be peaceable.
26:01 Now, you and I can do the same.
26:03 In fact, we need to.
26:05 Why?
26:07 Because from time to time  each one of us will encounter a “Paul”
26:11 —someone who gives us correction  that we need to hear,
26:15 but it comes to us in blunt terms,
26:17 perhaps at a most inappropriate time,  and it stings.
26:21 And sometimes the counsel  that stings the most
26:23 is also the counsel we need the most.
26:26 If, like Peter, we choose to be peaceable,  we’ll be able to take it
26:31 not only when someone wrongs us  but also when someone “rights” us
26:36 by giving us needed correction.
26:39 Let’s be honest, though,  it’s tough to do that.
26:42 We can be so hypersensitive at times,  and no wonder.
26:46 We live in a world where it’s just common
26:50 to blame someone else for our mistakes.
26:53 If someone breaks something,
26:55 it’s the manufacturer’s fault  for not making it unbreakable.
26:58 A speeding ticket  —that’s the policeman’s fault
27:01 because he had to meet a quota.
27:03 If a child fails English,  it’s the teacher’s fault
27:05 for not teaching English  good enough, or well enough.
27:09 In this world,  correction is largely viewed as an insult,
27:14 not as a teaching tool.
27:16 But God’s Word  does not support the world’s view.
27:20 The Bible tells us of people  that stayed in or went out of God’s favor
27:25 depending on how they responded to counsel.
27:29 So if we choose to remain bitter  at the person who corrected us,
27:33 we need to remember this:
27:35 We are letting our upset emotions
27:37 have far too much power over us.
27:40 Resentment is heavy baggage  that will only add to our load
27:45 on our journey to God’s new world,  and who needs that?
27:50 Instead, we need to be peaceable,
27:53 not only when we’re wronged
27:55 but also when we’re righted  through correction.
27:59 So to review:
28:01 How can we lighten our load  when someone upsets us?
28:04 First, like Gideon,  look for the “grape harvest”
28:07 —find something good about the person.
28:10 Second, like Peter,  be willing to accept correction
28:14 regardless of the manner in which it’s given.
28:18 Those two suggestions  can lighten our load when people upset us.
28:25 Now, let’s move  on to our third and final point:
28:28 when negative emotions overwhelm us.
28:33 As imperfect humans,
28:35 we are prone to have  a distorted view of ourselves.
28:40 A few might ‘think more  of themselves than necessary,’
28:44 as Romans 12:3 says.
28:47 But others have the opposite problem
28:49 —thinking too little of themselves,
28:52 plagued with feelings of worthlessness.
28:56 When they look at themselves,  what they see
28:59 is a gross misrepresentation of reality,
29:03 as if viewing themselves  in a distorted fun house mirror.
29:07 For example, one Witness
29:09 quoted in the September 15, 2014,  Watchtower said this:
29:14 “When I think  about everything I’ve done wrong,
29:18 “it can make me feel as if there’s no way
29:20 anyone can ever love me, not even Jehovah.”
29:25 Another, quoted  in the January 2006, Awake! said this:
29:29 “I knew that Jehovah  had forgiven me for my mistakes,
29:33 “but I did not want him to.
29:35 “I wanted to suffer  because I hated myself so much.
29:39 “While I knew that Jehovah  could never have conceived
29:42 “of a place . . . like Christendom’s hell,
29:45 I wanted him to invent one just for me.”
29:51 Now, as these examples illustrate,  our emotions
29:55 —which ironically Jehovah created  to enhance our love and our worship—
30:00 can sometimes turn against us  and make us feel condemned.
30:05 And that does more than just hinder our joy;
30:09 it also hinders our ability  to give Jehovah full glory
30:13 for the magnitude of his love.
30:16 So how can we cope with negative emotions
30:20 that at times overwhelm us?
30:22 Well, let’s look at Romans 7:22-25.
30:27 Now, here the apostle Paul  describes negative emotions
30:31 that at times overwhelmed him.
30:33 And as we read these verses,  try to detect two things:
30:36 (1) what Paul could not control
30:39 and (2) what he could control.
30:42 Romans 7, beginning with verse 22:
30:45 “I really delight in the law of God  according to the man I am within,
30:50 “but I see in my body another law  warring against the law of my mind
30:55 “and leading me captive  to sin’s law that is in my body.
30:59 “Miserable man that I am!
31:02 “Who will rescue me  from the body undergoing this death?
31:06 Thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!”
31:11 Now, let’s identify our two components.
31:13 First, what couldn’t Paul control?
31:17 Occasional feelings of self-doubt
31:20 which Paul said made him feel miserable.
31:23 What could he control?
31:25 Once again, it’s his response.
31:27 And Paul’s response  is right there in verse 25:
31:30 “Thanks to God  through Jesus Christ our Lord!”
31:34 Here Paul gives us the first key
31:36 to coping with negative emotions:
31:38 meditate on the ransom.
31:42 Make it a personal study project  if necessary.
31:45 Collect scriptures from the Bible  and material from our publications
31:49 that build up appreciation  for what Jesus’ death means
31:54 not just to the world of mankind in general
31:57 but to each one of us as an individual.
32:01 Meditating on the ransom  can help us cope with negative emotions,
32:05 and why?
32:07 Because as the April 1, 1995,  Watchtower says:
32:12 “Christ’s ransom sacrifice  is the most potent answer
32:17 to the satanic lie  that we are worthless or unlovable.”
32:22 Let’s think about that statement.
32:24 Why does it call the idea  that we are worthless or unlovable
32:28 not just a lie but a “satanic lie”?
32:33 Well, who really profits when we believe  that we’re unlovable to Jehovah?
32:39 Who really benefits when we wallow  in thoughts of self-condemnation?
32:44 Whose purpose is really served
32:46 when our emotions plague us
32:48 to the extent that we feel like giving up?
32:52 Obviously, it’s Satan.
32:55 And consider the irony of that.
32:58 Who really has proved himself  unworthy of Jehovah’s love?
33:02 Him!
33:03 Who really is beyond Jehovah’s forgiveness?
33:06 Him!
33:08 Who really does the ransom not apply to?
33:11 Him!
33:13 And yet now,  in one of his greatest “crafty acts,”
33:18 as Ephesians 6:11 calls it,
33:21 Satan tries to throw  all those feelings of condemnation
33:25 that he deserves on you and on me.
33:30 The ransom gives us permission
33:34 to throw off that heavy baggage.
33:37 Evidently, that’s what Paul did.
33:40 Yes, at times  he felt miserable about himself,
33:44 as we read at Romans 7:24.
33:47 But he also wrote at Galatians 2:20:
33:50 “I live by faith in the Son of God,
33:52 who loved me  and handed himself over for me.”
33:56 Now, in stating that,  Paul wasn’t being egotistical
33:59 or thinking more of himself than necessary.
34:03 He simply understood  a basic Scriptural truth
34:06 —that Christ died for sinners,  not for perfect people.
34:11 The fact that Paul was so keenly aware  of his imperfections was evidence
34:16 that he was the very kind of person  that Jesus gave his life for.
34:22 The ransom helped Paul  refute any feelings of self-doubt,
34:27 and it can do the same for us.
34:29 Again, the April 1, 1995, Watchtower
34:32 expresses that thought beautifully.
34:35 It says: “If life in this system  has taught you to see yourself
34:39 “as an obstacle too daunting
34:41 “even for God’s immense love to surmount,
34:44 “. . . or your sins as too vast
34:47 “even for the death  of his precious Son to cover,
34:50 “you have been taught a lie.
34:53 Reject such lies  with all the repugnance that they deserve!”
34:58 Isn’t that what we do  with all of Satan’s other lies?
35:01 Do we accept the doctrine of the Trinity? No!
35:04 Do we believe in hellfire? No!
35:07 Do we believe that life evolved? No!
35:10 Do we believe that we are unlovable
35:14 and worthless to Jehovah?
35:17 Our answer to that question should be no,
35:22 and it should be just as decisive  as our no to the other questions.
35:25 And why?
35:27 Because the idea that we are worthless
35:29 or unlovable to Jehovah is a false doctrine,
35:34 and we need to reject it just as firmly
35:38 as we would reject  any of Satan’s other God-dishonoring lies.
35:45 Meditating on the ransom can help us do that.
35:49 But besides meditating on the ransom,
35:51 there’s something else we can do  to cope with negative emotions.
35:54 Let’s look at Psalm 61:2.
35:58 What David prayed for  in this verse presents us
36:01 with another key to dealing  with negative emotions,
36:04 including feelings of worthlessness.
36:07 At Psalm 61:2,
36:11 David says to Jehovah:
36:13 “From the ends of the earth  I will cry out to you
36:16 “when my heart is in despair.
36:19 Lead me onto a rock  that is higher than I am.”
36:24 Here, David is asking Jehovah  for a different view,
36:28 an elevated one.
36:30 And that’s what we need
36:32 when negative emotions plague us.
36:34 As David wrote,  we need to be placed on a rock
36:38 that is higher than ourselves,
36:40 higher than our imperfect  and distorted reasoning.
36:44 Now, Scriptural truths  can help us do that.
36:48 For example,
36:50 when the heart is in despair,  as David wrote,
36:54 we may feel that no one can love us,  not even Jehovah.
36:59 But the elevated view from the rock  reveals a Scriptural truth
37:02 —Romans 8:38, 39—
37:04 nothing can “separate us from God’s love.”
37:08 When the heart is in despair,
37:11 we feel that our mistakes  are too great for Jehovah to forgive.
37:16 But the elevated view from the rock
37:18 reveals a Scriptural truth—Romans 5:8:
37:21 “While we were yet sinners,  Christ died for us.”
37:24 As we mentioned before,  Jesus died for sinners,
37:27 not for perfect people.
37:29 When the heart is in despair,
37:32 we can’t picture ourselves in Paradise
37:35 because in our heart we feel condemned.
37:40 But the elevated view from the rock  reveals a Scriptural truth
37:44 —1 John 3:20:
37:46 “God is greater than our hearts  and [he] knows all things,”
37:50 including the reasons why we tend to think
37:54 so negatively of ourselves.
37:56 The point is: Gradually we can replace
38:01 lowly negative thoughts
38:03 with elevated Scriptural truths.
38:06 Now, we just mentioned three of those truths.
38:08 Here’s one more.
38:09 Let’s look at Malachi 3:17.
38:12 Now, in its application,
38:14 Malachi 3 is talking  about Jehovah’s spiritual temple.
38:18 But in principle, this verse  shows us the high value
38:21 that Jehovah places on his people.
38:24 Malachi 3:17 says:
38:27 “‘And they will be mine,’  says Jehovah of armies,
38:31 ‘in the day  when I produce a special property’”
38:35 or, as the footnote renders it,  “a treasured possession.”
38:40 Let’s stop there.
38:42 Notice how proudly  Jehovah talks about his people.
38:46 He says: “They will be mine.”
38:49 He even calls his people  “a special property.”
38:53 And make no mistake,  that term isn’t thrown into the Bible
38:56 just to make us feel good  or to give us empty praise.
39:00 No, Jehovah’s people are special to him.
39:03 And why?
39:05 Because he produced  this property that we just read.
39:08 In other words,  Jehovah is cultivating in each one of us
39:11 the very spiritual qualities  that make us special to him.
39:17 So again, going back to Psalm 61:2,  when the “heart is in despair,”
39:22 as David wrote, we may only see  our failings and imperfections.
39:26 But the elevated view from the rock  reveals a Scriptural truth
39:30 —Malachi 3:17—
39:32 we are “a special property” to Jehovah  despite our flaws.
39:38 And if it’s difficult for us to accept that,  then we need to remember
39:42 that Jehovah is the one  who sets the standard
39:45 for what’s special here, not us.
39:49 One sister who had  an extremely negative view of herself
39:54 was helped to reason on that.
39:56 She says:  “A spiritually mature sister helped me
39:58 “to look at myself realistically  as an imperfect human
40:02 “with strengths and weaknesses,
40:04 “no better or worse  than any other brother or sister
40:07 “struggling with imperfection.
40:09 “An elder greatly helped me too
40:11 “by telling me  that no one comes to Jehovah
40:14 “without being drawn by His spirit  (that’s John 6:44).
40:18 “So Jehovah must see  something lovable in me,
40:21 and who was I  to despise what Jehovah loves?”
40:26 And notice how this sister  is slowly moving away
40:29 from that distorted mirror  and coming to see herself
40:33 the way Jehovah does.
40:35 We can do the same.
40:37 Is it easy? Absolutely not.
40:39 Second Corinthians 10:4
40:41 talks about “strongly entrenched things”  that we need to overturn,
40:45 and it lists “reasonings”  as one of those things.
40:48 Now, that could include  our imperfect and distorted reasoning
40:52 about our value to Jehovah.
40:55 That reasoning might be  so strongly entrenched
40:58 that we need  to keep praying about it, keep studying,
41:02 (or as we mentioned earlier)  keep meditating on the ransom.
41:06 But as we gradually replace  lowly negative emotions
41:10 with elevated Scriptural truths,
41:12 we’ll be better able to move away  from that distorted mirror
41:16 and see ourselves the way Jehovah does.
41:21 So to review:
41:23 How can we cope with negative emotions
41:26 that at times overwhelm us?
41:28 First, meditate on the ransom.
41:30 It is the most potent answer  to the satanic lie
41:34 that we are worthless  or unlovable to Jehovah.
41:38 Second, gradually replace  lowly negative thoughts
41:42 with elevated Scriptural truths
41:45 —truths that will help us  see ourselves the way Jehovah does.
41:49 Those two suggestions  can help us cope with negative emotions
41:53 that have become a plague of our heart.
41:59 Now in conclusion, a final thought:
42:01 Whatever plagues our heart,
42:04 even if it’s a situation  that we haven’t touched on this evening,
42:07 remaining spiritually active  will lighten our load.
42:12 Now, we at Bethel are blessed
42:15 because we have plenty to do  in Jehovah’s work.
42:17 And really, wherever we serve,
42:19 theocratic activity  will balance our thinking
42:23 and help us to put  the principles we discussed into practice.
42:27 But our strongest means of coping  with any plague of our heart
42:32 is identified at Psalm 62:1, 2.
42:35 Let’s read those verses.
42:37 What David says in Psalm 62
42:40 can lighten our load  and make it easier for us to carry.
42:44 Psalm 62, beginning with verse 1:
42:48 “Indeed, I wait silently for God.
42:51 “My salvation comes from him.
42:54 “Indeed, he is my rock and my salvation,
42:57 “my secure refuge;
43:00 I will never be greatly shaken.”
43:04 Let’s think about that last phrase
43:06 “I will never be greatly shaken.”
43:09 What does that mean,
43:11 and how can it help us cope  with the plague of our heart?
43:15 Well, to illustrate it,  last year my wife and I were on a flight
43:18 from El Paso to New York  when the plane hit turbulence.
43:22 And this wasn’t ordinary turbulence;
43:25 this turbulence was so bad  that the pilot told the flight attendants
43:29 to sit down and fasten their seat belts.
43:31 It was a nerve-racking experience.
43:34 Obviously, we survived.
43:37 But a day or two later, I did some research
43:40 and I found out something about turbulence
43:42 that many passengers don’t know.
43:45 You know what it is?
43:47 It’s that planes are built  to handle turbulence,
43:51 even the really bad kind.
43:54 In fact, when the pilot says  he’s searching for smoother air,
43:59 he’s not doing it so much for our safety
44:02 as he is just for our comfort  and to keep the coffee in our cups.
44:07 Turbulence might shake a plane,
44:10 but the plane will not be greatly shaken.
44:15 To cope with the plague of our heart,
44:18 we need to understand something similar
44:21 about the turbulence going on in our life.
44:25 When we face a trial,  our tendency might be to panic,
44:30 to grip the armrests (so to speak),
44:32 to worry about what  the next moment will bring,
44:35 to fear that we are going to crash.
44:37 But we can have confidence that,  as David said,
44:41 we will never be greatly shaken.
44:43 We can handle the turbulence  of any trial that comes our way.
44:46 And why?
44:48 Not because of our own strength,
44:50 but because we feel  as David expresses in verse 2:
44:54 “[Jehovah] is my rock and my salvation,  my secure refuge.”
44:58 So yes, we may be shaken by our trial,
45:02 but with Jehovah’s help,  we will never be greatly shaken.
45:07 By all means, then,  whatever hardship we face
45:11 —whether it’s circumstances  that discourage us, people who upset us,
45:16 negative emotions that overwhelm us,  or anything else
45:19 —let us continue to make Jehovah  our secure refuge,
45:23 confident that he can help us cope  with the plague of our heart.

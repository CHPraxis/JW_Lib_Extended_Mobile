00:01.350 --> 00:02.685
Imagine for a moment 


00:02.685 --> 00:05.055
that you’re going on a trip. 


00:05.055 --> 00:07.290
The tickets are a gift; 


00:07.290 --> 00:09.558
a friend has paid the price. 


00:09.558 --> 00:12.295
All you have to do is pack your bags 


00:12.295 --> 00:14.297
and get to the airport. 


00:14.297 --> 00:17.867
Now as you know, packing isn’t easy, 


00:17.867 --> 00:22.005
and dragging heavy bags 
around the airport is exhausting. 


00:22.005 --> 00:24.607
Remember the days 
before luggage had wheels? 


00:24.607 --> 00:26.609
How did we do that? 


00:26.608 --> 00:31.000
Heavy baggage can make even a vacation 
seem like a burden. 


00:32.348 --> 00:34.416
Well, the point is this: 


00:34.417 --> 00:37.887
You and I have set out on an exciting journey 


00:37.887 --> 00:40.357
—a journey to God’s new world. 


00:40.357 --> 00:44.294
The trip is free; the ransom paid the price. 


00:44.293 --> 00:47.763
All we have to do is get there. 


00:47.763 --> 00:50.031
And that’s the hard part, right? 


00:50.032 --> 00:52.035
And why? 


00:52.035 --> 00:54.603
Because each one of us is carrying 


00:54.603 --> 00:58.608
some type of heavy baggage on this journey. 


00:58.608 --> 01:01.010
Now, it’s true our life is blessed. 


01:01.010 --> 01:05.848
As Isaiah 65:13 says, figuratively, 
we’re eating and drinking 


01:05.848 --> 01:08.985
while the world goes hungry and thirsty. 


01:08.985 --> 01:12.088
Still, Acts 14:22 says: 


01:12.088 --> 01:14.290
“We must enter into the Kingdom of God 


01:14.290 --> 01:16.525
through many tribulations.” 


01:16.525 --> 01:19.328
We have anxieties. 


01:19.328 --> 01:21.730
And Proverbs 12:25 says: 


01:21.730 --> 01:25.102
‘Anxiety in the heart can weigh it down.’ 


01:25.102 --> 01:27.837
The heavy baggage we carry 


01:27.837 --> 01:31.007
can make even the journey to God’s new world 


01:31.007 --> 01:33.577
seem like a burden. 


01:33.577 --> 01:36.145
Well, the good news is that we have help. 


01:36.145 --> 01:42.352
Open your Bible to 1 Kings 8:38, 39. 


01:42.352 --> 01:45.855
Here Solomon prayed 
on behalf of Jehovah’s people 


01:45.855 --> 01:48.692
at the inauguration of the temple. 


01:48.692 --> 01:50.794
And what he said in that prayer 


01:50.793 --> 01:52.861
can help us put wheels on our baggage 


01:52.862 --> 01:54.930
so it’s easier for us to carry. 


01:54.930 --> 01:58.768
At 1 Kings 8, beginning with verse 38, 


01:58.768 --> 02:00.836
Solomon says to Jehovah: 


02:00.837 --> 02:04.607
“Whatever prayer, whatever request for favor 


02:04.607 --> 02:08.812
“may be made by any man 
or by all your people Israel 


02:08.812 --> 02:13.015
“(for each one knows the plague 
of his own heart) 


02:13.015 --> 02:15.985
“when they spread out their hands 
toward this house, 


02:15.985 --> 02:19.355
“then may you hear from the heavens, 
your dwelling place, 


02:19.355 --> 02:22.358
and may you forgive and take action.” 


02:22.358 --> 02:24.360
Now let’s stop there. 


02:24.360 --> 02:29.198
Notice that phrase 
“each one knows the plague of his own heart.” 


02:29.198 --> 02:34.136
In stating that, Solomon wasn’t referring 
to the nation as a whole. 


02:34.137 --> 02:37.507
He was referring to private suffering 


02:37.507 --> 02:41.244
—the baggage each person had to carry, 


02:41.243 --> 02:44.913
the problems no one else might know about. 


02:44.913 --> 02:49.151
And although Solomon evidently had 
a specific type of plague in mind 


02:49.152 --> 02:51.287
—one that required forgiveness—


02:51.287 --> 02:56.292
by extension his words can apply 
to any anxiety that weighs us down. 


02:56.292 --> 03:00.397
For example, 
chapter 2 of the “God’s Love” book 


03:00.397 --> 03:03.700
applies Solomon’s words 
to a personal weakness 


03:03.700 --> 03:05.868
we might struggle with. 


03:05.868 --> 03:09.105
The May 1, 2010, Watchtower applies it 


03:09.105 --> 03:12.942
to the grief a person feels 
after losing a mate. 


03:12.942 --> 03:15.245
The point is: 


03:15.245 --> 03:18.615
Any anxiety that weighs us down 


03:18.615 --> 03:21.000
can be considered a plague of the heart. 


03:23.418 --> 03:26.000
What is the plague of your heart? 


03:27.123 --> 03:32.000
What anxiety weighs you down 
on your journey to God’s new world? 


03:33.528 --> 03:36.198
Whatever baggage we carry, 


03:36.198 --> 03:39.735
the scripture we just read 
confirms that we have help. 


03:39.735 --> 03:41.803
Notice, Solomon prayed that Jehovah 


03:41.803 --> 03:44.240
would not only “hear from the heavens” 


03:44.240 --> 03:46.708
but also “take action” 


03:46.708 --> 03:51.000
—if not to eliminate our load 
then at least to help us carry it. 


03:52.115 --> 03:55.452
For the rest of this discussion, 
we’ll see how Jehovah can do that 


03:55.452 --> 03:57.454
in three situations: 


03:57.453 --> 04:01.123
(1) when circumstances discourage us, 


04:01.123 --> 04:05.026
(2) when people upset us, 


04:05.027 --> 04:09.599
and (3) when negative emotions 
overwhelm us. 


04:09.598 --> 04:11.833
In all situations, 


04:11.833 --> 04:15.605
Jehovah can help us cope 
with the plague of our heart. 


04:15.605 --> 04:17.173
Let’s see how. 


04:17.173 --> 04:21.000
First, when circumstances discourage us. 


04:22.445 --> 04:24.680
Now, when it comes to circumstances, 


04:24.680 --> 04:26.748
life is unpredictable. 


04:26.748 --> 04:29.885
In this system, 
things can change just like that 


04:29.885 --> 04:32.088
with one phone call, 


04:32.088 --> 04:34.256
one accident, 


04:34.257 --> 04:36.359
one diagnosis. 


04:36.358 --> 04:38.360
Let me tell you about Anny, 


04:38.360 --> 04:42.132
who was diagnosed at age 19 
with pulmonary fibrosis, 


04:42.132 --> 04:46.535
and at first she felt 
this was completely unfair. 


04:46.535 --> 04:50.540
Anny says: “Pulmonary fibrosis 
affects heavy smokers, 


04:50.540 --> 04:54.010
“and I had never had a cigarette in my life! 


04:54.010 --> 04:57.347
“I was depressed, I wouldn’t eat, 


04:57.347 --> 04:59.515
“and I wouldn’t talk to people. 


04:59.515 --> 05:01.550
“I would just lie in bed 


05:01.550 --> 05:04.687
and think about how miserable my life was.” 


05:04.687 --> 05:08.124
Now, Anny is one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


05:08.123 --> 05:10.960
and she was one when she got sick. 


05:10.960 --> 05:15.030
She understood the real cause of her illness, 


05:15.030 --> 05:18.133
and she knew about the new world. 


05:18.133 --> 05:22.405
Still, this discouraging circumstance 
threw Anny off course. 


05:22.405 --> 05:25.875
She says, “I prayed and prayed 
and prayed about it, 


05:25.875 --> 05:28.000
but it felt like I was just talking 
to the wall.” 


05:30.045 --> 05:32.815
Now, regardless of our age, 


05:32.815 --> 05:35.818
we may relate to Anny’s comment. 


05:35.818 --> 05:39.221
When any of us face 
a discouraging circumstance, 


05:39.222 --> 05:41.290
we pray about it repeatedly. 


05:41.290 --> 05:43.292
And if nothing changes, 


05:43.292 --> 05:47.197
we may wonder whether Jehovah cares about 


05:47.197 --> 05:49.932
or even sees what we’re going through. 


05:49.932 --> 05:54.937
A discouraging circumstance 
can become a plague of our heart. 


05:54.937 --> 05:56.939
How can we cope with it? 


05:56.938 --> 06:01.710
Well, let’s look at 2 Corinthians 12:7-9. 


06:01.710 --> 06:06.148
Here the apostle Paul 
faced a discouraging circumstance 


06:06.148 --> 06:08.650
—one that he calls “a thorn in the flesh.” 


06:08.650 --> 06:11.320
Now, as you realize, 
we don’t know what that thorn was. 


06:11.320 --> 06:13.622
It might have been a physical affliction. 


06:13.622 --> 06:16.059
Whatever it was, as we read these verses, 


06:16.058 --> 06:18.060
try to detect two things: 


06:18.060 --> 06:21.063
(1) what Paul could not control 


06:21.063 --> 06:23.966
and (2) what he could control. 


06:23.967 --> 06:27.770
Second Corinthians 12, 
beginning with verse 7: 


06:27.770 --> 06:31.207
“To keep me from becoming overly exalted, 


06:31.207 --> 06:35.412
“I was given a thorn in the flesh, 
an angel of Satan, 


06:35.412 --> 06:40.417
“to keep slapping me, 
so that I might not be overly exalted. 


06:40.417 --> 06:44.720
“Three times I begged the Lord about this, 
that it would depart from me. 


06:44.720 --> 06:46.722
“But he said to me: 


06:46.722 --> 06:49.892
“‘My undeserved kindness 
is sufficient for you, 


06:49.892 --> 06:53.729
for my power is being 
made perfect in weakness.’” 


06:53.728 --> 06:57.100
Now let’s stop there 
and look at our two components. 


06:57.100 --> 07:00.703
First, what couldn’t Paul control? 


07:00.703 --> 07:02.705
The answer is obvious 


07:02.705 --> 07:05.975
—the circumstance itself—
his “thorn in the flesh.” 


07:05.975 --> 07:08.778
Paul even prayed about it three times, 


07:08.778 --> 07:10.946
but nothing changed. 


07:10.947 --> 07:15.284
The circumstance was beyond his control. 


07:15.283 --> 07:17.553
What could Paul control? 


07:17.553 --> 07:19.555
His response. 


07:19.555 --> 07:23.425
And part of that response 
was to accept the reality 


07:23.425 --> 07:26.528
of his situation 
to the point that he says in verse 9: 


07:26.528 --> 07:30.466
“Most gladly, . . . 
I will boast about my weaknesses.” 


07:30.467 --> 07:35.170
Once Paul realized 
that his thorn would not be removed, 


07:35.170 --> 07:38.340
he didn’t waste time doubting God’s love 


07:38.340 --> 07:42.278
or asking ‘Why me?’ 
or comparing himself to others 


07:42.278 --> 07:44.446
who seemed to have an easier life. 


07:44.447 --> 07:47.950
No, Paul accepted reality. 


07:47.950 --> 07:50.787
He viewed his thorn as “an angel of Satan,” 


07:50.787 --> 07:54.224
and he got about the business of endurance. 


07:54.223 --> 07:56.825
Now, Paul’s experience gives us a key 


07:56.825 --> 07:59.562
to coping with any discouraging circumstance. 


07:59.562 --> 08:02.299
First, break it down into two components: 


08:02.298 --> 08:05.066
(1) what we can’t control 


08:05.067 --> 08:08.070
and (2) what we can. 


08:08.070 --> 08:12.875
And often, like Paul, 
what we can control is our response. 


08:12.875 --> 08:15.645
That is a choice. 


08:15.645 --> 08:18.513
When we face a discouraging circumstance, 


08:18.513 --> 08:23.185
we could choose to become bitter about life, 


08:23.185 --> 08:25.655
angry at God. 


08:25.655 --> 08:29.492
We could even let it stumble us as some have. 


08:29.492 --> 08:32.462
Or we can choose a better response. 


08:32.462 --> 08:36.399
And like Paul, 
a better response usually involves 


08:36.398 --> 08:40.970
first accepting the reality of the situation. 


08:40.970 --> 08:45.240
Now, at first that might sound cold, 


08:45.240 --> 08:47.843
but accepting reality is vital. 


08:47.843 --> 08:49.845
Why? 


08:49.845 --> 08:54.550
Page 7 of the April 2014 Awake! says this: 


08:54.550 --> 08:57.987
“By learning to accept 
what you cannot change, 


08:57.987 --> 09:02.057
“. . . you are also more likely to look 
for ways to cope with the situation . . . 


09:02.057 --> 09:05.160
“You start to take a measure of control 


09:05.160 --> 09:09.698
of what seems to be 
an uncontrollable situation.”


09:09.698 --> 09:12.868
Now, Harold King is an example of that. 


09:12.868 --> 09:16.005
As you know, he was imprisoned for his faith, 


09:16.005 --> 09:19.275
confined to a four-and-a-half 
by nine-foot cell. 


09:19.275 --> 09:23.245
Brother King certainly couldn’t control 
his circumstance, 


09:23.245 --> 09:26.415
but he could control his response. 


09:26.415 --> 09:30.285
Once Brother King 
accepted the reality of his situation, 


09:30.285 --> 09:32.722
he thought of things that he could control 


09:32.722 --> 09:37.294
—things that even prison walls 
could not prevent him from doing. 


09:37.293 --> 09:39.628
For example: He prayed; 


09:39.628 --> 09:41.796
he memorized scriptures; 


09:41.797 --> 09:44.000
he wrote Kingdom songs; 


09:44.000 --> 09:47.970
he celebrated the Memorial 
right there in his cell alone; 


09:47.970 --> 09:52.975
he even went out in service 
by creating imaginary householders. 


09:52.975 --> 09:55.978
Once Brother King accepted reality, 


09:55.978 --> 09:59.048
he was able to take a measure of control 


09:59.048 --> 10:03.885
of what seemed to be 
an uncontrollable situation. 


10:03.885 --> 10:06.888
A brother whose wife 
was diagnosed with cancer 


10:06.888 --> 10:09.591
relates how they did something similar. 


10:09.592 --> 10:12.429
They couldn’t control the disease. 


10:12.428 --> 10:15.230
But what could they do? 


10:15.230 --> 10:19.968
Quoted in the August 2011 Awake! 
the husband says: 


10:19.968 --> 10:22.371
“We decided that at regular intervals 


10:22.372 --> 10:26.175
“we would not talk 
about the cancer for a whole day. 


10:26.175 --> 10:29.845
“Instead, we focused 
on the positive aspects of our life. 


10:29.845 --> 10:33.615
“It was like taking a vacation 
from the disease. 


10:33.615 --> 10:37.320
Regularly we had a cancer-free day.” 


10:37.320 --> 10:40.757
Now, that’s how this couple 
took a measure of control. 


10:40.757 --> 10:43.125
Others might choose a different method, 


10:43.125 --> 10:45.527
but again the point is this: 


10:45.527 --> 10:48.464
Once we accept reality, 


10:48.463 --> 10:52.300
we’re more likely to find ways 
to cope with the situation 


10:52.300 --> 10:56.000
and to even take a measure 
of control over it.


10:57.773 --> 11:00.776
But is accepting reality all we can do? 


11:00.777 --> 11:03.245
No, there’s something more. 


11:03.245 --> 11:06.482
The article 
“Learning to Live with the Unchangeable” 


11:06.482 --> 11:11.320
in the March 15, 1978, Watchtower 
suggests this: 


11:11.320 --> 11:15.858
“In whatever state or condition 
you might find yourself, 


11:15.858 --> 11:20.863
look for its compensations or mercies.” 


11:20.863 --> 11:25.033
That’s exactly what Paul did 
in connection with his thorn. 


11:25.033 --> 11:28.236
For example, look back at 2 Corinthians 12. 


11:28.237 --> 11:32.509
In verse 7, twice Paul says 
that his thorn kept him 


11:32.508 --> 11:34.810
“from becoming overly exalted.” 


11:34.810 --> 11:37.747
Humility—that’s one compensation. 


11:37.747 --> 11:42.752
In verse 9, Paul says God’s power 
is “made perfect in weakness.” 


11:42.752 --> 11:47.757
Increased reliance on Jehovah 
—that’s a second compensation. 


11:47.757 --> 11:49.759
Here’s a third. 


11:49.758 --> 11:52.728
Let’s look at Philippians 4:11. 


11:52.728 --> 11:56.365
Now, Philippians was written 
about five or six years 


11:56.365 --> 12:01.003
after Paul wrote to the Corinthians 
about his thorn in the flesh. 


12:01.003 --> 12:05.440
So that thorn may have been 
one of the things on Paul’s mind 


12:05.440 --> 12:08.610
as he wrote what we’re about to read. 


12:08.610 --> 12:13.615
At Philippians 4:11, 
the second part of the verse, 


12:13.615 --> 12:17.687
Paul says: 
“I have learned to be self-sufficient 


12:17.687 --> 12:21.124
“[or according to the footnote, “content”] 


12:21.123 --> 12:24.393
regardless of my circumstances.” 


12:24.393 --> 12:26.828
Now, with these words, 


12:26.828 --> 12:29.198
Paul expresses a vital truth 


12:29.198 --> 12:33.535
that contentment, even happiness, 


12:33.535 --> 12:37.940
does not depend 
on having ideal circumstances. 


12:37.940 --> 12:40.508
You know, sometimes we talk as if it does. 


12:40.508 --> 12:42.511
We say things like: 


12:42.512 --> 12:45.147
‘I’ll be happy 
when I get a better work assignment’ 


12:45.147 --> 12:47.850
or ‘I’ll be happy when I get married.’ 


12:47.850 --> 12:50.787
‘I’ll be happy when I get a better room.’ 


12:50.787 --> 12:53.555
‘I’ll be happy when I get a better roommate.’ 


12:53.555 --> 12:58.000
The idea is: ‘I’ll only be happy 
when my circumstances change.’ 


12:59.195 --> 13:01.763
It’s been said that people who think that way 


13:01.763 --> 13:04.733
strive and strive but never arrive 


13:04.733 --> 13:06.735
because as soon as they get that circumstance 


13:06.735 --> 13:08.737
that was supposed to make them happy, 


13:08.737 --> 13:12.000
another obstacle looms up 
and they’re discontent again. 


13:13.675 --> 13:18.447
Paul chose to be content, 
despite his circumstances. 


13:18.447 --> 13:22.184
And notice, he says in verse 11: 
“I have learned” this. 


13:22.183 --> 13:26.288
Contentment might not have been 
his default position. 


13:26.288 --> 13:28.290
Perhaps like many of us, 


13:28.290 --> 13:32.293
Paul had a tendency 
to veer towards negativity 


13:32.293 --> 13:35.130
when confronted with a trial. 


13:35.130 --> 13:38.300
But Paul learned to be content 


13:38.300 --> 13:41.603
even when his repeated prayers for relief 


13:41.603 --> 13:44.240
were not answered 
the way he would have liked. 


13:44.240 --> 13:47.643
In fact, we could summarize 
the lesson Paul learned this way: 


13:47.643 --> 13:50.880
Don’t let the blessing you’re praying for 


13:50.880 --> 13:55.000
blind you to the compensations 
and mercies you have. 


13:56.152 --> 13:58.820
You know, sometimes 
when we’re going through a trial, 


13:58.820 --> 14:02.257
we tend to narrow the focus 
of our prayers by, in effect, 


14:02.257 --> 14:05.394
telling Jehovah how we expect to be blessed. 


14:05.393 --> 14:10.031
And yet, Jehovah may already be giving us 


14:10.032 --> 14:14.002
compensations and mercies 
that we haven’t considered. 


14:14.002 --> 14:18.374
That’s what Anny, the sister 
with pulmonary fibrosis, came to learn. 


14:18.373 --> 14:20.375
Remember how she said, 


14:20.375 --> 14:22.510
“I prayed and prayed and prayed, 


14:22.510 --> 14:26.315
but it felt like I was just talking 
to the wall”? 


14:26.315 --> 14:30.920
Anny also admits, 
“At first, I was even mad at Jehovah 


14:30.920 --> 14:34.723
for not helping me 
in the way I wanted to be helped.” 


14:34.723 --> 14:38.826
How did Anny come to see 
compensations and mercies 


14:38.827 --> 14:40.897
even in the midst of a serious illness? 


14:40.897 --> 14:43.165
Here’s what she says: 


14:43.165 --> 14:46.368
“My dad opened my eyes. 


14:46.368 --> 14:48.570
“While I was so upset at Jehovah, 


14:48.570 --> 14:52.140
“my dad wouldn’t stop 
praying to him and thanking him 


14:52.140 --> 14:55.643
“and talking about 
how good Jehovah had been to me. 


14:55.643 --> 14:58.880
“I had just been through 
the worst months of my life, 


14:58.880 --> 15:00.882
“and my dad was thanking Jehovah. 


15:00.882 --> 15:02.885
“‘For what?’ I asked him. 


15:02.885 --> 15:04.887
“He told me: 


15:04.887 --> 15:08.190
“‘You have no idea 
how expensive your medicine was, 


15:08.190 --> 15:10.858
“‘and I wasn’t even working. 


15:10.858 --> 15:13.828
“‘Somehow we managed 
to get everything we needed. 


15:13.828 --> 15:15.830
“‘There was always food in the house. 


15:15.830 --> 15:18.733
“‘Brothers kept coming 
to make sure we were eating. 


15:18.733 --> 15:23.371
Jehovah gave us the strength 
to keep going and not give up.’” 


15:23.372 --> 15:26.442
And then Anny’s dad told her this: 


15:26.442 --> 15:31.214
“Just because Jehovah didn’t help you 
the way you wanted to be helped 


15:31.213 --> 15:33.615
doesn’t mean he didn’t do it.” 


15:33.615 --> 15:36.052
In essence, her dad was saying, 


15:36.052 --> 15:38.887
‘Don’t let the blessing you’re praying for 


15:38.887 --> 15:43.359
blind you to the compensations 
and mercies you have.’ 


15:43.358 --> 15:45.426
Anny now says: 


15:45.427 --> 15:48.430
“Jehovah helps us 
in ways we can’t see at first 


15:48.430 --> 15:52.033
“because we’re so overwhelmed 
by what we’re going through. 


15:52.033 --> 15:55.770
“But I’ve learned that Jehovah 
has a way of doing things, 


15:55.770 --> 16:00.775
and his way is always better than my way.” 


16:00.775 --> 16:03.845
We can adopt a similar viewpoint. 


16:03.845 --> 16:08.217
If we can see the compensations 
and mercies in our situation, 


16:08.217 --> 16:11.554
then we’ll be better able 
to cope with a circumstance 


16:11.553 --> 16:15.223
that has become a plague of our heart.


16:15.223 --> 16:17.225
So to review: 


16:17.225 --> 16:20.328
How can the apostle Paul’s example 
lighten our load 


16:20.328 --> 16:23.498
when a discouraging circumstance 
is weighing us down? 


16:23.498 --> 16:26.835
First, accept the reality of the situation. 


16:26.835 --> 16:30.838
That may open our minds 
to practical ways to deal with it. 


16:30.838 --> 16:34.876
Second, look for compensations and mercies. 


16:34.877 --> 16:37.179
Don’t let the blessing you’re praying for 


16:37.178 --> 16:39.981
blind you to the blessings you have. 


16:39.982 --> 16:42.985
Those two suggestions can help us cope 


16:42.985 --> 16:45.220
with a discouraging circumstance 


16:45.220 --> 16:48.000
that has become a plague of our heart. 


16:50.325 --> 16:53.162
Now let’s move on to our second point: 


16:53.162 --> 16:57.967
when people upset us. 


16:57.967 --> 17:02.972
A sister we’ll call Helen 
has been pioneering for six years. 


17:02.972 --> 17:06.409
She serves as a construction volunteer. 


17:06.408 --> 17:10.445
She helped out for an extended period 
on the Warwick project. 


17:10.445 --> 17:15.217
Needless to say, 
Helen has been around a lot of people 


17:15.217 --> 17:18.354
—Jehovah’s people—
and that’s a blessing. 


17:18.353 --> 17:21.990
But Helen admits that at times 
it’s also been a test. 


17:21.990 --> 17:23.992
Why? 


17:23.992 --> 17:26.795
She says: 
“One of my greatest weaknesses 


17:26.795 --> 17:29.665
“is a critical eye toward others. 


17:29.665 --> 17:33.435
“Rarely do I have 
a good first impression of a person; 


17:33.435 --> 17:36.638
“it’s always tainted 
by some negative observation. 


17:36.638 --> 17:40.508
“At first, even the best of people 
seem too quick to laugh, 


17:40.508 --> 17:43.478
“too popular, even too spiritual. 


17:43.478 --> 17:47.081
It’s a terrible, ugly weakness I have.” 


17:47.082 --> 17:50.719
Now, perhaps we can relate 
to Helen’s comment. 


17:50.718 --> 17:54.590
We might tend to get annoyed 
or even hold a grudge 


17:54.590 --> 17:57.860
when someone says or does the wrong thing. 


17:57.860 --> 18:01.197
And we think that tendency will change 
when we come to Bethel, right? 


18:01.197 --> 18:04.667
‘Finally, I’ll be around people 
who are easy to get along with.’ 


18:04.667 --> 18:07.069
And then at some point 


18:07.068 --> 18:09.771
—whether it’s after a few months 
or a few minutes—


18:09.772 --> 18:12.942
the bubble bursts, 
and now we’re not sure 


18:12.942 --> 18:17.000
whether the brotherhood is a blessing 
from Jehovah or a test from Satan. 


18:18.513 --> 18:22.951
How can we cope with that 
when people upset us? 


18:22.952 --> 18:25.720
Well, let’s look at Romans 12:18. 


18:25.720 --> 18:30.225
And as we read Romans 12:18, 
try to detect two things: 


18:30.225 --> 18:33.762
(1) what we can’t control 


18:33.762 --> 18:36.899
and (2) what we can control. 


18:36.898 --> 18:39.768
Romans 12:18 says: 


18:39.768 --> 18:44.773
“If possible, as far as it depends on you, 


18:44.773 --> 18:47.208
be peaceable with all men.” 


18:47.208 --> 18:49.645
Now let’s look at our two components. 


18:49.645 --> 18:52.580
First, what can’t we control? 


18:52.580 --> 18:55.150
What others say or do; 


18:55.150 --> 18:58.153
that part depends on them. 


18:58.153 --> 19:00.655
What can we control? 


19:00.655 --> 19:04.960
Again, it’s our response 
—that is a choice. 


19:04.960 --> 19:08.730
When someone upsets us, 
we can choose to let it grow 


19:08.730 --> 19:10.798
or we can choose to let it go. 


19:10.798 --> 19:13.635
We can choose to “be peaceable with all men.” 


19:13.635 --> 19:17.172
That part, Romans 12:18 says, 


19:17.172 --> 19:20.309
depends on each one of us. 


19:20.308 --> 19:23.945
So how can we choose to be peaceable 


19:23.945 --> 19:25.947
when someone upsets us? 


19:25.947 --> 19:27.950
Well, let’s look at Judges 8:2. 


19:27.950 --> 19:31.320
This shows us one thing we can do, 
Judges 8:2. 


19:31.320 --> 19:33.388
Here Gideon avoided 


19:33.388 --> 19:36.725
what could have turned out 
to be a messy conflict. 


19:36.725 --> 19:38.727
You remember the story. 


19:38.727 --> 19:42.865
Gideon and his army 
had just won a battle against Midian. 


19:42.865 --> 19:47.768
And at that point, 
the tribe of Ephraim starts complaining. 


19:47.768 --> 19:50.805
Now, even though they 
were eventually called into the battle 


19:50.805 --> 19:54.508
and even though they captured 
two Midianite princes, 


19:54.508 --> 19:58.746
the Ephraimites felt that they 
should have been called in sooner 


19:58.747 --> 20:00.749
and they blamed this all on Gideon. 


20:00.748 --> 20:04.586
Judges 8:1 says that “they quarreled 
bitterly with him” about this. 


20:04.587 --> 20:06.955
So now there’s a conflict. 


20:06.955 --> 20:08.957
How did Gideon handle it? 


20:08.957 --> 20:13.262
Notice what he says 
to the tribe of Ephraim at Judges 8:2: 


20:13.262 --> 20:17.365
“What have I done compared with you? 


20:17.365 --> 20:22.370
Are not the gleanings of Ephraim 
better than the grape harvest of Abiezer?” 


20:22.370 --> 20:25.707
What does that last question mean? 


20:25.707 --> 20:29.144
Well, Gideon was from the family of Abiezer. 


20:29.143 --> 20:33.415
So, what he’s saying to the Ephraimites is: 


20:33.415 --> 20:36.752
‘The grapes that your tribe leaves behind 


20:36.752 --> 20:40.655
are better than the best grapes 
my family can grow.’ 


20:40.655 --> 20:42.723
And then he reminds the Ephraimites 


20:42.723 --> 20:44.760
that they had an important role 
in the battle, 


20:44.760 --> 20:46.762
and again he asks them: 


20:46.762 --> 20:48.964
“What have I done compared with you?” 


20:48.963 --> 20:53.000
Verse 3 says that after that 
the Ephraimites “calmed down.” 


20:54.535 --> 20:57.372
Problem solved—and how? 


20:57.372 --> 20:59.374
What did Gideon do here? 


20:59.373 --> 21:01.776
In the face of a conflict 
with the Ephraimites, 


21:01.777 --> 21:03.779
he did not put them down. 


21:03.778 --> 21:05.313
He raised them up. 


21:05.313 --> 21:07.315
He found something good about them 


21:07.315 --> 21:12.853
—in this case, their grape harvest, 
something totally unrelated to the conflict—


21:12.853 --> 21:17.925
and for the sake of peace, 
he praised them for it. 


21:17.925 --> 21:21.028
Now, we can take a similar approach. 


21:21.028 --> 21:25.766
When someone upsets us, 
look for the “grape harvest.” 


21:25.767 --> 21:27.769
Even if it’s just to ourselves, 


21:27.768 --> 21:30.438
we can find something good 
about the person, 


21:30.438 --> 21:34.743
perhaps something totally unrelated 
to the conflict we’re having. 


21:34.743 --> 21:39.748
Now, that’s what Helen, 
the sister I quoted earlier, is trying to do. 


21:39.748 --> 21:44.185
She says: “For every bad thought 
I have toward a person, 


21:44.185 --> 21:47.622
“I try to make myself 
find something good about them. 


21:47.622 --> 21:50.359
“When I take that step back, 


21:50.358 --> 21:55.363
it’s easier for me to get to know a person 
from a loving standpoint.” 


21:55.363 --> 21:57.798
We can do the same thing. 


21:57.798 --> 22:00.335
When someone upsets us, 
take that step back; 


22:00.335 --> 22:02.337
look for the “grape harvest.” 


22:02.337 --> 22:04.372
Find the good in that person. 


22:04.372 --> 22:06.609
That’s the first thing we can do. 


22:06.608 --> 22:10.345
Now, a second thing we can do 
is identified in Galatians chapter 2. 


22:10.345 --> 22:12.147
Let’s look at that. 


22:12.147 --> 22:14.984
And before we read from this chapter, 
Galatians 2, 


22:14.983 --> 22:17.318
consider this question: 


22:17.318 --> 22:21.823
Who are we most likely to get upset at? 


22:21.823 --> 22:25.126
Probably someone who wrongs us, 
wouldn’t you think? 


22:25.127 --> 22:27.229
But you know, there’s one type of person 


22:27.228 --> 22:29.931
we might be even more prone to get upset at. 


22:29.932 --> 22:31.634
You know who it is? 


22:31.633 --> 22:33.868
Not someone who wrongs us,


22:33.868 --> 22:38.440
but someone who “rights” us 
by giving us correction when we need it. 


22:38.440 --> 22:41.510
And in Galatians 2, 
we’re going to see an example of that. 


22:41.510 --> 22:45.513
Here Peter was given correction, 
and he needed it. 


22:45.513 --> 22:48.483
But notice how the correction was given, 


22:48.483 --> 22:50.818
and then we’ll see why, in this case, 


22:50.818 --> 22:54.890
it might have been exceptionally hard 
for Peter to accept it. 


22:54.890 --> 22:59.000
At Galatians 2:11, 


23:00.428 --> 23:04.531
Paul writes: “However, when Cephas 
[that’s Peter] came to Antioch, 


23:04.532 --> 23:06.535
“I resisted him face-to-face, 


23:06.535 --> 23:09.503
because he was clearly in the wrong.” 


23:09.503 --> 23:12.206
Paul is upset at Peter, and why? 


23:12.207 --> 23:14.209
In verse 12, he tells us: 


23:14.208 --> 23:18.313
“For before certain men from James arrived 
[those who were Jewish Christians], 


23:18.313 --> 23:21.416
“[Peter] used to eat 
with people of the nations; 


23:21.417 --> 23:25.187
“but when they arrived, he stopped doing this 
and separated himself, 


23:25.187 --> 23:28.257
fearing those of the circumcised class.” 


23:28.257 --> 23:30.625
Now, what’s Paul saying here? 


23:30.625 --> 23:34.997
That Peter would change how he acted 
depending on who was watching, 


23:34.997 --> 23:36.999
and Paul called him out on this. 


23:36.998 --> 23:39.633
He says: “I resisted [Peter] face-to-face.” 


23:39.633 --> 23:42.403
And then in verse 14, 
Paul really gives it to Peter. 


23:42.403 --> 23:44.105
He tells him straight out: 


23:44.105 --> 23:46.775
‘You act one way 
when the Jewish Christians are watching 


23:46.775 --> 23:49.010
and another way 
when their backs are turned.’ 


23:49.010 --> 23:52.647
In verse 13, Paul calls this a “pretense,” 


23:52.647 --> 23:57.000
or as the footnote renders it “hypocrisy.” 


23:58.220 --> 24:03.125
Imagine: Paul is calling Peter a hypocrite. 


24:03.125 --> 24:07.928
And he does this not privately 
but “before them all,” verse 14 says. 


24:07.928 --> 24:09.931
Can this get any worse? 


24:09.932 --> 24:12.767
Yes, and it did. 


24:12.767 --> 24:16.972
Under inspiration, 
Paul wrote about this incident 


24:16.972 --> 24:20.742
in his letter to the Galatians, 
which we just read from. 


24:20.742 --> 24:23.212
Now, to make a comparison: 


24:23.212 --> 24:28.150
Today, Internet messages spread 
from one person to the next. 


24:28.150 --> 24:33.053
And when a message 
circulates rapidly and widely, 


24:33.053 --> 24:35.823
people say it went viral. 


24:35.823 --> 24:38.926
Now, they didn’t have the Internet 
in the first century, of course, 


24:38.927 --> 24:43.332
but they did have letters 
—and letters circulated. 


24:43.332 --> 24:45.834
And this one, Galatians, 


24:45.833 --> 24:48.603
did more than just circulate 
from one person to the next 


24:48.603 --> 24:50.871
or even one congregation to the next. 


24:50.872 --> 24:54.675
No, under Jehovah’s supervision, 
this one ended up in the Bible 


24:54.675 --> 24:58.580
—billions of copies down 
through the centuries still being printed, 


24:58.580 --> 25:00.915
translated into thousands of languages. 


25:00.915 --> 25:04.000
Now the whole world can read 
about Peter’s hypocrisy, as we just did. 


25:06.955 --> 25:11.225
Now, the Bible doesn’t tell us 
Peter’s immediate reaction. 


25:11.225 --> 25:15.030
Initially, he may have been upset 
at Paul, for all we know. 


25:15.030 --> 25:17.032
But in the end, 


25:17.032 --> 25:19.034
Peter chose to be peaceable. 


25:19.033 --> 25:21.035
How do we know that? 


25:21.035 --> 25:25.507
Well, in his second letter, 
which was written about 12 to 14 years later, 


25:25.507 --> 25:29.277
Peter called Paul “our beloved brother,” 


25:29.277 --> 25:32.414
and he even said 
that Paul had God-given wisdom. 


25:32.413 --> 25:35.583
That’s at 2 Peter 3:15. 


25:35.583 --> 25:37.685
So in the end, 


25:37.685 --> 25:40.088
Peter looked up to Paul, 
and for good reason. 


25:40.088 --> 25:44.591
As he acknowledged, 
Paul had God-given wisdom 


25:44.592 --> 25:48.597
to see not only into Scripture 
but also into people. 


25:48.597 --> 25:51.600
He could even see into Peter. 


25:51.600 --> 25:54.702
And instead of viewing that as a threat, 


25:54.702 --> 25:57.072
Peter saw it as a benefit. 


25:57.072 --> 26:00.000
And that’s because he chose to be peaceable. 


26:01.342 --> 26:03.345
Now, you and I can do the same. 


26:03.345 --> 26:05.347
In fact, we need to. 


26:05.347 --> 26:07.349
Why? 


26:07.348 --> 26:11.385
Because from time to time 
each one of us will encounter a “Paul” 


26:11.385 --> 26:15.357
—someone who gives us correction 
that we need to hear, 


26:15.357 --> 26:17.725
but it comes to us in blunt terms, 


26:17.725 --> 26:21.730
perhaps at a most inappropriate time, 
and it stings. 


26:21.730 --> 26:23.965
And sometimes the counsel 
that stings the most 


26:23.965 --> 26:26.902
is also the counsel we need the most. 


26:26.902 --> 26:31.907
If, like Peter, we choose to be peaceable, 
we’ll be able to take it 


26:31.907 --> 26:36.377
not only when someone wrongs us 
but also when someone “rights” us 


26:36.377 --> 26:39.914
by giving us needed correction. 


26:39.913 --> 26:42.783
Let’s be honest, though, 
it’s tough to do that. 


26:42.783 --> 26:46.586
We can be so hypersensitive at times, 
and no wonder. 


26:46.587 --> 26:50.625
We live in a world where it’s just common 


26:50.625 --> 26:53.260
to blame someone else for our mistakes. 


26:53.260 --> 26:55.463
If someone breaks something, 


26:55.463 --> 26:58.800
it’s the manufacturer’s fault 
for not making it unbreakable. 


26:58.800 --> 27:01.002
A speeding ticket 
—that’s the policeman’s fault 


27:01.002 --> 27:03.004
because he had to meet a quota. 


27:03.003 --> 27:05.706
If a child fails English, 
it’s the teacher’s fault 


27:05.707 --> 27:09.877
for not teaching English 
good enough, or well enough. 


27:09.877 --> 27:14.482
In this world, 
correction is largely viewed as an insult, 


27:14.482 --> 27:16.484
not as a teaching tool. 


27:16.483 --> 27:20.188
But God’s Word 
does not support the world’s view. 


27:20.188 --> 27:25.060
The Bible tells us of people 
that stayed in or went out of God’s favor 


27:25.060 --> 27:29.130
depending on how they responded to counsel. 


27:29.130 --> 27:33.067
So if we choose to remain bitter 
at the person who corrected us, 


27:33.067 --> 27:35.070
we need to remember this: 


27:35.070 --> 27:37.138
We are letting our upset emotions 


27:37.138 --> 27:40.775
have far too much power over us. 


27:40.775 --> 27:45.680
Resentment is heavy baggage 
that will only add to our load 


27:45.680 --> 27:50.018
on our journey to God’s new world, 
and who needs that? 


27:50.018 --> 27:53.388
Instead, we need to be peaceable, 


27:53.388 --> 27:55.390
not only when we’re wronged 


27:55.390 --> 27:59.327
but also when we’re righted 
through correction. 


27:59.327 --> 28:01.329
So to review: 


28:01.328 --> 28:04.198
How can we lighten our load 
when someone upsets us? 


28:04.198 --> 28:07.968
First, like Gideon, 
look for the “grape harvest” 


28:07.968 --> 28:10.471
—find something good about the person. 


28:10.472 --> 28:14.742
Second, like Peter, 
be willing to accept correction 


28:14.742 --> 28:18.045
regardless of the manner in which it’s given. 


28:18.045 --> 28:24.000
Those two suggestions 
can lighten our load when people upset us.


28:25.587 --> 28:28.322
Now, let’s move 
on to our third and final point: 


28:28.322 --> 28:32.000
when negative emotions overwhelm us. 


28:33.628 --> 28:35.630
As imperfect humans, 


28:35.630 --> 28:40.202
we are prone to have 
a distorted view of ourselves. 


28:40.202 --> 28:44.105
A few might ‘think more 
of themselves than necessary,’ 


28:44.105 --> 28:47.108
as Romans 12:3 says. 


28:47.108 --> 28:49.676
But others have the opposite problem 


28:49.677 --> 28:52.847
—thinking too little of themselves, 


28:52.847 --> 28:56.617
plagued with feelings of worthlessness. 


28:56.617 --> 28:59.487
When they look at themselves, 
what they see 


28:59.487 --> 29:03.090
is a gross misrepresentation of reality, 


29:03.090 --> 29:07.662
as if viewing themselves 
in a distorted fun house mirror. 


29:07.662 --> 29:09.730
For example, one Witness 


29:09.730 --> 29:14.735
quoted in the September 15, 2014, 
Watchtower said this: 


29:14.735 --> 29:18.405
“When I think 
about everything I’ve done wrong, 


29:18.405 --> 29:20.775
“it can make me feel as if there’s no way 


29:20.775 --> 29:25.147
anyone can ever love me, not even Jehovah.” 


29:25.147 --> 29:29.384
Another, quoted 
in the January 2006, Awake! said this: 


29:29.383 --> 29:33.153
“I knew that Jehovah 
had forgiven me for my mistakes, 


29:33.153 --> 29:35.390
“but I did not want him to. 


29:35.390 --> 29:39.693
“I wanted to suffer 
because I hated myself so much. 


29:39.693 --> 29:42.663
“While I knew that Jehovah 
could never have conceived 


29:42.663 --> 29:45.433
“of a place . . . like Christendom’s hell, 


29:45.433 --> 29:49.000
I wanted him to invent one just for me.” 


29:51.438 --> 29:55.143
Now, as these examples illustrate, 
our emotions 


29:55.143 --> 30:00.881
—which ironically Jehovah created 
to enhance our love and our worship—


30:00.882 --> 30:05.887
can sometimes turn against us 
and make us feel condemned. 


30:05.887 --> 30:09.624
And that does more than just hinder our joy; 


30:09.623 --> 30:13.326
it also hinders our ability 
to give Jehovah full glory 


30:13.327 --> 30:16.230
for the magnitude of his love. 


30:16.230 --> 30:20.435
So how can we cope with negative emotions 


30:20.435 --> 30:22.503
that at times overwhelm us? 


30:22.503 --> 30:27.408
Well, let’s look at Romans 7:22-25. 


30:27.408 --> 30:31.078
Now, here the apostle Paul 
describes negative emotions 


30:31.078 --> 30:33.080
that at times overwhelmed him. 


30:33.080 --> 30:36.417
And as we read these verses, 
try to detect two things: 


30:36.417 --> 30:39.220
(1) what Paul could not control 


30:39.220 --> 30:42.290
and (2) what he could control. 


30:42.290 --> 30:45.993
Romans 7, beginning with verse 22: 


30:45.993 --> 30:50.998
“I really delight in the law of God 
according to the man I am within, 


30:50.998 --> 30:55.903
“but I see in my body another law 
warring against the law of my mind 


30:55.903 --> 30:59.873
“and leading me captive 
to sin’s law that is in my body. 


30:59.873 --> 31:02.376
“Miserable man that I am! 


31:02.377 --> 31:06.347
“Who will rescue me 
from the body undergoing this death? 


31:06.347 --> 31:10.000
Thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!”


31:11.552 --> 31:13.955
Now, let’s identify our two components. 


31:13.955 --> 31:17.392
First, what couldn’t Paul control? 


31:17.392 --> 31:20.027
Occasional feelings of self-doubt 


31:20.027 --> 31:23.130
which Paul said made him feel miserable. 


31:23.130 --> 31:25.132
What could he control? 


31:25.132 --> 31:27.635
Once again, it’s his response. 


31:27.635 --> 31:30.905
And Paul’s response 
is right there in verse 25: 


31:30.905 --> 31:34.242
“Thanks to God 
through Jesus Christ our Lord!” 


31:34.242 --> 31:36.410
Here Paul gives us the first key 


31:36.410 --> 31:38.913
to coping with negative emotions: 


31:38.913 --> 31:42.016
meditate on the ransom. 


31:42.017 --> 31:45.654
Make it a personal study project 
if necessary. 


31:45.653 --> 31:49.790
Collect scriptures from the Bible 
and material from our publications 


31:49.790 --> 31:54.062
that build up appreciation 
for what Jesus’ death means 


31:54.062 --> 31:57.232
not just to the world of mankind in general 


31:57.232 --> 32:01.569
but to each one of us as an individual. 


32:01.568 --> 32:05.873
Meditating on the ransom 
can help us cope with negative emotions, 


32:05.873 --> 32:07.875
and why? 


32:07.875 --> 32:12.413
Because as the April 1, 1995, 
Watchtower says: 


32:12.413 --> 32:17.418
“Christ’s ransom sacrifice 
is the most potent answer 


32:17.418 --> 32:22.356
to the satanic lie 
that we are worthless or unlovable.” 


32:22.357 --> 32:24.625
Let’s think about that statement. 


32:24.625 --> 32:28.562
Why does it call the idea 
that we are worthless or unlovable 


32:28.562 --> 32:33.567
not just a lie but a “satanic lie”? 


32:33.567 --> 32:38.000
Well, who really profits when we believe 
that we’re unlovable to Jehovah? 


32:39.207 --> 32:44.579
Who really benefits when we wallow 
in thoughts of self-condemnation? 


32:44.578 --> 32:46.913
Whose purpose is really served 


32:46.913 --> 32:48.916
when our emotions plague us 


32:48.917 --> 32:51.000
to the extent that we feel like giving up? 


32:52.320 --> 32:55.188
Obviously, it’s Satan. 


32:55.188 --> 32:58.191
And consider the irony of that. 


32:58.192 --> 33:02.364
Who really has proved himself 
unworthy of Jehovah’s love? 


33:02.363 --> 33:03.865
Him! 


33:03.865 --> 33:06.567
Who really is beyond Jehovah’s forgiveness? 


33:06.567 --> 33:08.069
Him! 


33:08.068 --> 33:11.305
Who really does the ransom not apply to? 


33:11.305 --> 33:13.742
Him! 


33:13.742 --> 33:18.747
And yet now, 
in one of his greatest “crafty acts,” 


33:18.747 --> 33:21.082
as Ephesians 6:11 calls it, 


33:21.082 --> 33:25.252
Satan tries to throw 
all those feelings of condemnation 


33:25.252 --> 33:29.000
that he deserves on you and on me. 


33:30.992 --> 33:34.029
The ransom gives us permission 


33:34.028 --> 33:37.331
to throw off that heavy baggage. 


33:37.332 --> 33:40.100
Evidently, that’s what Paul did. 


33:40.100 --> 33:44.938
Yes, at times 
he felt miserable about himself, 


33:44.938 --> 33:47.808
as we read at Romans 7:24. 


33:47.808 --> 33:50.276
But he also wrote at Galatians 2:20: 


33:50.277 --> 33:52.614
“I live by faith in the Son of God, 


33:52.613 --> 33:56.716
who loved me 
and handed himself over for me.” 


33:56.717 --> 33:59.887
Now, in stating that, 
Paul wasn’t being egotistical 


33:59.887 --> 34:03.057
or thinking more of himself than necessary. 


34:03.057 --> 34:06.727
He simply understood 
a basic Scriptural truth 


34:06.727 --> 34:11.632
—that Christ died for sinners, 
not for perfect people. 


34:11.632 --> 34:16.270
The fact that Paul was so keenly aware 
of his imperfections was evidence 


34:16.270 --> 34:22.543
that he was the very kind of person 
that Jesus gave his life for. 


34:22.543 --> 34:27.548
The ransom helped Paul 
refute any feelings of self-doubt, 


34:27.548 --> 34:29.950
and it can do the same for us. 


34:29.950 --> 34:32.953
Again, the April 1, 1995, Watchtower 


34:32.953 --> 34:35.623
expresses that thought beautifully. 


34:35.623 --> 34:39.593
It says: “If life in this system 
has taught you to see yourself 


34:39.593 --> 34:41.895
“as an obstacle too daunting 


34:41.895 --> 34:44.965
“even for God’s immense love to surmount, 


34:44.965 --> 34:47.435
“. . . or your sins as too vast 


34:47.435 --> 34:50.872
“even for the death 
of his precious Son to cover, 


34:50.872 --> 34:53.740
“you have been taught a lie. 


34:53.740 --> 34:58.345
Reject such lies 
with all the repugnance that they deserve!” 


34:58.345 --> 35:01.082
Isn’t that what we do 
with all of Satan’s other lies? 


35:01.082 --> 35:04.719
Do we accept the doctrine of the Trinity? No! 


35:04.718 --> 35:07.086
Do we believe in hellfire? No! 


35:07.087 --> 35:10.559
Do we believe that life evolved? No! 


35:10.558 --> 35:14.528
Do we believe that we are unlovable 


35:14.528 --> 35:17.898
and worthless to Jehovah? 


35:17.898 --> 35:22.068
Our answer to that question should be no, 


35:22.068 --> 35:25.873
and it should be just as decisive 
as our no to the other questions. 


35:25.873 --> 35:27.073
And why? 


35:27.073 --> 35:29.910
Because the idea that we are worthless 


35:29.910 --> 35:34.715
or unlovable to Jehovah is a false doctrine, 


35:34.715 --> 35:38.820
and we need to reject it just as firmly 


35:38.820 --> 35:44.000
as we would reject 
any of Satan’s other God-dishonoring lies. 


35:45.225 --> 35:49.130
Meditating on the ransom can help us do that. 


35:49.130 --> 35:51.465
But besides meditating on the ransom, 


35:51.465 --> 35:54.602
there’s something else we can do 
to cope with negative emotions. 


35:54.602 --> 35:58.605
Let’s look at Psalm 61:2. 


35:58.605 --> 36:01.342
What David prayed for 
in this verse presents us 


36:01.342 --> 36:04.645
with another key to dealing 
with negative emotions, 


36:04.645 --> 36:07.415
including feelings of worthlessness. 


36:07.415 --> 36:11.718
At Psalm 61:2, 


36:11.718 --> 36:13.720
David says to Jehovah: 


36:13.720 --> 36:16.590
“From the ends of the earth 
I will cry out to you 


36:16.590 --> 36:19.060
“when my heart is in despair. 


36:19.060 --> 36:24.065
Lead me onto a rock 
that is higher than I am.” 


36:24.065 --> 36:28.202
Here, David is asking Jehovah 
for a different view, 


36:28.202 --> 36:30.204
an elevated one. 


36:30.203 --> 36:32.206
And that’s what we need 


36:32.207 --> 36:34.575
when negative emotions plague us. 


36:34.575 --> 36:38.245
As David wrote, 
we need to be placed on a rock 


36:38.245 --> 36:40.247
that is higher than ourselves, 


36:40.247 --> 36:44.952
higher than our imperfect 
and distorted reasoning. 


36:44.952 --> 36:48.489
Now, Scriptural truths 
can help us do that. 


36:48.488 --> 36:50.490
For example, 


36:50.490 --> 36:54.362
when the heart is in despair, 
as David wrote, 


36:54.362 --> 36:59.067
we may feel that no one can love us, 
not even Jehovah. 


36:59.067 --> 37:02.537
But the elevated view from the rock 
reveals a Scriptural truth 


37:02.537 --> 37:04.672
—Romans 8:38, 39—


37:04.672 --> 37:08.509
nothing can “separate us from God’s love.” 


37:08.508 --> 37:11.445
When the heart is in despair, 


37:11.445 --> 37:16.250
we feel that our mistakes 
are too great for Jehovah to forgive. 


37:16.250 --> 37:18.318
But the elevated view from the rock 


37:18.318 --> 37:21.155
reveals a Scriptural truth—Romans 5:8: 


37:21.155 --> 37:24.758
“While we were yet sinners, 
Christ died for us.” 


37:24.758 --> 37:27.226
As we mentioned before, 
Jesus died for sinners, 


37:27.227 --> 37:29.964
not for perfect people. 


37:29.963 --> 37:32.366
When the heart is in despair, 


37:32.367 --> 37:35.269
we can’t picture ourselves in Paradise 


37:35.268 --> 37:39.000
because in our heart we feel condemned. 


37:40.842 --> 37:44.345
But the elevated view from the rock 
reveals a Scriptural truth 


37:44.345 --> 37:46.347
—1 John 3:20: 


37:46.347 --> 37:50.919
“God is greater than our hearts 
and [he] knows all things,” 


37:50.918 --> 37:54.188
including the reasons why we tend to think 


37:54.188 --> 37:56.623
so negatively of ourselves. 


37:56.623 --> 38:01.395
The point is: Gradually we can replace 


38:01.395 --> 38:03.497
lowly negative thoughts 


38:03.497 --> 38:06.467
with elevated Scriptural truths. 


38:06.467 --> 38:08.769
Now, we just mentioned three of those truths. 


38:08.768 --> 38:09.836
Here’s one more. 


38:09.837 --> 38:12.774
Let’s look at Malachi 3:17. 


38:12.773 --> 38:14.775
Now, in its application, 


38:14.775 --> 38:18.178
Malachi 3 is talking 
about Jehovah’s spiritual temple. 


38:18.178 --> 38:21.548
But in principle, this verse 
shows us the high value 


38:21.548 --> 38:24.985
that Jehovah places on his people. 


38:24.985 --> 38:27.955
Malachi 3:17 says: 


38:27.955 --> 38:31.692
“‘And they will be mine,’ 
says Jehovah of armies, 


38:31.692 --> 38:35.495
‘in the day 
when I produce a special property’” 


38:35.495 --> 38:40.100
or, as the footnote renders it, 
“a treasured possession.” 


38:40.100 --> 38:42.102
Let’s stop there. 


38:42.102 --> 38:46.440
Notice how proudly 
Jehovah talks about his people. 


38:46.440 --> 38:49.343
He says: “They will be mine.” 


38:49.343 --> 38:53.446
He even calls his people 
“a special property.” 


38:53.447 --> 38:56.517
And make no mistake, 
that term isn’t thrown into the Bible 


38:56.517 --> 39:00.420
just to make us feel good 
or to give us empty praise. 


39:00.420 --> 39:03.957
No, Jehovah’s people are special to him. 


39:03.957 --> 39:05.960
And why? 


39:05.960 --> 39:08.695
Because he produced 
this property that we just read. 


39:08.695 --> 39:11.865
In other words, 
Jehovah is cultivating in each one of us 


39:11.865 --> 39:15.000
the very spiritual qualities 
that make us special to him. 


39:17.103 --> 39:22.108
So again, going back to Psalm 61:2, 
when the “heart is in despair,” 


39:22.108 --> 39:26.980
as David wrote, we may only see 
our failings and imperfections. 


39:26.980 --> 39:30.350
But the elevated view from the rock 
reveals a Scriptural truth 


39:30.350 --> 39:32.352
—Malachi 3:17—


39:32.352 --> 39:37.000
we are “a special property” to Jehovah 
despite our flaws. 


39:38.225 --> 39:42.797
And if it’s difficult for us to accept that, 
then we need to remember 


39:42.797 --> 39:45.332
that Jehovah is the one 
who sets the standard 


39:45.332 --> 39:49.104
for what’s special here, not us.


39:49.103 --> 39:54.108
One sister who had 
an extremely negative view of herself 


39:54.108 --> 39:56.276
was helped to reason on that. 


39:56.277 --> 39:58.845
She says: 
“A spiritually mature sister helped me 


39:58.845 --> 40:02.450
“to look at myself realistically 
as an imperfect human 


40:02.450 --> 40:04.518
“with strengths and weaknesses, 


40:04.518 --> 40:07.186
“no better or worse 
than any other brother or sister 


40:07.187 --> 40:09.490
“struggling with imperfection. 


40:09.490 --> 40:11.658
“An elder greatly helped me too 


40:11.658 --> 40:14.628
“by telling me 
that no one comes to Jehovah 


40:14.628 --> 40:18.365
“without being drawn by His spirit 
(that’s John 6:44). 


40:18.365 --> 40:21.902
“So Jehovah must see 
something lovable in me, 


40:21.902 --> 40:26.274
and who was I 
to despise what Jehovah loves?” 


40:26.273 --> 40:29.710
And notice how this sister 
is slowly moving away 


40:29.710 --> 40:33.347
from that distorted mirror 
and coming to see herself 


40:33.347 --> 40:35.349
the way Jehovah does. 


40:35.348 --> 40:37.350
We can do the same. 


40:37.350 --> 40:39.853
Is it easy? Absolutely not. 


40:39.853 --> 40:41.855
Second Corinthians 10:4 


40:41.855 --> 40:45.258
talks about “strongly entrenched things” 
that we need to overturn, 


40:45.258 --> 40:48.595
and it lists “reasonings” 
as one of those things. 


40:48.595 --> 40:52.833
Now, that could include 
our imperfect and distorted reasoning 


40:52.833 --> 40:55.168
about our value to Jehovah. 


40:55.168 --> 40:58.505
That reasoning might be 
so strongly entrenched 


40:58.505 --> 41:02.075
that we need 
to keep praying about it, keep studying, 


41:02.075 --> 41:06.213
(or as we mentioned earlier) 
keep meditating on the ransom. 


41:06.213 --> 41:10.150
But as we gradually replace 
lowly negative emotions 


41:10.150 --> 41:12.720
with elevated Scriptural truths, 


41:12.720 --> 41:16.723
we’ll be better able to move away 
from that distorted mirror 


41:16.723 --> 41:19.000
and see ourselves the way Jehovah does.


41:21.628 --> 41:23.630
So to review: 


41:23.630 --> 41:26.000
How can we cope with negative emotions 


41:26.000 --> 41:28.235
that at times overwhelm us? 


41:28.235 --> 41:30.737
First, meditate on the ransom. 


41:30.737 --> 41:34.675
It is the most potent answer 
to the satanic lie 


41:34.675 --> 41:38.178
that we are worthless 
or unlovable to Jehovah. 


41:38.178 --> 41:42.650
Second, gradually replace 
lowly negative thoughts 


41:42.650 --> 41:45.285
with elevated Scriptural truths 


41:45.285 --> 41:49.323
—truths that will help us 
see ourselves the way Jehovah does. 


41:49.323 --> 41:53.493
Those two suggestions 
can help us cope with negative emotions 


41:53.493 --> 41:56.000
that have become a plague of our heart. 


41:59.333 --> 42:01.768
Now in conclusion, a final thought: 


42:01.768 --> 42:04.238
Whatever plagues our heart, 


42:04.238 --> 42:07.875
even if it’s a situation 
that we haven’t touched on this evening, 


42:07.875 --> 42:12.713
remaining spiritually active 
will lighten our load. 


42:12.713 --> 42:15.081
Now, we at Bethel are blessed 


42:15.082 --> 42:17.184
because we have plenty to do 
in Jehovah’s work. 


42:17.183 --> 42:19.720
And really, wherever we serve, 


42:19.720 --> 42:23.023
theocratic activity 
will balance our thinking 


42:23.023 --> 42:27.526
and help us to put 
the principles we discussed into practice. 


42:27.527 --> 42:32.532
But our strongest means of coping 
with any plague of our heart 


42:32.532 --> 42:35.702
is identified at Psalm 62:1, 2. 


42:35.702 --> 42:37.739
Let’s read those verses. 


42:37.738 --> 42:40.073
What David says in Psalm 62 


42:40.073 --> 42:44.245
can lighten our load 
and make it easier for us to carry. 


42:44.245 --> 42:48.015
Psalm 62, beginning with verse 1: 


42:48.015 --> 42:51.918
“Indeed, I wait silently for God. 


42:51.918 --> 42:54.655
“My salvation comes from him. 


42:54.655 --> 42:57.825
“Indeed, he is my rock and my salvation, 


42:57.825 --> 43:00.360
“my secure refuge; 


43:00.360 --> 43:04.230
I will never be greatly shaken.” 


43:04.230 --> 43:06.300
Let’s think about that last phrase 


43:06.300 --> 43:09.202
“I will never be greatly shaken.” 


43:09.202 --> 43:11.205
What does that mean, 


43:11.205 --> 43:15.542
and how can it help us cope 
with the plague of our heart? 


43:15.542 --> 43:18.379
Well, to illustrate it, 
last year my wife and I were on a flight 


43:18.378 --> 43:22.983
from El Paso to New York 
when the plane hit turbulence. 


43:22.983 --> 43:25.785
And this wasn’t ordinary turbulence; 


43:25.785 --> 43:29.122
this turbulence was so bad 
that the pilot told the flight attendants 


43:29.122 --> 43:31.459
to sit down and fasten their seat belts. 


43:31.458 --> 43:34.961
It was a nerve-racking experience. 


43:34.962 --> 43:37.230
Obviously, we survived. 


43:37.230 --> 43:40.167
But a day or two later, I did some research 


43:40.167 --> 43:42.770
and I found out something about turbulence 


43:42.770 --> 43:45.338
that many passengers don’t know. 


43:45.338 --> 43:47.340
You know what it is? 


43:47.340 --> 43:51.345
It’s that planes are built 
to handle turbulence, 


43:51.345 --> 43:54.113
even the really bad kind. 


43:54.113 --> 43:59.118
In fact, when the pilot says 
he’s searching for smoother air, 


43:59.118 --> 44:02.121
he’s not doing it so much for our safety 


44:02.122 --> 44:07.127
as he is just for our comfort 
and to keep the coffee in our cups. 


44:07.127 --> 44:10.297
Turbulence might shake a plane, 


44:10.297 --> 44:14.000
but the plane will not be greatly shaken. 


44:15.368 --> 44:18.638
To cope with the plague of our heart, 


44:18.638 --> 44:21.908
we need to understand something similar 


44:21.908 --> 44:25.878
about the turbulence going on in our life. 


44:25.878 --> 44:30.150
When we face a trial, 
our tendency might be to panic, 


44:30.150 --> 44:32.152
to grip the armrests (so to speak), 


44:32.152 --> 44:35.355
to worry about what 
the next moment will bring, 


44:35.355 --> 44:37.958
to fear that we are going to crash. 


44:37.958 --> 44:41.295
But we can have confidence that, 
as David said, 


44:41.295 --> 44:43.297
we will never be greatly shaken. 


44:43.297 --> 44:46.434
We can handle the turbulence 
of any trial that comes our way. 


44:46.433 --> 44:48.435
And why? 


44:48.435 --> 44:50.570
Not because of our own strength, 


44:50.570 --> 44:54.040
but because we feel 
as David expresses in verse 2: 


44:54.040 --> 44:58.712
“[Jehovah] is my rock and my salvation, 
my secure refuge.” 


44:58.712 --> 45:02.349
So yes, we may be shaken by our trial, 


45:02.348 --> 45:07.353
but with Jehovah’s help, 
we will never be greatly shaken. 


45:07.353 --> 45:11.158
By all means, then, 
whatever hardship we face 


45:11.158 --> 45:16.163
—whether it’s circumstances 
that discourage us, people who upset us, 


45:16.163 --> 45:19.933
negative emotions that overwhelm us, 
or anything else


45:19.933 --> 45:23.503
—let us continue to make Jehovah 
our secure refuge, 


45:23.503 --> 45:34.131
confident that he can help us cope 
with the plague of our heart.

00:03 When we heard that there would be  a special convention in Madagascar,
00:08 we were very happy.
00:10 We said, “We have to get there!”
00:13 We decided to increase
00:14 the amount of soap  we make so that we could pay
00:16 for the travel to the convention.
00:20 We have three children
00:21 who are going to be baptized
00:23 in Antananarivo.
00:25 As a family,  we have worked together to make bricks
00:28 so that we can pay the fare  for this special event in our life.
00:32 We are looking forward to meeting
00:34 brothers and sisters from around the world.
00:39 I make earrings, and I sell them.
00:46 I will use the money  to attend the convention.
00:51 I am very happy.
00:56 I make bags made with these voapika beans
00:58 to get some money to attend the convention.
01:00 This is my pig.
01:02 I will sell it  so that I can attend the convention.
01:04 I am raising chickens.
01:06 I am doing laundry.
01:11 Visiting delegates are traveling far
01:14 —from nine countries— to come to Madagascar.
01:18 We are taking with us necklaces  and bracelets from South Africa
01:21 to give to the brothers  and sisters in Madagascar.
01:38 From the very moment that we showed up,
01:39 you could just feel the love  from all of the friends.
01:42 “Welcome, welcome, welcome!”  was the message we kept getting.
01:45 We really enjoyed the tour of the branch.
01:47 They also had dancing and wonderful food.
01:51 One theme that I saw  with all of the local friends here
01:54 was that they  were all smiling from ear to ear.
01:56 A lot of energy too
01:58 —great, happy energy!
02:01 The ministry was incredible.
02:02 We had the friends there  right by our side to help us along.
02:07 Just seeing Jehovah’s creation
02:09 in an area where it’s been untouched
02:11 and getting to see some
02:13 of the plants and animals  that you can’t see anywhere else in the world
02:15 is truly a nice blessing.
02:18 Even on our large island,
02:20 many people have far to travel.
02:23 Some walk on foot for several days.
02:27 Many take a bus journey of a few days  to arrive here in Antananarivo.
02:32 But everyone is eager to be
02:35 at the special convention in Madagascar.
04:01 Now, when I think about my three children
04:04 who got baptized today,
04:07 I feel my heart is full of joy,
04:10 and I really thank Jehovah!
04:13 We walked for three days  with our congregation,
04:17 and then we took a bus.
04:19 We arrived safely in Antananarivo  because we did not give up.
04:24 We are so happy to be here!
04:27 Even though I do not know  all these people from before,
04:31 they are Jehovah’s people  and I can get to know them.
04:35 I’ve never been in a stadium  with so many people.
04:38 Just to see that many people  singing to Jehovah
04:41 was quite an experience,  and it made me think:
04:45 ‘Wow!  This is like a taste of Paradise!’
04:49 I have been in the organization  for 47 years now.
04:54 This is something  that really makes me happy,
04:57 and it encourages me  to see such a great crowd,
05:00 which is benefiting greatly  from Jehovah himself.
05:05 This is our very first special convention,
05:08 and everything has exceeded  all of my expectations!
05:11 It makes me think:
05:13 ‘Wow!  What does Jehovah have in store next?’

00:03.895 --> 00:08.062
When we heard that there would be 
a special convention in Madagascar, 


00:08.062 --> 00:10.062
we were very happy. 


00:10.062 --> 00:13.020
We said, “We have to get there!” 


00:13.020 --> 00:14.687
We decided to increase 


00:14.687 --> 00:16.854
the amount of soap 
we make so that we could pay 


00:16.853 --> 00:19.000
for the travel to the convention. 


00:20.353 --> 00:21.770
We have three children 


00:21.770 --> 00:23.687
who are going to be baptized 


00:23.687 --> 00:25.812
in Antananarivo. 


00:25.812 --> 00:28.395
As a family, 
we have worked together to make bricks 


00:28.395 --> 00:32.812
so that we can pay the fare 
for this special event in our life. 


00:32.812 --> 00:34.979
We are looking forward to meeting 


00:34.978 --> 00:38.000
brothers and sisters from around the world. 


00:39.728 --> 00:44.000
I make earrings, and I sell them. 


00:46.853 --> 00:51.561
I will use the money 
to attend the convention. 


00:51.562 --> 00:54.000
I am very happy. 


00:56.020 --> 00:58.062
I make bags made with these voapika beans 


00:58.062 --> 01:00.437
to get some money to attend the convention. 


01:00.437 --> 01:02.187
This is my pig. 


01:02.187 --> 01:04.979
I will sell it 
so that I can attend the convention. 


01:04.978 --> 01:06.978
I am raising chickens. 


01:06.978 --> 01:09.000
I am doing laundry. 


01:11.645 --> 01:14.353
Visiting delegates are traveling far 


01:14.353 --> 01:18.270
—from nine countries—
to come to Madagascar.


01:18.270 --> 01:21.937
We are taking with us necklaces 
and bracelets from South Africa 


01:21.937 --> 01:25.000
to give to the brothers 
and sisters in Madagascar. 


01:38.062 --> 01:39.687
From the very moment that we showed up, 


01:39.687 --> 01:42.270
you could just feel the love 
from all of the friends. 


01:42.270 --> 01:45.270
“Welcome, welcome, welcome!” 
was the message we kept getting. 


01:45.270 --> 01:47.270
We really enjoyed the tour of the branch. 


01:47.270 --> 01:51.270
They also had dancing and wonderful food. 


01:51.270 --> 01:54.770
One theme that I saw 
with all of the local friends here 


01:54.770 --> 01:56.395
was that they 
were all smiling from ear to ear. 


01:56.395 --> 01:58.270
A lot of energy too 


01:58.270 --> 02:01.187
—great, happy energy! 


02:01.187 --> 02:02.645
The ministry was incredible. 


02:02.645 --> 02:07.228
We had the friends there 
right by our side to help us along. 


02:07.228 --> 02:09.395
Just seeing Jehovah’s creation 


02:09.395 --> 02:11.437
in an area where it’s been untouched 


02:11.437 --> 02:13.395
and getting to see some 


02:13.395 --> 02:15.520
of the plants and animals 
that you can’t see anywhere else in the world 


02:15.520 --> 02:18.853
is truly a nice blessing. 


02:18.853 --> 02:20.895
Even on our large island, 


02:20.895 --> 02:23.812
many people have far to travel. 


02:23.812 --> 02:27.145
Some walk on foot for several days. 


02:27.145 --> 02:32.645
Many take a bus journey of a few days 
to arrive here in Antananarivo. 


02:32.645 --> 02:35.978
But everyone is eager to be 


02:35.978 --> 02:39.000
at the special convention in Madagascar. 


04:01.895 --> 04:04.895
Now, when I think about my three children 


04:04.895 --> 04:07.062
who got baptized today, 


04:07.062 --> 04:10.229
I feel my heart is full of joy, 


04:10.228 --> 04:13.186
and I really thank Jehovah! 


04:13.187 --> 04:17.895
We walked for three days 
with our congregation, 


04:17.895 --> 04:19.437
and then we took a bus. 


04:19.437 --> 04:24.187
We arrived safely in Antananarivo 
because we did not give up. 


04:24.187 --> 04:27.312
We are so happy to be here! 


04:27.312 --> 04:31.687
Even though I do not know 
all these people from before, 


04:31.687 --> 04:35.312
they are Jehovah’s people 
and I can get to know them. 


04:35.312 --> 04:38.312
I’ve never been in a stadium 
with so many people. 


04:38.312 --> 04:41.895
Just to see that many people 
singing to Jehovah 


04:41.895 --> 04:45.187
was quite an experience, 
and it made me think: 


04:45.187 --> 04:49.895
‘Wow! 
This is like a taste of Paradise!’ 


04:49.895 --> 04:53.000
I have been in the organization 
for 47 years now. 


04:54.353 --> 04:57.436
This is something 
that really makes me happy, 


04:57.437 --> 05:00.729
and it encourages me 
to see such a great crowd, 


05:00.728 --> 05:04.000
which is benefiting greatly 
from Jehovah himself. 


05:05.895 --> 05:08.645
This is our very first special convention, 


05:08.645 --> 05:11.853
and everything has exceeded 
all of my expectations! 


05:11.853 --> 05:13.478
It makes me think: 


05:13.478 --> 05:29.958
‘Wow! 
What does Jehovah have in store next?’

00:17 First, we asked the branch for permission.
00:20 Once they gave us approval,
00:22 we began to make preparations  for the assembly,
00:25 though we had absolutely nothing.
00:28 So one brother lent us a property  for the assembly site.
00:31 Our brothers have brought  many different skills to the project.
00:34 There are metalworkers,
00:36 cabinetmakers, and bricklayers.
00:39 Many brothers
00:40 have given of their resources
00:42 and used their abilities
00:44 so that this project could go ahead.
00:48 This has really made us stand out here.
00:50 People were asking each other:
00:52 “What is happening here?”
00:54 and “Who paid for all of this?”
00:57 They say people are surprised  at how many workers are coming to help.
01:01 And I wonder,
01:02 ‘If this is getting attention now,
01:05 what will the assembly be like?’
01:08 A comfortable, practical,  and secure Assembly Hall
01:12 was constructed using materials  acquired locally.
01:15 Expectations grew  as the special day drew closer,
01:18 and when it finally arrived,  those in attendance
01:21 experienced something truly moving.
01:28 With Jehovah’s help, many interested ones,
01:31 along with our brothers and sisters,  have come here today
01:34 to celebrate our first assembly  in the Bribri language.
01:40 Friends, this is wonderful!
01:47 When the program started in Bribri, I cried.
01:53 I’m so happy
01:54 to have participated in the assembly,
01:57 especially because it’s in my own language.
02:03 It’s what we wanted.
02:04 We hope it continues just like this.
02:07 We walked a long way to invite these people,
02:13 and to see them here, it makes me very happy.
02:23 The information presented  in the local language
02:26 touched many hearts.
02:28 This was truly a historic event
02:30 for our indigenous brothers in Costa Rica.
02:33 Jehovah has made it possible
02:35 for more people in this isolated region  to enjoy his spiritual blessing.

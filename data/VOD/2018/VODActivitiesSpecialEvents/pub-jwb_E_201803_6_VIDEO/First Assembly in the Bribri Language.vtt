00:17.580 --> 00:20.832
First, we asked the branch for permission. 


00:20.832 --> 00:22.627
Once they gave us approval, 


00:22.627 --> 00:25.087
we began to make preparations 
for the assembly, 


00:25.087 --> 00:28.007
though we had absolutely nothing. 


00:28.007 --> 00:31.510
So one brother lent us a property 
for the assembly site.


00:31.510 --> 00:34.930
Our brothers have brought 
many different skills to the project. 


00:34.930 --> 00:36.932
There are metalworkers,


00:36.932 --> 00:39.727
cabinetmakers, and bricklayers. 


00:39.727 --> 00:40.937
Many brothers 


00:40.937 --> 00:42.479
have given of their resources 


00:42.478 --> 00:44.063
and used their abilities 


00:44.063 --> 00:47.000
so that this project could go ahead.


00:48.152 --> 00:50.570
This has really made us stand out here. 


00:50.570 --> 00:52.907
People were asking each other: 


00:52.907 --> 00:54.032
“What is happening here?” 


00:54.032 --> 00:57.369
and “Who paid for all of this?”


00:57.368 --> 01:01.581
They say people are surprised 
at how many workers are coming to help. 


01:01.582 --> 01:02.499
And I wonder, 


01:02.498 --> 01:05.418
‘If this is getting attention now, 


01:05.418 --> 01:08.671
what will the assembly be like?’


01:08.672 --> 01:12.175
A comfortable, practical, 
and secure Assembly Hall 


01:12.175 --> 01:15.220
was constructed using materials 
acquired locally. 


01:15.220 --> 01:18.807
Expectations grew 
as the special day drew closer, 


01:18.807 --> 01:21.935
and when it finally arrived, 
those in attendance 


01:21.935 --> 01:24.000
experienced something truly moving.


01:28.567 --> 01:31.695
With Jehovah’s help,
many interested ones, 


01:31.695 --> 01:34.990
along with our brothers and sisters, 
have come here today 


01:34.990 --> 01:38.000
to celebrate our first assembly 
in the Bribri language. 


01:40.245 --> 01:44.000
Friends, this is wonderful!


01:47.043 --> 01:52.000
When the program started in Bribri, I cried.


01:53.508 --> 01:54.926
I’m so happy 


01:54.927 --> 01:57.512
to have participated in the assembly, 


01:57.512 --> 02:00.000
especially because it’s in my own language.


02:03.310 --> 02:04.853
It’s what we wanted. 


02:04.853 --> 02:07.563
We hope it continues just like this.


02:07.563 --> 02:11.000
We walked a long way to invite these people, 


02:13.362 --> 02:18.000
and to see them here,
it makes me very happy.


02:23.622 --> 02:26.542
The information presented 
in the local language 


02:26.542 --> 02:28.377
touched many hearts. 


02:28.377 --> 02:30.670
This was truly a historic event 


02:30.670 --> 02:33.757
for our indigenous brothers in Costa Rica. 


02:33.757 --> 02:35.759
Jehovah has made it possible 


02:35.758 --> 03:00.761
for more people in this isolated region 
to enjoy his spiritual blessing.

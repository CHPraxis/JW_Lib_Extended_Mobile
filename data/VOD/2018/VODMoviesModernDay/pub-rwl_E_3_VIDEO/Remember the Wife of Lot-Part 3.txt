00:01 Previously on Remember the Wife of Lot.
00:04 I’m going to real estate classes.
00:06 What?  We didn’t talk about this!
00:07 Why?
00:09 If you made more money, I wouldn’t have to!
00:12 Gloria, wait.
00:13 I’ve decided something.
00:14 What is it?
00:15 To start studying the Bible together.
00:17 Do you mean you want me to become a priest?
00:19 Come on, Rick.
00:20 It’s Jehovah’s Witnesses, isn’t it, Dad?
00:22 What are you trying to say?
00:23 All I see is an unhappy man.
00:25 You have no idea how much pressure Gloria is putting on me.
00:28 You’re not the same person that I once knew.
00:43 Everybody, squeeze in.
00:44 Smile.
00:47 How did it turn out?
00:48 Oh, it turned out good.
00:49 Oh, it’s nice.
00:50 Very nice.
00:51 It’s very nice.
00:52 Sure.
01:09 It was time for something new.
01:11 Actually, we got many new things.
01:12 We even got a new piano for Anna.
01:14 Oh, nice.
01:15 Yeah.
01:17 Oh, Brian is home.
01:18 Have some dessert, OK?
01:20 Thank you.
01:20 Hey, Brian.
01:22 Hey.
01:23 I’ve invited some relatives for dinner.
01:25 Yeah, so I see.
01:27 Are you hungry?
01:29 Do you want some?
01:30 Oh, here are the oranges.
01:32 Oh, thank you.
01:33 Hey, let’s go.
01:34 Come on.
01:35 Wait a minute.
01:35 Hold—hold on, Gloria.
01:37 Why did you arrange  this without telling me?
01:40 Well, surprise!
02:23 Why did you arrange this without telling me?
02:26 I thought it would be nice to have a family dinner.
02:28 But none of them are in the truth.
02:30 How else are we going to witness to them?
02:34 They’re only here to socialize.
02:35 They’re not here to talk about Jehovah.
02:37 Come on, Brian.
02:38 They’re family.
02:39 Let’s go and talk.
02:40 Oh.
02:40 Is your mother OK?
02:42 Eh, she’s fine.
02:44 Hey, Henry.
02:45 Hey.
02:45 I’ll let you guys talk.
02:46 Oh, OK.
02:48 Hello, Henry, how are you?
02:50 OK.
02:50 We haven’t seen much of you lately.
02:52 Yeah, well, we’ve been pretty busy.
02:54 Busy?
02:55 Well, I can tell you spend a lot of time
02:58 with your church but not with us.
03:00 We feel really left out.
03:05 Hey, guys.
03:06 Hey.
03:06 How are you guys doing?
03:10 We have other relatives  who are Christians.
03:12 I mean, they really spend time  with us during holidays.
03:16 Henry, as I’ve explained before,
03:18 when we became Witnesses,
03:20 there are just certain practices we don’t want to compromise on.
03:23 Our beliefs are very important to us.
03:27 Between that and—and work,  we really do have busy schedules.
03:32 Well, speaking of work, um, I’m out of work at this moment.
03:37 I’m sorry to hear that, Henry.
03:38 So if you hear of any job openings, I mean, I’ve got a lot of experience.
03:43 Would you excuse us for a moment?
03:45 Of course.
03:48 Gloria,  recently you have done well.
03:51 I must congratulate you on your hard work with my company.
03:55 Thank you, Uncle.
03:57 But do not forget, it’s not just your
04:01 hard work that has given you all this.
04:03 Yes, Uncle.
04:04 I understand,
04:05 and thank you for everything.
04:07 Then you must not let me down.
04:11 What do you mean, Uncle?
04:13 I am talking about your priorities.
04:17 What about them?
04:19 You must learn to keep your religion in its place.
04:22 Of course, you can have your God,
04:26 but it must not interfere with what’s most
04:29 important in your life —your relatives and your career.
04:34 Your religion gets in the way of what’s expected of you.
04:37 Well, Uncle, I understand
04:39 how important those things are to you and to all of my relatives,
04:43 but as I explained to you before,
04:45 when I became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
04:48 spiritual things also became very important to me.
04:52 Yes.
04:53 And I have never agreed with your choice, have I?
04:58 No.
04:59 And yet I’ve given you this job.
05:01 I helped you get this beautiful apartment
05:04 because the way you live reflects on me.
05:09 You know that since your father passed away,
05:12 I’ve taken the responsibility as family head
05:15 towards you as well as your mother and your brother.
05:19 Have you forgotten all I have done for you?
05:25 No.
05:27 I do remember.
05:29 Then you must serve my company and work hard for me.
05:35 This is for family, Gloria.
05:37 This must be your priority.
05:40 You must make me proud.
05:44 Remember what I’ve said to you.
05:47 You could lose all this very easily.
05:51 Do you understand?
05:55 Yes, I understand.
05:59 Good.
06:21 Mom, why are you  reading a medical book?
06:24 I’m reading about my problem.
06:26 Problem?
06:27 What problem?
06:28 The pain in my back.
06:30 You didn’t tell me you had any pain.
06:32 I called you three times,  but you didn’t answer.
06:35 Mom, I didn’t see any calls from you.
06:37 I wouldn’t need to call you if you would visit me.
06:40 I hardly see you anymore  since you moved here.
06:43 Mom, I came by only three days ago.
06:46 One day, you’ll come by
06:48 and find me on the floor, not breathing.
06:52 I want you to take me to the doctor.
06:56 Go ahead and laugh.
06:57 Are you going to follow his instructions this time?
06:59 At this rate,  I may not be around
07:02 to see my granddaughters get married.
07:04 Mom, listen.
07:05 We’re going to see the doctor tomorrow.
07:08 OK?
07:09 Gloria,
07:11 when you were little, my mom used to live with us
07:16 and later your father’s mother too.
07:18 Remember that?
07:19 Yes.
07:20 My apartment is not like this,
07:23 big and warm.
07:26 Mine is cold and drafty,  you know?
07:31 I think that’s why I have this pain.
07:35 Come on, Mom.
07:43 “That’s why I have this pain.”
07:49 Oh, she wants to move in with us.
07:55 Oh, man.
08:01 Hey.
08:02 Hey.
08:08 Oh, Brother Williams’ next visit
08:11 is the third week of March.
08:14 That’s the same week  of the Memorial.
08:16 So make sure you put that in your calendar.
08:19 OK.
08:21 Oh, I have a big showing on the same day as the Memorial.
08:26 It—it’s the new property  that Uncle asked me to handle.
08:29 The—the day of the Memorial?
08:32 Yeah.
08:35 Ah, it’s OK.
08:36 I—I can get Marty to cover for me once I set up.
08:40 OK, you better make sure that he can handle that.
08:43 Yeah, I will.
08:46 All right.
08:51 Hey, what were you and Uncle talking about on the balcony tonight?
08:56 It’s nothing.
08:57 We were just talking about business.
08:59 Are you sure?
09:00 Because it seemed  like it bothered you.
09:05 Well,
09:06 he’s putting a lot of pressure on me.
09:10 It’s OK.
09:11 I can handle it.
09:13 Really?
09:15 I mean, but can we?
09:17 What do you mean?
09:21 I’m just saying, look at us.
09:27 Actually,
09:28 Joe spoke with me today.
09:30 About what?
09:32 Well, he’s concerned about us spiritually.
09:34 He feels we’ve become materialistic.
09:40 Joe doesn’t understand our background.
09:43 And is it really wrong  to try to improve our life?
09:47 No, but, not if it means putting anything
09:50 or anyone ahead of Jehovah.
09:53 But don’t you think that we need to make some sacrifices if we want nice things?
09:57 We have made sacrifices,  all the wrong ones.
10:01 You’ve even had to quit pioneering.
10:03 We’re neglecting family worship, study, service.
10:09 We’ve even become too busy,  or maybe too ashamed,
10:13 to even pray together.
10:15 Gloria, we’re drifting apart from each other.
10:20 But look at this place.
10:22 It is so nice.
10:25 I don’t want to give it up.
10:28 Gloria,
10:30 we don’t want this place if it takes us
10:34 or you away from Jehovah.
10:37 Besides, we haven’t been able to rent out the old place yet.
10:41 We have two mortgages.
10:44 But more than that, Gloria,
10:46 think of all we taught the girls when they were little
10:50 about putting Jehovah ahead of everything else.
10:55 Do you remember Brother Williams’ talk a couple years ago
10:57 about not being able to serve two masters
11:01 and how Lot’s wife put her home ahead of Jehovah?
11:06 Jesus told her story as a lesson for us.
11:12 We have to “remember the wife of Lot.”
11:16 It didn’t have to end that way for her,
11:19 and it doesn’t have  to end that way for us.
11:25 Do you think we are that bad?
11:30 Come here.
11:46 I want us to get back to where we were, spiritually.
11:53 I want you close  to me again, remember?
12:00 Let’s say a prayer.
12:03 OK.
12:08 Jehovah God, our heavenly Father, we come before you.
12:12 We pray all of this in Jesus’ name.
12:14 Amen.
12:15 Amen.
12:21 We can turn this around.
12:23 We can do it.
12:25 OK?
12:26 Jehovah will help us.
12:28 OK.
12:30 I’m proud of you.
12:35 I’m going to finish cleaning up, OK?
12:38 OK.
12:59 We have to  “remember the wife of Lot.”
13:03 It didn’t have to end that way for her,
13:07 and it doesn’t have to end that way for us.
13:13 “Remember the wife of Lot.”
13:32 Hey, so I was wondering, tomorrow,  what time do you think we’ll finish?
13:35 Look, Anna, we’re really behind schedule,
13:37 so I need you  to be a team player on this.
13:40 OK.
13:41 When have I not been a team player?
13:42 Some people on the team feel that you’re getting special treatment
13:45 because we’re related,
13:47 and I have to make sure that everyone gets treated equally.
13:49 When have I ever asked for special treatment?
13:51 It’s your church meetings, Anna.
13:53 If we’re all working overtime,
13:54 I can’t keep covering for you  so you can go while everyone else stays.
13:57 But you said when I started  that it wouldn’t be a problem.
14:00 Look, I remember what I said, but things change, Anna.
14:03 And if you want to be part of this team,
14:05 you need to do your part,
14:06 and that’s starting now.
14:08 We’re working overtime every night this week until we get caught up.
14:10 Every night?  I can’t do that, Kevin.
14:12 Tomorrow is a really important meeting; it’s the Memorial.
14:15 I told you already.
14:16 I remember,
14:17 but I can’t make an exception for you.
14:19 But who knows?
14:20 Maybe if we work hard enough,  we’ll get caught up and you could still go.
14:24 Fine.
14:26 Hey, it’s close to lunch.
14:28 Let’s grab the rest of the team and get some food,
14:30 and we can talk about this later.
14:32 OK?
14:34 Fine.
14:34 Nice haircut, by the way.
14:35 Thanks,  my dad doesn’t like it though.
14:38 Of course.
14:43 It was so gross.
14:45 Hey, look at those  religious fanatics over there.
14:48 I bet they get along great with your strict parents.
14:50 Hey, Anna!
14:54 Did you see that?
14:58 These are the top headlines from BNC News.
15:01 Death tolls continue to rise
15:03 in the wake of a massive earthquake
15:05 with a magnitude of 8.1
15:06 that struck off the northern coast of Taiwan on Tuesday
15:09 and was felt as far away  as Tokyo, Japan.
15:12 The resulting tsunami has caused devastation in the entire region.
15:16 Meanwhile, the global financial  meltdown continues to plague stocks
15:20 as market prices dropped drastically once again today.
15:24 China’s government suspended  trading early in fears of a sell off.
15:30 Hello?
15:31 Gloria.  Hi.
15:32 I was just catching up on where we stand.
15:35 I’m really looking forward to helping out with this new property.
15:38 Yes, Marty, remember,  the showing is on for tomorrow.
15:41 And you can still help me out when I need to leave, right?
15:45 Yes, of course.  I wouldn’t miss it.
15:47 There’s going to be a ton of big investors there.
15:49 Just be sure you can be there on time.
15:51 I have to leave once everything is set up.
15:53 And this is really important to me, Marty.
15:56 I’m counting on you.
15:58 Absolutely,
15:59 anything for you.
16:00 Talk to you later, bye.
16:06 You made sure with Marty that he can cover?
16:08 Yes, he’ll be there.
16:10 Well, why don’t you come over?
16:11 We’re going to start our Memorial Bible reading.
16:13 OK.
16:22 OK, so we’re starting with Mark 14:1.
16:33 Anna?
16:34 I thought you had a big day at work.
16:37 I did.
16:38 Then why are you home so early?
16:45 I just— I’m just so ashamed of myself.
16:51 Ashamed?
16:53 Honey, come over here.
17:04 Anna,
17:05 what are you talking about?
17:09 I saw Mary and Ricky
17:13 out in service today.
17:18 I couldn’t even acknowledge them.
17:23 Mom, I don’t know why  I’m doing this anymore.
17:26 The people I’m working with,
17:28 they’re not who I thought they were.
17:32 And this job,  it’s not making me happy.
17:35 And I know it’s  not making Jehovah happy.
17:40 Anna, you can’t just quit like this.
17:46 I want you to have a comfortable life
17:49 so that you don’t need to worry about money.
17:52 You have to be successful with a secure job and it will—
17:57 it will help you to pioneer.
17:59 Mom.
18:07 I know you care about me,
18:12 but if I keep this job, I know where it will take me.
18:18 It’s changed me so much already.
18:22 I want to be a success,
18:25 but I want to be a success in Jehovah’s eyes.
18:33 I had no idea you felt that way.
18:43 I am sorry.
18:50 Are you sure that’s what you want to do?
18:55 Yes.
19:02 Anna,
19:04 I am so proud of you
19:09 because you have the courage to do
19:14 what I should have done.
19:19 So,
19:20 what are we going to do now?
19:22 We need to examine our priorities together.
19:28 But if we make  the changes that we need to,
19:33 we might give up this place.
19:39 Is that all right with everyone?
19:41 Finally.  I never liked this place anyway.
19:45 Really?
19:47 Yeah.
19:49 Can we at least keep the new piano?
19:52 Only if we do something about your hair first.
19:56 Good point.
20:04 Can I help you?
20:05 Hey, good morning, Sir.  How are you?
20:07 Good.  Thank you.
20:07 Good.
20:08 My name is Joe, and this morning
20:09 we’re leaving this invitation with your neighbors.
20:12 This is your copy here.
20:13 OK, thank you.
20:14 OK.
20:14 Director Williams,
20:16 this is a nice surprise.
20:18 I haven’t seen you since you were overseeing our division.
20:20 Donald,
20:20 I didn’t know this was your home.
20:22 Yeah, but I mean, what brings you here?
20:24 Well, I’ve changed careers.
20:25 Really?
20:26 Yes.
20:27 You must have gotten a really good offer.
20:29 You know, Donald,
20:30 I finally found a far better career and something more important.
20:34 Really?
20:35 If you have a moment, I’d love to tell you about it.
20:37 Yeah, would you guys like to come in for some coffee or something?
20:39 Oh, absolutely.
20:39 Yeah, yeah, sure, thanks.
20:41 Thank you.
20:49 Morning.
20:50 Hello.
20:52 OK, uh, what are you guys going to sell me today?
20:55 Nothing, Sir.
20:55 We have an invitation for you.
20:57 It’s, uh, to a special event tonight.
20:59 OK, sure, thanks.
21:01 Hey, aren’t you Arthur Gomez?
21:03 Yeah, Joe’s boy,
21:05 and you must be his wife, um—
21:07 Mary.
21:08 Mary, that’s right.
21:09 I’m sorry,  have we met before?
21:12 Oh, yeah, sorry.
21:13 You probably wouldn’t remember me.
21:15 But I used to work with Joe.
21:16 Yeah, and he would  always show us pictures
21:18 of the boys and talk about you guys all the time.
21:20 I could tell he was  really proud of his family.
21:23 That’s really nice of you to say, Sir.
21:25 Man, Joe, he changed so much.
21:28 I remember when I first started working with him,
21:29 he had this temper, and he would just lose it over the smallest thing.
21:34 But then he really started changing.
21:36 I guess he said it was  what he learned from the Bible,
21:40 well, from you guys, right?
21:42 Actually, you’d be surprised.
21:44 It was Joe who first suggested  that we study the Bible as a family, not us.
21:49 Really?
21:49 Yeah.
21:50 OK, this I’ve got to hear.
21:52 Do you ever really regret your decision you made to uh,
21:55 you know, leave your career and start pioneering?
21:58 Absolutely not.
21:59 My only regret is that I hadn’t started sooner.
22:24 It sounds really nice.
22:26 Thanks, Anna.
22:29 What?
22:30 Is there something wrong with my hair?
22:33 Tina helped me fix it yesterday.
22:35 It’s fine, Anna.
22:37 You’re beautiful.
22:38 Do you know that?
22:39 Why are you  getting all sentimental?
22:42 Well, last night, when I told you I was proud of you,
22:47 I meant it.
22:49 Thank you.
22:51 I should have never pushed you into that internship.
22:54 I was pressuring you the way my mother tried to pressure me.
22:59 It’s OK, Mom.
23:01 I know you just want what’s best for me.
23:04 I do,
23:05 but I was setting a bad example for you.
23:10 You don’t need a prestigious job to pioneer.
23:13 You just need something
23:15 appropriate to help you make a living.
23:19 But I left out the most important thing.
23:24 What’s that?
23:27 Remember to rely on Jehovah, and he will always help us.
23:33 Before this job, when I was pioneering,
23:36 we always had enough.
23:39 If we put Jehovah first,  he will help us no matter what.
23:44 Anna, everything comes at a cost.
23:48 If you put your career first,  like I’ve been doing,
23:51 there’s very little left for Jehovah.
23:55 You made the right decision.
23:57 Thank you.
24:01 Hey, you girls look like you’re enjoying yourselves.
24:05 Did you pick out your outfits for tonight?
24:07 Yep.
24:07 But, Mom, do you really have to go to that showing tonight?
24:11 I don’t want to,  but I gave my word to Uncle,
24:15 and he’s expecting me to take care of it.
24:18 I got myself into this,
24:20 and now I have to finish it.
24:24 But this is the last time.
24:26 Don’t worry.
24:27 OK, so you’re not going to be late, right?
24:30 I won’t be late.
24:31 Marty will be there, and as soon as everything is set up,
24:34 I can leave.
24:35 Nothing will happen.
24:37 OK.
24:38 I just want to make sure that this isn’t going to be a problem.
24:41 It won’t be.
24:42 Mom,
24:43 promise me you’ll be at the Memorial.
24:46 I promise.
24:48 OK.
24:49 I have to leave now or I’ll be late.
24:56 We’ll see you there.
24:58 Yeah, I’ll see you there.
25:24 “Hi.
25:25 “You’ve reached Marty.
25:26 “I’m out of the office.
25:27 Please leave me a message.”
25:29 Marty, this is Gloria.
25:30 Where are you?
25:32 I’m at the showing now.
25:33 You know I’m counting on you to be here.
25:36 Just—just call me back right away.
25:38 OK?
25:47 Excuse me.
25:48 I need approval on what time to serve the hors d’oeuvres.
25:50 I mean,  as soon as guests are arriving.
25:52 You know, check with Marty when he gets here.
25:55 He’s supposed to be handling all of this.
25:58 Oh, and make sure the wine is open now so it can breathe, OK?
26:03 People are starting to arrive.
26:05 Surely you want me to serve something.
26:06 Serve something now then.
26:08 Go ahead.  Figure something out.
26:11 Hello, Sir.
26:12 Where is the list of property details?
26:14 Yes, I can get one for you, Sir.
26:15 Can I ask you, who is the agent you are working with?
26:18 Uh, yes, I’m working with Marty.
26:19 Where is he?
26:21 Marty, yes, he’s on his way, Sir.
26:23 He will be here very soon.
26:25 In the meantime, would you like to have something to drink?
26:27 Sure.
26:28 Come this way, please.
26:33 Girls, you look nice.
26:35 Thanks, Dad.
26:36 Is Mom on her way to the hall?
26:38 You know what?
26:38 Let me check.
26:39 Um, let me send her a quick text.
26:42 I mean, think about it —privacy, outdoor living.
26:45 Where can you get it in the city, right?
26:46 Hmm, it’s true.
26:49 Excuse me.
26:50 I have to talk  to other clients as well.
26:52 OK, thank you.
26:53 Excuse me.
26:58 How is it going, everyone?
26:59 Are you guys doing OK?
27:00 Oh, yes, good.
27:02 When is Marty going to be here?
27:05 He was supposed to show me  some other offerings in this building.
27:08 Yes,  Marty will be here very soon, Sir.
27:11 Um, would you care for another glass of wine?
27:13 I can’t stay long.
27:15 I have another important meeting tonight.
27:20 Did she text back?
27:23 No, I don’t see anything yet.
27:25 Dad, why don’t you just call her?
27:26 She probably didn’t see your text.
27:28 Or she could be on her way to the hall already.
27:30 Yeah, that’s a good point.
27:31 Let me just give her a quick call.
27:39 Hello?
27:40 Hey,
27:41 the Memorial is going to start in less than an hour.
27:42 Did you leave yet?
27:43 I can’t leave yet.
27:45 What?
27:45 I thought you made arrangements so that you could leave whenever you want?
27:48 I know, I know.
27:49 Marty said he was going to be here, but I can’t reach him now.
27:52 Gloria, what are you going to do?
27:53 I’ll figure something out.
27:54 I have to go, OK?
27:57 Dad,
27:58 where is Mom?
28:00 She is coming, right?
28:01 She promised.
28:03 Yeah, she said she’d be there.
28:04 Yeah, I know, girls.
28:06 Marty is not there yet.
28:08 I don’t know what your mom is going to do.
28:19 Promise me,  you’ll be at the Memorial.
28:23 I promise.
28:31 Mom.
28:33 Mom.
28:34 Don’t look back.
28:37 “Remember the wife of Lot.”
28:39 “Remember the wife of Lot.”
28:59 Gloria, what’s wrong?
29:01 Are you OK?
29:01 Marty!  Finally!
29:02 You’re here!  Where were you?
29:04 Do you know how  many times I called you?
29:06 I’m so sorry, Gloria.
29:07 My phone died on the way over here, and the traffic is just terrible!
29:10 Well, look, I’ve got everything set up.
29:12 Make sure you take care of everybody, OK?
29:14 And do not forget the lease details.
29:15 And before I go, I have to introduce you to really important brokers.
29:19 Go!  Let’s go!
29:20 Hurry!
29:22 The friends are here.
29:24 How are you all?
29:25 Welcome.  Come on in.
29:27 Hey.
29:27 Nice to see you, my brother.
29:38 Gloria!
29:40 Oh, Uncle.
29:41 Where are you going?
29:41 Oh, Uncle, I-I didn’t know you were coming tonight.
29:44 You didn’t think I would give you such an important building
29:47 to sell and not check in on you?
29:49 Uncle, we have a really important religious observance tonight.
29:53 I did everything you asked me to do for the showing,
29:56 but I have to leave now.
29:58 That’s nonsense.
29:59 You stay right here
30:00 and care for the investors.
30:02 But, Uncle,  I did everything for you.
30:04 Will you disgrace me here
30:06 in front of everyone?
30:08 You have my respect,  Uncle, but I—
30:11 But what?
30:12 There is no discussion.
30:14 Remember who it is you are speaking to.
30:17 I have to go, Uncle.
30:18 This is most important to me.
30:21 Jehovah is most important to me.
30:24 Please understand.
30:25 If you leave now,
30:27 you will lose everything.
30:36 We invite all to please find their seats.
30:40 Our program will begin in just a few minutes.
31:14 Welcome to the observance of the Memorial
31:17 of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
31:20 To begin our program tonight,
31:22 we ask all to please stand.
31:24 We’ll be singing song number 147,
31:27 entitled “A Special Possession.”
31:31 That night changed me forever.
31:34 I came so close  to letting my relationship
31:37 with Jehovah slip through my fingers.
31:39 I almost ended up like a woman
31:41 in the Bible I would never want to imitate.
31:45 Thankfully,  I was able to change in time
31:48 because I ‘remembered the wife of Lot.’

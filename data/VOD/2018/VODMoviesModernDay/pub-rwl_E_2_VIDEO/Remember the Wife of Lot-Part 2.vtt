00:00.980 --> 00:04.608
Previously on
Remember the Wife of Lot.


00:04.608 --> 00:06.443
We wanted to invite you,
all of you,


00:06.443 --> 00:08.111
uh, to the hall this Sunday.


00:08.112 --> 00:09.405
We have a special speaker.


00:09.405 --> 00:11.157
We’ll have to talk about that.


00:11.157 --> 00:12.157
Yeah.


00:12.157 --> 00:15.285
The safest road is to get a good job
with a good company.


00:15.285 --> 00:17.788
Yeah, but should we
be pushing Anna and Tina


00:17.788 --> 00:19.000
to succeed in this system?


00:20.623 --> 00:24.168
We are living at a time
when it is vital that 


00:24.168 --> 00:29.000
we do not look back
in a figurative sense.


00:40.643 --> 00:43.271
Brian, this stock is going so well. 


00:43.272 --> 00:45.149
You’ve got to join us.


00:45.148 --> 00:47.275
Thanks for thinking of me,
Henry, but I can’t accept it.


00:47.275 --> 00:48.110
Why not? 


00:48.110 --> 00:49.278
This is a good opportunity, 


00:49.278 --> 00:50.736
and you need more income.


00:50.737 --> 00:51.989
You seem confident, Henry,


00:51.988 --> 00:53.990
but, uh, I’m sorry,
I just can’t accept it.


00:53.990 --> 00:56.368
You don’t trust
my investment strategy. 


00:56.368 --> 00:58.036
That’s it, isn’t it? 


00:58.037 --> 00:59.162
Just say so.


00:59.162 --> 01:01.957
Look, you already know I think
your latest investments are risky. 


01:01.957 --> 01:04.294
And, no, I’m not going to gamble
my meager funds, 


01:04.293 --> 01:05.626
but that’s not it.


01:05.627 --> 01:10.340
Brian, these days we’ve got
to risk money to make money. 


01:10.340 --> 01:11.633
Don’t you understand that?


01:11.633 --> 01:13.635
Even if there weren’t
any risk involved, 


01:13.635 --> 01:16.138
I can’t accept a job offer
that’s going to take


01:16.138 --> 01:17.765
so much of my time and money.


01:17.765 --> 01:20.142
Brian, I don’t get it. 


01:20.142 --> 01:24.605
All you have to do is sacrifice
a little time for a couple of years


01:24.605 --> 01:26.815
and you’d have all
the money you need.


01:26.815 --> 01:28.650
Henry,
I hope it works out for you, OK? 


01:28.650 --> 01:30.277
But I can’t accept, all right? 


01:30.277 --> 01:32.529
Just—just say hi
to Jennifer for me, OK? 


01:32.528 --> 01:34.000
All right, bye.


01:40.412 --> 01:41.830
Who was that? 


01:41.830 --> 01:42.790
Your client?


01:42.790 --> 01:43.790
That was just your brother. 


01:43.790 --> 01:46.085
He wants to get me involved in one
of his investment businesses. 


01:46.085 --> 01:47.585
But I don’t have the time
or money for that.


01:47.585 --> 01:50.505
Well, I think we need
to invest our money 


01:50.505 --> 01:53.425
into something more secure
like real estate. 


01:53.425 --> 01:56.178
And we need to move across town
where we can network


01:56.178 --> 01:58.513
with more influential people.


01:58.513 --> 02:00.515
Is this your mom’s idea? 


02:00.515 --> 02:02.517
Because we can’t afford this. 


02:02.517 --> 02:03.727
We’re already too much in debt.


02:03.727 --> 02:04.812
Well, look! 


02:04.812 --> 02:06.022
We can mortgage this place


02:06.022 --> 02:07.230
and then rent it out. 


02:07.230 --> 02:09.442
We’re not taking
full advantage of this opportunity.


02:09.442 --> 02:10.985
We need to put the Kingdom first.


02:10.985 --> 02:12.402
I am putting the Kingdom first,


02:12.402 --> 02:14.697
but this is the time
to think about our future. 


02:14.697 --> 02:17.449
How many working years
do we have left anyway? 


02:17.448 --> 02:21.000
But if you don’t plan ahead, 
we’ll end up living on the street.


02:24.790 --> 02:26.792
Why are you all dressed up like this? 


02:26.792 --> 02:28.794
Are-are you going out in service?


02:28.793 --> 02:31.630
I’m going to real estate classes.


02:31.630 --> 02:33.465
What? 
We didn’t talk about this! 


02:33.465 --> 02:34.592
Why?


02:34.592 --> 02:37.344
If you made more money, 
I wouldn’t have to!


02:37.343 --> 02:39.346
We’ve never gone without.


02:39.347 --> 02:41.000
Gloria, wait. 


02:43.933 --> 02:46.770
Do you have cash?


02:46.770 --> 02:48.022
I need it for a taxi. 


02:48.022 --> 02:50.000
Please?


03:36.778 --> 03:39.000
Hey, boys, 
I just heard your dad pull up. 


03:40.240 --> 03:42.492
Start getting ready for dinner.


03:42.492 --> 03:44.000
Nice. 


03:49.373 --> 03:50.583
Hey, boys.


03:50.583 --> 03:51.585
Hey, Dad.


03:51.585 --> 03:52.002
Hey, Babe.


03:52.002 --> 03:52.837
How is it going?


03:52.837 --> 03:54.212
Oh, all right. 
How are you doing?


03:54.212 --> 03:54.839
Good.


03:54.838 --> 03:55.880
What a day.


03:55.880 --> 03:57.298
Hey, dinner
is going to be ready soon, 


03:57.298 --> 03:58.383
so go wash up, OK?


03:58.383 --> 03:59.801
Oh, all right, yeah. 


03:59.802 --> 04:02.512
Hey, guys, you
want to wrap this game up? 


04:02.512 --> 04:05.000
Let’s get ready for dinner.


04:06.642 --> 04:08.000
Here you go.


04:09.268 --> 04:09.978
Hey! 


04:09.978 --> 04:12.105
What did I just say? 


04:12.105 --> 04:15.000
Put this furniture back,
and get ready for dinner! 


04:18.487 --> 04:21.000
There’s something important
we got to talk about tonight.


04:24.200 --> 04:28.000
So, what did you want to talk
about that was so important?


04:29.707 --> 04:31.709
All right. 
OK. 


04:31.708 --> 04:35.000
Look. 
I’ve decided something. 


04:36.422 --> 04:38.632
I decided that I want to— 


04:38.632 --> 04:41.344
Well, I—I want us all 


04:41.343 --> 04:44.053
to start studying the Bible together.


04:44.053 --> 04:45.346
What? 


04:45.347 --> 04:46.724
Do you mean you want me
to become a priest?


04:46.723 --> 04:48.100
Come on, Rick.


04:48.100 --> 04:50.560
It’s Jehovah’s Witnesses,
isn’t it, Dad? 


04:50.560 --> 04:52.980
I borrowed your book. 


04:52.980 --> 04:53.980
I liked it.


04:53.980 --> 04:56.107
Well, I think it’s a good idea. 


04:56.107 --> 04:58.527
You know,
I really like those people,


04:58.527 --> 05:00.820
and it seems to be helping you, Joe. 


05:00.820 --> 05:02.447
You seem so much happier.


05:02.447 --> 05:04.000
Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, I am. 


05:05.242 --> 05:08.745
So like I said,
that’s what I decided. 


05:08.745 --> 05:11.873
But I really want us all
to be in on this together. 


05:11.873 --> 05:12.581
All right? 


05:12.582 --> 05:13.000
So...


05:14.502 --> 05:15.835
what do you say, boys?


05:15.835 --> 05:17.000
Sure, Dad.


05:21.717 --> 05:22.000
Rick? 


05:25.678 --> 05:27.000
Come on, Rick.


06:16.438 --> 06:18.940
Gloria? 
Is that you?


06:18.940 --> 06:21.000
Yeah, it’s me.


06:26.072 --> 06:28.492
Gloria, what is all of this?


06:28.492 --> 06:31.662
Oh, it’s some new things
that I picked up today. 


06:31.662 --> 06:33.789
I made my first sale today. 


06:33.788 --> 06:35.456
Aren’t you happy?


06:35.457 --> 06:37.709
Yeah, that’s-that’s great. 


06:37.708 --> 06:41.003
We need the extra income, 
but it looks like you spent it already.


06:41.003 --> 06:42.588
Yeah, it’s just a few things. 


06:42.588 --> 06:46.175
Uncle told me that I have to look
professional to work for him. 


06:46.175 --> 06:49.930
If I’m going to move up and attract
the right type of upscale client, 


06:49.930 --> 06:52.598
I have to look the part, you know?


06:52.598 --> 06:55.185
But, Gloria, I thought you
were doing this just to get


06:55.185 --> 06:58.688
a little extra income
for our necessities? 


06:58.688 --> 07:01.023
How much time are you 
planning to spend on this?


07:01.023 --> 07:02.943
As much as it takes. 


07:02.943 --> 07:05.153
You can’t be successful
by working less.


07:05.153 --> 07:07.113
We already have a very full schedule


07:07.113 --> 07:08.573
with our spiritual routine. 


07:08.573 --> 07:11.660
We have to make sacrifices 
for what’s most important in life. 


07:11.660 --> 07:12.618
You know that. 


07:12.618 --> 07:14.286
This new job—I’m worried. 


07:14.287 --> 07:15.705
It may mean sacrificing time


07:15.705 --> 07:18.000
we should be spending
on spiritual things. 


07:18.000 --> 07:19.417
What about your pioneering?


07:19.417 --> 07:20.794
What about it? 


07:20.793 --> 07:23.000
I can do both.


07:43.858 --> 07:45.000
All right. 
Here you go, Joe, your first door.


07:46.445 --> 07:47.000
OK. 


07:53.493 --> 07:55.161
Good morning,
Sir, how are you?


07:55.162 --> 07:57.039
Oh, you people again? 


07:57.038 --> 07:58.998
Look, don’t you have real jobs? 


07:58.998 --> 08:00.833
I have a real job,
and you keep waking me up. 


08:00.833 --> 08:01.460
OK?


08:01.460 --> 08:02.752
I’m sorry, Frank. 
Forgive us. 


08:02.752 --> 08:03.879
We didn’t mean to upset you, man.


08:03.878 --> 08:04.628
Joe?


08:04.628 --> 08:05.713
Yeah, it’s me, Joe.


08:05.713 --> 08:07.381
I didn’t even recognize you, man. 


08:07.382 --> 08:08.384
How are you doing, Joe, man?


08:08.383 --> 08:09.341
Hey, how are you doing, Frank?


08:09.342 --> 08:10.135
I’m sorry. 


08:10.135 --> 08:11.428
I’m good.
It’s been a while.


08:11.428 --> 08:12.345
It has. 


08:12.345 --> 08:14.013
We used to work together
back in the day.


08:14.013 --> 08:14.765
Oh, OK.


08:14.765 --> 08:15.890
When was the last time
we saw each other?


08:15.890 --> 08:17.767
I think it was that time
we were hauling that lumber.


08:17.767 --> 08:20.895
Oh, when we were loading it,
and then it all fell over in the street.


08:20.895 --> 08:21.688
It fell all over the street.


08:21.688 --> 08:23.065
It took us forever to clean it up.


08:23.065 --> 08:24.648
Forever. 
It was terrible.


08:24.648 --> 08:27.235
What you should have seen
was how mad this guy got.


08:27.235 --> 08:27.610
Oh.


08:27.610 --> 08:28.403
He was so mad, man. 


08:28.403 --> 08:30.446
You could almost see
the fumes coming out of his ears.


08:30.447 --> 08:32.449
Yeah, that was the old Joe, Frank.


08:32.448 --> 08:34.075
It looks like
I got a new Joe here though. 


08:34.075 --> 08:35.535
You’re all dressed up and everything.


08:35.535 --> 08:35.993
Yeah, yeah.


08:35.993 --> 08:36.703
What brings you by?


08:36.703 --> 08:38.538
Well, actually, 
we have some good news


08:38.538 --> 08:39.706
we’d like to share with you.


08:39.707 --> 08:40.790
Good news, huh?


08:40.790 --> 08:42.083
OK, I like good news. 


08:42.083 --> 08:43.000
Well, why don’t you come on in? 


08:43.000 --> 08:44.585
And I’ll get some beers, 
and we can talk about this good news.


08:44.585 --> 08:44.878
OK. 


08:44.878 --> 08:46.755
But no thanks
on the beers this morning.


08:46.755 --> 08:48.000
Oh, OK. 
Well, come on in anyway.


08:55.513 --> 08:56.305
Mom,


08:56.305 --> 08:58.933
this place is so big and fancy. 


08:58.933 --> 09:01.728
I could make so much money 
if I close this deal today. 


09:01.728 --> 09:03.000
Uncle would be so proud.


09:04.815 --> 09:06.983
That’s my little Gloria. 


09:06.983 --> 09:09.526
You make me so proud now. 


09:09.527 --> 09:11.405
I’ll tell all my relatives


09:11.405 --> 09:14.490
what a big important realtor
my daughter is. 


09:14.490 --> 09:15.992
What about Anna? 


09:15.992 --> 09:19.079
Did she accept the internship
with your cousin’s business?


09:19.078 --> 09:21.790
You know how hard
I worked to set it up.


09:21.790 --> 09:22.790
I know, Mom. 


09:22.790 --> 09:24.500
Thank you so much for everything. 


09:24.500 --> 09:25.793
She starts next week.


09:25.793 --> 09:27.503
You make me so happy.


09:27.503 --> 09:28.921
There’s something else. 


09:28.922 --> 09:31.174
If I make this sale today, 


09:31.173 --> 09:33.050
I’ll have enough
to make the down payment


09:33.050 --> 09:35.053
on the bigger apartment 
that I told you about, 


09:35.053 --> 09:36.971
the one on the East Side.


09:36.972 --> 09:39.057
The fancy one your uncle’s firm owns?


09:39.057 --> 09:40.225
Yes. 
That one.


09:40.225 --> 09:43.187
Oh, I’m so excited.


09:43.187 --> 09:44.020
I know, me too. 


09:44.020 --> 09:45.897
I can’t wait to tell everybody. 


09:45.897 --> 09:47.774
Mom, I think my clients are here. 


09:47.773 --> 09:48.441
I got to go. 


09:48.442 --> 09:49.860
Talk to you later, OK? 


09:49.860 --> 09:50.000
OK. 


09:55.407 --> 09:57.284
Hello, come on in. 


09:57.283 --> 09:59.243
Good to see you guys. 


09:59.243 --> 10:04.000
The color contrast is very nice
and flows into this living area. 


10:11.465 --> 10:12.965
Here’s the contract. 


10:12.965 --> 10:14.000
Please sign at the bottom of the page. 


10:20.557 --> 10:21.517
Congratulations.


10:21.517 --> 10:22.184
Thank you.


10:22.183 --> 10:23.016
It’s all yours.


10:23.017 --> 10:23.727
Thank you, Gloria.


10:23.727 --> 10:24.352
Enjoy it.


10:24.352 --> 10:25.000
Thank you.


11:20.908 --> 11:22.451
Joe, Mary. 


11:22.452 --> 11:23.370
Hi, boys. 


11:23.370 --> 11:24.370
Congratulations.


11:24.370 --> 11:25.538
Thanks, Brother Williams. 


11:25.538 --> 11:27.040
Thanks so much. 


11:27.040 --> 11:28.250
I’m really proud of them all.


11:28.250 --> 11:29.375
Yeah, so am I.


11:29.375 --> 11:29.792
Yeah.


11:29.792 --> 11:30.919
Well, how have you been?


11:30.918 --> 11:31.836
You know, we’ve been good. 


11:31.837 --> 11:33.297
Um, it’s like Jesus said,


11:33.297 --> 11:35.299
we always have enough
to pay the bills


11:35.298 --> 11:37.425
and sometimes,
even a little extra.


11:37.425 --> 11:39.802
Ricky, congratulations.


11:39.802 --> 11:40.845
Aw, thank you. 
Thank you so much.


11:40.845 --> 11:42.013
I’m so happy for you.


11:42.013 --> 11:44.265
Yeah, but, hey,
I know it’s just the beginning.


11:44.265 --> 11:46.350
Really? 
So, what’s next?


11:46.350 --> 11:47.893
Actually, 
I want to learn sign language.


11:47.893 --> 11:48.853
Wow!


11:48.853 --> 11:51.063
Maybe join the congregation,
hopefully pretty soon.


11:51.063 --> 11:53.358
That sounds exciting. 
Good for you.


11:53.358 --> 11:55.026
I’ve been teaching myself so far.


11:55.027 --> 11:55.610
Yeah.


11:55.610 --> 11:56.570
Um, as far as I’ve gotten is,


11:56.570 --> 11:59.572
“I’m learning sign language.”


11:59.572 --> 12:00.782
And that’s all I know.


12:00.782 --> 12:01.867
That’s very impressive.


12:01.867 --> 12:03.285
You’ve got to start somewhere. 


12:03.285 --> 12:04.285
Yeah, that’s true.


12:04.285 --> 12:04.995
Tina. 


12:04.995 --> 12:05.000
Come over here. 


12:06.955 --> 12:08.122
What are you doing?


12:08.122 --> 12:09.749
I was just congratulating Ricky.


12:09.748 --> 12:11.000
Hi, Tina. 


12:12.418 --> 12:13.168
Hi, Gloria.


12:13.168 --> 12:13.961
Hi, Brother Williams.


12:13.962 --> 12:14.629
How are you?


12:14.628 --> 12:14.921
Good. 


12:14.922 --> 12:16.757
I would love to talk to you,
 but I have an appointment. 


12:16.757 --> 12:17.632
I got to go.


12:17.632 --> 12:18.090
Oh.


12:18.090 --> 12:19.175
Talk to you later, OK?


12:19.175 --> 12:21.762
Oh, OK. 


12:21.762 --> 12:22.929
Brian, 


12:22.928 --> 12:24.096
where is Gloria going? 


12:24.097 --> 12:25.015
Is she OK?


12:25.015 --> 12:28.518
Oh, yeah, Brother Williams,
uh, she-she had to leave. 


12:28.518 --> 12:31.478
Um, Gloria is going to catch 
the rest of the assembly next week. 


12:31.478 --> 12:35.650
Um, it’s just been so busy
with her real estate job lately. 


12:35.650 --> 12:37.193
We needed the extra money. 


12:37.193 --> 12:38.653
You know, 
we moved into a better place


12:38.653 --> 12:40.655
over on the east side of town,


12:40.655 --> 12:43.825
well, I’m working
a little bit more too. 


12:43.825 --> 12:45.000
I’m just trying to make her happy.


12:48.788 --> 12:50.000
True happiness, Brian


12:51.248 --> 12:54.793
—joy—it’s spiritual. 


12:54.793 --> 12:59.000
You can’t satisfy
spiritual needs with material things.


13:00.342 --> 13:02.427
I know, Brother Williams, 


13:02.427 --> 13:04.929
but this extra stress, 
it’s just temporary. 


13:04.928 --> 13:07.181
I’ve-I’ve thought it all through. 


13:07.182 --> 13:10.435
We’ve prayed about it,
and we’ve asked


13:10.435 --> 13:12.437
for Jehovah to bless this decision.


13:12.437 --> 13:15.357
Now you know, Brian,


13:15.357 --> 13:18.402
Jehovah God cannot bless a decision


13:18.402 --> 13:20.945
if it is not in harmony with his will. 


13:20.945 --> 13:22.738
Look at yourself. 


13:22.738 --> 13:25.000
You don’t seem happy.


13:26.492 --> 13:28.537
But what can I do now?


13:28.537 --> 13:31.999
Do all you can to protect
your family spiritually 


13:31.998 --> 13:34.000
and to save your girls.


13:38.128 --> 13:40.506
I appreciate the encouragement, 
Brother Williams.


13:40.507 --> 13:42.000
You’re welcome.


13:43.885 --> 13:45.887
You know, 
it seems like it’s been a while


13:45.887 --> 13:47.347
since we’ve been able to talk like this.


13:47.347 --> 13:49.000
Oh, it has been.


13:50.100 --> 13:53.060
If you’re not busy,
would you be able to come over


13:53.060 --> 13:55.063
and join us for dinner 
tomorrow night?


13:55.063 --> 13:57.023
You know,
I would love to do that. 


13:57.023 --> 14:00.443
Why don’t you text me
your new address and the time,


14:00.443 --> 14:02.695
and I’ll look forward 
to seeing you tomorrow. 


14:02.695 --> 14:03.488
That sounds good?


14:03.488 --> 14:04.363
That sounds great.


14:04.363 --> 14:05.156
Excellent.


14:05.157 --> 14:06.157
Thank you, Brother Williams.


14:06.157 --> 14:07.367
I look forward
to seeing you tomorrow. 


14:07.367 --> 14:07.992
OK.


14:07.992 --> 14:09.000
OK. 
Bye-bye.


14:19.753 --> 14:21.923
Hey, Mom, 
can I help with anything?


14:21.923 --> 14:22.590
Oh, yeah. 


14:22.590 --> 14:23.967
Can you put
the lemons in the water?


14:23.967 --> 14:24.550
OK.


14:24.550 --> 14:27.678
Hey, guys, Brother Williams
is going to be here any minute, OK?


14:27.678 --> 14:28.000
OK. 


14:31.557 --> 14:33.560
And Anna and her friend
from the North Congregation


14:33.560 --> 14:35.018
are supposed to come too, right?


14:35.018 --> 14:37.000
Yep, that’s the plan.


14:40.023 --> 14:40.983
I’ll get it.


14:40.983 --> 14:42.000
Thank you, Tina.


14:46.697 --> 14:48.450
Hey, Brother Williams.


14:48.450 --> 14:49.033
Hi, Tina.


14:49.033 --> 14:49.575
Come on in.


14:49.575 --> 14:50.160
How are you?


14:50.160 --> 14:50.785
Good.


14:50.785 --> 14:51.912
It’s good to see you.


14:51.912 --> 14:53.370
Brother Williams, you made it.


14:53.370 --> 14:54.372
Thanks for coming over.


14:54.372 --> 14:56.165
Of course. 
Thanks for the invitation. 


14:56.165 --> 14:57.125
Very nice.


14:57.125 --> 14:58.543
Welcome.


14:58.543 --> 14:59.710
Hi, Gloria.


14:59.710 --> 15:01.170
Hi, Brother Williams.


15:01.170 --> 15:04.798
I think I’d get lost
in this big apartment.


15:04.798 --> 15:06.000
Jehovah blessed 
us for our hard work.


15:07.760 --> 15:09.762
Really, it just means longer hours


15:09.762 --> 15:12.974
on the job and more work
around the house.


15:12.973 --> 15:15.226
You know, 
the other day in field service, 


15:15.227 --> 15:16.812
we passed by your old house. 


15:16.812 --> 15:18.062
I liked that place. 


15:18.062 --> 15:19.939
I remember our nice visits there.


15:19.938 --> 15:21.356
I do too. 


15:21.357 --> 15:22.942
That was a great place. 


15:22.942 --> 15:24.319
Well, Tina, do you want to show 


15:24.318 --> 15:26.028
Brother Williams around
while I finish the coffee?


15:26.028 --> 15:28.000
OK, come on in.


15:30.908 --> 15:33.243
Brother Williams
likes the old place.


15:33.243 --> 15:36.000
It seems like he likes it here too.


15:42.128 --> 15:44.130
It all seems very nice. 


15:44.130 --> 15:46.423
What do you think
of this place, Tina?


15:46.423 --> 15:50.303
Well, honestly, 


15:50.303 --> 15:53.096
I wish we never left the other place.


15:53.097 --> 15:53.724
Really? 


15:53.723 --> 15:55.000
Why do you feel that way?


15:57.227 --> 16:00.397
Everything is so different here. 


16:00.397 --> 16:01.899
Everything has to look good 


16:01.898 --> 16:03.273
for you to fit in.


16:03.273 --> 16:05.610
You have to wear the nicest clothes. 


16:05.610 --> 16:08.613
You have to drive
the most expensive car. 


16:08.613 --> 16:13.535
Everything is— It’s just—
It’s just different, that’s all.


16:13.535 --> 16:15.828
Yeah, you know, I understand. 


16:15.828 --> 16:18.915
I was about your age when we moved
into a new neighborhood,


16:18.915 --> 16:21.083
and it can certainly be challenging. 


16:21.083 --> 16:23.836
But you know what might help? 


16:23.837 --> 16:25.255
If you set a new goal.


16:25.255 --> 16:26.713
OK, like what?


16:26.713 --> 16:28.131
Well, what do you think? 


16:28.132 --> 16:29.675
What interests you?


16:29.675 --> 16:34.680
Well, I was thinking
of learning a new language.


16:34.680 --> 16:35.848
Really? 


16:35.848 --> 16:38.726
That’s an excellent goal. 


16:38.727 --> 16:40.979
What do you think of Ricky
learning sign language?


16:40.978 --> 16:42.855
Ah, I think it’s really exciting.


16:42.855 --> 16:43.982
I do too. 


16:43.982 --> 16:46.734
You know, he is really
making the truth his own, 


16:46.733 --> 16:48.820
and if he keeps on applying himself,


16:48.820 --> 16:51.238
Jehovah God is
going to really bless him.


16:51.238 --> 16:52.198
Yeah.


16:52.198 --> 16:53.991
I was hoping to see Anna. 


16:53.992 --> 16:55.075
Is Anna here?


16:55.075 --> 16:57.662
Oh, she is with Kevin.


16:57.662 --> 16:58.622
Kevin? 


16:58.622 --> 17:00.122
Kevin who?


17:00.122 --> 17:01.582
Kevin is one of our relatives. 


17:01.582 --> 17:03.669
They work together
at a pharmaceutical company. 


17:03.668 --> 17:06.000
He’s a pretty nice guy
and from a nice family too.


17:07.713 --> 17:09.000
Tina, are you OK?


17:10.800 --> 17:13.000
How do you think Anna is doing?


17:15.972 --> 17:19.017
Um, she’s— 


17:19.017 --> 17:22.145
she’s going through
different things right now. 


17:22.145 --> 17:25.022
We invited her friend over
from the other congregation 


17:25.022 --> 17:26.482
to maybe encourage her.


17:26.482 --> 17:28.944
That’s nice. 


17:28.943 --> 17:31.946
But you know, 
I have to commend you


17:31.947 --> 17:35.032
because you’re
doing so well spiritually,


17:35.032 --> 17:37.494
keeping up with your spiritual routine, 


17:37.493 --> 17:40.663
and you’re thinking about learning
a new language so you can help out.


17:40.663 --> 17:41.788
Keep up the good work. 


17:41.788 --> 17:42.000
Don’t give up. 


17:43.667 --> 17:47.000
But, Tina, we’re not
going to give up on your sister. 


17:48.880 --> 17:52.925
She has the potential of being
a fine servant of Jehovah. 


17:52.925 --> 17:54.677
And she has a good heart. 


17:54.677 --> 17:58.139
I’m confident that in time, 
she’s going to make the right decisions.


17:58.138 --> 17:59.598
Brother Williams, 
here is your coffee.


17:59.598 --> 18:01.766
Thank you.


18:01.767 --> 18:03.812
Sorry, Brother Williams,
I have to finish getting ready.


18:03.812 --> 18:05.000
Oh, OK.


18:06.730 --> 18:08.357
This looks really good, Anna. 


18:08.357 --> 18:08.900
Good job.


18:08.900 --> 18:09.942
Really? 


18:09.942 --> 18:11.069
Thanks.


18:11.068 --> 18:13.570
Hey, we’re still
behind schedule, though, 


18:13.570 --> 18:15.573
so I’m going to have to ask
you to work overtime 


18:15.573 --> 18:17.783
with the rest of the team
just until we get caught up. 


18:17.783 --> 18:18.283
OK?


18:18.283 --> 18:19.910
But I can’t tonight. 


18:19.910 --> 18:21.870
I have a family dinner 
I have to go to.


18:21.870 --> 18:22.497
Dinner? 


18:22.497 --> 18:26.334
Anna, if you want to be successful,
work needs to come first. 


18:26.333 --> 18:29.000
Everyone else is doing it.


18:30.212 --> 18:31.339
Fine. 


18:31.338 --> 18:33.548
I’ll text my mom
and tell her I can’t make it.


18:33.548 --> 18:34.258
Good. 


18:34.258 --> 18:35.551
Don’t worry. 
She’ll understand.


18:35.552 --> 18:38.387
It’s not my mom
I’m worried about; it’s my dad. 


18:38.387 --> 18:41.224
He doesn’t want me
working late anymore.


18:41.223 --> 18:43.308
Fine, um, I’ll cover for you. 


18:43.308 --> 18:46.395
We’re all working late anyways,
so I’ll give everyone a ride home


18:46.395 --> 18:48.563
and afterwards 
we’ll step in for a few minutes


18:48.563 --> 18:50.525
and I’ll explain that it’s all my fault. 


18:50.525 --> 18:51.000
OK?


18:52.527 --> 18:53.485
OK.


18:53.485 --> 18:54.862
So does this mean


18:54.862 --> 18:56.822
we’re going to meet
those uptight parents of yours?


18:56.822 --> 18:58.074
They’re not that uptight.


18:58.073 --> 18:58.783
I’m kidding. 


18:58.783 --> 18:59.741
Lighten up.


18:59.742 --> 19:02.704
Hey, Anna’s family
is pretty conservative, 


19:02.703 --> 19:04.663
so just be careful what you do say.


19:04.663 --> 19:06.623
This should be interesting.


19:06.623 --> 19:08.000
Tess, just be nice, OK?


19:11.712 --> 19:13.882
I had a really good time tonight. 


19:13.882 --> 19:16.050
I’m glad 
Brother Williams could make it.


19:16.050 --> 19:17.718
Yeah, it was very nice.


19:17.718 --> 19:19.553
Yeah, I think
he had a good time too.


19:19.553 --> 19:20.000
Yeah. 


19:21.972 --> 19:23.725
Oh, Anna is home.


19:23.725 --> 19:24.683
Hi.


19:24.683 --> 19:26.143
Hey.


19:26.143 --> 19:27.895
It’s customary to take our shoes off. 


19:27.895 --> 19:28.437
So—


19:28.437 --> 19:28.980
Oh, OK.


19:28.980 --> 19:30.398
Hey, Kevin is here too. 


19:30.398 --> 19:32.733
Come on in, guys. 


19:32.733 --> 19:36.903
Um, I know Kevin,
but who are your friends, Anna?


19:36.903 --> 19:37.571
Oh, yeah. 


19:37.572 --> 19:40.115
Mom, Dad, this is Tess and Eric. 


19:40.115 --> 19:41.450
We’re in the same intern program.


19:41.450 --> 19:42.410
Nice to meet you all.


19:42.410 --> 19:43.000
Come on in. 
Have a seat.


19:44.828 --> 19:46.580
Anna, come here.


19:46.580 --> 19:50.000
Um, would you like something
to eat or drink?  


19:51.460 --> 19:52.462
Anna,


19:52.462 --> 19:54.339
you missed dinner
with Brother Williams tonight. 


19:54.338 --> 19:56.923
And your friend from the North Congregation,
she came too. 


19:56.923 --> 19:58.091
What happened?


19:58.092 --> 20:00.929
Dad, I know,
but we had to work late. 


20:00.928 --> 20:02.305
I sent Mom a text.


20:02.305 --> 20:02.972
Anna, 


20:02.972 --> 20:06.000
I was trying to do something
spiritually encouraging for the family. 


20:07.435 --> 20:09.103
We’re worried about you, Honey.


20:09.103 --> 20:09.561
OK, Dad,


20:09.562 --> 20:12.482
I’m sorry,
but it’s no big deal. 


20:12.482 --> 20:14.567
It’s just that the new medication
we’re working on,


20:14.567 --> 20:16.069
it goes to market soon. 


20:16.068 --> 20:17.528
It’s really important. 


20:17.528 --> 20:19.488
It could save people’s lives.


20:19.488 --> 20:20.656
No big deal? 


20:20.657 --> 20:25.454
Anna, first of all, you know only
God’s Kingdom will solve our problems. 


20:25.453 --> 20:27.746
These kids and your work, 


20:27.747 --> 20:30.584
it’s getting in the way
of what’s most important.


20:30.583 --> 20:32.876
Dad, these kids are on my team,


20:32.877 --> 20:35.755
and they understand what I’m
working on, the brothers don’t. 


20:35.755 --> 20:37.423
It’s way over their heads.


20:37.423 --> 20:39.800
Anna, don’t you see? 


20:39.800 --> 20:40.885
They’re changing you.


20:40.885 --> 20:42.137
Would you relax? 


20:42.137 --> 20:44.000
Just go talk to them, OK?


20:51.520 --> 20:52.188
You know,


20:52.188 --> 20:55.065
I really wanted
to apologize to both of you. 


20:55.065 --> 20:57.318
It’s my fault that Anna is late today. 


20:57.318 --> 20:59.028
I asked the entire team
to work overtime


20:59.028 --> 21:00.613
so we could get caught up
on the schedule. 


21:00.613 --> 21:03.031
But just to let you know, 
she’s doing really good. 


21:03.032 --> 21:05.075
And we really do enjoy
having her on the team.


21:05.075 --> 21:06.202
OK, thank you.


21:06.202 --> 21:06.952
You know, 


21:06.952 --> 21:09.580
not just that, she’s working
with some good people. 


21:09.580 --> 21:12.040
Tess and Eric, 
they’re some of the best


21:12.040 --> 21:14.002
up-and-coming talents 
we have in the field.


21:14.002 --> 21:16.379
Your parents 
must be really proud of you.


21:16.378 --> 21:18.755
Well, my moms
are both really proud of me. 


21:18.755 --> 21:20.842
I was raised by two wonderful women, 


21:20.842 --> 21:22.927
you know, life partners.


21:22.927 --> 21:24.000
Oh, huh.


21:25.262 --> 21:25.889
Yeah. 


21:25.888 --> 21:28.850
Um, you know, 
my assistant, Marty? 


21:28.850 --> 21:31.310
I recently found out that he’s gay.


21:31.310 --> 21:33.520
You say that like there’s
something wrong with it. 


21:33.520 --> 21:34.772
Do you have a problem?


21:34.772 --> 21:36.065
Tess, don’t do this.


21:36.065 --> 21:36.690
Why? 


21:36.690 --> 21:38.400
There’s nothing wrong with being gay.


21:38.400 --> 21:39.402
Tess,


21:39.402 --> 21:42.070
we live by the Bible’s moral standards, 


21:42.070 --> 21:45.742
but we don’t force
our beliefs on other people, 


21:45.742 --> 21:47.160
and we don’t judge anyone either.


21:47.160 --> 21:48.870
But you do think being gay is wrong.


21:48.870 --> 21:52.207
Eric, remember where we’re at.


21:52.207 --> 21:55.250
Well, we believe there are
standards of right and wrong


21:55.250 --> 21:56.460
that we should live by,


21:56.460 --> 21:57.920
and God’s Word says that 


21:57.920 --> 21:59.963
sex is meant to be between
a man and a woman 


21:59.963 --> 22:01.548
who are married to each other.


22:01.548 --> 22:02.258
Look, 


22:02.258 --> 22:05.385
I don’t mean to be rude, Sir,
but the world has changed.


22:05.385 --> 22:08.347
Honey, maybe we’re being
too harsh on gays. 


22:08.347 --> 22:11.100
Some people just seem
to be programmed that way.


22:11.100 --> 22:13.853
Look, I know not everyone
agrees with us,


22:13.853 --> 22:15.855
but we all have free will, 


22:15.855 --> 22:18.773
and God lets us choose
to live by his standards or not. 


22:18.773 --> 22:22.320
If we go against his standards, 
we end up hurting ourselves. 


22:22.320 --> 22:25.782
He just wants what’s best for us.


22:25.782 --> 22:28.242
Anna, what about you? 


22:28.242 --> 22:30.000
Do you agree with your father?


22:31.870 --> 22:33.000
Well—


22:35.750 --> 22:39.337
You know, we actually have
another project due tomorrow. 


22:39.337 --> 22:41.339
It’s probably best
that we get going.


22:41.338 --> 22:41.880
Yeah.


22:41.880 --> 22:42.465
Wait. 


22:42.465 --> 22:45.000
At least let me
walk you guys outside.


22:59.648 --> 23:02.066
So this is our Anna’s association.


23:02.067 --> 23:04.362
They’re just kids. 


23:04.362 --> 23:07.740
Kids talk like they know everything.


23:07.740 --> 23:10.000
Our Anna believes them.


23:17.458 --> 23:20.878
OK, so I think you
have all the invoices, right?


23:20.878 --> 23:23.130
I gave you all the receipts, right?


23:23.130 --> 23:26.000
Yep, I just got a couple more steps. 


23:31.847 --> 23:33.557
OK, Joe,


23:33.557 --> 23:35.017
your books are clean. 


23:35.017 --> 23:36.602
I have no more concerns, 


23:36.602 --> 23:38.000
and amazingly, 
you’re out of debt.


23:43.858 --> 23:45.110
Amazingly. 


23:45.110 --> 23:47.447
I don’t-I don’t think so, man. 


23:47.447 --> 23:49.115
It’s like you’ve always said,


23:49.115 --> 23:51.658
“If you do things Jehovah’s way,” 


23:51.658 --> 23:52.993
right? 


23:52.993 --> 23:54.995
“He’ll help us.”


23:54.995 --> 23:57.163
Hey, um, I got to go. 


23:57.163 --> 23:59.125
Um, you’ve got
everything that you need. 


23:59.125 --> 24:00.125
I think it looks good. 


24:00.125 --> 24:02.337
So I’m just going to leave, OK?


24:02.337 --> 24:03.879
Oh, oh, all right, OK. 


24:03.878 --> 24:08.633
Hey-hey, Brian, um, could you
stick around for another minute? 


24:08.633 --> 24:11.136
There’s something
I need to talk to you about.


24:11.137 --> 24:12.764
Um, yeah, sure.


24:12.763 --> 24:14.000
Yeah, thanks. 


24:22.773 --> 24:25.483
Look, Brian, I owe you
a huge debt of gratitude, man. 


24:25.483 --> 24:28.695
Um, I was thinking back on
when we first started studying. 


24:28.695 --> 24:29.447
Do you remember that? 


24:29.447 --> 24:32.074
I had all sorts of issues with my life, 


24:32.073 --> 24:34.993
my family, my business.


24:34.993 --> 24:36.995
And my whole life was messed up, 


24:36.995 --> 24:42.000
and one of the things that you always
talked to me about was Matthew 6:24. 


24:42.000 --> 24:43.127
Do you remember that? 


24:43.127 --> 24:45.129
‘No one can serve two masters. 


24:45.128 --> 24:48.548
You cannot slave 
for God and for Riches.’


24:48.548 --> 24:50.801
I’m sorry, Joe, 
I’m not getting it. 


24:50.802 --> 24:52.804
What are you trying to say?


24:52.803 --> 24:55.180
Well, I guess 
what I’m trying to say is


24:55.180 --> 24:57.000
I’m concerned about you.


24:58.183 --> 24:59.518
About me?


24:59.518 --> 25:02.228
Yes, yes, about you


25:02.228 --> 25:04.148
and your family. 


25:04.148 --> 25:06.316
And I’m not talking about financially. 


25:06.317 --> 25:08.527
Brian, I’m talking about spiritually.


25:08.527 --> 25:10.905
I mean, you’re the one who
—who always taught me


25:10.905 --> 25:14.075
to never cave in to other
people’s expectations of me. 


25:14.075 --> 25:17.160
And now it seems like
—like you’re the one who’s doing that.


25:17.160 --> 25:19.413
Man, what are you 
talking about, Joe?


25:19.413 --> 25:20.663
Brian, 


25:20.663 --> 25:24.418
your whole life is changing,
man, and not for the better. 


25:24.418 --> 25:24.918
Look,


25:24.918 --> 25:27.253
it’s written all over your face!


25:27.253 --> 25:30.381
Listen, you have no idea
how much pressure 


25:30.382 --> 25:32.175
Gloria is putting on me. 


25:32.175 --> 25:35.470
You don’t know what it’s like
to try to balance two lives


25:35.470 --> 25:38.098
—two worlds—
and try to make it work.


25:38.098 --> 25:40.141
No, man, you’re right. 


25:40.142 --> 25:41.560
You’re right. 
I don’t know what that’s like.


25:41.560 --> 25:42.812
So don’t tell me 


25:42.812 --> 25:45.064
about not changing for the better.


25:45.063 --> 25:46.356
Brian, 


25:46.357 --> 25:49.319
all I know is what you taught me. 


25:49.318 --> 25:51.486
And what you taught me 
was good, man. 


25:51.487 --> 25:53.447
You made me look at myself, 


25:53.447 --> 25:56.409
my-my family, my whole situation. 


25:56.408 --> 25:59.786
And I had to ask myself:
‘Do-do I really know God? 


25:59.787 --> 26:02.039
Am I truly happy?’


26:02.038 --> 26:04.040
I mean, what you taught me, Brian,


26:04.040 --> 26:06.418
it gave me something new
—the new world. 


26:06.418 --> 26:07.420
It opened that up to me. 


26:07.420 --> 26:09.547
It gave me and Mary and the kids,


26:09.547 --> 26:12.759
it gave us all something
to live for, Brian. 


26:12.758 --> 26:14.801
But now when I look at you


26:14.802 --> 26:19.307
—my-my teacher,
my brother, my friend—


26:19.307 --> 26:22.000
all I see is an unhappy man.


26:23.643 --> 26:28.815
So I thought it’d be a kind thing
to help you the way you helped me. 


26:28.815 --> 26:30.567
Brian,
I made those changes in my life, 


26:30.567 --> 26:33.000
the repairs that you
helped me to make. 


26:34.238 --> 26:39.910
So I just thought you could use
a little reminder yourself


26:39.910 --> 26:44.000
because, frankly, you’re not 
the same person that I once knew.


26:46.875 --> 26:49.000
Man, I got to go.


26:56.635 --> 26:59.000
Thanks for listening.


27:05.435 --> 27:07.813
Next time
on Remember the Wife of Lot.


27:07.813 --> 27:10.190
The way you live reflects on me.


27:10.190 --> 27:13.485
You must learn to keep
your religion in its place.


27:13.485 --> 27:16.988
You could lose all this very easily. 


27:16.988 --> 27:19.073
Do you understand?


27:19.073 --> 27:22.578
Think of all we taught the girls
when they were little


27:22.578 --> 27:26.206
about putting Jehovah 
ahead of everything else.


27:26.207 --> 27:27.290
This is your copy here.


27:27.290 --> 27:28.083
OK, thank you.


27:28.083 --> 27:29.000
OK.


27:29.000 --> 27:30.543
Director Williams, 


27:30.543 --> 27:32.211
this is a nice surprise. 


27:32.212 --> 27:34.507
I haven’t seen you since you
were overseeing our division.


27:34.507 --> 27:36.009
But I mean, 
what brings you here?


27:36.008 --> 27:37.216
If you have a moment, 


27:37.217 --> 27:46.499
I’d love to tell you about it.

00:02 Hello, and welcome to this month’s broadcast!
00:05 With me I have a good friend  as my cohost, Leon Weaver.
00:10 Leon, what do we have  to look forward to this time?
00:13 Thanks, Brother Lösch.
00:15 We’ll see a young brother who must choose
00:17 between his loyalty to Jehovah
00:19 or to a close friend.
00:21 Which will he choose?
00:25 Then we’ll hear the story of Rafika Morris,
00:27 a young woman  who desperately fought for racial equality
00:32 but eventually discovers  the real path to peace.
00:38 And we’ll also enjoy a new music video
00:40 that beautifully highlights the importance
00:43 of putting our confidence in Jehovah.
00:47 We have much to look forward to
00:49 in this March 2018 edition
00:52 of JW Broadcasting!
01:13 The theme for this month is
01:16 “In Whom Do You Trust?”
01:18 Do you trust me?
01:20 I hope so.
01:21 All of us want to be trusted.
01:23 Trust is a basic element of everyday life.
01:27 To trust others is a normal reaction.
01:30 Many of us have traveled on a train or a bus.
01:34 Did we worry whether  the conductor or driver
01:37 would bring us safely to our destination?
01:39 Normally, we do not worry.
01:42 We trust an airplane captain  to take us safely to our destination.
01:47 We trust that when we enter an elevator,
01:49 it will not crash at the bottom of the shaft,
01:52 but safely take us to the desired floor.
01:56 When we marry, we trust that  our partner will remain faithful.
02:00 In many situations in life we need trust.
02:05 What is trust?
02:06 Trust is the “firm belief in the reliability,
02:10 truth, or ability of someone or something.”
02:15 Webster’s dictionary says  that it is “confidence”;
02:18 a “reliance [or] resting  of the mind on the integrity,
02:22 “veracity, justice, friendship,
02:25 or other sound principle, of another person.”
02:29 Trust is related to confidence,
02:32 belief, faith, and assurance.
02:36 Experiments conducted  by Professor Dr. Michael Kosfeld,
02:41 a professor at a university  in Frankfurt, Germany,
02:45 led him to the conclusion that trust
02:47 is “a biologically-based part  of human nature.”
02:53 Kosfeld discovered that when  there is interaction between two people,
02:58 the human brain releases  a hormone that stimulates trust.
03:03 “It is, in fact,  one of the distinguishing features
03:06 of the human species,” Kosfeld states.
03:11 In everyday life, how discouraged  some are if they are not trusted.
03:16 The phrase “Don’t you trust me?”
03:18 is frequently heard with an undertone of sadness or complaint.
03:24 Sometimes children or teenagers ask their parents
03:27 “Don’t you trust me?” when the parents place some restrictions on them,
03:32 perhaps in connection with leisure-time activities.
03:35 Parents do that because they love you young ones
03:39 and want to prevent any spiritual or physical harm befalling you.
03:44 If you cooperate, you will see that parents
03:47 will gradually trust you ever more
03:50 and grant more liberty to you.
03:53 You can prove to them that you are trustworthy.
03:58 In the world,  many people are not trustworthy.
04:01 Since we are living in the time of the end
04:03 and the demons are desperate  and have influenced many people,
04:08 we have to admit that trusting in everybody is not wise.
04:13 Many trusted in religion and were disappointed.
04:17 Others trusted in governments or the United Nations,
04:20 but they were disappointed.
04:22 They trusted political leaders that made all kinds of promises
04:26 but did not keep all of them.
04:28 Some politicians were even exposed as being liars.
04:33 Proverbs 14:15 says:
04:36 “The naive person believes every word,
04:39 but the shrewd one ponders each step.”
04:43 If somebody, even in the truth, promises us big monetary returns
04:48 if we give him money for his planned investment,
04:51 we need to be careful and not believe every word.
04:55 Some that spent their money were in for a disappointment
04:59 when they learned that everything was lost.
05:03 We also should not trust everything we read
05:06 in newspapers or see on television.
05:10 There is another thing we should not trust in—riches.
05:14 Psalm 49:6 speaks about “those who are trusting in their wealth
05:19 and who boast about their great riches.”
05:23 Trusting in riches often leads to disappointment.
05:27 “The one trusting in his riches will fall,”
05:30 says Proverbs 11:28.
05:34 It is not wrong to be rich;  just do not trust in riches.
05:39 Riches are a risk factor.
05:43 Many people today are dishonest and cheat.
05:46 Some business owners have installed
05:48 cameras at the workplace,
05:50 since they do not trust their employees to put in a full day of work.
05:55 They know that some would play video games during work hours.
06:00 But Jehovah created us with the inclination to trust.
06:05 We can especially trust our spiritual brothers.
06:08 True, once in a while such trust is misplaced.
06:12 A few commit serious sins and have to be disfellowshipped.
06:16 But that is rare.
06:19 Jehovah himself is the best example of trusting in others.
06:24 He trusted the Logos to faithfully cooperate
06:27 with him as the “master worker” in creating the universe,
06:32 the earth, and all the living things on earth, including mankind.
06:37 What tremendous trust Jehovah showed in Jesus when He sent him to the earth.
06:43 Jehovah trusted that Jesus would remain faithful
06:46 and redeem mankind  so that His will and purpose with mankind
06:51 and the earth could be accomplished.
06:53 Jehovah trusted him so much that he arranged for prophecies
06:58 to be written that foretold that he would die faithfully.
07:02 This trust on the part of Jehovah was not a risk.
07:06 It was based on the collaboration between the two for aeons of time.
07:13 Think of the prophecy at Psalm 16:10:
07:16 “For you will not leave me in the Grave.”
07:21 Jesus had free will.
07:23 This means that theoretically  he could have sinned.
07:26 If he could not have sinned,
07:29 Satan probably would not have tried three times to tempt Jesus to sin.
07:35 If Jesus could not have sinned,
07:37 why would he be so heavily distressed
07:39 in the garden of Gethsemane that he was sweating blood?
07:43 Why send an angel to comfort and strengthen him
07:46 if he could not sin or fail anyway?
07:51 No question that Jesus felt the unfathomable load
07:55 on his shoulders to remain faithful,
07:59 since not only the salvation of mankind depended on him
08:03 but also the vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty.
08:07 He did not want to disappoint Jehovah.
08:10 Jesus used his own free will
08:13 and was determined to stay loyal.
08:16 How glad we are that he did!
08:20 On the other hand,  Jesus also trusted Jehovah completely.
08:25 He trusted Jehovah that he would resurrect him if he would die faithfully.
08:31 Actually, Jesus was publicly known to trust in Jehovah.
08:35 People that passed by when he was on the torture stake were saying:
08:40 “He has put his trust in God;
08:43 “let Him now rescue him if He wants him,
08:46 for he said, ‘I am God’s Son.’”
08:49 Another example of trust was Abraham.
08:52 When God told him to kill his beloved son Isaac,
08:55 Abraham was willing to do so.
08:58 He trusted that Jehovah could resurrect him.
09:03 Hebrews 11:19 says:
09:05 “He reasoned that God was able to raise him up even from the dead,
09:10 and he did receive him from there in an illustrative way.”
09:14 First Corinthians 13:7 says that
09:17 love “believes all things.”
09:21 Love trusts that prophecies will come true.
09:24 It also believes what our brothers tell us.
09:28 It also helps to grant others the benefit of the doubt
09:31 if a matter could be interpreted in different ways.
09:36 Yes, trusting others is an expression of love.
09:40 If you love somebody, you only assume and think the best of him.
09:46 Another example of trust in Jehovah was Moses.
09:50 He led the nation of Israel out of Egypt into the desert
09:55 —a nation upwards of three million people.
09:58 And they had flocks of cattle and sheep with them.
10:03 When he left Egypt,  did he know how to provide
10:06 these great crowds with water in the desert?
10:09 Did he know what they would be eating
10:11 after the initial foodstuffs that they took out of Egypt ran out?
10:16 Did he know in advance that Jehovah  would miraculously provide the manna?
10:21 It doesn’t seem so.
10:23 But he trusted that Jehovah  would take care of the people.
10:30 The three friends of Daniel were another fine example of trust.
10:34 They did not bow and worship in front of an idol
10:37 that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
10:41 They were told they would be thrown into a fiery furnace if they disobeyed.
10:47 They remained firm and were protected by an angel,
10:51 so that the fire did not do any harm to them.
10:54 After that
10:56 “Nebuchadnezzar then declared:
10:59 “‘Praised be the God of Shadrach,  Meshach, and Abednego,
11:03 “‘who sent his angel and rescued his servants.
11:06 “‘They trusted in him and went against the command of the king
11:11 “‘and were willing to die rather than serve
11:13 or worship any god except their own God.’”
11:17 As we are getting ever closer to the great tribulation,
11:21 we might be confronted with scary challenges
11:24 and tests related to nationalism.
11:27 Will we keep trusting Jehovah?
11:30 We trust we will.
11:32 Jehovah will miraculously save his  people throughout the great tribulation
11:37 and arrange for their survival.
11:40 Today, the faithful slave is put in charge of providing spiritual food for God’s people,
11:45 who number into the millions.
11:49 The slave also shows complete trust in Jehovah
11:52 that he will guide them with his holy spirit.
11:56 What makes it possible  for the “faithful and discreet slave”
11:59 to provide precious spiritual food?
12:03 “I will give you insight and instruct you in the way you should go,”
12:08 says Jehovah at Psalm 32:8.
12:13 Today, Jehovah provides direction to the slave through Jesus.
12:17 Jesus, in turn,  provides direction for his people
12:21 through “the faithful and discreet slave.”
12:24 We can therefore have full confidence
12:27 in the Scriptural insight,  understanding, and guidance.
12:33 Satan tries to sow mistrust.
12:36 Under Communist dictatorship in Romania,
12:39 secret police officers forced a responsible brother
12:42 to walk with them on a heavily frequented street
12:45 hoping that other brothers would see this
12:48 and wrongly conclude that this brother works with the secret police.
12:53 Did the scheme work out?
12:55 No, it failed.
12:57 Brothers did see him but kept trusting him.
13:01 We learn that we should not quickly lose trust in our brothers.
13:08 Satan also has the scheme  to spread rumors about faithful brothers,
13:12 including the faithful slave.
13:16 The method of spreading rumors is not new.
13:19 When Jesus was resurrected and the tomb was empty,
13:22 the soldiers who reported it  were told to spread the rumor
13:26 that the disciples came  and stole the body at night.
13:30 Matthew 28:15 relates:
13:35 “So they took the silver pieces and did as they were instructed,
13:39 and this story has been spread abroad among the Jews up to this very day.”
13:45 Another rumor in the first century was that Christians
13:48 were responsible for the great fire of Rome.
13:52 Could such an accusation be true?
13:55 Historians say that it was Nero,
13:58 the emperor, who set fire to the city.
14:03 Today, rumors are occasionally being spread in electronic form about the faithful slave.
14:08 This has caused some concern on the part of some brothers,
14:11 especially when the reports are commenting on court cases
14:16 where some in the organization were accused.
14:20 Sometimes reference is made to certain quotes and then readers think,
14:25 ‘How can a quote be a rumor?’
14:27 A quote can be taken out of context.
14:31 Critical reports often  give only part of a matter
14:35 and leave out other aspects.
14:38 Often, such rumors play on the emotions.
14:43 Ask yourself: ‘Am I prone to believe rumors?
14:47 ‘And even if I am, should I spread it
14:51 ‘and undermine the trust that others have in the slave
14:54 or in representatives of the branch office?’
14:59 Avoid sensationalism  by not saying something like
15:03 “Can you believe what I heard about this matter or that matter
15:06 or this person or that person?”  referring to a statement
15:11 that may have appeared on Facebook, YouTube, or Twitter.
15:16 The spread of rumors is like wildfire that is hard to control.
15:21 It spreads distrust and can undermine someone’s faith.
15:26 This is not to say that the slave is perfect and never makes mistakes.
15:31 But Jehovah and Jesus trust the imperfect slave
15:35 who cares for things to the best of his ability
15:38 and with the best of motives.
15:40 Shouldn’t we then trust the imperfect slave as well?
15:46 To appreciate the extent of Jehovah and Jesus’ trust in the faithful slave,
15:51 reflect on what he has promised its members.
15:55 He has promised them immortality and incorruption.
16:01 Soon, just before Armageddon,
16:03 the remaining members of the slave will be taken to heaven.
16:07 Since 1919 of our Common Era,
16:10 the slave has been put in charge of some belongings of Christ.
16:14 According to Matthew 24:47,
16:18 when the anointed are taken to heaven, Jesus will at that point entrust
16:23 “all his belongings” to them.
16:27 Does this not reveal immense trust?
16:32 Revelation 4:4 describes  these resurrected anointed
16:36 as corulers with Christ.
16:39 Revelation 22:5 says they will rule,
16:43 not only for a thousand years
16:45 but “forever and ever.”
16:50 What immense trust  Jesus shows toward them!
16:55 Since Jehovah God and Jesus Christ
16:58 completely trust “the faithful and discreet slave,”
17:01 should we not do the same?
17:06 Many servants of Jehovah in the past  showed trust in Jehovah
17:09 when confronted with obstacles or opposition.
17:13 We can trust that Jehovah will not let us be tested beyond what we can bear
17:18 but will provide a “way out”
17:21 so we can remain faithful under trials.
17:25 So whom do you trust?
17:28 You fully trust in Jehovah,  Jesus, and the faithful slave.
17:34 To a reasonable degree, you also trust all your fellow brothers and sisters.
17:40 The writer of Psalm 119:42 mentioned something else we need to trust in
17:45 —God’s Word.
17:47 He wrote:
17:49 “For I put my trust in your word.”
17:53 The prophecies in God’s Word have always come true at the proper time.
17:58 Based on that, we can fully trust that the remaining prophecies
18:02 pointing to the survival of the great tribulation
18:06 and to the Paradise to follow will also come true,
18:11 without the slightest possibility of failure.
18:15 Of course, we should trust not only Jehovah, Jesus,
18:19 the faithful slave, and the Bible  but also our fellow brothers.
18:24 The apostle Paul is a fine example of this.
18:27 He wrote to Philemon
18:30 asking him to kindly receive back
18:33 the runaway slave Onesimus who had become a brother.
18:38 Paul wrote at Philemon 21:
18:42 “I am confident that you will comply,
18:45 so I am writing you, knowing that you will do even more than what I say.”
18:50 When we speak of trust,
18:52 we sometimes think of a little child
18:55 walking hand in hand with his father.
18:59 The child does not question where the father will take him.
19:03 The child trusts the father.
19:05 All throughout the last days,
19:08 true Christians have faced hostility  of so many in the world.
19:13 How strengthening Jehovah’s promise is
19:15 in view of the impending attack by Satan’s hordes!
19:19 When they attack, Jehovah’s people will seem as defenseless.
19:24 But we do not need to quake with fear.
19:27 We trust that Jehovah, Jesus, and the angels
19:30 will fight to deliver us.
19:33 We will not shrink back in fear.
19:37 At Hebrews 10:39, Paul wrote:
19:39 “Now we are not the sort  who shrink back to destruction,
19:43 but the sort who have faith for the preserving of our lives.”
19:47 Today and after Armageddon, all can say,
19:50 according to Psalm 26:1 and 52:8:
19:54 “I have trusted [in Jehovah] without wavering.”
19:58 “My trust is in God’s loyal love, forever and ever.”
20:04 Therefore, keep trusting in Jehovah  and those who are proving loyal to him.
20:09 Back to you, Leon.
20:11 Thank you, Brother Lösch.
20:14 In line with that,
20:15 we all want
20:16 good friends
20:17 we can trust
20:19 —the type
20:20 mentioned at Proverbs 18:24,  where it says:
20:24 “There is a friend  who sticks closer than a brother.”
20:28 But at times,  we may find that a close friend
20:32 needs spiritual help.
20:34 Do we fear losing  that friendship if we speak up?
20:39 What does Jehovah want us to do?
20:42 In the following dramatization,
20:45 the young man Danny  faces these same questions.
21:04 I had a secret.
21:07 Only it wasn’t mine to tell.
21:12 It was my best friend’s, Julian.
21:28 This was not the Julian I knew.
21:46 At the end of the meeting,
21:48 Brother Max wanted to know  if I was OK.
21:52 I shrugged it off.
21:54 I just didn’t know  who to talk to at that point.
22:06 A few years ago,
22:09 when my parents  stopped attending meetings,
22:21 Julian was there for me.
22:44 I didn’t want to lose my friend.
22:49 But did I really know him?
23:06 I decided to ask Julian  about the pictures he posted.
23:13 I told him it wasn’t right.
23:15 He needed to talk to the elders.
23:19 Then he got really defensive about it.
23:27 I knew I did the right thing.
23:31 When was I supposed  to take care of this bill?
23:33 I’ve been telling you  for the past month!
23:34 I just needed someone to talk to.
23:36 When did you tell me?
23:37 I’ve been working  for the past couple of weeks.
23:39 Well, as if I don’t work?
23:41 Oh! Now you’re going  to blame everything on me.
23:52 Brother Max wanted to know  how I was really doing.
23:56 He could tell something was wrong.
23:59 So I opened up.
24:13 I told him everything.
24:15 I didn’t want to get my friend in trouble.
24:17 Max understood.
24:20 He asked me to read James 5:14, 15:
24:28 “Is there anyone sick among you?
24:32 “Let him call  the elders of the congregation to him,
24:36 “and let them pray over him,
24:39 “applying oil to him  in the name of Jehovah.
24:44 “And the prayer of faith
24:46 “will make the sick one well,
24:49 and Jehovah will raise him up.”
24:56 Max showed me that the elders  can encourage and strengthen
24:59 a spiritually weak person.
25:03 Covering up a friend’s wrongdoing
25:05 prevents him from getting  the spiritual help he needs.
25:10 All this time,  I was focused on Julian and his deception,
25:15 and I didn’t speak up.
25:20 I’m glad I was honest with Brother Max.
25:24 The elders are like our spiritual doctors,
25:27 and even more, they’re our friends.
25:30 They want to help us.
25:32 Julian might receive discipline,
25:35 but that’s an expression of Jehovah’s love.
25:38 It could save his spiritual life.
25:46 Julian got the spiritual help he needed.
25:59 And I kept my best friend.
26:14 Did you notice how our young brother
26:17 put trust in the Bible and acted accordingly?
26:21 How can we do the same?
26:25 Brother Ron Curzan’s morning worship  comments share some thoughts
26:30 on specific ways we can continue  to make spiritual adjustments
26:35 as we encounter  a variety of life’s challenges.
26:40 These were very practical comments.
26:42 And they all tie in well
26:43 with what the apostle Paul was trying to tell
26:46 those in the Ephesian congregation
26:49 about examining themselves.
26:51 The same way we have to do today
26:53 —examining ourselves  so that we please Jehovah.
26:56 If you’d like,  please open up to Ephesians chapter 5,
26:59 and we’ll read verse 10,  which is our theme scripture.
27:04 Ephesians 5:10, it says:
27:08 “Keep on making sure  of what is acceptable to the Lord.”
27:11 And then it goes on in verse 11:
27:13 “And stop sharing in the unfruitful works  that belong to the darkness;
27:18 rather, expose them for what they are.”
27:23 So it’s very clear to us,  in this chapter of Ephesians chapter 5,
27:28 that there are things  that Jehovah views as acceptable
27:32 and things he views as unacceptable.
27:35 Jehovah’s standard of what is unacceptable
27:38 is outlined in quite a few  of the verses in chapter 5 here.
27:41 If you would just scan  through verses 3, 4, and 5,
27:46 we’ll see that unwholesome talk about sex,
27:49 shameful conduct, obscene jesting
27:52 —and then verse 18, drunkenness—
27:55 well, these are things  that will bar us from God’s Kingdom.
28:00 When you think  about entertainment today,
28:02 it’s nearly impossible  to try to find something
28:05 that is acceptable to Jehovah
28:07 that does not have  immoral sex, pornography,
28:10 spiritism, and violence.
28:13 Satan has thoroughly saturated  all forms of the media.
28:17 So thoroughly,  that it’s in our literature,
28:19 it’s in movies,  it’s in electronic games,
28:22 and everything that we  can think of Satan has infiltrated.
28:26 Yes, he knows that Jehovah  hates these things,
28:29 and he doesn’t mind if part of our heart  hates these things
28:33 as long as part of our heart  loves these things.
28:37 So we do well to ask ourselves:
28:39 ‘Does the entertainment that I choose help me
28:43 ‘in my being acceptable to Jehovah?
28:46 ‘Does it help me to have the qualities
28:49 ‘that Jehovah endears in me,
28:51 and will he draw closer to me?’
28:54 Well, the spirit of the world  reflects rebellion of the Bible,
28:58 which outlines  Jehovah’s qualities and his standards.
29:02 We want to show respect for the Bible,
29:04 which teaches us  to love what Jehovah loves
29:07 and hate what he hates.
29:10 And what will help us to do this  and resist the spirit of the world
29:14 and draw closer to Jehovah  and be acceptable to him?
29:17 Let’s notice verse 17,
29:19 chapter 5 and verse 17, it says:
29:24 “On this account stop being unreasonable,
29:26 but keep perceiving  what the will of Jehovah is.”
29:31 We need to constantly think:
29:33 ‘What would Jehovah want me to do?’
29:36 Well, verse 1 and verse 2  help us to appreciate this, it says:
29:39 “Become imitators of God,  as beloved children,
29:42 “and go on walking in love,  just as the Christ also loved us
29:47 “and [he] gave himself [up]  for us as an offering
29:50 and a sacrifice,  a sweet fragrance to God.”
29:54 So, bottom line,  we need to imitate Jehovah and Jesus.
29:58 Our sacrifices need to be  acceptable to Jehovah
30:01 as was Jesus’.
30:04 What made Jesus so pleasing?
30:06 Well, he did everything  the way Jehovah wanted him to do.
30:10 In fact, he said something  that we want to say one day:
30:14 “I always do the things pleasing to him.”
30:17 And one day in perfection,  we will be able to say that.
30:19 Jesus was pleasing  in his word, in his deed, in his actions.
30:24 Well, how can we imitate Jesus  and thus imitate Jehovah?
30:28 Well, let’s briefly discuss three ways.
30:31 First: Pray for God’s holy spirit.
30:34 When confronted with trials,  what did Jesus do?
30:37 He did not rely on himself;  he petitioned Jehovah for help.
30:41 So if we’re struggling with a temptation
30:44 —a certain fleshly weakness—
30:46 it’s vital that we do the same.
30:49 We can also talk to the elders —our loving shepherds—
30:51 who will pray with us, and they will definitely help us
30:55 to remain faithful  with words of encouragement.
30:58 Number two: Obey Jehovah completely.
31:03 Jesus always did things  that were pleasing to his Father.
31:06 Luke 22:42 says:
31:08 “Let, not my will, but yours take place.”
31:12 Remember,  there is no substitute for obedience.
31:15 We cannot be acceptable without obedience.
31:19 Number three: Know the Scriptures well.
31:22 Jesus used God’s Word as his authority.
31:25 His whole life revolved around knowing
31:28 and obeying and encouraging others  about God’s laws.
31:32 We all have busy schedules.
31:34 We have work to do  —busy in the congregation.
31:37 It’s more than just trying to find time  to dig deep into God’s Word;
31:41 we must make the time.
31:43 So, what do our schedules tell us
31:46 about our love for Jehovah?
31:49 our love for his Word?
31:51 Do we read the Bible daily?
31:54 And if we do,  how much time do we take
31:56 to let it sink into our mind  and our heart and to meditate?
32:02 Are we content with just looking
32:04 at the basics —the surface—
32:06 or digging deeper and deeper  below the surface?
32:10 It’s vital that we train  our minds and our hearts,
32:13 but it takes time  and it takes effort,
32:16 just as a marathon runner  must devote much time and effort
32:20 to his training to run a race.
32:22 In fact, as we know,  Christians are likened
32:25 to running a race,  and it’s a race for life.
32:27 Let’s see  what the apostle Paul had to tell us.
32:29 If we go over to 1 Corinthians,
32:33 1 Corinthians chapter 9,
32:36 a scripture we know very well,  and we’ll start in verse 24.
32:40 And there are a few key elements
32:42 that we would like to extract  as we’re reading these verses.
32:44 Here Paul said:
32:46 “Do you not know  that the runners in a race all run,
32:49 “but only one receives the prize?
32:52 “Run in such a way that you may win it.
32:55 “Now everyone competing in a contest
32:58 “exercises self-control in all things  [there’s a key].
33:02 “Of course, they do it  to receive a crown that can perish,
33:05 “but we, one that does not perish.
33:07 “Therefore, the way  I am running is not aimlessly;
33:11 “the way I am aiming my blows
33:13 “is so as not to be striking the air;
33:16 “but I pummel my body
33:18 “[and the footnote says,  “punish; strictly discipline”]
33:22 “and lead it as a slave,  so that after I have preached to others,
33:26 “I myself should not become disapproved
33:29 [or the footnote says, “disqualified”]  somehow.”
33:34 So we definitely want to have  self-control like a runner.
33:38 We need to say no to Satan’s world
33:40 and yes to things  that are acceptable to Jehovah.
33:43 And we definitely want  to make sure that we are acceptable
33:47 and never to be disapproved.
33:50 Perhaps we can illustrate this.
33:52 In the 1994 New York City Marathon,
33:55 there was a young man named German Silva,
33:58 and he ran an outstanding race.
34:00 In fact, there was only half a mile  to the finish line in Central Park,
34:05 and somehow he got distracted.
34:07 He took the wrong path.
34:09 Did he lose the race?
34:10 Well, the lead runner took over.
34:12 Well, he got redirected;  he went back on the path;
34:16 he began to run faster and faster.
34:18 He passed up the lead runner,
34:20 and he won the New York City Marathon  by two seconds.
34:24 What does this tell us?
34:26 It tells us that sometimes  we can lose our focus, we can be sidetracked,
34:30 or we could get involved  in unacceptable conduct.
34:34 But allow God’s Word  and loving shepherds to readjust our course.
34:39 Never give up.
34:41 Just a few years later, after that —1997—
34:43 German began running again  in a New York City Marathon.
34:47 He thought he had this one all in the bag;
34:50 he thought he was going to win this race.
34:52 But he started to run slower.
34:54 He began to—  He dehydrated.
34:56 Instead of taking  just a few seconds to hydrate,
35:00 he skipped that.
35:01 He thought he could do it.
35:02 Well, what could this tell us?
35:04 Well, we cannot afford to take shortcuts.
35:07 We need to have  a regular intake of spiritual food
35:10 to keep pace with Jehovah’s organization.
35:12 We do this  by what the commenters told us today,
35:15 that is, a regular intake  of God’s Word and meditation.
35:19 As we run the Christian course —the race for life—
35:22 remember, it’s not the speed,  it’s the direction
35:25 —that’s what matters the most.
35:28 And may we always run in such a way  that is acceptable to Jehovah.
35:33 As Brother Curzan mentioned,
35:35 certainly a regular intake of God’s Word
35:39 can have a dramatic effect on our lives.
35:43 Take the example of Rafika Morris.
35:47 Her life led her on a search
35:49 for ways to achieve racial harmony
35:53 through human means.
35:56 But after years of frustration  and disappointments,
36:00 how would studying the Bible
36:02 affect her search for answers?
36:08 Growing up in the South
36:10 during the time of segregation
36:14 —blacks and whites— we couldn’t mix.
36:18 And not only that, they had signs
36:20 to keep you knowing  where you were supposed to go.
36:23 I couldn’t understand  why we couldn’t get along.
36:27 Fifty cents.
36:29 Yes, Sir.
36:31 Thank you, Sir.
36:33 Grandma, he’s just a boy.  Why are you saying “Sir”?
36:36 Be quiet.  I want you to know your place.
36:41 I told her after we got back on the truck:
36:43 “You know what?  I’ll never hold my head down!”
36:47 My grandmother  knew I had a love for the Bible
36:49 because I would  always read the Bible as a kid.
36:54 But I couldn’t understand it.
37:02 I used to pray,  “What makes us so different?”
37:05 You know,  “Why can’t we live together?”
37:11 I met a group,
37:14 and this group was like  what I really wanted to be in.
37:19 They were about politics.
37:21 They said, “We’re fighting injustice.”
37:23 And when they said  that word “injustice,” it was like,
37:26 ‘Yeah, this is what I want to be in, right?
37:30 ‘To be part of something that can change
37:32 and make people united, right?’
37:35 That was my goal.
37:38 We started protesting about police brutality,
37:41 and I think that’s what a lot of people,
37:43 you know,  were focusing on.
37:47 I liked some of the things  that they were doing,
37:50 but they trained us every,  every day in military training.
37:53 We learned how to use weapons  and stuff like that.
37:56 And so I’m thinking:
37:58 ‘This is not what I want to be in.  This is not what I joined.’
38:01 So I started going back to God again —to reading the Bible—
38:05 because it was like  I’m not changing anything.
38:08 The Bible that I was reading  was the King James Version.
38:11 So I was reading it, reading it, reading it,
38:13 but I couldn’t understand it.
38:16 We went to Jamaica,
38:18 and we saw this Bible,  the New World Translation.
38:20 And I started reading it,  and it made so much sense!
38:23 And I could understand it,  and it wasn’t “thee” and “thou.”
38:26 I was like, ‘Wow!’
38:28 You know, like,  ‘This is the one I want to get.’
38:31 One day, two women knocked on the door.
38:34 I didn’t know they were Jehovah’s Witnesses.
38:36 All I could see was that Bible.
38:39 And I said,  “Where did you get that Bible from?”
38:42 And they said,  “OK, we’ll bring you one.”
38:44 And they did.  So they brought me the Bible,
38:46 but I didn’t know I was going to have  a Bible study that came along with it.
38:51 The first time I went  to a convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
38:54 it was like ten thousand people.
38:57 When I went in there and I saw
38:59 all these different faces  and different colors,
39:02 it was like Jehovah showing me:
39:04 “Hey, Rafika, remember you were asking me
39:06 “about all different people  getting together and being one?
39:10 See, I’m not partial;  they do get along; we are unified.”
39:14 And it just made me feel so good inside.
39:17 Yes!
39:19 This is the organization  that I want to be in.
39:22 I just see people as people, you know,
39:27 and I can preach  and be friends with anybody.
39:32 Now that I know  what the Bible really teaches,
39:35 I have a wonderful life
39:37 because I know  that only God and his government
39:41 can bring about peace.
39:44 Just like how Jehovah  unified everybody,
39:46 I want everybody  to be unified
39:49 and come to know Jehovah,  just like I know him.
39:53 Jehovah answered my prayer.
40:05 While Rafika faced unique challenges
40:09 early in her spiritual life,
40:11 she learned to trust in Jehovah.
40:14 Trust is also needed
40:17 if we choose to extend ourselves
40:19 in a new form of Kingdom service.
40:21 This is especially true  of those who have had the privilege
40:26 to attend the School  for Kingdom Evangelizers.
40:29 Their personal experiences confirm this.
40:37 I have an illness  that affects my level of energy,
40:39 so I didn’t feel that I could accept  just any kind of assignment.
40:44 Since the end of this system is near,
40:47 I want to do whatever I can
40:49 that Jehovah wants down to the very end.
40:52 So I applied.
40:54 Before attending SKE,  when I received my invitation,
40:57 all of a sudden I had challenges  or worries about myself.
41:01 I felt unworthy, even unqualified.
41:06 Being a single sister,  going into the class with so many couples,
41:11 I thought I would be out of place.
41:17 I used all my abilities.
41:21 I felt like my head was swelling up.
41:25 Even so, I felt  that I was really being refined
41:28 and ended each day feeling fulfilled.
41:34 Something that I
41:36 really enjoyed about SKE
41:37 was Friday afternoons.
41:39 That’s when we had a talk
41:41 from one of the Governing Body members.
41:43 That was special.
41:45 During the eight weeks of school,
41:47 such an emphasis was placed
41:49 on serving where the need is greater.
41:51 So this way of thinking  became more important to us.
41:54 After eight weeks of attending the school,
41:56 you are even ready to be sent to the moon.
41:58 When I was told
42:00 that my next assignment
42:01 would be in Mesa, Arizona,
42:03 I thought, ‘Where is that?’
42:05 And then I thought,  ‘Oh, no, scorpions!’
42:08 And then I thought, ‘OK,
42:10 this is where Jehovah thinks  I should be, so I’m ready to go.’
42:14 One of the challenges in my new assignment
42:16 was finding suitable accommodations.
42:19 There was a couple in the congregation
42:21 who had two rooms that they rented  in the back of their property,
42:25 but it needed some renovations.
42:27 So the brothers very quickly came together,  helped sort it out,
42:30 and even built an extra  little kitchenette lounge.
42:34 So now we have a beautiful little home
42:36 to go back to after a long,  hot day in the ministry.
42:40 I always thought that I’d do much better  in the cold than I would in the heat.
42:44 So the brothers and sisters  were very helpful
42:47 in making sure that I stayed hydrated,
42:49 making sure I knew  how to handle myself in the heat,
42:52 giving me pointers on things to carry,
42:55 and they made sure that I had
42:57 an extra-large water bottle with me.
43:00 We really felt supported by the congregation
43:04 because they found us an apartment.
43:06 This meant that we could concentrate  on our ministry.
43:12 One of the things that really helped me  was an experienced brother
43:16 who gave an encouraging comment  about whether my health
43:19 would permit me to attend the school.
43:21 He said, “If she can pioneer,
43:24 then it’s also possible for her  to attend the school.”
43:29 The education that we received at SKE
43:31 especially helped us with our qualities,
43:35 our personality  —putting on the new personality.
43:37 That really will help us  not only now in our assignment
43:41 but right through into the new world.
43:46 I think there are many  who could meet the qualifications
43:48 with just a little more effort.
43:51 Please know that there is  a wonderful education program,
43:55 and we were able  to experience it in our 60’s.
43:59 We could get through it.
44:02 So if others are thinking of applying,
44:05 I want to tell them  that we were able to do it,
44:09 and by all means,
44:11 I want them to taste  the same joy that we experienced.
44:17 You could be nervous
44:18 and have performance anxiety  and worry about,
44:21 ‘How will I handle answering,
44:23 ‘and how about all  of the student assignments
44:26 and the tests?’ —worries like that.
44:28 But for my own part,
44:30 it was two months  with an incredible amount of joy.
44:34 And you have to focus on that.
44:37 It is a gift  —it is a wonderful gift from Jehovah.
44:41 I wasn’t sure if I was going  to put in the application
44:44 because I thought maybe  I wanted to do it as a couple
44:47 rather than as a single person.
44:49 But I prayed to Jehovah about it,  and I put my application in.
44:53 I wouldn’t be experiencing the happiness
44:55 that I have now if I had waited.
44:57 So I’m happy  that I just put my application in
45:00 and let Jehovah do the rest.
45:02 And now, sometimes I’m driving  down the freeway, and I think:
45:04 ‘Wow, Jehovah, I am so happy!  Thank you!’
45:09 These experiences remind me
45:13 of Colossians 3:23, 24 which reads:
45:17 “Whatever you are doing,
45:19 “work at it whole-souled as for Jehovah,
45:23 “and not for men,  for you know that it is from Jehovah
45:28 “you will receive  the inheritance as a reward.
45:31 Slave for the Master, Christ.”
45:34 Certainly, these brothers  and sisters are doing just that.
45:38 If you personally find yourself in a position
45:43 to reach out for a privilege,  such as attending this school
45:47 or moving to where the need is great,
45:50 give it consideration.
45:54 Now we travel to Costa Rica,
45:56 where we find our brothers  and sisters relying on Jehovah
46:01 as they prepare for a very special assembly.
46:06 Why was trust in Jehovah  essential for this project?
46:28 First, we asked the branch for permission.
46:32 Once they gave us approval,
46:33 we began to make preparations  for the assembly,
46:36 though we had absolutely nothing.
46:39 So one brother lent us a property  for the assembly site.
46:42 Our brothers have brought  many different skills to the project.
46:46 There are metalworkers ,
46:48 cabinetmakers, and bricklayers.
46:50 Many brothers
46:52 have given of their resources
46:53 and used their abilities
46:55 so that this project could go ahead.
46:59 This has really made us stand out here.
47:01 People were asking each other:
47:04 “What is happening here?”
47:05 and “Who paid for all of this?”
47:07 They say people are surprised  at how many workers are coming to help.
47:12 And I wonder,
47:13 ‘If this is getting attention now,
47:16 what will the assembly be like?’
47:19 A comfortable, practical,  and secure Assembly Hall
47:23 was constructed using materials  acquired locally.
47:26 Expectations grew  as the special day drew closer,
47:30 and when it finally arrived,  those in attendance
47:33 experienced something truly moving.
47:39 With Jehovah’s help,  many interested ones,
47:42 along with our brothers and sisters,  have come here today
47:46 to celebrate our first assembly  in the Bribri language.
47:50 Friends, this is wonderful!
47:57 When the program started in Bribri, I cried.
48:04 I’m so happy
48:06 to have participated in the assembly,
48:08 especially because it’s in my own language.
48:14 It’s what we wanted.
48:16 We hope it continues just like this.
48:18 We walked a long way to invite these people,
48:24 and to see them here,  it makes me very happy.
48:34 The information presented  in the local language
48:37 touched many hearts.
48:39 This was truly a historic event
48:41 for our indigenous brothers in Costa Rica.
48:44 Jehovah has made it possible
48:46 for more people in this isolated region  to enjoy his spiritual blessing.
48:58 Did you note why trust in Jehovah
49:03 was so essential for this project?
49:07 At the start the brothers had nothing.
49:11 But they trusted  that Jehovah would assist them,
49:15 and he did through donated land,
49:19 materials, and willing volunteers.
49:22 Yes, we can truly put  our confidence in Jehovah
49:26 as he guides us  through this system of things.
49:30 Such trust in Jehovah
49:33 is highlighted  in this month’s music video entitled
49:38 Confident in You.
49:47 Like a tree planted in the ground,  Your words have sunk deep down
49:58 Into my heart and soothed my mind  with gentle thoughts of peace.
50:08 ’Cause no matter what may come,  With this wisdom from above,
50:19 I always have these truths  to keep reminding me to
50:28 Go on; don’t be afraid.  Hold on to what Jehovah says.
50:39 Through all the storms, your words have  Given me strength to endure.
50:49 And every day I am more  confident in you.
51:05 When this world tries to pull me down,  To give up on what I’ve found,
51:16 I turn to you and know that you  are always there.
51:26 It takes time to meditate—  Get the words from off the page
51:36 And in my heart so they can help  and guide me to
51:45 Go on; don’t be afraid.  Hold on to what Jehovah says.
51:55 Look beyond any adversity.  Focus on the things that I can’t see.
52:07 Through all the storms, your words have  Given me strength to endure.
52:17 And every day I am more  confident in you—
52:29 In you.
52:44 Go on; don’t be afraid.  Hold on to what Jehovah says.
52:55 Look beyond any adversity.  Focus on the things that I can’t see.
53:06 Through all the storms, your words have  Given me strength to endure.
53:16 And every day I am more  confident in you.
53:30 This month we have seen  how trusting in Jehovah
53:34 and his guidance  can assist us in a variety of ways:
53:38 addressing issues with a close friend,
53:41 our choices in entertainment,
53:43 and even coping with a world  filled with social injustice.
53:48 Certainly, Jehovah  is someone in whom we can trust!
53:52 But we have one last treat  for you before we end our program.
53:57 We’ll briefly travel to Cádiz, Spain.
54:01 Cádiz is considered to be one  of the oldest cities in Western Europe
54:06 and was founded by the Phoenicians.
54:08 It is situated on a narrow slice  of land surrounded by the sea.
54:13 Cádiz has a wealth of vistas
54:16 and well-preserved historical landmarks.
54:20 On the outskirts  lies Puerto de Santa María,
54:24 where an English-speaking  congregation meets.
54:27 This congregation is made up mainly
54:30 of brothers and sisters  serving as need-greaters.
54:33 They have come from other parts  of Spain as well as distant lands,
54:37 such as Australia, Britain,  Canada, and the United States.
54:42 Cádiz has a high rate of unemployment,
54:46 so finding work is not easy.
54:48 One couple travels nearly 300 miles
54:52 (or 483 km)
54:54 every Thursday to their territory,
54:57 and on Monday morning they make  the trip back to where they live and work.
55:01 In spite of these financial challenges,
55:04 many are still serving  as construction volunteers,
55:07 remote Bethel workers, and pioneers.
55:11 Our brothers and sisters  in Puerto de Santa María
55:14 are thrilled to send their love  and greetings to you all.
55:18 This is JW Broadcasting
55:21 from the world headquarters  of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

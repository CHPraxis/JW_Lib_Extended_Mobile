00:00:01 ‎Welcome, brothers and sisters, to JW Broadcasting!
00:00:06 ‎In this edition,
00:00:08 ‎we’ll glorify Jehovah’s name in our discussions and segments.
00:00:12 ‎For example:
00:00:14 ‎How was the discovery of this ancient manuscript
00:00:17 ‎a tremendous help to the New World Bible Translation Committee?
00:00:22 ‎How did it support  their decision to restore God’s name
00:00:25 ‎in the Christian Greek Scriptures?
00:00:28 ‎We’ll find out.
00:00:30 ‎We’ll visit the Quechua-speaking people in the Andes Mountains.
00:00:33 ‎What special efforts  have our brothers been making there
00:00:36 ‎to spread the good news?
00:00:38 ‎And what new tool do they have  to glorify God’s name in Quechua?
00:00:45 ‎How did you feel  when you finally found Jehovah?
00:00:48 ‎And how does it feel now
00:00:50 ‎when you can help  someone in his or her search
00:00:54 ‎to know the true God?
00:00:56 ‎You’ll enjoy a new original song
00:00:59 ‎about the search for Jehovah.
00:01:02 ‎You’re watching JW Broadcasting
00:01:05 ‎for October 2018.
00:01:25 ‎It’s hard to believe  that it’s already been five years
00:01:29 ‎since the release of the revised New World Translation in English.
00:01:33 ‎What a wonderful blessing from Jehovah it has been!
00:01:38 ‎Do you remember why the Governing Body  saw the need for a revised edition?
00:01:43 ‎One reason was to honor God’s name,
00:01:46 ‎including it in six more places  where new evidence made it possible.
00:01:51 ‎Another reason to revise the English text
00:01:54 ‎was to allow Bible translation  into even more languages.
00:01:59 ‎Thousands of questions  from Bible translation teams
00:02:03 ‎showed where the English text
00:02:05 ‎could be made  more clear and understandable
00:02:08 ‎without sacrificing accuracy.
00:02:11 ‎It’s our prayer that, in time,
00:02:13 ‎more of our brothers can have
00:02:15 ‎a revised New World Translation  in their language.
00:02:19 ‎The Governing Body feels  that Jehovah is answering that prayer.
00:02:23 ‎Revised translations  are now available in 13 languages.
00:02:28 ‎Listen to brothers and sisters  from four European-language groups
00:02:33 ‎explain how the revised Bible  has benefited them
00:02:36 ‎in their study and in their ministry.
00:02:44 ‎The release of the revised version
00:02:46 ‎of the New World Translation  of the Holy Scriptures
00:02:49 ‎in the English language in 2013
00:02:52 ‎had a wonderful impact  on the English-speaking world.
00:02:58 ‎As Brother Jackson noted,
00:03:01 ‎more than 60 years had passed  since the release of the first volume
00:03:04 ‎of the New World Translation,  and during that time,
00:03:07 ‎the English language had changed as well.
00:03:14 ‎During 2017,
00:03:17 ‎the revised version
00:03:19 ‎of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures
00:03:20 ‎has been released
00:03:22 ‎in some major European languages,
00:03:28 ‎such as Italian (originally released in 1963),
00:03:33 ‎Dutch (also originally released in 1963),
00:03:37 ‎Greek (originally released in 1997),
00:03:41 ‎and Hungarian (originally released in 2000).
00:03:46 ‎How do the brothers and sisters feel
00:03:48 ‎about the revised New World Translation  in their particular language?
00:03:54 ‎The modern language
00:03:56 ‎in this revised version of the Bible
00:03:57 ‎helps me to understand Bible passages
00:04:00 ‎because now it flows better and is much simpler.
00:04:03 ‎This helps me to meditate more on what I have just read.
00:04:11 ‎At Numbers 14:24,
00:04:14 ‎Jehovah speaks to Moses.
00:04:16 ‎In the older version,  Jehovah says about Caleb
00:04:19 ‎that “a different spirit  has proved to be with him.”
00:04:26 ‎In the revised version, the verse reads
00:04:29 ‎that ‘my servant Caleb thinks differently’
00:04:32 ‎—very clear  and doesn’t need further explanation.
00:04:39 ‎Psalm 7:9 now says
00:04:41 ‎that Jehovah “examines the hearts
00:04:43 ‎and the deepest emotions,”
00:04:45 ‎whereas previously it said he examines the ‘hearts and the kidneys.’
00:04:49 ‎Now it’s easier to understand.
00:04:52 ‎Besides all the aspects of helping to get
00:04:55 ‎a better understanding of God’s Word,
00:04:59 ‎why are brothers and sisters  happy to use this revised version
00:05:01 ‎in field service?
00:05:07 ‎When reading a scripture,
00:05:09 ‎you can tell that people understand
00:05:10 ‎it more quickly;
00:05:12 ‎there is less need to explain more.
00:05:14 ‎And that’s great.
00:05:16 ‎I particularly like the glossary;
00:05:19 ‎it’s a kind of mini Insight book.
00:05:21 ‎It has been very useful
00:05:23 ‎when I study and also in the ministry.
00:05:26 ‎Furthermore, I like
00:05:28 ‎that at the beginning of the Bible,
00:05:30 ‎there are 20 introductions
00:05:32 ‎that answer questions that people in the territory often ask,
00:05:36 ‎and they have Bible verses  and very nice illustrations.
00:05:40 ‎So they are very clear and practical.
00:05:44 ‎To achieve such an awesome result by revising the New World Translation,
00:05:48 ‎which important aspects did the translators have to keep in mind?
00:05:56 ‎Thanks to the modern language
00:05:58 ‎that is used in the revision,
00:06:00 ‎readers can understand most Bible passages as they read them,
00:06:04 ‎without having to stop  and read them over again.
00:06:08 ‎This is possible, in part,
00:06:10 ‎because the text  is not cluttered with too many words
00:06:14 ‎—trying to copy  the Hebrew syntax and style of expression.
00:06:18 ‎Thus, the use of modern language
00:06:21 ‎contributes to naturalness and clarity.
00:06:28 ‎The language used
00:06:30 ‎in the revision also now allows
00:06:32 ‎the emotions of the characters  to come through more vividly.
00:06:36 ‎You straightaway notice when someone
00:06:38 ‎is angry or desperate or sad.
00:06:40 ‎Like in Matthew 11, when Jesus invites us to take his yoke upon us,
00:06:45 ‎his warmth is immediately obvious.
00:06:49 ‎In the 2003 edition,
00:06:52 ‎only one sentence was packed
00:06:53 ‎into seven verses,
00:06:55 ‎and its length was half a column,
00:06:57 ‎making it very cumbersome to follow the line of thought.
00:07:01 ‎In the revised Bible,  this part was cut into more sentences,
00:07:05 ‎so it is easier to grasp the idea.
00:07:09 ‎Many parents have told us
00:07:11 ‎that now when they read the Bible
00:07:12 ‎with their children,
00:07:13 ‎they don’t have to stop to explain words
00:07:15 ‎and the reading is much more enjoyable.
00:07:20 ‎The revised New World Translation  will be made available
00:07:23 ‎in more languages in the near future.
00:07:27 ‎We know that Jehovah wants  all his people to listen
00:07:30 ‎as he speaks to them in clear, understandable language.
00:07:36 ‎This will help us  to come to know Jehovah even better,
00:07:39 ‎and our love for him
00:07:41 ‎will keep growing
00:07:43 ‎while we read his Word with joy.
00:07:52 ‎In addition to being clear and accurate,
00:07:54 ‎what should be the primary goal  of any Bible translation?
00:07:59 ‎The answer is found
00:08:01 ‎in the theme of our program this month:
00:08:04 ‎“Father, Glorify Your Name.”
00:08:07 ‎It’s based on Jesus’ words
00:08:10 ‎recorded at John 12:28.
00:08:13 ‎Let’s start by examining  the context of those words
00:08:17 ‎as found in verses 27 and 28:
00:08:21 ‎“‘Now I am troubled,  and what should I say?
00:08:26 ‎“‘Father, save me out of this hour.
00:08:29 ‎“‘Nevertheless, this is why  I have come to this hour.
00:08:33 ‎“Father, glorify your name.’
00:08:36 ‎“Then a voice came out of heaven:
00:08:39 ‎‘I have glorified it and will glorify it again.’”
00:08:44 ‎Jesus uttered these words
00:08:46 ‎just four days before his agonizing death.
00:08:50 ‎But even though Jesus was very troubled
00:08:53 ‎about what was soon to happen to him,
00:08:55 ‎what was his primary concern?
00:08:58 ‎It was for Jehovah’s name to be glorified.
00:09:02 ‎We today are likewise concerned
00:09:05 ‎about the glorification of Jehovah’s name and his reputation.
00:09:10 ‎But how can someone  be glorified, or made famous,
00:09:14 ‎if nobody knows his name?
00:09:17 ‎Knowing God’s personal name, Jehovah,
00:09:20 ‎is closely tied in with glorifying his reputation.
00:09:24 ‎In fact, knowing Jehovah’s name
00:09:27 ‎is the very first step in that process.
00:09:31 ‎The June 2015 program of JW Broadcasting
00:09:35 ‎discussed why God’s personal name
00:09:38 ‎should appear in all translations of the Bible.
00:09:41 ‎You might find it helpful to review that program.
00:09:45 ‎But this month, we will consider another aspect of this subject
00:09:50 ‎that is far more controversial, namely,
00:09:54 ‎Should the divine name appear  in the Christian Greek Scriptures,
00:09:59 ‎or what is commonly called  the New Testament?
00:10:04 ‎Many scholars who agree with us
00:10:06 ‎that the divine name should appear  in the Hebrew Scriptures
00:10:09 ‎disagree with our use of the same name
00:10:13 ‎in the New Testament.
00:10:15 ‎So, what prompted the translators  of the New World Translation
00:10:19 ‎to restore the divine name 237 times
00:10:23 ‎in the Christian Greek Scriptures?
00:10:25 ‎The answer to that question  involves some fascinating events
00:10:30 ‎that seem to be too amazing  to be just coincidence.
00:10:34 ‎It also requires us to do some detective work.
00:10:38 ‎Sound intriguing?
00:10:40 ‎It is!
00:10:41 ‎So let’s start our journey together.
00:10:44 ‎First of all, imagine that you are back in the late 1940’s
00:10:49 ‎—the time when the New World Bible Translation Committee
00:10:52 ‎was translating the book of Matthew.
00:10:55 ‎As they started the project,
00:10:58 ‎no doubt they realized  that Matthew’s account contains
00:11:01 ‎many quotations from the Hebrew Scriptures.
00:11:05 ‎Many of these contain the Tetragrammaton,
00:11:08 ‎that is, the divine name  in Hebrew letters in the original text.
00:11:13 ‎For example, let’s consider Matthew 22:44.
00:11:19 ‎This verse records Jesus quoting the words of Psalm 110:1:
00:11:25 ‎“Jehovah said to my Lord: ‘Sit at my right hand.’”
00:11:31 ‎But did Jesus use the divine name when making this quote?
00:11:35 ‎Or did he substitute the divine name
00:11:38 ‎with an equivalent such as “Lord”?
00:11:41 ‎Well, the brothers would have realized
00:11:43 ‎that many editions of the King James Version
00:11:46 ‎did something very interesting at Matthew 22:44.
00:11:50 ‎In that verse, the English word “LORD”
00:11:53 ‎is written in capital letters.
00:11:56 ‎This technique is used  throughout the King James Version
00:12:00 ‎to indicate where  the original Hebrew text uses the divine name.
00:12:05 ‎So using “LORD” in capital letters in this verse,
00:12:08 ‎in effect,  acknowledges that the name of God
00:12:12 ‎was originally in this quote.
00:12:14 ‎The implication is
00:12:16 ‎that Jesus used God’s name  when making this quote.
00:12:20 ‎However, in the years prior  to the release of the New World Translation,
00:12:25 ‎many scholars argued  that long before Jesus came to earth,
00:12:29 ‎the Jewish people had already removed the Tetragrammaton
00:12:33 ‎from the Greek translation of the Hebrew text —the Septuagint.
00:12:37 ‎If true, that would mean
00:12:40 ‎that copies of the Holy Writings  used in Jesus’ day
00:12:43 ‎would not have contained  the divine name.
00:12:47 ‎So, what should the Translation Committee do?
00:12:50 ‎Should they use the divine name in their translation or not?
00:12:55 ‎This is where the story becomes intriguing.
00:13:00 ‎Around that time, some exciting discoveries
00:13:03 ‎were made that proved those scholars wrong.
00:13:06 ‎One of these discoveries was documented by the brothers
00:13:10 ‎in the foreword of the 1950 edition
00:13:13 ‎of the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures.
00:13:16 ‎It involved  some papyri copies of the Septuagint
00:13:20 ‎that dated  back to around the time of Jesus.
00:13:24 ‎What did these papyri fragments reveal?
00:13:27 ‎Let’s find out in this documentary report.
00:13:34 ‎In 1950,
00:13:36 ‎the New World Translation  of the Christian Greek Scriptures was released.
00:13:40 ‎“I have the extreme pleasure of releasing
00:13:44 ‎“the New World Translation
00:13:46 ‎of the Christian Greek Scriptures!”
00:13:51 ‎This translation was unique
00:13:54 ‎in that it restored  the divine name, Jehovah,
00:13:57 ‎237 times in the main text
00:13:59 ‎of the so-called New Testament.
00:14:02 ‎But how could they do that,  considering that for centuries
00:14:06 ‎many Bibles did not use Jehovah’s name?
00:14:10 ‎And why did the divine name  need to be restored?
00:14:14 ‎The oldest copies we have available
00:14:16 ‎do not use the divine name
00:14:18 ‎in the Christian Greek Scriptures;
00:14:21 ‎they use substitutes like God or Lord.
00:14:24 ‎Very early on,
00:14:26 ‎the copyists of those original manuscripts,
00:14:29 ‎they simply replaced
00:14:31 ‎—they got into the practice of replacing— God’s name.
00:14:35 ‎We know that this is not a translation
00:14:38 ‎because one is a name  and the other one is a title.
00:14:41 ‎And it’s not even   a synonym for Jehovah, for a name.
00:14:45 ‎Since the Greek Scriptures
00:14:47 ‎were an inspired addition
00:14:48 ‎to the sacred Hebrew Scriptures and,
00:14:50 ‎in fact,
00:14:51 ‎Jehovah’s name, God’s name,
00:14:53 ‎was used some 7,000 times in the Hebrew Scriptures,
00:14:56 ‎the sudden disappearance in the Greek text is inconsistent.
00:15:00 ‎Even though  the New World Bible Translation Committee
00:15:04 ‎believed that Jehovah’s name should appear
00:15:06 ‎in the text of the Christian Greek Scriptures,
00:15:09 ‎they also knew that at that time
00:15:11 ‎virtually all Bible scholars  disagreed with that belief.
00:15:15 ‎Those scholars argued  that by the time of Jesus,
00:15:18 ‎even the Greek translation  of the Hebrew Scriptures, the Septuagint,
00:15:22 ‎no longer contained the divine name.
00:15:25 ‎So why would the writers  of the New Testament
00:15:27 ‎use the divine name when their copies  of the Holy Scriptures in Greek
00:15:32 ‎did not contain the Tetragrammaton?
00:15:34 ‎This view was based on faulty information.
00:15:37 ‎How so?
00:15:39 ‎Did the Septuagint still use
00:15:41 ‎the divine name in Jesus’ time?
00:15:43 ‎Let’s consider one piece of evidence
00:15:45 ‎that answers this question.
00:15:48 ‎Something amazing happened in 1944.
00:15:51 ‎A theological journal published a picture
00:15:53 ‎of a Greek Septuagint fragment
00:15:55 ‎from the Papyrus Fouad 266 collection.
00:15:58 ‎Now, inside that fragment  there was the divine name.
00:16:02 ‎In the Greek text,  you had the Tetragrammaton,
00:16:05 ‎not just once but throughout.
00:16:08 ‎Now, this fragment was very old,  dating back to the first century B.C.E.,
00:16:12 ‎but the important point is  that this was proof, clear proof,
00:16:15 ‎that the divine name was originally there.
00:16:19 ‎Two Jehovah’s Witnesses were asked
00:16:22 ‎to obtain photographs of these fragments,
00:16:25 ‎which were located in Cairo, Egypt.
00:16:29 ‎The New World Translation Committee  was very interested in this
00:16:32 ‎because they started translating
00:16:34 ‎the Greek Scriptures in 1947.
00:16:39 ‎After obtaining permission,  pictures of 12 of the fragments
00:16:43 ‎were published in the foreword  of the New World Translation
00:16:45 ‎of the Christian Greek Scriptures.
00:16:50 ‎What amazes me about this is the timing.
00:16:55 ‎When our brothers —this New World Translation Committee—
00:16:59 ‎did their research, before even translating,
00:17:02 ‎suddenly something that was unknown
00:17:04 ‎until essentially 1944
00:17:07 ‎came to light that confirmed
00:17:10 ‎that the eternal name of God
00:17:13 ‎had to be revealed; it could no longer be hidden.
00:17:18 ‎It should be shown to everyone  who wants to worship Jehovah.
00:17:21 ‎This careful preservation  supports what Jesus said in prayer
00:17:25 ‎at John 17:26,  when he said to his Father:
00:17:29 ‎“I have made your name known . . .  and will make it known.”
00:17:33 ‎As Jehovah’s Witnesses,  we are proud to be “a people for his name.”
00:17:38 ‎Knowing his name  is essential to knowing Jehovah himself,
00:17:42 ‎and the fact that Jehovah  has provided this arrangement
00:17:45 ‎through his people
00:17:48 ‎makes it very clear
00:17:50 ‎that he was gathering  “a people for his name.”
00:17:54 ‎This is why  this Bible translation is so beautiful,
00:17:57 ‎because it brings us closer to Jehovah.
00:18:00 ‎Jehovah is not just a Lord somewhere, which could apply to anyone,
00:18:04 ‎but he is Jehovah, our God.
00:18:07 ‎He extends his hand to us and says, well,
00:18:10 ‎‘I’m Jehovah; call me by that name.’
00:18:16 ‎What an amazing find!
00:18:19 ‎They found proof that the divine name in Hebrew letters
00:18:22 ‎was included in the text of the Septuagint
00:18:26 ‎that would have been available in Jesus’ day
00:18:28 ‎and just at the right time
00:18:31 ‎—the time when the members of the Translation Committee
00:18:33 ‎were making the decision as to whether they should use
00:18:37 ‎the name Jehovah in their translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures.
00:18:42 ‎We are so happy that the brothers  were able to find this information
00:18:46 ‎because these fragments  were not released for general publication
00:18:50 ‎until much later in 1971
00:18:54 ‎—years after the time when the committee  needed to make that vital decision.
00:18:59 ‎But that’s not all!
00:19:01 ‎Do you remember  what other important material
00:19:04 ‎was discovered starting in 1947?
00:19:08 ‎It was the Dead Sea Scrolls.
00:19:10 ‎Many of these scrolls were dated to around the time when Jesus was on earth.
00:19:15 ‎And what did these scrolls contain over and over again?
00:19:20 ‎You guessed it
00:19:22 ‎—the Tetragrammaton— the divine name.
00:19:25 ‎Isn’t it interesting
00:19:27 ‎that these discoveries were made around the time
00:19:30 ‎when our brothers were translating the New World Translation?
00:19:34 ‎Is this just coincidence
00:19:37 ‎or do you see Jehovah’s hand in this?
00:19:40 ‎What has happened  in the years since that time?
00:19:44 ‎It’s important to note
00:19:46 ‎that the divine name is consistently used
00:19:49 ‎in fragments of the Septuagint
00:19:51 ‎that date from the first century B.C.E.
00:19:54 ‎and the first century C.E.
00:19:56 ‎This has led some scholars to acknowledge the possibility
00:20:00 ‎that Jesus and his disciples
00:20:02 ‎used the divine name when making these quotations.
00:20:07 ‎But we need to remember  that Hebrew Scripture quotations
00:20:11 ‎account for approximately one third
00:20:14 ‎of the 237 times
00:20:16 ‎the New World Translation restores the divine name
00:20:20 ‎in the Christian Greek Scriptures.
00:20:22 ‎So, what about the other  two thirds of occurrences?
00:20:26 ‎Well, this brings us  to the part of our program
00:20:29 ‎that involves some detective work.
00:20:33 ‎Imagine that you are a detective,
00:20:36 ‎and you catch an art thief
00:20:38 ‎who has stolen  over 200 original pieces of art
00:20:42 ‎from various museums and art galleries.
00:20:46 ‎This thief not only stole each piece of art
00:20:49 ‎but he also substituted it with a copy.
00:20:53 ‎So you need to start an investigation
00:20:56 ‎and follow the clues.
00:20:58 ‎First of all, you need to find out
00:21:01 ‎where each painting was located originally.
00:21:04 ‎Once you have verified  that fakes are hanging in those locations,
00:21:09 ‎you would be in a position  to return the originals
00:21:12 ‎to their proper locations.
00:21:15 ‎In a similar way,  we have solid evidence
00:21:19 ‎that a crime was committed  in the second and third centuries C.E.
00:21:23 ‎Apostate Christians removed the divine name
00:21:27 ‎from manuscripts of the Bible
00:21:29 ‎and replaced it with Kyʹri·os, the Greek word for “Lord.”
00:21:33 ‎There is much evidence for this conclusion.
00:21:36 ‎So they are like the art thief in our illustration.
00:21:40 ‎They stole something valuable
00:21:43 ‎when they removed Jehovah’s name from the Christian Greek Scriptures.
00:21:48 ‎But we have a problem.
00:21:50 ‎There are no copies  of the Christian Greek Scriptures
00:21:53 ‎from the first century for us to examine.
00:21:56 ‎The earliest existing manuscripts
00:21:59 ‎that would have a bearing on this matter
00:22:01 ‎date from the late second century onward
00:22:04 ‎—a time when we know that the crime  had already been committed
00:22:08 ‎and Jehovah’s name  had already been removed.
00:22:12 ‎So how do we know where Jehovah’s name
00:22:15 ‎originally appeared in the Greek text
00:22:18 ‎before the apostates removed it?
00:22:21 ‎Well, just like the detective in our illustration,
00:22:24 ‎we need to start an investigation
00:22:27 ‎and follow the clues.
00:22:29 ‎To do our work properly,
00:22:31 ‎we need to examine every time  the word “Lord” appears in the text
00:22:36 ‎and see if it refers to Jehovah, to Jesus,
00:22:40 ‎or to some other person with the title “Lord.”
00:22:44 ‎Basically,  there are five clues that will help us
00:22:47 ‎to find out where the original artwork,
00:22:50 ‎that is, Jehovah’s name,  needs to be returned to.
00:22:54 ‎Let’s scrutinize these clues.
00:22:57 ‎The first clue is,
00:22:59 ‎as we have already mentioned, the easiest clue,
00:23:03 ‎where the title “Lord” appears
00:23:05 ‎in quotations from the Hebrew Scriptures
00:23:08 ‎that originally used the divine name.
00:23:10 ‎The second clue is
00:23:13 ‎where the Greek text contains a Hebrew idiom
00:23:16 ‎that would normally contain the divine name.
00:23:19 ‎For example,  if someone says in English,
00:23:22 ‎“He escaped by the skin of his . . . ,”
00:23:25 ‎what word do you expect?
00:23:27 ‎Teeth, not eye.
00:23:29 ‎Yes, the expression is “skin of his teeth.”
00:23:33 ‎This is similar with Hebrew expressions.
00:23:36 ‎Some of these contain the divine name.
00:23:39 ‎For example,  the expression found at Matthew 1:20
00:23:43 ‎is “the angel of Jehovah.”
00:23:47 ‎So whenever we find  a Greek translation of a Hebrew idiom
00:23:50 ‎that uses the divine name,
00:23:52 ‎this is another clue  that Jehovah’s name should be there.
00:23:57 ‎The third clue
00:23:59 ‎is where the term “Lord” appears
00:24:02 ‎in the context surrounding a quotation
00:24:04 ‎that is originally attributed to Jehovah.
00:24:07 ‎An example of this is Matthew 1:22:
00:24:12 ‎“All of this actually came about to fulfill
00:24:16 ‎what was spoken by Jehovah  through his prophet, saying . . .”
00:24:20 ‎The quotation  that immediately follows at Matthew 1:23
00:24:25 ‎is taken from Isaiah 7:14.
00:24:28 ‎This is a prophetic message
00:24:30 ‎spoken by Jehovah through Isaiah.
00:24:33 ‎The fourth clue
00:24:35 ‎is when we see in the Greek text
00:24:38 ‎where there is no definite article  before Kyʹri·os, the Greek word for “Lord,”
00:24:42 ‎in places where the Greek grammar normally expects a definite article.
00:24:47 ‎This clue may indicate  that a proper name, such as Jehovah,
00:24:52 ‎originally was there in the text
00:24:54 ‎and was removed from later manuscripts and replaced with Kyʹri·os.
00:24:59 ‎To illustrate the importance of this clue,
00:25:03 ‎imagine that you are a newspaper reporter
00:25:06 ‎who is reporting on a car accident.
00:25:09 ‎You report that Joe Smith, the driver of the vehicle,
00:25:12 ‎was killed in the accident.
00:25:15 ‎But just before the story goes to press,
00:25:18 ‎your editor informs you  that Joe Smith’s relatives
00:25:21 ‎have not yet been notified of his death.
00:25:24 ‎So you are told to remove his name from the report.
00:25:28 ‎You do that, but in doing so,
00:25:31 ‎you forget to add  the “the” before the word “driver.”
00:25:35 ‎What would happen?
00:25:37 ‎Your report would say,
00:25:39 ‎“As a result of the accident, driver was killed.”
00:25:43 ‎That sounds strange, doesn’t it?
00:25:46 ‎It sounds like “driver”  is the name of the person killed.
00:25:50 ‎That’s because you suppressed the name
00:25:52 ‎and forgot to add the appropriate article.
00:25:56 ‎That is similar  to what our symbolic art thieves did
00:25:59 ‎when removing  Jehovah’s name from the Bible.
00:26:03 ‎An example of this
00:26:05 ‎is found in the Greek text of Mark 13:20.
00:26:11 ‎“In fact, unless Lord had cut short the days,
00:26:15 ‎no flesh would be saved.”
00:26:19 ‎That sounds like “Lord” is a name,
00:26:21 ‎and clearly it should be Jehovah’s name.
00:26:25 ‎That’s why the New World Translation  restores the divine name in this verse.
00:26:31 ‎However,  even in cases where the definite article
00:26:34 ‎occurs before the word “Lord,”
00:26:36 ‎there may be other strong reasons
00:26:38 ‎for viewing “Lord”  as a substitute for the divine name,
00:26:42 ‎like the ones we already discussed.
00:26:46 ‎The final clue
00:26:48 ‎is where the divine name  needs to be added to avoid ambiguity.
00:26:53 ‎An example of this
00:26:55 ‎is in Mark 5:19.
00:26:59 ‎There, Jesus says to a man he healed:
00:27:02 ‎“Go home to your relatives,
00:27:05 ‎“and report to them all the things
00:27:08 ‎Jehovah has done for you  and the mercy he has shown you.”
00:27:13 ‎How do we know that “Lord”  here refers to Jehovah
00:27:17 ‎and not Jesus?
00:27:19 ‎Well, in recording the same event,
00:27:21 ‎Luke 8:39 uses the Greek word The·osʹ (God),
00:27:26 ‎supporting the thought  that Kyʹri·os (Lord) at Mark 5:19
00:27:31 ‎is used with reference to Jehovah God.
00:27:34 ‎So these five clues helped  the New World Bible Translation Committee
00:27:39 ‎to ascertain where the name Jehovah
00:27:41 ‎should be restored to the Biblical text.
00:27:44 ‎In this way, they were able to right the wrong
00:27:47 ‎that was committed by apostate Christians
00:27:50 ‎in the second and third centuries or,
00:27:53 ‎in other words, they were able to return
00:27:55 ‎the figurative pieces of stolen artwork
00:27:58 ‎to their proper places.
00:28:01 ‎If you would like to review these five clues,
00:28:03 ‎you will find a detailed explanation in Appendix C
00:28:08 ‎of the Study Edition of the New World Translation.
00:28:12 ‎You can either find this in the JW Library® app
00:28:15 ‎or online at Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY.
00:28:19 ‎In the same Appendix C,
00:28:21 ‎you will find a list  of what we call J-References
00:28:25 ‎that support these decisions.
00:28:27 ‎But you might ask,
00:28:29 ‎‘What role did these J-References play  in making these decisions?’
00:28:34 ‎Well, to help us understand  the answer to that question,
00:28:37 ‎I’d like to introduce to you  a brother with whom I work,
00:28:40 ‎Brother Nick Ahladis.
00:28:42 ‎He’s the assistant overseer  of Translation Services.
00:28:45 ‎Nick, thanks so much for being willing
00:28:47 ‎to come along  and answer some questions for us.
00:28:50 ‎Yes, I’m glad to come.
00:28:51 ‎Well, now that we’ve got you here, the first question I’d like to ask you is,
00:28:55 ‎What really are these so-called J-References?
00:28:58 ‎Well the “J” in the J-References
00:29:00 ‎stands for Jehovah.
00:29:02 ‎And this is mainly a list of Bibles
00:29:05 ‎in Hebrew and other languages
00:29:08 ‎that use the divine name, Jehovah,
00:29:10 ‎in the main text  of the Christian Greek Scriptures
00:29:13 ‎—or at least some form  of the name Jehovah.
00:29:16 ‎And this list began to be compiled
00:29:18 ‎by the New World Bible Translation Committee
00:29:21 ‎in the 1940’s.
00:29:23 ‎So where would we find a list like that now?
00:29:26 ‎Well, originally there was  a list of 21 such references
00:29:30 ‎in the 1950 edition  of the Christian Greek Scriptures.
00:29:34 ‎Then, in 1984,
00:29:36 ‎27 such references were included
00:29:39 ‎in the Reference Bible in English.
00:29:42 ‎And since that time,  many more J-References have been found,
00:29:47 ‎and now the list includes
00:29:49 ‎over 90 such translations and reference works.
00:29:52 ‎And you can find an up-to-date list
00:29:55 ‎in Appendix C4 of the [Study] Bible.
00:29:58 ‎Very good.
00:29:59 ‎So I guess the main question  we’re interested in asking you is,
00:30:03 ‎Do these J-References prove in themselves
00:30:07 ‎that the Tetragrammaton should be  in the Christian Greek Scriptures?
00:30:11 ‎Actually, no; they don’t.
00:30:13 ‎Ah, now, I’m sure most of us  weren’t expecting you to say that.
00:30:16 ‎So can you explain it a little bit more please?
00:30:18 ‎Well,  the New World Translation Committee
00:30:20 ‎did not rely on the J-References as the basis for their decision
00:30:25 ‎to restore the divine name  in the Christian Greek Scriptures.
00:30:28 ‎You already discussed  the basis for the decision
00:30:31 ‎earlier in the broadcast.
00:30:33 ‎Rather,  these J-References provide proof
00:30:36 ‎that other translators  have made similar decisions
00:30:40 ‎when restoring the divine name
00:30:42 ‎to their editions  of the Christian Greek Scriptures,
00:30:46 ‎or the so-called New Testament.
00:30:48 ‎So, now that you’re talking  about these other Bible translators,
00:30:51 ‎could you give us an example  of who you’re talking about?
00:30:54 ‎Well, a number of them  were well-known Bible scholars.
00:30:58 ‎For example, 19th-century  Lutheran theologian Franz Delitzsch
00:31:03 ‎is still considered to be  a foremost Bible scholar
00:31:06 ‎and a scholar of Biblical Hebrew.
00:31:09 ‎Delitzsch’s translation
00:31:11 ‎of the New Testament in Hebrew  was produced in 1877,
00:31:15 ‎and it’s one of the J-References.
00:31:17 ‎In fact, it’s still one  of the best-known New Testaments
00:31:20 ‎in the Hebrew language.
00:31:23 ‎In that translation,  he discerned when to use Jehovah’s name
00:31:27 ‎in places where the Greek text
00:31:29 ‎contains the term Kyʹri·os, or Lord.
00:31:32 ‎The New World Bible Translation Committee
00:31:34 ‎studied all those occurrences  from his translation
00:31:38 ‎as well as the occurrences  in others of the J-References.
00:31:43 ‎So how would you summarize  what the value is of these J-References?
00:31:47 ‎Well, all the J-References,
00:31:49 ‎including the new ones in the Study Bible,
00:31:52 ‎represent the view  of translators and scholars
00:31:56 ‎who arrived at the same conclusion
00:31:58 ‎that the New World  Bible Translation Committee did,
00:32:01 ‎namely, that Jesus Christ and the apostles
00:32:04 ‎used the name Jehovah  in their teaching and in their writings.
00:32:09 ‎And this conclusion is reflected
00:32:11 ‎in their translation and reference works.
00:32:15 ‎Very interesting.  That’s fascinating.
00:32:17 ‎So if I’ve got it right then,
00:32:19 ‎what you’re saying is that if we go to Appendix C, in C3,
00:32:24 ‎there we’ve got a list of the reasons
00:32:26 ‎why the brothers on the New World Translation Committee
00:32:29 ‎decided to put Jehovah’s name in certain verses.
00:32:32 ‎And then C4 is virtually
00:32:35 ‎a list of other Bible translations
00:32:37 ‎where the translators made exactly the same decision.
00:32:40 ‎Is that right?
00:32:41 ‎That’s exactly right.
00:32:42 ‎Ah, that’s good.
00:32:43 ‎Well, thank you very much, Nick, for coming along.
00:32:45 ‎We really appreciated hearing  those expressions from you.
00:32:48 ‎Before you go, though,  can we ask you, please,
00:32:51 ‎Can you take back the love and greetings and an expression of appreciation
00:32:55 ‎to all those hardworking brothers and sisters there in Translation Services?
00:32:59 ‎Yes, I’d be happy to.
00:33:00 ‎Thank you very much.
00:33:03 ‎Why does the organization work  so diligently to translate the Bible?
00:33:07 ‎It’s not so that we can feel smart
00:33:10 ‎when talking to others about the Bible and God’s name.
00:33:13 ‎No, but it equips us to follow  Jesus’ example in the ministry
00:33:18 ‎and to glorify God’s name
00:33:20 ‎and make it known  to those searching for Him.
00:33:23 ‎This month’s original song is entitled
00:33:26 ‎“The Search,”
00:33:28 ‎and it shows the joy people feel  when they find Jehovah.
00:33:51 ‎We heard the words ‘seek and you’ll find’ The very priceless pearl of truth.
00:34:03 ‎It was a sea of doubts and questions to God That the search would take us through.
00:34:15 ‎But we carried on with our sails unfurled.
00:34:22 ‎Like merchants on a quest,  we knew that truth was out there.
00:34:33 ‎The search—the search for the key To answer all the things,
00:34:41 ‎Things that we fight to understand:
00:34:47 ‎The origin of man, wondering why we need  God’s Kingdom soon to come.
00:34:58 ‎Searching hard to find.
00:35:02 ‎We had never known God had a name. Jehovah is the one to call on.
00:35:14 ‎When we were shown, we found a piece Of what we were searching for.
00:35:26 ‎And we carried on with our sails unfurled,
00:35:33 ‎Finding truths about where we came from  and where we’re heading.
00:35:44 ‎The search—the search for the key That answered all the things,
00:35:51 ‎Things that we fought to understand:
00:35:58 ‎The origin of man, a paradise that’s promised  in God’s Kingdom soon to come.
00:36:10 ‎Search and you will find.
00:36:14 ‎Now we can never hold back  when others are searching
00:36:20 ‎For the priceless pearl of truth, Sailing a sea of unanswered questions.
00:36:32 ‎So we help them to get through, And we share what we’ve discovered.
00:37:07 ‎The search—the search for the key To answer all the things,
00:37:15 ‎Things that they fight to understand:
00:37:21 ‎The origin of man, living forever in God’s Kingdom soon to come.
00:37:35 ‎Search and you will find.
00:37:55 ‎Maybe you once thought similarly
00:37:57 ‎to what the lyrics from our song express:
00:38:01 ‎“Like merchants on a quest,  we knew the truth was out there.”
00:38:06 ‎What a wonderful privilege it is to find Jehovah
00:38:10 ‎and then to help others who are still searching.
00:38:13 ‎It’s an important way we glorify God’s name
00:38:17 ‎and why we’re called Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:38:20 ‎Bearing that name is, of course,
00:38:22 ‎both a privilege and a responsibility.
00:38:26 ‎How so?
00:38:28 ‎Brother Robert Ciranko explains in this Bethel morning worship.
00:38:32 ‎By the time the apostle Peter
00:38:34 ‎wrote the words of today’s text,
00:38:36 ‎individuals who were Jews,
00:38:38 ‎proselytes, Samaritans,
00:38:40 ‎and Gentiles had been brought
00:38:42 ‎into the Christian congregation
00:38:44 ‎as God’s people,
00:38:45 ‎the spiritual Israel of God.
00:38:48 ‎In the verse before today’s text,
00:38:50 ‎Peter outlined what their mission was.
00:38:53 ‎Let’s open  to 1 Peter chapter 2 and read that.
00:38:57 ‎It’s in verses 9 and 10 of 1 Peter 2.
00:39:02 ‎He wrote:
00:39:04 ‎“But you are ‘a chosen race,  a royal priesthood,
00:39:08 ‎“‘a holy nation,  a people for special possession,
00:39:12 ‎“that you should declare abroad  the excellencies’
00:39:15 ‎“of the One who called you  out of darkness into his wonderful light.
00:39:19 ‎“For you were once not a people,
00:39:21 ‎but now you are God’s people.”
00:39:25 ‎And, of course, this refers  to the spirit-anointed members
00:39:29 ‎of the congregation  who would be responsible
00:39:32 ‎for glorifying Jehovah’s name  as his Witnesses.
00:39:35 ‎And this harmonizes  with what Peter had said years earlier
00:39:39 ‎in the first-century governing body meeting,
00:39:42 ‎as reported in Acts chapter 15.
00:39:45 ‎So let’s turn there, Acts 15,
00:39:48 ‎and we will begin with verse 14.
00:39:52 ‎It says:  “Symeon has related thoroughly how God
00:39:55 ‎“for the first time  turned his attention to the nations
00:39:58 ‎“to take out of them a people for his name.
00:40:01 ‎“And with this the words  of the Prophets agree,
00:40:04 ‎“just as it is written:
00:40:06 ‎“‘After these things  I will return and raise up again
00:40:08 ‎“‘the tent of David that is fallen down;
00:40:11 ‎“‘I will rebuild its ruins and restore it,
00:40:13 ‎“‘so that the men who remain  may earnestly seek Jehovah,
00:40:17 ‎“‘together with people of all the nations,
00:40:19 ‎“‘people who are called by my name,
00:40:22 ‎says Jehovah, who is doing these things.’”
00:40:26 ‎Now, what about the rest of us
00:40:28 ‎who are not anointed Christians
00:40:30 ‎but who call ourselves Jehovah’s Witnesses?
00:40:34 ‎Are we also God’s people?
00:40:36 ‎Well, most certainly!
00:40:38 ‎And what a proud honor it is for us
00:40:40 ‎to bear the name of the only true God.
00:40:43 ‎But with that name comes responsibility,
00:40:46 ‎one that other religious groups  do not want to take on.
00:40:50 ‎You see, we are under obligation
00:40:52 ‎to bear witness to Jehovah,
00:40:54 ‎to tell the truth about him,
00:40:57 ‎and to expose false teachings
00:40:59 ‎that misrepresent Jehovah.
00:41:02 ‎And a classic example  of an unscriptural dogma
00:41:05 ‎that God’s people have exposed is the Trinity,
00:41:09 ‎which reminds me of another hoax
00:41:11 ‎that fooled many people  who should have known better.
00:41:14 ‎It’s the true story  about a man named van Meegeren,
00:41:18 ‎a Dutch artist, born in 1889,
00:41:22 ‎who perpetrated what may have been
00:41:25 ‎the most sensational art hoax of all time.
00:41:28 ‎You see, he never won the critical acclaim
00:41:31 ‎that he thought he was due as an artist.
00:41:33 ‎So to get back at the art critics,
00:41:36 ‎he decided to demonstrate his talent
00:41:38 ‎by producing a painting that would fool them all,
00:41:41 ‎and he set out to imitate
00:41:42 ‎the famous 17th-century Dutch impressionist,
00:41:46 ‎Johannes Vermeer.
00:41:48 ‎Well, van Meegeren spent 4 years figuring out
00:41:52 ‎how to make  a new painting look 300 years old.
00:41:56 ‎The canvas was the easy part.
00:41:58 ‎He just took a lesser-known painting
00:42:00 ‎from the 17th century  and removed the picture.
00:42:02 ‎His biggest problem was getting oil paint
00:42:05 ‎to harden thoroughly,  which usually takes 50 years.
00:42:08 ‎He solved it  by mixing his pigments with a synthetic resin
00:42:12 ‎instead of oil and then baking the canvas.
00:42:16 ‎Well, van Meegeren produced six paintings
00:42:19 ‎that were passed off as Vermeers.
00:42:22 ‎His greatest sold in 1937.
00:42:24 ‎It was entitled  Christ and the Disciples at Emmaus.
00:42:28 ‎The most authoritative art historian of the day
00:42:31 ‎said it was a genuine Vermeer masterpiece,
00:42:35 ‎untouched, on the original canvas,
00:42:37 ‎and that it had no restoration done to it.
00:42:40 ‎But in reality, it was a fake.
00:42:43 ‎The critic’s opinion was taken  as gospel in the art world,
00:42:46 ‎so much so that this critic  had been nicknamed “The Pope.”
00:42:51 ‎Eventually, though,  a chemical analysis proved
00:42:54 ‎that the paint contained  an ingredient that had not been discovered
00:42:57 ‎until two centuries after Vermeer died,
00:43:00 ‎and that’s what exposed  van Meegeren as a fraud.
00:43:04 ‎Well, something similar  went on during the apostasy
00:43:07 ‎that took place  after the death of the apostles.
00:43:10 ‎Less than 300 years  after the Bible was completed,
00:43:13 ‎a Trinitarian added to 1 John 5:7 the words
00:43:18 ‎“in heaven, the Father,  the Word, and the Holy Ghost:
00:43:22 ‎and these three are one.”
00:43:25 ‎However, this addition does not appear
00:43:27 ‎in the oldest Greek manuscripts,
00:43:29 ‎proving it’s a fake;  it’s a corruption of God’s Word.
00:43:34 ‎And yet for centuries,  the churches propagated the Trinity doctrine.
00:43:38 ‎As recently as the 19th century,
00:43:40 ‎almost all Bible translations
00:43:42 ‎had this spurious addition.
00:43:45 ‎As late as 1897, Pope Leo XIII
00:43:48 ‎upheld the corrupted text
00:43:50 ‎of the Latin Vulgate.
00:43:53 ‎Interestingly, the New Catholic Encyclopedia
00:43:55 ‎comments on this  and says: “The Trinitarian dogma
00:43:58 ‎“is in the last analysis  a late 4th century invention.
00:44:03 ‎“Among the Apostolic Fathers,
00:44:05 ‎“there had been nothing  even remotely approaching
00:44:07 ‎such a mentality or perspective.”
00:44:10 ‎Well, Jehovah’s anointed Witnesses
00:44:13 ‎firmly rejected Christendom’s Trinity dogma.
00:44:17 ‎In 1915,  The Watch Tower exposed the foolishness
00:44:22 ‎of teaching a doctrine  that contradicts the Bible.
00:44:25 ‎The Watch Tower said:
00:44:27 ‎“In what a jumble of contradictions
00:44:29 ‎“and confusion  do they find themselves who say
00:44:32 ‎“that Jesus and the Father are one God!
00:44:34 ‎“This would involve the idea
00:44:36 ‎“that our Lord Jesus acted  the hypocrite when on earth
00:44:39 ‎“and only pretended  to address God in prayer,
00:44:41 ‎“when He Himself was the same God. . . .
00:44:44 ‎“The Father has always been immortal,  hence could not die.
00:44:47 ‎“How then, could Jesus have died? . . .
00:44:50 ‎“The Scriptures declare,  however, that He did die. . . .
00:44:53 ‎“If they admit that Jesus really died,  they take the other horn of the dilemma;
00:44:57 ‎“for believing that their three Gods
00:44:59 ‎“are all one person as many do,
00:45:01 ‎“when Jesus died  they must all three have died.
00:45:04 ‎“If they all died, who raised them to life?
00:45:07 ‎“How foolish all this sounds! . . .
00:45:09 ‎“Shall we thus contradict the Apostles  and Prophets and Jesus Himself,
00:45:13 ‎“and ignore reason  and common sense, in order to hold
00:45:16 ‎“to a dogma handed to us  from the dark, superstitious past,
00:45:20 ‎“by a corrupt apostate Church?
00:45:22 ‎Nay!” says The Watch Tower.
00:45:26 ‎Well, Jehovah’s people  continue to uphold the excellencies
00:45:30 ‎ of the only true God.
00:45:33 ‎Whether in ancient times,  as with the natural Israelites
00:45:36 ‎or in modern times, as with spiritual Israel,
00:45:39 ‎Jehovah’s words through Isaiah are still true.
00:45:42 ‎Look at it at Isaiah 43:21.
00:45:47 ‎Of course,  we know in Isaiah chapter 43
00:45:50 ‎Jehovah declares:  “You are my witnesses.”
00:45:53 ‎And in verse 21 he says:
00:45:57 ‎“The people whom I formed for myself
00:46:00 ‎so that they might declare my praise.”
00:46:05 ‎And the effort that Jehovah’s Witnesses​
00:46:07 ‎—God’s people​— have put forth to expose
00:46:09 ‎ Bible teachings that are false,
00:46:14 ‎to teach the truth about Jehovah,
00:46:16 ‎and to sanctify God’s name  has taken on proportions
00:46:19 ‎never attained by any other religious group.
00:46:22 ‎And Jehovah takes notice of that.
00:46:24 ‎Look at Malachi the 3rd chapter.
00:46:27 ‎Malachi chapter 3,
00:46:30 ‎beginning with verse 16.
00:46:34 ‎Malachi 3:​16:
00:46:37 ‎“At that time those  who feared Jehovah spoke with one another,
00:46:41 ‎“each one with his companion,
00:46:43 ‎“and Jehovah kept paying  attention and listening.
00:46:46 ‎“And a book of remembrance  was written before him
00:46:49 ‎“for those fearing Jehovah  and for those meditating on
00:46:52 ‎“[or the footnote says,  possibly, “treasuring”] his name.
00:46:56 ‎“‘And they will be mine,’  says Jehovah of armies,
00:46:59 ‎‘in the day when I produce  a special property.’”
00:47:03 ‎So Jehovah truly does love those
00:47:07 ‎who fear him and treasure his name,
00:47:10 ‎making them truly God’s people.
00:47:13 ‎Jehovah can remove any obstacle
00:47:16 ‎to sanctifying his name  and declaring the good news
00:47:20 ‎—even long-held false teachings.
00:47:23 ‎And what is more amazing,
00:47:25 ‎he uses his people —his special property—
00:47:28 ‎to get the work done.
00:47:30 ‎The challenges may be different where you live,
00:47:33 ‎but the results are the same:
00:47:36 ‎Jehovah blesses your efforts to glorify him.
00:47:40 ‎Let’s see an example in this report from Peru,
00:47:43 ‎where our brothers are reaching the hearts
00:47:45 ‎of Quechua-speaking people  in the Andes Mountains.
00:48:04 ‎My name is Faustino Camacho Quispe.
00:48:08 ‎My family and I speak Quechua or,
00:48:12 ‎as we say, runa simi
00:48:15 ‎—the language of the people.
00:48:18 ‎We live in an agricultural community
00:48:22 ‎in the mountains of Peru.
00:48:25 ‎Our way of life depends on farming.
00:48:28 ‎We grow crops such as corn,
00:48:31 ‎potatoes, wheat,
00:48:34 ‎and quinoa.
00:48:37 ‎We also raise a small amount of livestock.
00:48:43 ‎Many people who speak Quechua  have moved to larger cities,
00:48:46 ‎but others, like us, still enjoy
00:48:49 ‎a more traditional way of life in the country.
00:48:54 ‎My family and I are Jehovah’s Witnesses.
00:49:05 ‎Most of our brothers and sisters in this area
00:49:08 ‎would never have been able to learn the truth
00:49:10 ‎had there not been someone  sent here to preach in Quechua.
00:49:16 ‎In 1992,
00:49:19 ‎the Peru branch office began to expand
00:49:22 ‎the work in the Quechua-language field.
00:49:24 ‎In order to reach those living in isolated areas,
00:49:28 ‎zealous brothers and sisters climbed narrow roads
00:49:31 ‎in the frigid elevations of the Andes Mountains.
00:49:37 ‎Great efforts were made in order
00:49:39 ‎to bring Quechua-speaking people
00:49:41 ‎the good news in their own language.
00:49:45 ‎The people loved having publications in their mother tongue.
00:49:50 ‎However, there were some challenges
00:49:53 ‎in carrying out this work.
00:49:55 ‎One problem was not having a good translation
00:49:58 ‎of the Holy Scriptures in Quechua.
00:50:00 ‎The commonly used translations here in Peru
00:50:03 ‎omit God’s name in the main text.
00:50:06 ‎It can be found in the glossary of some Bibles,
00:50:09 ‎and sometimes we used that in order to preach.
00:50:11 ‎But even so, it didn’t have the same impact
00:50:15 ‎as seeing it in its proper place.
00:50:17 ‎That, along with the influence of false doctrines,
00:50:21 ‎made it difficult for us to teach the truth.
00:50:25 ‎When we teach people about the Bible,
00:50:28 ‎we want them to draw close to God;
00:50:31 ‎we want them to become his friends.
00:50:33 ‎But no one can be God’s friend
00:50:35 ‎if they don’t know his name.
00:50:38 ‎For people to be able to come to love God,
00:50:40 ‎they have to know his name,
00:50:43 ‎and they have to understand what it means.
00:50:47 ‎It was difficult for us to use the Bible at the meetings,
00:50:51 ‎in the field ministry, and in our family worship.
00:51:07 ‎How could Jehovah’s great name be sanctified
00:51:09 ‎throughout this mountainous region?
00:51:12 ‎How could the Quechua people get to know God
00:51:14 ‎when his name was hidden?
00:51:18 ‎The answer to our prayers came
00:51:19 ‎when Quechua congregations throughout the country
00:51:22 ‎were invited to a special program
00:51:24 ‎on May 1, 2016.
00:51:27 ‎Imagine the great joy we felt when Brother Jackson
00:51:30 ‎of the Governing Body announced the release
00:51:32 ‎of the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures
00:51:36 ‎in two Quechua languages!
00:51:38 ‎Language number 136:
00:51:40 ‎It’s the Christian Greek Scriptures
00:51:44 ‎in Quechua Ayacucho!
00:51:55 ‎But we also have number 137:
00:51:59 ‎It’s Quechua Cuzco!
00:52:05 ‎What a wonderful gift we’ve received today!
00:52:12 ‎This new Quechua Bible
00:52:15 ‎is a grand victory for Jehovah’s great name.
00:52:18 ‎God’s name is no longer hidden from the Quechua people,
00:52:22 ‎giving them the precious opportunity
00:52:25 ‎to come to know our loving Creator, Jehovah.
00:52:53 ‎I feel proud to use our new Bible to teach
00:52:57 ‎my family and neighbors Jehovah’s name.
00:53:00 ‎I am thankful every day
00:53:02 ‎that Jehovah sent this good news to the mountains
00:53:05 ‎to us who speak runa simi
00:53:07 ‎—the language of the people.
00:53:14 ‎It was a privilege  to be at such a happy event
00:53:18 ‎and to see our brothers’ joy
00:53:20 ‎when they received  the Christian Greek Scriptures
00:53:22 ‎in two Quechua languages.
00:53:25 ‎May they use their Bibles  to draw close to Jehovah
00:53:28 ‎and glorify his name in the Andes Mountains.
00:53:32 ‎Our program now goes
00:53:34 ‎to the South Pacific,
00:53:37 ‎where we conclude  with greetings from Tuvalu.
00:53:41 ‎Most of Tuvalu’s nine islands  are ring-shaped coral atolls
00:53:46 ‎surrounding peaceful lagoons.
00:53:48 ‎These small islands barely rise out of the sea.
00:53:52 ‎On Funafuti, Tuvalu’s capital,
00:53:55 ‎the island is just wide enough in some places
00:53:59 ‎for the main road and a single house.
00:54:03 ‎The motorbike is the preferred way  to travel on the island.
00:54:06 ‎So it’s good that our witnessing carts come equipped with sturdy wheels.
00:54:12 ‎Tuvalu has a busy remote translation office.
00:54:15 ‎In 2011,
00:54:17 ‎the New World Translation  of the Christian Greek Scriptures in Tuvaluan
00:54:21 ‎was released.
00:54:22 ‎In October of last year,  the complete Bible was released,
00:54:27 ‎making Tuvaluan  the smallest language group
00:54:30 ‎to receive the New World Translation.
00:54:33 ‎I was assigned to Tuvalu in 1979
00:54:36 ‎and enjoyed the challenging task
00:54:38 ‎of helping to establish Tuvaluan translation.
00:54:41 ‎There were  only 3 other baptized publishers back then,
00:54:45 ‎but in 2017,
00:54:48 ‎Tuvalu reported a peak of 125 publishers.
00:54:52 ‎They preach to a population
00:54:55 ‎of around 10,000 people.
00:54:58 ‎Tuvaluans are warm and friendly,
00:55:00 ‎and our brothers and sisters thoroughly enjoy
00:55:03 ‎the time they can spend together.
00:55:06 ‎They send their love  and greetings from the South Pacific.
00:55:13 ‎Alofa atu in Tuvaluan means
00:55:15 ‎“We send our love to you all.”
00:55:17 ‎We send them our love  and pray for Jehovah’s continued blessing.
00:55:21 ‎This is JW Broadcasting

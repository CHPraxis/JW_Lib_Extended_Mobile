00:01.383 --> 00:04.986
Welcome to JW Broadcasting! 


00:04.987 --> 00:07.224
On our program for this month, 


00:07.223 --> 00:10.860
we’ll hear the experience 
of Brother Jim Brown. 


00:10.860 --> 00:12.762
He studied the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses 


00:12.762 --> 00:16.065
off and on for 30 years! 


00:16.065 --> 00:21.972
What motivated him to make changes 
and dedicate his life to Jehovah? 


00:21.972 --> 00:24.907
When serious problems arise in marriage, 


00:24.907 --> 00:27.810
how will Bible principles help you? 


00:27.810 --> 00:30.313
The candid and heartfelt interviews 
with these couples 


00:30.313 --> 00:33.000
will show how the Bible 
saved their marriages. 


00:34.683 --> 00:38.488
It’s important for youths to develop 
good spiritual habits early. 


00:38.488 --> 00:42.958
How can teenagers get the most 
out of their daily Bible reading? 


00:42.958 --> 00:46.963
We have a lot to look forward to 
on the April 2018 edition 


00:46.963 --> 00:49.000
of JW Broadcasting. 


01:08.518 --> 01:11.586
As God’s Word touches 
the heart of a Bible student, 


01:11.587 --> 01:14.224
they may need to make significant changes 


01:14.223 --> 01:16.491
to live by Jehovah’s standards. 


01:16.492 --> 01:20.029
We start our program with just such a story. 


01:20.028 --> 01:22.131
Meet Jim Brown, 


01:22.132 --> 01:24.267
a brother from Key Largo, Florida, 


01:24.267 --> 01:26.269
in the United States. 


01:26.268 --> 01:28.671
Before becoming one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


01:28.672 --> 01:32.575
he was on a dangerous path 
of vice and violence. 


01:32.575 --> 01:36.000
What changes did he have to make 
on the road to true worship? 


01:41.750 --> 01:43.953
I’m 53 years old.


01:43.953 --> 01:46.000
I was known as a troublemaker.


01:47.690 --> 01:50.760
I was fighting in the bars.


01:50.760 --> 01:53.428
It comes to a point to where
you begin to enjoy it.


01:53.428 --> 01:55.831
He was flat-out scary.


01:55.832 --> 01:58.935
He was a very mean and violent man,


01:58.935 --> 02:02.000
so everybody
kind of kept their distance from him.


02:03.138 --> 02:07.110
My language was detestable.


02:07.110 --> 02:09.145
I would make grown men blush


02:09.145 --> 02:11.948
by the things that I would say
and things that I would do.


02:11.948 --> 02:14.950
I was involved with some bikers,


02:14.950 --> 02:18.855
and they were trying to prospect me
into getting into their club.


02:18.855 --> 02:21.223
Things were escalating.


02:21.223 --> 02:25.195
We got married very young,
and we were 17.


02:25.195 --> 02:27.563
And we had my oldest daughter.


02:27.563 --> 02:30.966
I was the mom,
and he lived a life


02:30.967 --> 02:34.000
of being out with his friends
and partying.


02:35.572 --> 02:39.242
About that time, my wife started studying
the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


02:39.242 --> 02:43.079
It was a big change for her, 
but she explained the reasoning behind it.


02:43.078 --> 02:44.680
I couldn’t argue with it. 


02:44.680 --> 02:47.383
She talked me into studying.


02:47.383 --> 02:52.155
I studied from 20 years old to 30.


02:52.155 --> 02:53.857
I had always seen it.


02:53.857 --> 02:55.325
I had always seen that it was good.


02:55.325 --> 02:57.160
I knew that this was where I needed to be.


02:57.160 --> 03:01.030
Somehow, I just could never break free
of the person that I was.


03:01.030 --> 03:03.098
My mom always raised us in the truth, 


03:03.098 --> 03:05.066
growing up, and that’s what we knew. 


03:05.067 --> 03:06.435
So, then, to see my dad, 


03:06.435 --> 03:08.905
where he was so different


03:08.905 --> 03:11.908
but yet believed it to be the truth, 


03:11.908 --> 03:15.778
and then to see that his lifestyle 
didn’t do him any good 


03:15.778 --> 03:18.446
was kind of a good example


03:18.447 --> 03:21.000
of a bad example, if that makes sense.


03:23.085 --> 03:25.120
I was afraid of the change.


03:25.120 --> 03:28.123
People accepted me for who I was,


03:28.123 --> 03:32.728
being the tough guy, being Jimmy Brown.


03:32.728 --> 03:34.196
The scripture comes to mind:


03:34.197 --> 03:37.234
“I planted, Apollos watered,
but God kept making it grow.”


03:37.233 --> 03:39.568
Many brothers have studied with Jim


03:39.568 --> 03:41.905
from time to time over the years.


03:41.905 --> 03:45.808
I just happened to be the one
at the time in his life


03:45.808 --> 03:49.000
when he was taking the truth
and running with it.


03:51.147 --> 03:53.382
I wanted to be a better person.


03:53.382 --> 03:56.285
I truly knew that this was just


03:56.285 --> 03:59.000
not the way of life that I wanted anymore.


04:00.790 --> 04:02.925
He changed his friends;
he changed his life;


04:02.925 --> 04:04.927
he changed his dress and grooming; 


04:04.927 --> 04:07.464
he changed his speech patterns;


04:07.463 --> 04:10.433
he changed the way he was a grandfather; 


04:10.433 --> 04:12.901
he changed the way he was a father;
he changed the way he was a husband.


04:12.902 --> 04:15.000
Everything changed about him.


04:18.107 --> 04:20.109
I knew the work that Witnesses do


04:20.108 --> 04:22.111
—going out door to door talking to people. 


04:22.112 --> 04:23.680
I thought I could never do that. 


04:23.680 --> 04:25.348
Whoa! 
Me, going door to door? 


04:25.348 --> 04:27.850
I’m going to run into people that I know, 


04:27.850 --> 04:30.453
that I drank with for years and years. 


04:30.453 --> 04:33.288
How can I face them now? 


04:33.288 --> 04:35.325
I had always told my wife, 


04:35.325 --> 04:37.327
“It would be much easier for me 


04:37.327 --> 04:39.962
to become a Witness if I didn’t live here.”


04:39.962 --> 04:42.832
But how wrong I was


04:42.832 --> 04:45.635
because what a witness my changes have been


04:45.635 --> 04:48.000
to so many people in town.


04:51.040 --> 04:53.175
One of my favorite things to do


04:53.175 --> 04:57.047
is bridge witnessing with my granddaughter.


04:57.047 --> 05:00.517
People are fishing on the bridge
—some have been there all night.


05:00.517 --> 05:02.552
I even have return visits that I do


05:02.552 --> 05:04.654
because people regularly
come down on the weekend


05:04.653 --> 05:06.655
to fish on the bridges.


05:06.655 --> 05:08.692
I seize every opportunity.


05:08.692 --> 05:10.660
My kids laugh at me.


05:10.660 --> 05:13.362
He’ll witness to anybody, anytime, anywhere.


05:13.362 --> 05:17.167
You’ll see some raggedy-taggedy,
old, rough guy


05:17.167 --> 05:19.702
that he knew
and brought to the Kingdom Hall.


05:19.702 --> 05:21.704
In a few weeks,
he’s got a new suit on,


05:21.703 --> 05:25.508
got a haircut,
clean-shaven, and just—


05:25.508 --> 05:28.043
This is the effect he has on the people


05:28.043 --> 05:31.146
that he comes in contact with.


05:31.147 --> 05:33.149
I love life now.


05:33.148 --> 05:35.150
I have true friends.


05:35.150 --> 05:37.753
I know that I have hope for the future.


05:37.753 --> 05:41.356
Jehovah has seen something in me,


05:41.357 --> 05:43.359
and he’s brought it to light


05:43.358 --> 05:46.028
that I am a good person.


05:46.028 --> 05:49.531
I can be a good human being;
I can help other people;


05:49.532 --> 05:53.000
I can be loved by Him.


05:54.937 --> 05:56.000
It’s priceless.


06:04.080 --> 06:06.915
Are you a Bible student who is undecided 


06:06.915 --> 06:09.918
on whether to “commit your way to Jehovah”? 


06:09.918 --> 06:13.155
Take note of the trust and confidence 


06:13.155 --> 06:16.458
Brother Brown showed 
in dedicating his life to God. 


06:16.458 --> 06:20.261
Be assured that Jehovah 
will guide and care for us 


06:20.262 --> 06:22.832
if we give him the opportunity. 


06:22.832 --> 06:27.637
Brother Brown now enjoys the blessing 
of living under Jehovah’s protection, 


06:27.637 --> 06:31.374
serving as a ministerial servant 
and regular pioneer. 


06:31.373 --> 06:35.611
You too can experience 
Jehovah’s spiritual protection, 


06:35.612 --> 06:38.915
as we’ll learn throughout our program. 


06:38.915 --> 06:40.617
The theme of our broadcast 


06:40.617 --> 06:42.752
is a very comforting one: 


06:42.752 --> 06:44.954
“Being ‘Securely Wrapped 


06:44.953 --> 06:47.000
in the Bag of Life With Jehovah.’” 


06:48.423 --> 06:50.826
Perhaps the thought 
of being securely wrapped 


06:50.827 --> 06:53.695
makes us think of a safely swaddled baby 


06:53.695 --> 06:58.100
or of being enveloped 
in a warm blanket on a cold night. 


06:58.100 --> 07:01.737
In the Bible, these words 
were uttered by the woman Abigail 


07:01.737 --> 07:03.974
to Jehovah’s servant David. 


07:03.973 --> 07:06.208
To understand the meaning of the words 


07:06.208 --> 07:08.210
and their importance today, 


07:08.210 --> 07:12.482
let’s review the context 
of 1 Samuel chapter 25. 


07:12.482 --> 07:16.352
David and 600 of his men 
 were dwelling as fugitives. 


07:16.352 --> 07:18.354
They eventually encountered men 


07:18.353 --> 07:21.723
who worked as shepherds 
for Abigail’s husband, Nabal. 


07:21.723 --> 07:25.728
David and his men began 
to help guard Nabal’s flocks 


07:25.728 --> 07:29.365
and serve as “a protective wall” 
for Nabal’s flocks and servants 


07:29.365 --> 07:33.702
against thieves and invaders 
who roamed through the wilderness. 


07:33.702 --> 07:38.240
It was likely challenging 
to find enough food for 600 soldiers, 


07:38.240 --> 07:40.710
so David decided to send ten of his men 


07:40.710 --> 07:43.312
to kindly ask Nabal for food 


07:43.312 --> 07:47.550
in repayment for the services 
that they had performed. 


07:47.550 --> 07:52.955
But at 1 Samuel 25:10, 11, 


07:52.955 --> 07:55.958
note Nabal’s reply: 


07:55.958 --> 07:58.995
“Nabal answered David’s servants: 


07:58.995 --> 08:03.365
“‘Who is David, and who is the son of Jesse? 


08:03.365 --> 08:07.770
“‘Nowadays many servants 
are breaking away from their masters. 


08:07.770 --> 08:11.507
“‘Do I have to take my bread and my water 


08:11.507 --> 08:14.144
“‘and the meat 
that I butchered for my shearers 


08:14.143 --> 08:18.080
and give it to men who come 
from who knows where?’” 


08:18.080 --> 08:23.085
This was not the response that David 
and his men were expecting to hear. 


08:23.085 --> 08:28.090
The Bible describes Nabal 
as a very harsh, worthless man, 


08:28.090 --> 08:31.527
and this is certainly evidenced by his reply. 


08:31.527 --> 08:35.699
“He screamed insults” 
at the messengers and ridiculed David, 


08:35.698 --> 08:39.101
comparing him to a runaway servant. 


08:39.102 --> 08:42.972
So David decided 
to take matters into his own hands 


08:42.972 --> 08:46.875
and resolve the situation 
the way many people today might 


08:46.875 --> 08:49.078
—by fighting. 


08:49.078 --> 08:51.080
In verse 13, 


08:51.080 --> 08:54.217
he has 400 of his men 
prepare themselves for battle, 


08:54.217 --> 08:56.252
with one mission


08:56.252 --> 08:59.000
—to wipe out every male 
in Nabal’s household. 


09:00.623 --> 09:05.193
Eventually, word got back to Abigail 
about what her husband had done. 


09:05.193 --> 09:08.330
Without telling Nabal, 
she gathered an abundance of food 


09:08.330 --> 09:10.667
and went out to meet David. 


09:10.667 --> 09:14.470
When she met up with him, 
she poured out her heart at length, 


09:14.470 --> 09:17.072
asking David to forgive her personally 


09:17.072 --> 09:19.275
and making a powerful plea for mercy 


09:19.275 --> 09:22.545
on behalf of her husband and her household. 


09:22.545 --> 09:26.482
She acknowledged that Nabal 
was a foolish and senseless man, 


09:26.482 --> 09:29.385
so she urged David not to take any action 


09:29.385 --> 09:31.520
that might bring bloodguilt upon him 


09:31.520 --> 09:35.523
or cause him to be affected 
by a troubled conscience. 


09:35.523 --> 09:38.826
As Abigail concluded her appeal to David, 


09:38.827 --> 09:42.732
notice what she tells him in verse 29, 


09:42.732 --> 09:45.869
the theme of our discussion: 


09:45.868 --> 09:50.371
“When someone rises up 
to pursue you and seeks your life, 


09:50.372 --> 09:53.542
“the life of my lord will be wrapped securely 


09:53.542 --> 09:56.512
“in the bag of life with Jehovah your God, 


09:56.512 --> 09:58.514
“but the lives of your enemies 


09:58.513 --> 10:02.585
he will hurl away like stones from a sling.” 


10:02.585 --> 10:05.587
Just as we might wrap up something valuable 


10:05.587 --> 10:08.090
in order to protect and preserve it, 


10:08.090 --> 10:11.227
Abigail was telling David 
that that is how his life 


10:11.227 --> 10:13.395
would be in Jehovah’s hands. 


10:13.395 --> 10:17.367
Jehovah would protect and preserve 
David’s life from his enemies 


10:17.367 --> 10:21.670
as long as he did not seek 
to save himself by personal efforts 


10:21.670 --> 10:23.872
but waited on Jehovah, 


10:23.872 --> 10:27.000
trusting in the One to whom he owed his life.


10:28.543 --> 10:32.415
What lessons can we learn from this account? 


10:32.415 --> 10:36.985
As David saw, his relationship 
with Jehovah was a protection. 


10:36.985 --> 10:41.000
In verse 32, he acknowledges 
that God had sent Abigail with the warning. 


10:42.825 --> 10:46.428
We learn 
that Jehovah’s spiritual protection for us 


10:46.428 --> 10:51.000
is related to the quality 
of our relationship with him. 


10:51.000 --> 10:56.672
That’s why the Bible tells us at James 4:8: 


10:56.672 --> 10:59.342
“Draw close to God, 


10:59.342 --> 11:02.412
and he will draw close to you.” 


11:02.412 --> 11:05.414
Jehovah invites us to draw near to him 


11:05.413 --> 11:10.118
because he wants to receive us 
into his favor as his friends. 


11:10.118 --> 11:14.390
When we dedicate our lives 
and vow to serve him unconditionally, 


11:14.390 --> 11:16.725
we gain an approved standing with him; 


11:16.725 --> 11:20.162
we’re figuratively put in that “bag of life.” 


11:20.162 --> 11:24.500
And as we work to develop 
a close personal relationship with him, 


11:24.500 --> 11:28.770
then we can experience 
Jehovah’s friendship and protection. 


11:28.770 --> 11:31.640
We would never want 
to restrict Jehovah’s protection 


11:31.640 --> 11:36.000
by not looking to him for guidance 
or relying on our own thinking. 


11:37.045 --> 11:40.148
Now, can we think of areas or situations 


11:40.148 --> 11:43.451
that might require us to wait on Jehovah? 


11:43.452 --> 11:48.490
Perhaps we’re experiencing 
literal opposition at work or at school. 


11:48.490 --> 11:53.000
Like Abigail, we might face the challenge 
of living with a difficult marriage mate. 


11:54.197 --> 11:56.199
Maybe we’re battling a health issue 


11:56.198 --> 11:59.768
and loyalty is needed 
regarding our medical choices. 


11:59.768 --> 12:01.770
Or it may be that we live in a country 


12:01.770 --> 12:03.872
where we cannot preach freely 


12:03.872 --> 12:06.875
or that we face opposition for our beliefs. 


12:06.875 --> 12:10.378
Really, it could be any number of situations. 


12:10.378 --> 12:13.781
But it is our response


12:13.782 --> 12:16.319
—the way we handle the situation—


12:16.318 --> 12:21.323
that indicates how much 
we are allowing Jehovah to help us. 


12:21.323 --> 12:26.328
Do we trust him enough 
that we can leave the matter in his hands 


12:26.328 --> 12:30.365
and see how he works 
things out in our behalf? 


12:30.365 --> 12:35.103
We have to manifest 
Christian qualities in order to do that. 


12:35.103 --> 12:40.675
Think about what qualities displayed 
by Abigail and David impress you most. 


12:40.675 --> 12:45.080
Two that come to mind 
are patience and reasonableness. 


12:45.080 --> 12:47.850
Patience is closely connected with endurance 


12:47.850 --> 12:51.453
and enables one to put up 
with difficult circumstances 


12:51.453 --> 12:54.823
while maintaining a positive attitude. 


12:54.823 --> 12:58.326
Reasonableness describes 
a person who is fair, 


12:58.327 --> 13:02.230
considerate, willing to yield to others. 


13:02.230 --> 13:05.667
How well this describes Abigail! 


13:05.667 --> 13:09.305
It must have been quite a challenge 
to live with someone like Nabal. 


13:09.305 --> 13:13.508
But nowhere do we read 
that she was ever disrespectful of him 


13:13.508 --> 13:15.510
or that she belittled him. 


13:15.510 --> 13:19.748
Even when she referred to him 
as senseless in verse 25, 


13:19.748 --> 13:23.251
from Jehovah’s standpoint, 
her comments were proper 


13:23.252 --> 13:28.257
because Nabal’s actions 
put his entire household in danger. 


13:28.257 --> 13:30.359
How about David? 


13:30.358 --> 13:32.528
He was in a position of authority, 


13:32.528 --> 13:37.198
but he showed great patience 
and reasonableness in listening to Abigail 


13:37.198 --> 13:40.668
and having the good sense 
to know that she was right. 


13:40.668 --> 13:43.638
That’s not always easy to do 
in the heat of the moment 


13:43.638 --> 13:46.108
or when we’re upset. 


13:46.108 --> 13:48.110
Perhaps you recall that at our 


13:48.110 --> 13:50.913
“Don’t Give Up!” 
Regional Convention last year, 


13:50.913 --> 13:54.983
when discussing 2 Peter 1:5-8, 


13:54.983 --> 13:57.620
we learned a nice formula 
that can help us 


13:57.620 --> 14:01.190
to cultivate and strengthen 
Christian qualities. 


14:01.190 --> 14:04.660
We were encouraged to study them, 


14:04.660 --> 14:07.062
meditate on them, 


14:07.062 --> 14:09.632
and put them into practice. 


14:09.632 --> 14:11.634
If we apply this formula 


14:11.633 --> 14:14.336
with the qualities 
of patience and reasonableness, 


14:14.337 --> 14:18.040
it can help us to endure 
our trials successfully. 


14:18.040 --> 14:20.608
And we’re confident 
that Jehovah will supply us 


14:20.608 --> 14:23.045
with whatever power we need 


14:23.045 --> 14:25.347
so that we will not tire out 


14:25.347 --> 14:29.000
as we continue to endure 
and put our trust in him. 


14:30.518 --> 14:32.655
In addition to developing these qualities, 


14:32.655 --> 14:36.425
something else that can help us 
is our spiritual routine. 


14:36.425 --> 14:40.628
Our consistent routine 
of study, meeting attendance, 


14:40.628 --> 14:44.165
and the ministry will help us remain busy, 


14:44.165 --> 14:48.170
stay active, and make good decisions. 


14:48.170 --> 14:51.673
We’ll have no time 
to become curious or occupied 


14:51.673 --> 14:55.110
with the things this world has to offer. 


14:55.110 --> 14:58.880
It’s good to remember 
the people during the days of Haggai. 


14:58.880 --> 15:03.885
When the Jews lost their focus 
and started neglecting Jehovah’s temple, 


15:03.885 --> 15:08.290
they lost his blessing 
and protection spiritually. 


15:08.290 --> 15:10.892
And what was the result? 


15:10.892 --> 15:13.662
Well, notice how Haggai draws our attention 


15:13.662 --> 15:16.199
to a different type of “bag” 


15:16.198 --> 15:20.435
at Haggai 1:6: 


15:20.435 --> 15:25.473
“You have sown much seed, 
but you harvest little. 


15:25.473 --> 15:29.411
“You eat, but it is not to satisfaction. 


15:29.412 --> 15:33.049
“You drink, but you do not drink your fill. 


15:33.048 --> 15:37.686
“You put on clothing, but no one gets warm. 


15:37.687 --> 15:41.190
“The one who hires himself out puts his wages 


15:41.190 --> 15:43.892
in a bag full of holes.”


15:43.892 --> 15:48.330
The Jews sowed seed 
but had a meager harvest. 


15:48.330 --> 15:51.533
They lacked enough food 
to satisfy their needs. 


15:51.533 --> 15:55.003
They were unable to clothe 
themselves with warm garments. 


15:55.003 --> 15:58.240
Because Jehovah withheld his blessings, 


15:58.240 --> 16:01.243
Haggai rightly compared them to a man 


16:01.243 --> 16:05.646
who “puts his wages in a bag full of holes.” 


16:05.647 --> 16:10.052
Imagine the disappointment 
of discovering that hard-earned wages 


16:10.052 --> 16:13.922
had gradually disappeared 
through a leaking bag! 


16:13.922 --> 16:17.860
Of course, 
our focus is not material prosperity, 


16:17.860 --> 16:21.463
because, whether we have 
an abundance of material things or not, 


16:21.463 --> 16:24.966
if we fail to receive Jehovah’s blessing, 


16:24.967 --> 16:28.370
our spirituality is jeopardized. 


16:28.370 --> 16:33.175
So we must be determined 
never to lose our focus 


16:33.175 --> 16:37.612
and keep Jehovah 
in the forefront of our lives.


16:37.612 --> 16:40.515
When we examine the life of David, 


16:40.515 --> 16:42.617
it’s evident that he enjoyed 


16:42.617 --> 16:46.689
a preserved and protected 
relationship with God. 


16:46.688 --> 16:49.056
When you read the book of Psalms, 


16:49.057 --> 16:53.895
take note of how David 
describes Jehovah’s protective care 


16:53.895 --> 16:55.897
in Psalm 18, 


16:55.897 --> 16:59.000
Psalm 31, and Psalm 34 


16:59.000 --> 17:01.070
as he went through distresses 


17:01.070 --> 17:03.938
—just beautiful accounts! 


17:03.938 --> 17:07.876
Now, did David always do 
everything the right way? 


17:07.877 --> 17:09.445
No. 


17:09.445 --> 17:11.780
Think of his encounter with Nabal. 


17:11.780 --> 17:15.050
While his angry reaction was understandable, 


17:15.050 --> 17:18.953
his way of expressing it was not correct. 


17:18.953 --> 17:21.923
But David learned from his mistakes, 


17:21.923 --> 17:24.960
and each new trial that he went through 


17:24.960 --> 17:28.763
strengthened his relationship 
with Jehovah even more. 


17:28.763 --> 17:32.566
For example, 
after the ordeal with Nabal, 


17:32.567 --> 17:36.037
a short time later, 
David married Abigail. 


17:36.037 --> 17:38.074
They were still fugitives, 


17:38.073 --> 17:40.641
but he found a king that befriended them, 


17:40.642 --> 17:44.580
and he gave David’s men 
and family a land to dwell in. 


17:44.580 --> 17:47.548
One day, while all the men were away, 


17:47.548 --> 17:50.718
the Amalekites raided and burned the city 


17:50.718 --> 17:53.321
and carried off all the men’s wives, 


17:53.322 --> 17:55.624
children, and flocks. 


17:55.623 --> 17:58.360
Upon returning 
and seeing what had happened, 


17:58.360 --> 18:01.330
David and his men wept. 


18:01.330 --> 18:03.998
Grief quickly turned to bitterness, 


18:03.998 --> 18:07.401
and David’s men spoke of stoning him. 


18:07.402 --> 18:10.972
This was likely quite stressful for David. 


18:10.972 --> 18:13.975
He was concerned 
for the safety of his family, 


18:13.975 --> 18:17.880
and likely he was frustrated 
that his men had turned on him. 


18:17.880 --> 18:22.818
Maybe he felt disrespected again, 
as he had with Nabal. 


18:22.818 --> 18:26.655
So how would he handle this situation? 


18:26.655 --> 18:29.023
We get a glimpse of David’s feelings 


18:29.023 --> 18:34.361
at 1 Samuel 30:6: 


18:34.362 --> 18:37.465
“David was very distressed, 


18:37.465 --> 18:40.335
“because the men were talking of stoning him, 


18:40.335 --> 18:43.005
“for all the men had become very bitter 


18:43.005 --> 18:46.208
over the loss of their sons and daughters.” 


18:46.208 --> 18:51.111
But notice, 
how did David handle the situation? 


18:51.112 --> 18:54.684
The verse continues: 


18:54.683 --> 18:59.721
“But David strengthened himself 
by Jehovah his God.” 


18:59.722 --> 19:02.224
How did he do this? 


19:02.223 --> 19:04.458
Verse 8 says: 


19:04.458 --> 19:09.665
“David inquired of Jehovah.” 


19:09.665 --> 19:14.335
This time, David has 
a different thought process and response. 


19:14.335 --> 19:19.373
Immediately he remembers 
to consult Jehovah. 


19:19.373 --> 19:21.376
Isn’t this a nice reminder 


19:21.377 --> 19:25.314
that when you and I are going 
through difficult trials and situations, 


19:25.313 --> 19:29.116
we want to immediately pray to Jehovah 


19:29.117 --> 19:32.820
and seek his direction 
through the pages of his Word, the Bible? 


19:32.820 --> 19:37.000
This is essential 
for our spiritual protection. 


19:38.760 --> 19:43.765
So in review, 
as we face difficult situations in life, 


19:43.765 --> 19:48.437
may we look for opportunities 
to show and develop our Christian qualities 


19:48.437 --> 19:51.674
—such as patience and reasonableness. 


19:51.673 --> 19:55.476
These qualities show Jehovah 
that we want to be like him, 


19:55.477 --> 19:58.080
that we have 
the mental disposition of Christ, 


19:58.080 --> 20:02.750
and that we will allow Him 
to guide us constantly. 


20:02.750 --> 20:07.555
Next, may we keep focused and busy 
“in the work of the Lord.” 


20:07.555 --> 20:10.525
By drawing close to Jehovah through prayer 


20:10.525 --> 20:13.128
and engaging in spiritual activities, 


20:13.128 --> 20:16.698
we make the best of our situation now. 


20:16.698 --> 20:18.700
But we will also find 


20:18.700 --> 20:21.970
everlasting protection in Jehovah’s hands, 


20:21.970 --> 20:23.972
safely swaddled 


20:23.972 --> 20:27.000
and securely wrapped in his “bag of life”! 


20:29.510 --> 20:34.515
We need to rely on Jehovah’s guidance 
even in the most severe trials. 


20:34.515 --> 20:37.920
It’s possible that you 
may face a life-threatening issue 


20:37.920 --> 20:40.422
where there’s no desirable option, 


20:40.422 --> 20:43.525
but a decision is necessary. 


20:43.525 --> 20:45.927
In the following dramatization, 


20:45.927 --> 20:49.397
Emma is faced with a situation like this. 


20:49.397 --> 20:51.400
What will she do? 


20:51.400 --> 20:55.000
And how will God’s Word 
help her to make a decision? 


20:58.073 --> 21:01.376
When Thomas and I first learned 
I was pregnant, 


21:01.377 --> 21:04.000
we were both really shocked. 


21:09.283 --> 21:12.000
But then we grew more and more excited. 


21:15.423 --> 21:20.000
And we were so thrilled when we saw 
our little girl for the first time. 


21:25.200 --> 21:27.802
We really didn’t care 
if it was a boy or a girl; 


21:27.802 --> 21:30.000
we just wanted the baby to be healthy. 


21:45.120 --> 21:49.390
Unfortunately, our hopes 
were completely destroyed 


21:49.390 --> 21:52.627
when the doctor told us 
that the baby would likely be born 


21:52.627 --> 21:57.000
with severe problems and could even die. 


22:04.840 --> 22:08.610
My husband and his parents 
are not Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


22:08.610 --> 22:11.000
but they do feel abortion is wrong. 


22:19.487 --> 22:23.000
Still, they thought that we should listen 
to our doctor’s advice. 


22:26.193 --> 22:28.963
I couldn’t believe this was happening. 


22:28.963 --> 22:32.300
I even questioned why Jehovah would allow it. 


22:32.300 --> 22:36.000
I really felt it was more than I could bear. 


22:38.707 --> 22:41.142
Thomas asked me what I wanted to do, 


22:41.142 --> 22:44.880
and I told him 
that I could never have an abortion. 


22:44.880 --> 22:47.948
He agreed that normally it would be wrong 


22:47.948 --> 22:51.000
but felt that in our situation 
God would understand. 


22:55.690 --> 22:57.892
I was so overwhelmed. 


22:57.892 --> 23:01.897
I was being pressured 
to make a decision I knew was wrong 


23:01.897 --> 23:05.000
but that everyone 
was telling me was best for my child. 


23:08.403 --> 23:12.000
I had never felt so alone. 


23:13.408 --> 23:16.176
I needed Jehovah more than ever, 


23:16.177 --> 23:20.000
so I poured out my heart to him in prayer. 


23:28.557 --> 23:31.000
And then I did research. 


23:49.945 --> 23:53.000
I showed Thomas the scripture I had found. 


24:08.263 --> 24:10.798
“If men should struggle with each other 


24:10.798 --> 24:13.000
“and they hurt a pregnant woman 


24:14.602 --> 24:17.572
“. . . if a fatality does occur, 


24:17.572 --> 24:21.710
then you must give life for life.”


24:21.710 --> 24:24.778
Jehovah views even the unintentional killing 


24:24.778 --> 24:27.815
of an unborn child as a serious sin. 


24:27.815 --> 24:32.000
So how could we intentionally take 
the life of our child? 


24:36.558 --> 24:41.000
I made my decision clear to our doctor 


24:45.267 --> 24:49.000
and to my in-laws. 


24:50.305 --> 24:53.975
There was a chance 
the diagnosis was incorrect, 


24:53.975 --> 24:57.078
and I’d love to say that’s what occurred; 


24:57.078 --> 24:59.246
but it did not. 


24:59.247 --> 25:03.452
My daughter Chloe only lived 
a few weeks after she was born, 


25:03.452 --> 25:07.822
and losing her was the hardest thing 
I’ve ever had to endure. 


25:07.822 --> 25:11.960
But Jehovah gave me the courage 
to explain my beliefs to my husband, 


25:11.960 --> 25:14.997
my in-laws, and the medical staff, 


25:14.997 --> 25:19.034
and they all expressed admiration 
for my strong faith. 


25:19.033 --> 25:23.771
And I’ve never regretted the decision I made. 


25:23.772 --> 25:26.942
Even though Chloe only lived those few weeks, 


25:26.942 --> 25:29.444
I’m so grateful for the time I had with her. 


25:29.443 --> 25:33.448
I know Jehovah remembers 
every detail about her, 


25:33.448 --> 25:37.951
and he’ll give her back to me 
in the resurrection in perfect health, 


25:37.952 --> 25:42.000
because all life 
is truly precious in his eyes. 


25:47.662 --> 25:49.664
Getting Jehovah’s thinking on a matter 


25:49.663 --> 25:53.535
should be the first thing 
we do when making decisions. 


25:53.535 --> 25:57.572
This is especially true 
when well-intentioned friends or family 


25:57.572 --> 26:01.309
offer advice that may conflict 
with Bible principles. 


26:01.308 --> 26:03.811
As we weigh a variety of options, 


26:03.812 --> 26:06.849
follow Emma’s good example 
of consulting God’s Word 


26:06.848 --> 26:08.950
and our Christian publications. 


26:08.950 --> 26:13.000
This will help us make decisions 
that bring honor to Jehovah. 


26:14.522 --> 26:16.692
Emma’s Christian conduct 
helped her to navigate 


26:16.692 --> 26:20.295
a potentially divisive moment 
in her marriage. 


26:20.295 --> 26:25.133
But unfortunately, 
this system of things and our imperfect flesh 


26:25.133 --> 26:28.836
can create extreme tension in a marriage. 


26:28.837 --> 26:32.574
Can the Bible save 
a marriage that’s in danger? 


26:32.573 --> 26:36.043
The following interviews, 
while very frank, 


26:36.043 --> 26:40.448
will show the exceeding value 
of God’s own Word, the Bible, 


26:40.448 --> 26:42.950
to preserve that divine union. 


26:42.950 --> 26:45.120
Almost from the start of the marriage, 


26:45.120 --> 26:50.158
it was not running smoothly, 
to say the least. 


26:50.158 --> 26:52.926
We were fighting constantly. 


26:52.927 --> 26:57.465
Even the smallest things 
we would argue over, 


26:57.465 --> 27:00.568
and it would just get blown 
out of proportion. 


27:00.568 --> 27:04.471
We couldn’t communicate 
without it being an argument. 


27:04.472 --> 27:08.009
Steadily the arguments increased 


27:08.008 --> 27:11.345
in frequency and intensity. 


27:11.345 --> 27:14.548
And you think, ‘Well, I’m not happy here,’ 


27:14.548 --> 27:17.785
and that’s when I threatened to leave. 


27:17.785 --> 27:22.457
Sometimes I felt 
like completely giving up on the marriage. 


27:22.457 --> 27:24.459
There would be arguments 
where you’d be packing the bags 


27:24.458 --> 27:26.695
and saying you’d wished you’d never done it. 


27:26.695 --> 27:29.097
And ultimately it would end in insults. 


27:29.097 --> 27:31.867
Jehovah was missing in our marriage, 


27:31.867 --> 27:36.370
and that was the essential part 
of making our marriage work. 


27:36.370 --> 27:40.375
A brother and sister 
that we’d known for a long time 


27:40.375 --> 27:42.977
initially offered us a Bible study. 


27:42.977 --> 27:45.914
They invited us 
to their Family Worship evening 


27:45.913 --> 27:48.281
to have dinner 
and to do The Watchtower with them, 


27:48.282 --> 27:50.285
which we accepted. 


27:50.285 --> 27:52.587
The Family Worship arrangement helped 


27:52.587 --> 27:55.857
because it wasn’t just Bible principles 
that you read about, 


27:55.857 --> 27:59.560
but we saw them being applied 
in this couple’s life. 


27:59.560 --> 28:01.562
And so all of a sudden, 


28:01.562 --> 28:06.034
I could see the cause and effect 
of a Bible principle. 


28:06.033 --> 28:09.870
But the impact 
that it was having was tremendous 


28:09.870 --> 28:13.875
because we could see how to apply 
a Bible principle and make it work. 


28:13.875 --> 28:18.112
I think it took a long time 
before things got better, honestly, 


28:18.112 --> 28:22.250
but the turning point 
was coming back to Jehovah. 


28:22.250 --> 28:24.252
There were many principles 
that all of a sudden 


28:24.252 --> 28:26.889
were like little light bulbs going off, 


28:26.888 --> 28:29.256
such as Jesus at John 13:34 


28:29.257 --> 28:31.894
when he recommended his example. 


28:31.893 --> 28:34.795
Ephesians 5:33 


28:34.795 --> 28:36.832
eventually had an impact on me, 


28:36.832 --> 28:39.134
because there were articles that pointed out 


28:39.133 --> 28:43.036
how important it is for a husband 
to feel respected by his wife, 


28:43.037 --> 28:45.840
and I don’t think 
I’d ever really appreciated that before. 


28:45.840 --> 28:48.008
I just viewed it as a mechanical process: 


28:48.008 --> 28:51.511
He’s the head; 
he needs to have respect from his wife. 


28:51.512 --> 28:55.884
I didn’t recognize that it’s important 
for a husband to feel respected 


28:55.883 --> 29:00.421
to be able to take on his role as head. 


29:00.422 --> 29:04.925
We’re so thankful 
to Jehovah for his patience. 


29:04.925 --> 29:07.128
The Bible principles were always there; 


29:07.128 --> 29:09.130
we just weren’t making application of them. 


29:09.130 --> 29:11.165
As soon as we started to make application, 


29:11.165 --> 29:14.535
our marriage did a complete turnaround. 


29:14.535 --> 29:17.172
Where we are now is totally different. 


29:17.172 --> 29:20.642
The relationship that we have 
is what we wanted at the start 


29:20.642 --> 29:22.644
but didn’t know how to get. 


29:22.643 --> 29:24.645
It’s just that application 
of Bible principles 


29:24.645 --> 29:28.000
that has made it possible. 


29:32.853 --> 29:36.523
We were 17, actually, when we met 
and 20 when we got married. 


29:36.523 --> 29:40.428
Life was good for Tony and me; 
we were happy. 


29:40.428 --> 29:43.765
But then I got into another business 


29:43.765 --> 29:46.802
that became the main focus in my life. 


29:46.802 --> 29:50.239
It had quite a dramatic effect 
on our spirituality. 


29:50.238 --> 29:54.241
We went through a time 
when we hardly saw each other, 


29:54.242 --> 29:57.179
so there was a great deal 
of time that we spent apart. 


29:57.178 --> 30:02.183
Bible principles were ones 
that weren’t brought into our life. 


30:02.183 --> 30:06.620
At that time, 
Bible reading was out of the picture. 


30:06.620 --> 30:09.690
I started delving into viewing things 


30:09.690 --> 30:12.860
that were really, really inappropriate. 


30:12.860 --> 30:16.463
And then it eventually happened 


30:16.463 --> 30:19.166
where I didn’t really care what I viewed, 


30:19.167 --> 30:22.837
and I didn’t think about the consequences 


30:22.837 --> 30:26.540
and of the unhappiness that it would cause. 


30:26.540 --> 30:31.478
It made me feel very, extremely, unloved. 


30:31.478 --> 30:36.116
I felt very angry about his behavior. 


30:36.117 --> 30:39.187
I felt a lot of resentment 
towards him, a lot of bitterness. 


30:39.187 --> 30:42.757
We ended up in separation, to begin with. 


30:42.757 --> 30:45.227
I left Tony; I walked away from him. 


30:45.227 --> 30:48.362
I walked away from the marriage, 
walked away from the business 


30:48.362 --> 30:52.467
and, eventually, 
ended up unscripturally divorcing Tony. 


30:52.467 --> 30:57.439
The elders who were assisting me 


30:57.438 --> 31:01.075
helped me to see exactly how Jehovah felt 


31:01.075 --> 31:03.077
about what I’d been doing 


31:03.077 --> 31:07.715
and where my relationship was with him, 
and it was quite poor. 


31:07.715 --> 31:11.185
I felt that because of the betrayal 
that I had experienced, 


31:11.185 --> 31:14.622
I did not have a problem with my conscience 
at all in going through the divorce. 


31:14.622 --> 31:17.392
It seemed the logical 
and best way for me to go. 


31:17.392 --> 31:19.760
With my Bible reading, 


31:19.760 --> 31:22.497
I got to see Amos 5:15. 


31:22.497 --> 31:24.499
It really had an effect on me 


31:24.498 --> 31:27.735
because I needed to “hate what is bad, 
and love what is good.” 


31:27.735 --> 31:29.737
One scripture that affected me 


31:29.737 --> 31:33.540
was from Malachi 
about how Jehovah felt about divorce. 


31:33.540 --> 31:37.845
Altogether, it took us 15 years 
before we got together again. 


31:37.845 --> 31:41.950
I was just enjoying 
a day out in the field midweek, 


31:41.950 --> 31:45.987
and I got home in mid-afternoon. 


31:45.987 --> 31:48.757
And all of a sudden, my mobile phone rang, 


31:48.757 --> 31:52.560
and I heard Rhonda’s voice. 


31:52.560 --> 31:55.297
What a delight it was 
that she was inviting me 


31:55.297 --> 31:59.334
to accompany her 
for a cup of coffee somewhere 


31:59.333 --> 32:02.000
to talk about things! 


32:03.638 --> 32:06.706
If I hadn’t started 
having a Scriptural intake 


32:06.707 --> 32:09.510
and learning to love God’s Word, 


32:09.510 --> 32:12.580
my life wouldn’t have changed. 


32:12.580 --> 32:15.983
Without the Bible, 
Tony and I would not be together. 


32:15.983 --> 32:18.720
The marriage 
would never ever have reconciled. 


32:18.720 --> 32:22.323
We have become best friends, 
so we really enjoy 


32:22.323 --> 32:26.160
being in each other’s company 
and serving Jehovah together. 


32:26.160 --> 32:29.063
Our married life now has certainly benefited 


32:29.063 --> 32:33.768
by both of us seeing 
how beneficial the Scriptures are. 


32:33.768 --> 32:35.936
Tony and I are now very much a couple, 


32:35.937 --> 32:39.000
and so no matter what we deal with, 
it’s us together. 


32:40.240 --> 32:42.810
When situations like these arise, 


32:42.810 --> 32:45.413
it’s not just our marriage that’s affected. 


32:45.413 --> 32:49.850
Our relationship with Jehovah is on the line! 


32:49.850 --> 32:51.885
Our dear sister, for example, 


32:51.885 --> 32:54.988
reached an emotional point 
where she felt the only solution 


32:54.988 --> 32:57.591
was an unscriptural divorce. 


32:57.592 --> 33:00.329
As we make our decisions in marriage, 


33:00.328 --> 33:04.865
Jehovah’s feelings on the subject, 
found at Malachi 2:16, 


33:04.865 --> 33:07.668
should be carefully considered: 


33:07.668 --> 33:10.805
“‘For I hate divorce,’ 


33:10.805 --> 33:14.042
says Jehovah the God of Israel.” 


33:14.042 --> 33:16.877
If you find your marital peace is threatened, 


33:16.877 --> 33:18.914
review articles like the one 


33:18.913 --> 33:23.918
in the May 15, 2012, study edition 
of The Watchtower entitled 


33:23.918 --> 33:27.655
“Take a Positive View 
of a Strained Marriage.” 


33:27.655 --> 33:30.425
It provides powerful counsel that can help 


33:30.425 --> 33:33.000
to save and strengthen your marriage bond. 


33:34.528 --> 33:36.696
In our program, we’ve seen a few ways 


33:36.697 --> 33:39.534
that Satan will exert pressure on those 


33:39.533 --> 33:42.270
‘securely wrapped in the bag of life.’ 


33:42.270 --> 33:45.338
True Christians 
courageously stand up to the Devil, 


33:45.338 --> 33:49.510
never allowing him to pry us 
away from Jehovah’s protection. 


33:49.510 --> 33:51.778
At a recent Bethel morning worship, 


33:51.778 --> 33:56.783
Brother Mark Sanderson 
of the Governing Body discussed 1 Peter 5:9 


33:56.783 --> 34:00.000
and outlined how we take 
our stand against Satan. 


34:01.288 --> 34:03.825
Is it possible to survive 


34:03.825 --> 34:07.195
the attack of a roaring lion? 


34:07.195 --> 34:08.528
Well, now, I did some 


34:08.528 --> 34:09.530
—just quick—checking 


34:09.530 --> 34:12.433
on various wildlife websites, 


34:12.433 --> 34:13.666
and here’s what they say. 


34:13.667 --> 34:14.669
Basically, 


34:14.668 --> 34:16.403
they all give the same advice 


34:16.403 --> 34:18.671
if you’re being attacked by a lion. 


34:18.672 --> 34:21.275
They say: “Hold your ground. 


34:21.275 --> 34:24.545
Never run or turn back.” 


34:24.545 --> 34:27.415
In fact, one website says: 


34:27.415 --> 34:30.785
“A lion can run 50 miles per hour (80 km/h). 


34:30.785 --> 34:32.920
“So stand still. 


34:32.920 --> 34:36.000
If you run, you will only die tired.” 


34:38.158 --> 34:40.260
Well, that’s true. 


34:40.260 --> 34:43.530
First Peter 5:9 


34:43.530 --> 34:46.933
gives us exactly the same advice. 


34:46.933 --> 34:51.205
It says: “Take your stand against him.” 


34:51.205 --> 34:54.575
Well, in this case 
not against a literal lion, 


34:54.575 --> 34:58.278
but against that “roaring lion,” 
Satan the Devil, 


34:58.278 --> 35:03.150
who is seeking to devour 
every single one of us. 


35:03.150 --> 35:07.755
Our ability to stand firm 
when facing this lion 


35:07.755 --> 35:09.890
—to be able to oppose him, 


35:09.890 --> 35:13.293
to refuse to be intimidated by him, 


35:13.293 --> 35:17.298
to refuse to run away or turn back— 


35:17.298 --> 35:21.935
requires what the apostle Peter 
next mentions there in verse 9, 


35:21.935 --> 35:24.938
and Brother Crane 
so nicely covered in his comment. 


35:24.938 --> 35:28.541
We have to: “Take [our] stand against him, 


35:28.542 --> 35:31.245
firm in the faith.” 


35:31.245 --> 35:35.517
To be successful, 
we must have complete trust 


35:35.517 --> 35:39.220
and complete confidence in Jehovah. 


35:39.220 --> 35:42.690
Well, now, in that regard, 
let’s look at an example 


35:42.690 --> 35:47.162
of someone in Bible times who had 
that kind of confidence in Jehovah. 


35:47.162 --> 35:50.699
This is in the days of King Jehoshaphat, 


35:50.698 --> 35:54.135
when Judah was threatened 
by the combined forces 


35:54.135 --> 35:56.137
of Moab, Ammon, 


35:56.137 --> 35:59.174
and the inhabitants 
of the mountainous region of Seir. 


35:59.173 --> 36:01.908
Now let’s begin by opening our Bibles 


36:01.908 --> 36:07.915
and reading 2 Chronicles 20:12. 


36:07.915 --> 36:10.718
So here Jehoshaphat is praying to Jehovah; 


36:10.718 --> 36:14.521
he’s pouring out his heart to him, 
and see what he says: 


36:14.522 --> 36:19.527
“O our God, 
will you not execute judgment on them? 


36:19.527 --> 36:23.030
“For we are powerless before this large crowd 


36:23.030 --> 36:25.032
“that is coming against us; 


36:25.032 --> 36:28.335
“and we do not know what we should do, 


36:28.335 --> 36:32.340
but our eyes are toward you.” 


36:32.340 --> 36:36.310
Well, Jehoshaphat was facing the lion. 


36:36.310 --> 36:40.347
He said to Jehovah: 
‘We don’t know what to do.’ 


36:40.347 --> 36:45.352
But Jehoshaphat had complete and total trust; 


36:45.352 --> 36:48.189
he had firm faith in Jehovah. 


36:48.188 --> 36:51.491
Well, what did Jehovah 
tell Jehoshaphat to do? 


36:51.492 --> 36:54.195
See verse 17: 


36:54.195 --> 36:57.465
“You will not need to fight this battle. 


36:57.465 --> 36:59.567
Take your position.” 


36:59.567 --> 37:01.569
Does that sound familiar? 


37:01.568 --> 37:05.371
“Take your position, stand still, 


37:05.372 --> 37:09.344
“and see the salvation of Jehovah 
in your behalf. 


37:09.343 --> 37:11.345
“O Judah and Jerusalem, 


37:11.345 --> 37:13.780
“do not be afraid or be terrified. 


37:13.780 --> 37:16.217
“Tomorrow go out against them, 


37:16.217 --> 37:19.254
and Jehovah will be with you.” 


37:19.253 --> 37:22.021
Well, what did Jehovah tell them to do? 


37:22.022 --> 37:26.894
He said: ‘Take a position 
in opposition to that military force, 


37:26.893 --> 37:30.496
‘stand firm, refuse to run away, 


37:30.497 --> 37:34.602
and see the salvation 
that will come from Jehovah.’ 


37:34.602 --> 37:36.604
Well, in order to do that, 


37:36.603 --> 37:38.905
Jehoshaphat and the people with him 


37:38.905 --> 37:43.000
would need to have strong, firm, solid faith. 


37:44.278 --> 37:46.280
Well, now, to help the people, 


37:46.280 --> 37:48.382
look at what Jehoshaphat said to them 


37:48.382 --> 37:50.484
as they were getting ready for this battle. 


37:50.483 --> 37:55.188
In verse 20, you see, 
just about the middle of the verse, 


37:55.188 --> 37:58.325
it says: 
“Jehoshaphat stood up and said: 


37:58.325 --> 38:02.797
“‘Listen to me, O Judah 
and you inhabitants of Jerusalem! 


38:02.797 --> 38:06.567
“‘Put faith in Jehovah your God 


38:06.567 --> 38:10.137
“‘so that you may be able to stand firm. 


38:10.137 --> 38:12.774
“‘Put faith in his prophets, 


38:12.773 --> 38:16.410
and you will be successful.’” 


38:16.410 --> 38:18.778
Well, that’s exactly what happened. 


38:18.778 --> 38:21.081
See, with that kind of confidence in Jehovah, 


38:21.082 --> 38:25.352
with that firm trust in him, 
with that standing firm, 


38:25.352 --> 38:27.355
what did Jehovah do? 


38:27.355 --> 38:30.123
Well, according to verses 22 and 23


38:30.123 --> 38:32.125
—you’ll remember what happened—


38:32.125 --> 38:35.362
the men of Ammon, Moab, 
and the inhabitants 


38:35.362 --> 38:37.699
of the mountainous region of Seir, 


38:37.698 --> 38:41.001
they all went to striking down one another. 


38:41.002 --> 38:43.304
And verse 23 says: 


38:43.303 --> 38:45.571
“And the Ammonites and the Moabites 


38:45.572 --> 38:49.310
“turned against the inhabitants 
of the mountainous region of Seir 


38:49.310 --> 38:51.712
“to destroy and annihilate them; 


38:51.712 --> 38:54.582
“and when they finished 
with the inhabitants of Seir, 


38:54.582 --> 38:57.952
they helped to destroy one another.” 


38:57.952 --> 39:02.957
Well, Jehovah had rewarded 
their firm faith in him. 


39:02.957 --> 39:05.225
The weapons that had been formed 


39:05.225 --> 39:09.997
against Jehoshaphat and his people 
had no success. 


39:09.997 --> 39:12.567
Well, now, 
sometimes we think, of course, 


39:12.567 --> 39:17.337
that these kinds of situations 
only happened in Bible times. 


39:17.337 --> 39:21.675
But it’s amazing to see 
how our brothers in our modern day 


39:21.675 --> 39:23.743
have had that same kind of faith 


39:23.743 --> 39:27.080
and have stood firm against the lion. 


39:27.080 --> 39:29.083
Here are just a couple of experiences 


39:29.083 --> 39:31.518
that really touched my heart. 


39:31.518 --> 39:35.555
Here’s one about a brother 
named Pavel from Russia. 


39:35.555 --> 39:37.558
In 1958, 


39:37.558 --> 39:40.828
Pavel was arrested for religious activities. 


39:40.828 --> 39:43.296
“Accompanying me to the train,” he says, 


39:43.297 --> 39:45.532
“the officer [with me] said, 


39:45.532 --> 39:48.335
“‘Look at your wife for the last time 


39:48.335 --> 39:51.205
because you will never see her again.’” 


39:51.205 --> 39:53.340
Well, there’s the lion. 


39:53.340 --> 39:58.012
“I spent six months 
in solitary confinement before my trial. 


39:58.012 --> 40:01.715
“During interrogations, . . . 
the investigators did everything 


40:01.715 --> 40:03.817
“to undermine my faith. 


40:03.817 --> 40:06.387
“Sometimes violence was used. 


40:06.387 --> 40:11.392
I begged Jehovah 
to give me the strength to stay firm.” 


40:11.392 --> 40:13.994
But now look what happened. 


40:13.993 --> 40:16.696
“During a routine interrogation, 


40:16.697 --> 40:20.769
“the investigator called me 
into his study and [he] said: 


40:20.768 --> 40:24.271
“‘Now we will show you 
what your organization is doing. 


40:24.272 --> 40:27.609
“Then you can see 
if it is God’s work or not!’ 


40:27.608 --> 40:30.911
“Looking at me intently, he continued: 


40:30.912 --> 40:34.315
“‘This year your convention in New York 


40:34.315 --> 40:37.585
“‘was attended by 253,000 people 


40:37.585 --> 40:39.587
“‘in two stadiums. 


40:39.587 --> 40:42.690
“The convention lasted eight days.’ 


40:42.690 --> 40:46.027
“The investigator strewed 
the table with photographs. 


40:46.027 --> 40:48.829
“In one of them, 
I saw happy delegates 


40:48.828 --> 40:52.065
“in colorful native dress 
embracing one another. 


40:52.065 --> 40:55.302
“Another photo showed 
Brother Knorr giving a talk, 


40:55.302 --> 40:58.339
“and yet others showed the baptism. 


40:58.338 --> 41:02.543
“The investigator could not even imagine 


41:02.543 --> 41:04.745
“what I was feeling at that moment. 


41:04.745 --> 41:07.413
“I felt that I was attending the convention 


41:07.413 --> 41:10.250
“without ever having left the prison. 


41:10.250 --> 41:13.987
“I felt new strength flooding into me. 


41:13.987 --> 41:17.057
“[It was just what] I had needed. 


41:17.057 --> 41:21.262
“. . . And Jehovah generously 
blessed me in a special way. 


41:21.262 --> 41:23.997
I was ready to endure further.” 


41:23.997 --> 41:26.000
Isn’t that amazing?


41:26.000 --> 41:28.235
Here’s another similar experience, 


41:28.235 --> 41:30.972
1960, also in Russia, 


41:30.972 --> 41:34.475
a large publicized trial 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


41:34.475 --> 41:37.645
About 300 persons 
were present in the courtroom, 


41:37.645 --> 41:40.813
including many of our brothers and sisters. 


41:40.813 --> 41:42.816
Well, as the evidence—


41:42.817 --> 41:44.952
As evidence against the brothers, 


41:44.952 --> 41:49.957
the prosecutor decided to present 
a letter from Nathan H. Knorr. 


41:49.957 --> 41:53.494
One of the brothers 
who attended the trial said this: 


41:53.493 --> 41:56.863
“The prosecutor loudly began to read a letter 


41:56.863 --> 41:59.466
“that had been intercepted by the KGB 


41:59.467 --> 42:02.870
“from Brother Knorr 
to the brothers in the Soviet Union. 


42:02.870 --> 42:06.073
“For all of us Witnesses present in the hall, 


42:06.073 --> 42:08.775
“it was a wonderful gift from Jehovah. 


42:08.775 --> 42:11.145
“This letter warmed our hearts! 


42:11.145 --> 42:13.880
“We heard wise counsel from the Bible 


42:13.880 --> 42:17.350
“and encouragement to serve 
our fellow believers lovingly 


42:17.350 --> 42:20.487
“and to stay faithful [even] under trials. 


42:20.487 --> 42:22.957
“The prosecutor read the letter 


42:22.957 --> 42:25.859
“from the beginning to the very end. 


42:25.858 --> 42:28.528
“We listened with rapt attention. 


42:28.528 --> 42:32.000
It seemed to us that we were 
attending a convention!”


42:33.800 --> 42:36.970
Well, now, brothers, what additional lessons 


42:36.970 --> 42:40.573
do we learn from these two experiences? 


42:40.573 --> 42:44.378
When we stand our ground against Satan, 


42:44.378 --> 42:46.380
firm in the faith, 


42:46.380 --> 42:49.283
then Jehovah will do just what he promised 


42:49.283 --> 42:52.185
at 1 Peter 5:10. 


42:52.185 --> 42:54.322
Do you see what it says there? 


42:54.322 --> 42:57.659
“But after you have suffered a little while, 


42:57.658 --> 43:00.526
“the God of all undeserved kindness, 


43:00.527 --> 43:04.299
“who called you to his everlasting glory 
in union with Christ, 


43:04.298 --> 43:07.601
“will himself finish your training. 


43:07.602 --> 43:09.604
“He will make you firm, 


43:09.603 --> 43:11.705
“he will make you strong, 


43:11.705 --> 43:14.642
he will firmly ground you.” 


43:14.642 --> 43:16.644
So, brothers, 


43:16.643 --> 43:20.913
can we survive the attack of a roaring lion? 


43:20.913 --> 43:22.916
Absolutely! 


43:22.917 --> 43:26.987
With firm faith, let’s stand fast 


43:26.987 --> 43:30.000
and see the salvation from Jehovah. 


43:31.458 --> 43:36.430
Firm faith is needed to resist 
the relentless attacks of Satan the Devil. 


43:36.430 --> 43:41.000
The modern-day examples brought out 
in the presentation are truly inspiring. 


43:42.102 --> 43:45.205
However, 
did you notice that Brother Sanderson 


43:45.205 --> 43:49.543
also applied 
the Biblical example of Jehoshaphat? 


43:49.543 --> 43:52.813
The Bible is full of accounts that can revive 


43:52.813 --> 43:56.000
and renew our courage 
every time we read them. 


43:57.117 --> 43:59.285
But here’s a question: 


43:59.285 --> 44:02.288
When should we develop the type of faith 


44:02.288 --> 44:05.158
that can resist the attack 
of “a roaring lion”? 


44:05.158 --> 44:09.730
Is it something 
only longtime servants of Jehovah can do? 


44:09.730 --> 44:11.998
Ecclesiastes 12:1 says 


44:11.998 --> 44:15.001
to “remember, then, your Grand Creator 


44:15.002 --> 44:18.472
in the days of your youth.” 


44:18.472 --> 44:20.474
Young ones, 


44:20.473 --> 44:24.210
do you find it a challenge 
to read the Bible every day? 


44:24.210 --> 44:27.013
A few of your peers 
have excellent suggestions 


44:27.013 --> 44:29.315
based on how they do their Bible reading 


44:29.315 --> 44:32.000
and how they get the most benefit from it. 


44:34.588 --> 44:36.823
I often put it off until later. 


44:36.823 --> 44:38.991
So I come home in the evening tired, 


44:38.992 --> 44:40.094
and I like to relax. 


44:40.093 --> 44:41.328
Well, very often, 


44:41.328 --> 44:42.996
I was tired for many different reasons, 


44:42.997 --> 44:45.099
and that is why I didn’t have the motivation 


44:45.098 --> 44:47.100
even to start Bible reading 
in the first place. 


44:47.100 --> 44:49.537
I also had many phases 


44:49.537 --> 44:51.072
where it was really tough 


44:51.072 --> 44:53.340
to stick it out with Bible reading. 


44:53.340 --> 44:55.608
Especially in the age of social media, 


44:55.608 --> 44:58.678
there are many other things 
you can fill your day with. 


44:58.678 --> 45:01.981
One hobby that mainly got in the way 


45:01.982 --> 45:03.984
was watching movies. 


45:03.983 --> 45:06.453
I really spent a lot of time on that. 


45:06.453 --> 45:10.456
This often steals precious time 
you could have made better use of. 


45:10.457 --> 45:12.692
So something that moved me 


45:12.692 --> 45:14.795
was the thought that through Bible reading, 


45:14.795 --> 45:16.797
you’re actually talking with Jehovah. 


45:16.797 --> 45:21.169
You pray to him, and he 
is then answering you through the Bible. 


45:21.168 --> 45:25.505
As Jehovah promised, he can give us 
both the power and the desire to act. 


45:25.505 --> 45:28.708
I just pray to Jehovah, please, 
to first give me the power to read 


45:28.708 --> 45:32.078
and then the desire follows. 


45:32.078 --> 45:35.581
Then I decided 
to simply start and stick with it. 


45:35.582 --> 45:37.717
I started with reading my favorite book, 


45:37.717 --> 45:40.920
and that way it was easier for me. 


45:40.920 --> 45:46.025
Well, I started with Genesis 
just to get through the whole Bible. 


45:46.025 --> 45:49.028
My favorite Bible book is Esther. 


45:49.028 --> 45:52.198
And because I think 
she was a very special person, 


45:52.198 --> 45:54.568
it was especially then that I could imagine 


45:54.568 --> 45:58.271
what her situation was like 
and what kind of a person she was 


45:58.272 --> 46:02.542
and I could see myself in the account. 


46:02.542 --> 46:05.612
The weekly Bible reading program 
has been such a guideline. 


46:05.612 --> 46:08.949
It’s motivating since we discuss 
this content at the meetings, 


46:08.948 --> 46:11.885
and I could use the study aids 
in our workbook too. 


46:11.885 --> 46:14.555
You can better relate 
to the brothers’ and sisters’ comments 


46:14.555 --> 46:18.000
because you’ve read the material yourself, 
and I can comment too. 


46:19.058 --> 46:22.863
When I’m reading the Bible 
in the JW Library app on my phone, 


46:22.863 --> 46:25.131
there is, of course, 
the risk that it vibrates, 


46:25.132 --> 46:27.134
and I get a message. 


46:27.133 --> 46:30.536
And then, of course, you have the urge 
to check to see who just wrote me. 


46:30.537 --> 46:33.407
For me personally, then, it’s really helpful 


46:33.407 --> 46:35.442
when I put my phone in airplane mode 


46:35.442 --> 46:37.710
so that I can really focus 
on what I’m reading 


46:37.710 --> 46:41.748
and nothing can distract me. 


46:41.748 --> 46:45.651
I like reading at home, 
but I also like to do it outdoors 


46:45.652 --> 46:49.122
because I think that’s 
where you’re closest to Jehovah. 


46:49.122 --> 46:52.894
I never just read about the events 
that are described in the Bible, 


46:52.893 --> 46:54.895
but I ask myself questions like: 


46:54.895 --> 46:56.997
‘Why did Jehovah have this written down? 


46:56.997 --> 46:59.132
What is in there for me personally?’ 


46:59.132 --> 47:02.837
This helps me to stay focused 
and not just scratch the surface; 


47:02.837 --> 47:05.000
otherwise, my mind 
would immediately start wandering. 


47:06.640 --> 47:09.175
At a convention, 
I learned something that helps me 


47:09.175 --> 47:11.412
to really take in the things I read. 


47:11.412 --> 47:13.447
The point discussed 
was to remember to look 


47:13.447 --> 47:17.450
in four different directions 
when meditating, so to speak. 


47:17.450 --> 47:21.855
First, look upwards 
to find out exactly what I am learning 


47:21.855 --> 47:24.023
from the text about Jehovah; 


47:24.023 --> 47:28.995
then downwards to find out 
what it teaches me about his purpose, 


47:28.995 --> 47:31.498
about what he wants for the earth; 


47:31.498 --> 47:36.101
then look at myself, 
how I can personally benefit now; 


47:36.102 --> 47:38.372
and eventually towards others, 


47:38.372 --> 47:40.540
thinking about how I can help other people 


47:40.540 --> 47:43.977
with this particular Bible text. 


47:43.977 --> 47:48.982
In the JW Library app, there are 
four different colors for highlighting text, 


47:48.982 --> 47:53.154
so I simply use a different color 
for each of the four directions 


47:53.153 --> 47:57.690
and highlight them 
on my tablet or smartphone. 


47:57.690 --> 48:01.160
For example, one of my hobbies is drawing. 


48:01.160 --> 48:03.897
I decided, one time, 
that I was going to draw 


48:03.897 --> 48:06.500
the spiritual suit of armor, 
all of its different parts 


48:06.500 --> 48:08.502
and their symbolic meanings. 


48:08.502 --> 48:11.705
And this especially helped me 
to actually see the benefit of it, 


48:11.705 --> 48:15.408
to see how many wonderful resources 
Jehovah provides us with 


48:15.408 --> 48:18.078
and that he never leaves us alone. 


48:18.078 --> 48:20.980
Another thing 
I like very much is the category 


48:20.980 --> 48:23.650
“Bible Study Activities” 
where you can directly pick a topic 


48:23.650 --> 48:25.652
that you personally find interesting 


48:25.652 --> 48:27.487
and then read that. 


48:27.487 --> 48:28.922
It’s Jehovah’s Word. 


48:28.922 --> 48:31.190
I love him and also want 
to please him, of course. 


48:31.190 --> 48:34.928
That’s why it’s very important 
to understand his Word. 


48:34.928 --> 48:37.163
It feels really good when you’ve understood 


48:37.163 --> 48:39.498
a difficult phrase by doing it this way. 


48:39.498 --> 48:42.368
It actually makes you feel 
like you’ve achieved something, 


48:42.368 --> 48:44.871
and this brings you a lot closer to Jehovah. 


48:44.872 --> 48:49.844
It happens often that you don’t even know 
what you should pray about 


48:49.843 --> 48:53.280
or what you could thank Jehovah for. 


48:53.280 --> 48:55.682
My personal Bible reading 
has helped me with this a lot 


48:55.682 --> 48:58.552
because now I know exactly 
what I want to tell Jehovah. 


48:58.552 --> 49:02.289
Daily Bible reading is very important to me 


49:02.288 --> 49:05.258
as it gives me some sort 
of inner balance when I face situations 


49:05.258 --> 49:08.761
that may be unfamiliar or shake me up. 


49:08.762 --> 49:11.030
I know that no matter what the problem is,


49:11.030 --> 49:14.935
Jehovah always has the right answer prepared.


49:14.935 --> 49:17.370
At the beginning, it is really hard. 


49:17.370 --> 49:20.973
You have to fight to keep it up, 
and you definitely need discipline. 


49:20.973 --> 49:24.076
But after a while, 
you truly start to enjoy it 


49:24.077 --> 49:26.079
and it gets easier and easier 


49:26.078 --> 49:28.415
and you’re happy 
that you started in the first place. 


49:28.415 --> 49:33.087
I really think that when Jehovah sees 
how much effort you put into it, 


49:33.087 --> 49:35.422
he is genuinely proud of you, 


49:35.422 --> 49:39.000
and that’s the best thing 
that can happen to you. 


49:47.167 --> 49:50.970
These young brothers and sisters 
didn’t just acquire knowledge; 


49:50.970 --> 49:53.473
they drew closer to Jehovah. 


49:53.473 --> 49:57.276
This will help them build 
a fine foundation for their future, 


49:57.277 --> 49:59.412
and you can too. 


49:59.412 --> 50:01.649
It may not be easy at first, 


50:01.648 --> 50:03.983
but as one young brother suggested, 


50:03.983 --> 50:06.686
start with something 
that captures your interest. 


50:06.687 --> 50:10.557
Try using the JW Library app 
or a handy notebook 


50:10.557 --> 50:15.095
to keep track of points you hope 
to apply or discuss at family worship. 


50:15.095 --> 50:17.697
This will make it 
a part of your daily routine 


50:17.697 --> 50:20.667
that you look forward to. 


50:20.667 --> 50:23.104
Each segment 
in the program has highlighted 


50:23.103 --> 50:26.740
some way we can build 
a strong relationship with God. 


50:26.740 --> 50:29.508
Our music video depicts the joy of marriage, 


50:29.508 --> 50:32.878
where Jehovah is part of a threefold cord 


50:32.878 --> 50:36.048
—one that cannot quickly be torn apart. 


50:36.048 --> 50:41.000
The song is called “Truly in Love.” 


50:50.697 --> 51:03.077
There is a gift that comes from above,
A lovely gift called being in love.


51:03.077 --> 51:16.000
When two hearts begin to beat as one,
Then a wonderful time has begun.


51:18.925 --> 51:24.330
It’s simple, so easy.
And it’s something we know.


51:24.330 --> 51:30.837
With a threefold cord,
Love will grow.


51:30.837 --> 51:41.815
With Jehovah to guide us in all that we do,
How I love to be truly in love


51:41.815 --> 51:54.000
With someone like you,
Someone like you.


51:55.995 --> 52:07.207
Trials will come our way,
But our love will grow stronger each day.


52:07.207 --> 52:18.852
We will build a bond that no one can break.
We will build a love that no one will take.


52:18.852 --> 52:23.157
No, no, no one, no.


52:23.157 --> 52:28.662
It’s simple, so easy.
And it’s something we know.


52:28.662 --> 52:34.600
With a threefold cord,
Love will grow.


52:34.600 --> 52:45.812
With Jehovah to guide us in all that we do,
How I love to be truly in love


52:45.812 --> 52:58.000
With someone like you,
Someone like you.


52:59.558 --> 53:11.538
Nothing can destroy our love.
This precious gift is from our God up above.


53:11.538 --> 53:17.176
Exclusive devotion​
—‘love’s as strong as death.’


53:17.177 --> 53:23.182
You are “bone of my bones”; 
you are “flesh of my flesh,”


53:23.182 --> 53:38.899
Such an excellent woman in all that you do.
I will spend all my life loving you.


53:38.898 --> 53:49.910
I want you to know how I feel
’Cause my love for you is so very real.


53:49.910 --> 54:02.000
I bless the day you came into my life.
I bless the day I made you my wife.


54:03.823 --> 54:05.958
Yes, I do.


54:05.958 --> 54:11.998
It’s simple, so easy.
And it’s something we know.


54:11.998 --> 54:17.670
With a threefold cord,
Love will grow.


54:17.670 --> 54:28.782
With Jehovah to guide us in all that we do,
How I love to be truly in love


54:28.782 --> 54:42.429
With someone like you,
Someone like you.


54:42.428 --> 54:54.000
How I love to be truly in love
With someone like you.


54:57.443 --> 55:02.448
So many of our brothers and sisters 
can agree with the words of that song: 


55:02.448 --> 55:07.820
“With a threefold cord, love will grow.” 


55:07.820 --> 55:10.990
In marriage, in youth, 


55:10.990 --> 55:13.393
really, in all things we’ve considered, 


55:13.393 --> 55:16.295
Jehovah will be there to guide us. 


55:16.295 --> 55:18.365
What will be the result? 


55:18.365 --> 55:21.067
We’ll find the warmth and security 


55:21.067 --> 55:23.370
of being securely wrapped 


55:23.370 --> 55:26.907
in Jehovah’s “bag of life.” 


55:26.907 --> 55:29.242
We hope you enjoyed our program. 


55:29.242 --> 55:30.744
We conclude by heading 


55:30.743 --> 55:33.613
to the beautiful tropical island 
of Sri Lanka, 


55:33.613 --> 55:37.000
off the southeast coast 
of India in the Indian Ocean. 


55:38.217 --> 55:42.822
Over 6,000 publishers 
make up the 112 congregations on the island, 


55:42.822 --> 55:45.859
including 13 isolated groups. 


55:45.858 --> 55:48.160
As you travel throughout the country, 


55:48.160 --> 55:51.998
the scars of the decades-long civil war 
are still evident. 


55:51.998 --> 55:55.135
However, our brothers and sisters display 


55:55.135 --> 55:58.137
the beautiful spirit of Christian unity. 


55:58.137 --> 56:01.174
Publishers preach the good news 
to those on the coast, 


56:01.173 --> 56:03.175
high in the mountains, 


56:03.175 --> 56:06.212
and in the bustling cities. 


56:06.212 --> 56:09.049
More than 8,000 Bible studies 
are being conducted, 


56:09.048 --> 56:13.051
and over 650 brothers and sisters 
are in the pioneer work. 


56:13.052 --> 56:16.924
Because of the dense population 
in the city of Colombo, 


56:16.923 --> 56:21.928
those in metropolitan witnessing 
see an average of almost 17,000 people 


56:21.928 --> 56:24.000
in just one 8-hour period. 


56:25.465 --> 56:27.800
High in Sri Lanka’s tea mountains 


56:27.800 --> 56:32.138
is a small congregation 
in the town of Badulla. 


56:32.138 --> 56:35.375
Their productive ministry takes them 
into banana plantations, 


56:35.375 --> 56:38.812
jungles, and mountain tea estates 
as they search 


56:38.812 --> 56:41.647
for those receptive to the good news. 


56:41.647 --> 56:44.484
Despite differing ethnic backgrounds, 


56:44.483 --> 56:48.286
they’re completely united 
in worship and brotherly affection. 


56:48.287 --> 56:50.757
Our brothers and sisters 
who are wrapped up 


56:50.757 --> 56:52.759
in Jehovah’s “bag of life” 


56:52.758 --> 56:54.760
send you their warm love and greetings 


56:54.760 --> 56:56.930
from the mountaintops of Sri Lanka! 


56:56.930 --> 56:59.032
Thank you for watching. 


56:59.032 --> 57:01.700
From the world headquarters 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


57:01.700 --> 57:11.128
this is JW Broadcasting.

00:00:01 We extend a warm welcome to all and are happy that you have joined us
00:00:06 for the December 2018 program of JW Broadcasting.
00:00:29 During this program, you’ll enjoy
00:00:31 exciting and upbuilding Scriptural talks
00:00:33 delivered to the students and other attendees
00:00:36 during the Gilead graduation
00:00:38 held on September 8, 2018.
00:00:41 And this is just the opener!
00:00:43 Parts 2 and 3 of the Gilead graduation program
00:00:46 will be released in the upcoming weeks.
00:00:48 In addition to motivating Bible talks,
00:00:51 you’ll get to know some of the students later this month
00:00:54 when you watch another edition of The Inside Story.
00:00:58 But now, please enjoy Part 1 of the graduation
00:01:02 of the 145th class of Gilead.
00:01:06 Well, what an exciting time this is
00:01:08 to be here for the graduation
00:01:10 of the 145th class of Gilead!
00:01:14 But let’s start by asking a question:
00:01:18 What makes a graduation program of Gilead
00:01:23 different from the various graduation programs
00:01:27 that people engage in right throughout the earth?
00:01:31 Well, I’m sure all of us would agree,
00:01:34 usually with regard to worldly institutions,
00:01:37 graduation programs are all about the accomplishments
00:01:41 and praise of individuals.
00:01:44 But as you dear students realize,
00:01:47 the Gilead program and the training that you’ve received
00:01:50 is all about glorifying Jehovah,
00:01:53 and that’s why the theme of our introductory comments are
00:01:57 “Always Seek Jehovah’s Glory and Not Your Own Glory.”
00:02:02 And that’s in harmony with what the Scriptures tell us.
00:02:05 If you’d like to turn with me, please, to the book of Romans
00:02:09 —Romans chapter 12
00:02:11 and notice what verses 3 and 16 remind us.
00:02:16 Romans 12:3:
00:02:19 “For through the undeserved kindness given to me,
00:02:22 “I tell everyone there among you
00:02:25 “not to think more of himself than it is necessary to think,
00:02:28 “but to think so as to have a sound mind,
00:02:31 each one as God has given to him a measure of faith.”
00:02:35 Notice the point there:
00:02:37 Whatever we have has been given to us by Jehovah.
00:02:41 So we shouldn’t think more of ourselves than is necessary.
00:02:44 And then verse 16 reminds us:
00:02:47 “Have the same attitude toward others as toward yourselves;
00:02:51 “do not set your mind on lofty things,
00:02:54 “but be led along with the lowly things.
00:02:57 Do not become wise in your own eyes.”
00:03:01 Now, we trust that you  fully understand that admonition
00:03:05 because your Gilead training has been helping you
00:03:08 to strengthen your relationship with Jehovah,
00:03:11 and when we know Jehovah, we can’t help but glorify him
00:03:14 because we know that any good things we have come from him.
00:03:18 But now, as you graduate
00:03:21 and you go either back to your former assignments
00:03:25 or to new assignments,
00:03:27 you may find various tests to this resolve
00:03:30 —that you have to always glorify Jehovah and not yourself.
00:03:35 Now, what might be some of those tests?
00:03:37 Well, one is perhaps an obvious test.
00:03:40 You go back maybe to your former assignment,
00:03:43 and the brothers say, “Oh, you’ve changed;
00:03:46 you’re so much better.”
00:03:49 Well, that’s humbling in itself, isn’t it?
00:03:52 You didn’t realize how bad you were before you left.
00:03:56 “And your knowledge, the illustrations,
00:04:00 the way you’re teaching seems so much better”
00:04:02 —so now what’s your reaction?
00:04:04 Well, I’m sure you’re not going to say: “You’re welcome.
00:04:07 I noticed that too.”
00:04:11 I know (and I’m sure all of us know)
00:04:13 that you’ll be determined in a situation like that
00:04:17 to bring glory to Jehovah and not to yourselves.
00:04:20 So perhaps that’s the easy time
00:04:23 because that’s obvious we have to be careful.
00:04:27 But when is the other occasion, or situation,
00:04:30 where we may be tempted
00:04:32 to show a measure of pride and glorify ourselves?
00:04:36 Well, it could be if people criticize us
00:04:40 or perhaps don’t show us the respect that we feel that we deserve.
00:04:45 Or maybe we don’t get the privileges that we hope to receive.
00:04:49 Now, that could be a temptation for us
00:04:52 —to remind everyone of the special training
00:04:57 and the fact that we graduated from that training.
00:05:01 You see, this is similar
00:05:04 to the trap that Job fell into.
00:05:07 Now, when we think of Job,
00:05:10 we think of a very faithful man —a man of integrity.
00:05:14 The two words go together: Job and integrity.
00:05:17 But we also realize that Job needed to have very strong counsel.
00:05:22 Now, at what point in his life
00:05:26 did he do something that warranted him getting counsel?
00:05:30 Well, let’s think about it.
00:05:32 We won’t read the verses because you know them well,
00:05:34 but in chapter 1, remember that Job lost everything
00:05:39 —his children and his possessions one after the other.
00:05:43 But when we look at Job 1:22,
00:05:47 it tells us there that “Job did not sin.”
00:05:51 He didn’t “accuse God of doing anything wrong.”
00:05:54 So all these horrific things happened to him.
00:05:57 He had these huge tests, and he came out looking pretty good.
00:06:01 He hadn’t sinned at that point.
00:06:04 So then what happened in the second round?
00:06:06 Well, you remember that he had this loathsome disease,
00:06:10 and then his wife said to him, “Curse God and die!”
00:06:14 So now, is that when he deserved some counsel?
00:06:17 No.
00:06:18 In chapter 2 of Job and verse 10,
00:06:20 it tells us that he “did not sin with his lips.”
00:06:24 So at that point, he was winning we might say.
00:06:28 He proved himself an integrity keeper.
00:06:31 So when was it that he started to make a few mistakes
00:06:36 that resulted in getting that strong counsel?
00:06:39 Well, The Watchtower, back in 1980, tells us.
00:06:43 It said that it was when these three so-called friends
00:06:46 started to criticize him and said:
00:06:48 ‘Maybe you did this. Maybe you did that.
00:06:50 That’s the— There’s a reason.’
00:06:53 Then The Watchtower said
00:06:55 that because of these false accusations,
00:06:58 it’s as if it pushed Job over the edge
00:07:01 and he vigorously determined to justify himself
00:07:06 even though that inferred  that maybe Jehovah
00:07:09 wasn’t treating him correctly.
00:07:11 So do we see that this is a situation
00:07:13 where if we are criticized or some false accusations are made about us,
00:07:18 then all of a sudden, the self-justification can come in?
00:07:22 And what is self-justification?
00:07:25 Glorifying ourselves rather than glorifying Jehovah.
00:07:30 Of course, our Lord Jesus Christ is an excellent example in that regard.
00:07:34 Let’s have a look at the record
00:07:37 recorded in John chapter 8
00:07:40 —John 8:48-50.
00:07:45 Now here, we have a group of Jewish persons
00:07:48 criticizing Jesus, falsely accusing him of something.
00:07:52 Notice there in verse 48:
00:07:54 “In answer the Jews said to him [that is, to Jesus]:
00:07:57 “‘Are we not right in saying, “You are a Samaritan
00:08:02 “‘“[now, you remember that’s not a compliment]
00:08:04 and have a demon”?’”
00:08:05 On another occasion, they said, ‘You’re out of your mind.’
00:08:08 But now, what did Jesus do?
00:08:11 Did he fall into the trap that Job fell into and try to justify himself?
00:08:16 No. He just made a simple comment in verse 49:
00:08:20 “I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.”
00:08:25 Then he says: “But I am not seeking glory for myself;
00:08:30 there is One who is seeking and judging.”
00:08:33 We see the excellent example of our Lord Jesus
00:08:37 in that difficult situation, where he was falsely accused
00:08:40 yet still focused on glorifying Jehovah.
00:08:44 So, what’s the lesson there for each one of us
00:08:48 —not only yourselves but all of us?
00:08:50 Well, you don’t need to remind other people
00:08:54 that you graduated from Gilead,
00:08:58 you don’t need to try to impress others
00:09:01 to get their respect,
00:09:03 and you don’t need to praise yourself.
00:09:07 What should be the goal of all of us?
00:09:10 Well, our final scripture that we want to share with you
00:09:13 are the words of Jesus as recorded in Matthew
00:09:16 —Matthew 5:16:
00:09:21 “Likewise, let your light shine before men,
00:09:25 “so that they may see your fine works
00:09:29 and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens.”
00:09:33 What a beautiful goal!
00:09:35 Yes, the goal is that we don’t glorify ourselves,
00:09:39 but we give all the glory to Jehovah God.
00:09:43 So with that in mind,
00:09:44 we’re going to look forward to our wonderful program.
00:09:47 We’ve got a number of brothers who put a lot of effort
00:09:49 in thinking about what they would like to convey to you
00:09:53 before you go to your assignments.
00:09:55 And the first of these brothers is Brother John Ekrann.
00:09:58 The theme that he selected is
00:10:01 “What Will You Do in the Year of the Drought?”
00:10:15 You students  are really like beautiful trees
00:10:19 planted along the river Gilead.
00:10:23 Jeremiah 17:8
00:10:25 describes such beautiful trees.
00:10:28 Let’s read that together, Jeremiah 17:8.
00:10:32 It says: “He will become like a tree planted by the waters,
00:10:36 “that sends out its roots to the stream.
00:10:39 “He will not notice when heat comes,
00:10:42 “but his leaves will always flourish.
00:10:45 “And in the year of drought he will not be anxious,
00:10:49 nor will he quit producing fruit.”
00:10:53 Well, you’ve enjoyed the spiritual waters
00:10:55 taught here at Gilead.
00:10:58 And as you graduate today and you go off to your assignments,
00:11:02 your leaves are flourishing
00:11:05 and you’re producing fruit, figuratively speaking.
00:11:09 Now, did you notice, though, in verse 8
00:11:12 what the righteous trees had to deal with?
00:11:15 It says “when [the] heat comes”
00:11:19 and “in the year of drought.”
00:11:22 Now, it doesn’t say if the heat comes but when the heat comes.
00:11:27 So, what is that heat and year of drought?
00:11:31 While there are many forms of heat we deal with
00:11:34 (and in addition to what you  considered about this verse in class),
00:11:38 I’d like to focus  on one particular form of heat,
00:11:42 and that is persecution.
00:11:45 Restrictions on our work and bans
00:11:49 are designed to create fear.
00:11:52 Negative articles in the media about Jehovah’s Witnesses
00:11:56 are designed to create doubt.
00:12:00 Religious leaders and opposers
00:12:02 —they attack our neutrality,
00:12:05 our clear support for the Bible’s view of sex and marriage,
00:12:09 or discipline by disfellowshipping, and other matters.
00:12:14 And add to that, some of our brothers
00:12:16 are being rounded up and thrown into prison.
00:12:18 We can say that Satan has truly “turned up the heat.”
00:12:24 What will happen to the trees?
00:12:26 Will fear and doubt cause them
00:12:28 to shrivel up and die during the drought?
00:12:31 No. If you notice there in verse 8,
00:12:34 Jehovah says that the righteous ‘will not notice the heat’
00:12:38 and ‘not be anxious in the drought.’
00:12:42 Well, why is Jehovah confident
00:12:44 that the righteous trees won’t notice the heat
00:12:47 and won’t wither up in the drought?
00:12:50 Look at verse 7 of Jeremiah 17.
00:12:53 It says: “Blessed is the man who puts his trust in Jehovah,
00:12:58 whose confidence is in Jehovah.”
00:13:03 So, what will you do in the year of drought?
00:13:07 Trust in Jehovah.
00:13:11 Satan wants to destroy  our trust in Jehovah.
00:13:15 Right from the very first with Eve:
00:13:17 “Is it really so?”
00:13:20 His whole system is built on fear,
00:13:24 uncertainty, and doubt.
00:13:28 Persecution—we could liken it to when you’re in an airplane;
00:13:32 and it has some turbulence; and it begins to shake.
00:13:34 One flight I was on,
00:13:36 there was one woman that cried in terror.
00:13:40 She screamed out loud every time the plane shook even just a little.
00:13:45 She was genuinely terrified.
00:13:49 I felt sorry for her.
00:13:51 But the experienced flyers
00:13:53 —they were eating, reading, watching movies;
00:13:56 they didn’t even notice the turbulence.
00:13:59 Why? Well, from experience,
00:14:01 they knew that the plane could easily handle
00:14:04 such a small amount of turbulence, and they were not worried.
00:14:08 It was designed for that.
00:14:11 Well, we are like experienced flyers.
00:14:14 We don’t let the turbulence,
00:14:16 or persecution, of this system
00:14:19 cause us fear or doubt.
00:14:23 With Jehovah and Jesus as our pilots,
00:14:25 we don’t need to be anxious, do we?
00:14:27 Let’s consider two ways  that we can show trust in Jehovah
00:14:31 as Jeremiah 17:7 says.
00:14:33 First, we’re going to talk about trusting “the faithful and discreet slave”
00:14:37 and trusting Bible principles.
00:14:40 Let’s talk first about trusting the faithful and discreet slave.
00:14:43 The faithful and discreet slave
00:14:45 has been selected and appointed by Jehovah,
00:14:49 and experience has shown that we can trust them.
00:14:52 Trust is built by repeated good experiences.
00:14:57 Think of all the good experiences we’ve had
00:15:01 with the faithful and discreet slave and following their direction.
00:15:05 Now, some might reason:
00:15:07 ‘Well, you know, the direction from the faithful and discreet slave
00:15:10 ‘is good for the United States, but they don’t understand here.
00:15:14 ‘They don’t understand my assignment where I’ve been assigned.
00:15:18 We need to do things differently.’
00:15:22 Trust in the faithful and discreet slave is not geographical.
00:15:26 Jehovah’s direction  through the faithful and discreet slave
00:15:30 applies to all of God’s people all over the earth.
00:15:36 Fear is really a loss of memory
00:15:39 of what Jehovah has done for us.
00:15:43 Satan wants us to forget
00:15:45 all the good experiences we’ve had with the faithful and discreet slave
00:15:49 and let one moment of fear get to us
00:15:52 and cause us to wither in the heat.
00:15:55 Second Thessalonians 2:2 says
00:15:58 “not to be quickly shaken  from your reason nor to be alarmed,”
00:16:02 especially at rumors.
00:16:05 Now, your trust  in the faithful and discreet slave
00:16:08 is going to be put to the test.
00:16:10 Satan will make sure of that.
00:16:13 It could be your own thoughts  of ‘I know better,’
00:16:17 or maybe some twisted lies you read or hear.
00:16:21 Either way, it’s a trap.
00:16:24 Stay away from such ideas.
00:16:27 Trust what you know about the faithful and discreet slave.
00:16:32 As Isaiah 30:15 says:
00:16:35 “Your strength will be
00:16:37 in keeping calm and showing trust.”
00:16:41 Remember,  the faithful and discreet slave
00:16:43 has been selected  and appointed by Jehovah,
00:16:46 and our experience  has shown that we can trust them.
00:16:52 Now let’s consider trusting Bible principles, our second point.
00:16:57 Bible principles
00:16:59 are timeless pearls of wisdom from Jehovah.
00:17:03 But many people today attack our decision
00:17:06 to live by Bible principles in this modern world.
00:17:09 They say, “That’s outdated.”
00:17:11 However, we trust Bible principles
00:17:14 because experience tells us they always work.
00:17:19 I asked one sister what helps her to be calm
00:17:22 in very difficult, or trying, situations.
00:17:24 And she said, “Give me a scripture.”
00:17:28 Jesus’ mother, Mary,
00:17:30 had that same “give-me-a-scripture” attitude.
00:17:33 Luke 2:51 says  that Mary made it her habit
00:17:37 to keep “these sayings in her heart.”
00:17:40 Mary was really like a tree, soaking in all of these waters
00:17:44 of Jesus’ teachings  and his amazing miracles.
00:17:47 Well, the heat for Mary came  when the Pharisees and Sadducees,
00:17:52 maybe even her own family,
00:17:54 and her neighbors began to attack Jesus,
00:17:56 call him names, slander his reputation,
00:18:00 and attack his motives.
00:18:02 What helped Mary to deal with the heat?
00:18:07 Those waters that she had treasured up in her heart.
00:18:13 What Bible principles and experiences
00:18:16 are you keeping in your heart
00:18:19 to help you  when you come under attack?
00:18:23 Be like Mary and keep in your heart
00:18:26 your good experiences in applying Bible principles.
00:18:31 Stick to what you know works —Bible principles.
00:18:35 They always work, and they never get out of date.
00:18:39 Not you or anyone else
00:18:41 can come up with better principles to live by.
00:18:44 Remember, we trust Bible principles
00:18:48 because they come from Jehovah
00:18:50 and our own experience tells us  they always work.
00:18:55 Now, trusting  the faithful and discreet slave
00:18:58 and trusting the Bible
00:19:00 are just two of many ways
00:19:03 that we can show that we trust Jehovah.
00:19:07 So, what will you do in the year of drought?
00:19:10 Trust in Jehovah.
00:19:13 Think of the birds.
00:19:15 When they’re flying high up there, are they worried?
00:19:17 ‘Oh, I think I’m going to fall. I’m really worried.’
00:19:20 Well, no. Birds don’t worry about that, do they?
00:19:23 Why? Well, they rely on the wings and instincts Jehovah gave them.
00:19:27 They can fly.
00:19:29 Likewise, we don’t need to be anxious when faced with lies,
00:19:34 bans, or attacks on our Bible principles.
00:19:38 Jehovah has given us  what we need to fly, so to speak
00:19:42 —the faithful and discreet slave, Bible principles,
00:19:45 prayer, holy spirit, and more.
00:19:49 As we head further into this system
00:19:51 and as the heat from this system intensifies, remember,
00:19:56 fear and doubt are reactions,
00:19:59 but our decision is trust and courage.
00:20:14 Well, thank you very much, Brother Ekrann.
00:20:16 We really appreciated that.
00:20:18 I neglected to mention that Brother Ekrann
00:20:21 is a helper to the Coordinators’ Committee.
00:20:23 As chairman, you’d probably appreciate that it’s hard for me to take notes.
00:20:28 There are a few other things that I’m worried about.
00:20:30 But I did jot down a few things here:
00:20:33 “Drought won’t make us doubt.
00:20:35 Trust is a must.”
00:20:37 So hopefully, I’ve got something I’ll remember from Brother Ekrann’s talk.
00:20:42 Well, now Brother William Turner, who is a helper to the Service Committee,
00:20:46 is giving us a challenging question.
00:20:48 The theme is “Have You Become a Different Person?”
00:20:56 Well, I think it’s safe to say
00:20:58 that with all of the training and instruction you’ve received,
00:21:02 you definitely are not the same individuals you were
00:21:05 when you first arrived at Patterson.
00:21:08 But how exactly have you changed,
00:21:12 and why is it important that you continue to do so?
00:21:17 Well, let’s consider this by looking at someone who,
00:21:20 just like you, received a special privilege.
00:21:25 His privilege was being the first divinely selected king of Israel.
00:21:31 So the man was Saul.
00:21:33 When Saul was anointed,
00:21:35 the prophet Samuel gave him three prophetic signs
00:21:39 in order to confirm that Jehovah was with him.
00:21:42 I invite you to turn with me in your Bibles,
00:21:44 please, to 1 Samuel chapter 10.
00:21:47 And as we read verse 6, note what was to happen after the last sign.
00:21:56 Chapter 10, verse 6, says:
00:21:58 “The spirit of Jehovah will empower you,
00:22:02 “and you will prophesy along with them
00:22:05 and be changed into a different person.”
00:22:11 Now, what did this change mean?
00:22:13 Would Saul all of a sudden become unrecognizable?
00:22:17 Or would there be a drastic change in his personality?
00:22:21 Well, let’s go back one chapter to chapter 9.
00:22:24 In verse 21, here we get a glimpse of Saul’s personality
00:22:28 before he was appointed as king.
00:22:31 Verse 21 says: “At this Saul answered:
00:22:35 “‘Am I not a Benjaminite of the smallest of the tribes of Israel,
00:22:40 “‘and my family the most insignificant
00:22:42 “‘of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin?
00:22:45 So why have you spoken to me in this way?’”
00:22:48 So Saul shows himself to be a very humble,
00:22:52 modest individual.
00:22:55 Well, how about  after his appointment as king?
00:22:59 Let’s go back to chapter 10.
00:23:01 If you look in verse 22,
00:23:03 here we see Saul’s introduction  as king to the people.
00:23:08 Verse 22 says:  “So they inquired of Jehovah:
00:23:11 “‘Has the man come here yet?’
00:23:13 “Jehovah answered: ‘There he is
00:23:16 hiding himself among the luggage.’”
00:23:20 —so evidently still modest,  still humble.
00:23:25 Interestingly,  the Insight book mentions
00:23:28 that about a month after his appointment as king,
00:23:30 Saul gained a couple of great military victorie
00:23:34 against the Ammonites and later against the Philistines.
00:23:37 So now, you think about that.
00:23:40 How did Saul change, and rather quickly,
00:23:44 from bashfully hiding among luggage
00:23:48 to leading a nation to victory?
00:23:51 That is evidence
00:23:54 of the power of God’s spirit
00:23:57 and the impact that it can have
00:24:01 when one allows it  to be operative in their lives.
00:24:05 So, what’s the lesson?
00:24:07 All of you  have manifested qualities
00:24:10 that are very pleasing  and useful to Jehovah.
00:24:13 It has allowed you  to be productive in your assignment.
00:24:15 It’s allowed you to now have  this privilege of Gilead training.
00:24:19 But as you now go to your assignments,
00:24:22 you’re going to continue to need
00:24:25 to have that spirit  operative in your life.
00:24:29 And just as we’ve seen  in the case of Saul,
00:24:31 that will not always mean  a drastic change in your personality.
00:24:35 Perhaps when we think  of that expression
00:24:38 of someone  becoming a different person,
00:24:39 maybe that’s where our mind goes
00:24:41 —to someone  who has come out of Satan’s world,
00:24:44 now into Jehovah’s organization, and they put on the new personality.
00:24:47 And that’s correct.
00:24:49 But the reality is that all Christians,
00:24:54 even those spiritually mature,
00:24:57 need to be adjusted from time to time,
00:25:01 and those adjustments  can have a tremendous impact.
00:25:05 Perhaps your personality is such
00:25:08 that you are naturally shy and reserved.
00:25:11 Maybe you would be quite comfortable, no problem, staying with the luggage.
00:25:15 But now having God’s spirit
00:25:19 coupled with appreciation for what you’ve learned
00:25:22 will now perhaps move you to come out of your comfort zone
00:25:27 —to initiate ways to share things that you’ve learned with others.
00:25:31 Or maybe before you came to Gilead,  you had very good leadership skills.
00:25:36 You had a take-charge personality —one who got things done.
00:25:41 But now you may see  the need to adjust.
00:25:44 You recognize there is wisdom
00:25:47 in perhaps slowing down,  or even waiting,
00:25:51 perhaps even seeking input  from others.
00:25:54 With the help of God’s spirit,
00:25:57 it can help you  to become a kinder overseer,
00:25:59 a better shepherd,  one who is more tolerant,
00:26:02 empathetic of others.
00:26:03 It’s just tremendous benefits  all the way around.
00:26:06 But the extent  that you become different
00:26:11 depends upon you and your response to God’s spirit.
00:26:17 Now, obviously, we know Saul’s story; it does not end well.
00:26:21 Instead of maintaining  his reliance on Jehovah,
00:26:24 he begins  to trust his own judgment.
00:26:27 He focuses more  on his position as king
00:26:30 than he does  on his relationship with God.
00:26:33 And it’s quite interesting,  if you are still in chapter 10,
00:26:37 if you look in verse 27, where Saul had God’s spirit
00:26:41 even when he encountered challenges
00:26:43 —in this particular case,  some questioning his appointment—
00:26:46 you’ll notice  that Saul didn’t feel the need
00:26:49 to prove himself  or challenge the men.
00:26:52 He just stayed silent  and focused on his assignment.
00:26:57 But you read a little later that when he lost God’s spirit
00:27:01 and when that bad spirit  began to take over him,
00:27:03 well, now the negative comments —the comments of others:
00:27:07 “Saul has struck down his thousands  and David his tens of thousands”
00:27:10 —oh, well, now it’s an issue.
00:27:14 It’s a problem.
00:27:16 It affected his judgment;
00:27:18 it affected his emotions
00:27:21 and caused him to make bad decisions.
00:27:24 So, what can help you  to avoid that
00:27:27 and to keep your focus?
00:27:29 Well, let’s look at the example
00:27:32 of the other Saul  that’s mentioned in the Bible
00:27:35 —the man who later  became the apostle Paul.
00:27:37 Now, we know, obviously, Paul’s personality needed more than a refinement.
00:27:41 Paul needed a complete overhaul.
00:27:44 But he truly became a different person  by way of God’s spirit.
00:27:49 And he was given a privilege to serve as “an apostle to the nations.”
00:27:52 But if you turn  to 1 Corinthians chapter 15,
00:27:56 let’s just note  the attitude that Paul showed.
00:28:00 At 1 Corinthians 15:9,
00:28:04 he says: “For I am the least of the apostles,
00:28:08 “and I’m not worthy  of being called an apostle,
00:28:11 “because I persecuted  the congregation of God.
00:28:13 “But by God’s undeserved kindness
00:28:16 I am what I am.”
00:28:20 Beautiful perspective, isn’t it?
00:28:22 Now, why do you think Paul was able
00:28:25 to maintain this humble attitude  for the rest of his life,
00:28:29 whereas King Saul could not?
00:28:32 Well, both men knew
00:28:35 that it was only by means  of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness
00:28:38 that they could enjoy  their privilege of service.
00:28:41 But Paul never viewed  his privilege of service
00:28:46 greater than  his relationship with God.
00:28:50 That’s why he studied, he meditated,
00:28:54 he discerned God’s will for him,
00:28:57 and then he was alert  to follow the leadings of God’s spirit.
00:29:01 And in his assignment, Paul had challenges.
00:29:04 You remember,  early on for parts of three years,
00:29:06 some of the brothers didn’t even believe he was an apostle.
00:29:09 But yet he never asserted his authority.
00:29:12 He never distanced himself from his brothers;
00:29:17 he just loved them.
00:29:20 He let his example speak for him, and you can do the same.
00:29:25 See, let the brothers feel.
00:29:28 Let them see the love that you have for Jehovah
00:29:32 and the love that you have for them.
00:29:35 So in review, maintain those wonderful traits
00:29:39 that qualified you for Gilead, like your modesty and humility.
00:29:43 And then study, meditate,
00:29:46 continue to follow the leadings of God’s spirit.
00:29:48 And when it becomes apparent that changes need to be made
00:29:52 either for the sake of the work or peace with your brother,
00:29:56 well, please be willing to make them.
00:29:59 And if you do, you will show
00:30:01 that you have become a different person
00:30:04 —one who is refined, one who is useful,
00:30:07 one who is dearly loved by Jehovah.
00:30:10 And may Jehovah continue to bless you
00:30:13 and all of the hard work  that you do
00:30:15 in behalf of his name.
00:30:27 Thank you very much, Brother Turner.
00:30:29 We really appreciated that.
00:30:30 So my quick notes:
00:30:32 “Don’t change the change.
00:30:35 Continue to make the right change.”
00:30:38 Good. Well, now we have the privilege of listening
00:30:41 to a member of the Governing Body, Brother Kenneth Cook.
00:30:44 And Brother Cook is going to talk to us on the theme
00:30:47 “Find Joy in Jehovah’s Gradual Blessing!”
00:30:53 As you know from your own life experience
00:30:56 and from your Gilead instruction,
00:30:59 Jehovah is a God of action.
00:31:02 And as such, he does some things quickly, doesn’t he?
00:31:06 And that’s true when it’s needed, or it’s warranted.
00:31:10 He makes sure it happens just at the right time.
00:31:14 For example,
00:31:16 when a sudden stiff breeze
00:31:18 rushed into the upper room at Pentecost,
00:31:20 those present were filled with holy spirit.
00:31:24 In another example,
00:31:26 the Bible tells us that when this world in some way says
00:31:30 that it has achieved “peace and security,”
00:31:33 what happens next?
00:31:35 First Thessalonians 5:3 says
00:31:38 that ‘sudden destruction will come instantly on them.’
00:31:44 But not all things that Jehovah
00:31:47 causes to happen occur so quickly.
00:31:50 In fact, he often does things gradually.
00:31:54 Let’s look at two examples
00:31:57 and see what we can learn from them.
00:31:59 First, we will look at the angels and creation,
00:32:03 and then resurrected ones and perfection.
00:32:08 Finally, we will look at how this applies to you
00:32:13 and how you can find great joy
00:32:15 in a gradual blessing.
00:32:18 We begin with the angels who were on hand
00:32:21 when Jehovah made the earth and all the things in it.
00:32:24 What did the angels see?
00:32:27 Did they see an instant burst
00:32:30 of unimaginable power
00:32:32 that suddenly formed  the earth and all life on it?
00:32:35 Not at all.
00:32:37 Jehovah could have done that,
00:32:40 but instead he created things gradually.
00:32:44 Job 38:5, 6
00:32:48 speak of him as setting the earth’s “measurements,”
00:32:51 sinking “its pedestals,”
00:32:53 and laying “its cornerstone.”
00:32:57 And in Genesis chapters 1 and 2,
00:33:00 we also read about how he gradually brought forth
00:33:03 life on earth and ultimately humans.
00:33:08 Imagine the joy that his angelic sons experienced
00:33:12 as they watched what Jehovah was gradually doing.
00:33:16 For example, undoubtedly, the angels could see
00:33:20 that their heavenly Father received great satisfaction
00:33:23 from a job well done.
00:33:26 They would also learn about facets
00:33:28 of Jehovah’s marvelous personality
00:33:32 as they observed everything from the first whale
00:33:35 breaching the surface of an ocean
00:33:37 to a hummingbird hovering over a beautiful flower
00:33:41 or seeing lion cubs playing together.
00:33:46 So stupendous was Jehovah’s work
00:33:49 and so enriching this experience for his angelic sons,
00:33:53 that Job 38:7 tells us
00:33:57 that at some point,
00:33:59 on seeing all of this  and seeing the earth formed,
00:34:02 they “began shouting in applause.”
00:34:06 That gradual blessing
00:34:09 is something that the faithful angels
00:34:12 will never forget.
00:34:14 In fact, God’s Word tells us that the angels
00:34:17 are still focused on what Jehovah is doing on the earth,
00:34:21 especially with regard to his people.
00:34:24 First Peter 1:12 says
00:34:28 that “into these very things,
00:34:30 angels are desiring to peer.”
00:34:33 So then, do the angels find pleasure
00:34:37 in Jehovah’s gradual work and blessing?
00:34:40 Yes, they do.
00:34:41 And aren’t we grateful
00:34:43 that they love Jehovah so much
00:34:46 as well as each one of us?
00:34:50 What do we learn from their response to Jehovah’s gradual work?
00:34:55 We learn to treasure every moment
00:34:58 in Jehovah’s service and to be grateful
00:35:01 for every opportunity we have
00:35:03 to learn more about him.
00:35:06 So be like the angels and, in effect,
00:35:09 shout in applause
00:35:11 at each new thing you learn about our heavenly Father.
00:35:15 Take time to meditate on his works,
00:35:18 on his Word of truth,
00:35:20 and on his indescribable mercy
00:35:22 toward us through his Son.
00:35:26 In our next example,
00:35:28 we look to the future but not too far into the future.
00:35:32 We’re talking about the resurrection
00:35:35 —specifically the resurrection
00:35:38 and perfection.
00:35:40 When Jehovah through his Son resurrects countless millions
00:35:44 to life again in the new world,
00:35:47 they will not all come back at the same time,
00:35:50 nor will they come back in perfection.
00:35:53 But Jehovah will bring them back in such a way
00:35:57 that they will know themselves;
00:35:59 they will recognize themselves.
00:36:01 Although their serious infirmities will be gone,
00:36:05 they will instantly know
00:36:07 their own familiar thoughts and feelings.
00:36:10 They will know who they are as a person.
00:36:14 Imagine the joy that such ones will have
00:36:18 as they apply what they learn
00:36:21 and then see the progress
00:36:23 that they are making day after day in serving Jehovah.
00:36:27 They will experience the words of Proverbs 10:22 coming true for them.
00:36:33 Please follow along, where it says in verse 22:
00:36:37 “It is the blessing of Jehovah that makes one rich,
00:36:41 and he adds no pain with it.”
00:36:46 So, what will God’s gradual blessing do
00:36:50 for such ones at that time?
00:36:53 His blessing will make them rich
00:36:55 in the most important way of all —and that is spiritually.
00:37:00 Things that they struggle to be able to overcome
00:37:05 in this old world under man’s control
00:37:07 and Satan’s influence,
00:37:09 they will be able to overcome
00:37:12 because they love Jehovah
00:37:14 and he will help them to do so.
00:37:17 But even more than this, in the new world,
00:37:21 millions and millions of people
00:37:23 will come to experience physical vitality
00:37:27 and strength that exceeds
00:37:29 anything imaginable today.
00:37:32 Jehovah’s gradual blessing will take hold,
00:37:36 and grateful ones will rejoice day after day.
00:37:40 Also important is the fact
00:37:42 that as each person grows
00:37:45 toward perfection,
00:37:48 they will keep hold of the empathy needed
00:37:51 to teach and help still others
00:37:55 who will come back in a gradual resurrection.
00:37:59 How can contemplating such future blessings benefit us?
00:38:03 benefit you right now?
00:38:07 We benefit when we patiently focus on Jehovah
00:38:12 and how he often fulfills his promises
00:38:15 in a gradual way.
00:38:17 Having this in mind keeps us grounded, you could say.
00:38:21 We do our best, but we do not expect
00:38:24 everything right now, do we,
00:38:28 especially perfection?
00:38:30 That is yet in the future.
00:38:32 However, when we develop strong faith,
00:38:35 we will find joy no matter what we will yet face.
00:38:39 Why?
00:38:41 Because we are absolutely certain
00:38:43 that Jehovah’s promises will come true, right on time.
00:38:48 Now we get to the part that especially involves you.
00:38:54 As one graduating from Gilead School,
00:38:57 you may look back on the past five months
00:39:01 and worry that you did not do everything perfectly.
00:39:04 I know that’s how I would feel,
00:39:06 but please don’t focus on that.
00:39:09 Instead, imagine the joy that you will find
00:39:13 as you patiently apply the things that you have learned
00:39:17 and then you see Jehovah’s gradual blessing on your efforts.
00:39:22 Remember, a head full of knowledge
00:39:25 is not what brings Jehovah’s blessing.
00:39:29 What matters is what we do with what we know.
00:39:34 Consider the example of King Solomon.
00:39:36 First Kings 4:32 says
00:39:41 that ‘he composed 3,000 proverbs
00:39:43 and 1,005 songs.’
00:39:47 But there was a disconnect
00:39:49 between what was in his mind
00:39:51 and what was really driving him from the heart.
00:39:55 And as a result,
00:39:57 Solomon drifted away from Jehovah, didn’t he?
00:40:00 The Bible tells us that his foreign wives
00:40:03 gradually inclined his heart
00:40:06 away from Jehovah.
00:40:08 So you could say that he, in effect, substituted one gradual thing
00:40:12 for another gradual thing.
00:40:15 In turn, he lost the opportunity
00:40:17 to find joy in Jehovah’s gradual blessing.
00:40:22 Now, in contrast to that example,
00:40:25 make it your heart’s desire to be like the faithful angels.
00:40:29 Although they undoubtedly know
00:40:32 far more than 3,000 proverbs and songs,
00:40:36 they savor every morsel that they learn
00:40:40 about our magnificent heavenly Father.
00:40:44 And again, as you look to the future
00:40:46 —to the real life—
00:40:48 take what you have learned in this beautiful schooling
00:40:52 and humbly work for the interests of others.
00:40:56 Jehovah will bless that effort, and the gradual blessing
00:40:59 that you will enjoy will serve as a taste
00:41:03 of what is yet ahead in God’s new world.
00:41:06 Keep in mind that those who find joy now
00:41:11 in a gradual blessing
00:41:14 will have no problem in patiently waiting for
00:41:18 and then enjoying the gradual blessings that are still to come.
00:41:33 Thank you very much, Brother Cook.
00:41:35 We truly appreciated those fine comments.
00:41:39 I just had a brief note here:
00:41:42 “Expect the unexpected gradually.”
00:41:47 Well, I’m sure we all got that point,
00:41:49 and we’ll enjoy looking forward to seeing that program, or that talk,
00:41:53 again and going through the main points.
00:41:56 Now, for you students,
00:41:58 you’re about to be addressed by one of your instructors from Gilead.
00:42:02 You’ve heard from Brother Cauthon a number of times,
00:42:04 and now he’s going to address you this final time
00:42:07 on this intriguing theme
00:42:10 “Shoulder to Shoulder.”
00:42:16 By the spring of 1945,
00:42:19 Allied and Russian armies were converging upon Germany.
00:42:23 The Nazis were losing the war.
00:42:26 The Germans gave the ominous order:
00:42:28 March all the concentration camp prisoners west,
00:42:31 and destroy all the evidence of the horrors
00:42:33 that had taken place in those camps.
00:42:37 On the 20th of April, the evacuation of Sachsenhausen began.
00:42:42 The plan was to march the prisoners to the Baltic Coast,
00:42:46 ship them out to sea, and drown them.
00:42:51 And if that wasn’t horrific enough,
00:42:53 the SS guards had explicit orders
00:42:57 to shoot any of the prisoners who couldn’t keep up.
00:43:01 Already in a weakened state,
00:43:03 hundreds were shot along the way,
00:43:07 while many thousands more died of exposure, starvation, and exhaustion.
00:43:12 Thus began what came to be known as a death march.
00:43:19 Interestingly, the Sachsenhausen evacuation
00:43:23 included 230 of our brothers.
00:43:26 And just like the other prisoners,
00:43:28 they were in no shape
00:43:30 to make this journey physically,
00:43:34 but they were  more than up to the journey spiritually.
00:43:39 How so?
00:43:40 Well, open your Bibles, if you would, to a promise Jehovah made.
00:43:44 It’s found at Zephaniah 3:9.
00:43:48 And here, he promised to give to his people
00:43:51 a pure language.
00:43:53 And the point being so that they could do what?
00:43:57 The latter part of that verse says
00:43:59 “to serve him shoulder to shoulder”
00:44:02 or, as the footnote says, “in unity.”
00:44:06 And that was the key.
00:44:09 The secret weapon
00:44:11 was their shoulder-to-shoulder unity.
00:44:16 Even the weak become strong when they are united.
00:44:20 Now, today, you and I are on a march for life.
00:44:25 And never forget that we’re not marching alone.
00:44:28 We have our brothers and sisters from all backgrounds and all ages
00:44:32 along with us for the journey.
00:44:34 But the question is,
00:44:36 Are we marching shoulder to shoulder?
00:44:40 What can we learn from our brothers who went through this death march?
00:44:45 Well, first of all,
00:44:48 to reach the coast, the Sachsenhausen prisoners
00:44:51 were to march 155 miles
00:44:54 —that’s 250 kilometers.
00:44:57 And throughout that journey, the Witnesses pooled all their food supplies
00:45:00 into one small bundle that was used for the benefit of all.
00:45:05 Now, you can imagine that sharing food is not an easy thing to do
00:45:09 when you’ve already been starved and you’re very weak.
00:45:13 But our brothers knew Bible principles,
00:45:17 such as the one at Proverbs 11:25 that says:
00:45:20 “The generous person will prosper,
00:45:22 and whoever refreshes others will himself be refreshed.”
00:45:27 So, what’s the lesson for us today?
00:45:30 The lesson is this:
00:45:32 Unity to be real must withstand the severest test.
00:45:38 Being a true Christian is more than a commitment to God;
00:45:42 it is a commitment to other Christians as well.
00:45:45 So don’t hold back.
00:45:48 Show a generous disposition in your assignment.
00:45:51 And remember, one of the most important resources
00:45:55 that you can share with others is your time.
00:45:58 So learn the balance.
00:46:00 Take time with others who may need it,
00:46:04 and don’t be ruled by time.
00:46:06 Rather than rush, refresh.
00:46:11 Second point:
00:46:13 When the SS guards gave the Witnesses a cart to haul,
00:46:17 that easily could have seemed like just another burden to bear,
00:46:21 but instead our brothers were thrilled.
00:46:23 Why?
00:46:25 Because they saw it as an opportunity.
00:46:28 How so?
00:46:30 Well, during the journey, the sick and elderly ones
00:46:32 were able to sit  on top of the cart and rest for a while,
00:46:35 and then when one  would get his strength back,
00:46:38 another one would replace him.
00:46:40 And so in a very real way, they carried one another.
00:46:46 The lesson for us?
00:46:49 Where there is unity, there is victory.
00:46:53 And in the middle of difficulty, lies opportunity.
00:46:57 So look for opportunities to encourage one another.
00:47:02 The word “encourage” literally means “to make strong or to hearten.”
00:47:07 Being spiritual people, we may not lose our hope
00:47:11 but we could lose heart,
00:47:13 especially during times of extreme crisis or grief.
00:47:16 But something as simple as a reassuring word
00:47:19 or even a kind deed can work like a miracle.
00:47:23 It can restore the weary soul.
00:47:26 It can carry others through a hard time.
00:47:29 So the point is this:
00:47:31 You’re not responsible for everyone in the Christian congregation,
00:47:36 but you are responsible to them.
00:47:39 Jehovah expects us to do whatever we can to help our brothers.
00:47:43 We simply cannot allow ourselves
00:47:45 to be separated in interest
00:47:48 or divided in purpose.
00:47:51 And then one more point:
00:47:53 On their last night, the prisoners were stopped near a forest.
00:47:58 The SS guards encouraged everyone to walk across to freedom.
00:48:02 Imagine you were there.
00:48:04 It must have seemed very tempting.
00:48:08 But naturally, they were unsure of what to do,
00:48:10 so they prayed for guidance
00:48:13 and unitedly they decided to stay put
00:48:17 —not one of them left the group.
00:48:20 Later, it was learned that those who had accepted the offer
00:48:23 were shot down.
00:48:25 The lesson for us?
00:48:27 Don’t allow anything or anyone to cause division.
00:48:32 Satan is the master of divide and conquer.
00:48:36 We must stand together until forever.
00:48:42 When problems arise,
00:48:44 you can use your energy
00:48:47 for retaliation or resolution, but not both.
00:48:51 The Bible says: “Have intense love for one another.”
00:48:54 So don’t allow differences to develop into distance,
00:48:57 and don’t nurture past offenses.
00:49:01 The brotherhood is a place where mistakes are not rubbed in
00:49:06 but rubbed out.
00:49:11 To recap:
00:49:13 We serve God in part, brothers,
00:49:16 by serving others.
00:49:18 Willingly share your resources with one another,
00:49:21 especially your time.
00:49:23 It’s in times of deep crisis and grief and doubt
00:49:26 that we need each other the most.
00:49:29 When you see a brother’s or a sister’s shoulders
00:49:31 beginning to droop,
00:49:34 pull out your “cart” for them.
00:49:36 Do what is needed even if it’s difficult or inconvenient.
00:49:40 Remember, our actions reveal what’s in our heart,
00:49:44 whether we like it or not.
00:49:46 Have intense love for one another;
00:49:51 remain united in heart and mind;
00:49:54 continue committed to one another
00:49:57 as you are to Jehovah God and Jesus Christ.
00:50:00 And finally,
00:50:02 there is beauty and power in unity.
00:50:06 Jehovah is creating a new world, brothers and sisters, a new world.
00:50:10 One world, one people
00:50:13 —a new world society of unified worshippers.
00:50:17 Stay focused on that fact.
00:50:22 In conclusion,
00:50:24 over 10,700 lost their lives
00:50:27 on that infamous death march from Sachsenhausen,
00:50:30 but not one,
00:50:32 not one of our 230 brothers lost their life.
00:50:36 Why?
00:50:38 Well, let’s let them tell us in their own words.
00:50:41 Here’s a quotation from a resolution
00:50:43 made by our brothers in that forest
00:50:46 just before their freedom.
00:50:48 I quote:
00:50:50 ‘A long, hard time of trial is behind us
00:50:54 ‘and we have been brought forth from the fiery furnace
00:50:57 ‘without a scent of the fire upon us.
00:51:00 ‘On the contrary,
00:51:02 ‘we are full of power and strength in Jehovah.
00:51:05 ‘We have only one desire
00:51:08 ‘after our stay in the “lions’ den.”
00:51:11 ‘We will serve Jehovah throughout eternity.
00:51:14 This would be our most precious reward.’
00:51:19 It’s signed:
00:51:21 “YOUR CO-FIGHTERS  FOR JEHOVAH’S HOLY NAME.”
00:51:24 You see, they didn’t pretend to be brothers;
00:51:26 they were brothers.
00:51:28 They functioned as one united family throughout the whole ordeal,
00:51:32 and they were victorious.
00:51:34 And so, as this world grows colder and colder, brothers,
00:51:39 let us be more determined than ever
00:51:42 to serve our God shoulder to shoulder.
00:52:06 Well, thank you so much, Brother Cauthon.
00:52:09 There were so many excellent points in that talk.
00:52:12 What did I write down to remind me?
00:52:15 “Shoulder to shoulder.”
00:52:18 I did also write down, though:
00:52:20 “Imperfections—don’t rub in, rub out.”
00:52:23 Well, there are a lot of good points
00:52:26 that you dear students, soon-to-be graduates,
00:52:28 are taking down, I’m sure.
00:52:31 Now you’re going to listen
00:52:33 to another brother who’s very familiar to you
00:52:36 —one of your instructors.
00:52:38 But the difference is that this time
00:52:40 you’re not going to be looking at him and thinking of written exercises.
00:52:46 But you’re going to be thinking,
00:52:48 ‘Well, I can sit back and enjoy these comments.’
00:52:51 Brother Mark Noumair, a helper to the Teaching Committee
00:52:56 as well as an instructor of Gilead,
00:52:58 will now talk to you on the theme
00:53:00 “Four Words to Live By.”
00:53:05 Can there really be four words that you can base your life on?
00:53:09 And if so, what would they be?
00:53:13 Well, we look to our Exemplar, Christ Jesus, for the answer.
00:53:16 We focus on the night before his death.
00:53:19 The future of every human being rested upon his shoulders.
00:53:24 His words, his actions, his very thoughts in these critical moments
00:53:29 would be remembered for thousands of years.
00:53:32 What would he give the world to remember?
00:53:36 He left no room for guesswork.
00:53:40 In one verse, one verse,
00:53:42 Jesus reveals what governed his every action and his decision
00:53:47 —in one verse.
00:53:49 Four words —four words that he lived by—
00:53:54 and we encourage you to live by these four words.
00:53:58 We encourage you to take these four words to heart.
00:54:02 Take them seriously.
00:54:04 They’re found at John 14:31,
00:54:11 John 14:31,
00:54:13 the last night of Jesus life:
00:54:17 “But for the world to know that I love the Father.”
00:54:22 “I love the Father.”
00:54:24 In these four words,
00:54:26 we find the most powerful bond in the universe
00:54:31 —an unbreakable bond of love between Jesus and his Father.
00:54:36 And it is this unbreakable attachment
00:54:40 that enabled Jesus to unselfishly defend
00:54:43 his Father’s reputation to his dying breath,
00:54:47 trusting that Jehovah would protect and resurrect him.
00:54:52 “I love the Father.”
00:54:55 But how did this love develop?
00:54:58 How did this unbreakable bond, this attachment of love, develop?
00:55:03 Well, the only-begotten Son was created perfect.
00:55:05 True.
00:55:06 However, was he created with love already fully developed?
00:55:11 No.
00:55:13 He was created with free will;
00:55:15 Satan was created with free will
00:55:18 and with the capacity to extend, enlarge, and enrich this love.
00:55:23 The Son of God
00:55:25 was not created with an unselfish, self-sacrificing love
00:55:29 already fully in place.
00:55:32 What did he have to do?
00:55:34 He had to cultivate this deep attachment for his Father,
00:55:37 cultivate this deep love.
00:55:39 How did he do that?
00:55:42 By observing his Father’s personality.
00:55:46 In his prehuman existence, imagine how the Son would do this.
00:55:51 He would observe closely how his Father used his power,
00:55:55 how he used his authority, how he used his strength
00:55:58 in behalf of people
00:56:00 —‘those crushed, those lowly in spirit.’
00:56:04 He would observe how his Father used his power
00:56:08 to help those “crushed in spirit.”
00:56:11 He watched his Father  deal with Ruth the Moabite girl
00:56:14 —a Moabite girl from a pagan nation.
00:56:18 Might he have thought: ‘Now, a Moabite girl?
00:56:21 ‘Weren’t these the Moabite women—?
00:56:23 ‘Weren’t these the very women that lured the Israelite men into immorality
00:56:28 right on the threshold of the Promised Land?’
00:56:31 True.
00:56:32 But his Father saw that this girl was different.
00:56:35 She was different.
00:56:36 What a lesson for the Son of God!
00:56:39 His Father did not put people in categories;
00:56:42 he did not stereotype individuals.
00:56:45 ‘Oh, that’s the Moabite girl. I’m not going to deal with her.’
00:56:49 No.
00:56:50 Jehovah God looked at Ruth as an individual.
00:56:54 And the Son’s love must have grown  as now He allows this girl—
00:56:58 He allows a Bible book to be named in behalf of her
00:57:01 —Ruth as opposed to Naomi or Boaz—
00:57:04 Ruth, a Moabite girl.
00:57:06 That’s right.
00:57:08 And the Son’s love would’ve continued to grow
00:57:11 when he observed how his Father then allowed this girl
00:57:15 to become an ancestress to the Messiah.
00:57:19 But watching and admiring his Father wasn’t enough.
00:57:23 He went further.
00:57:25 As the Son continued to develop appreciation
00:57:29 for his Father’s qualities,
00:57:31 this bond of love became more than just a feeling.
00:57:35 No.
00:57:36 His love for his Father began to shape his decisions and actions,
00:57:40 and Jesus demonstrated this when he was on earth.
00:57:43 He didn’t just say the words, “I love the Father.”
00:57:47 He didn’t just feel the words
00:57:49 —feel “I love the Father’s cozy, warm, little feeling.”
00:57:52 No, no, no.
00:57:54 He lived those words,
00:57:57 and that is why Jesus could say in the second half of John 14:31:
00:58:04 “I am doing just as the Father has commanded me to do.”
00:58:09 “I am doing”
00:58:11 —you see, his entire life course
00:58:14 proved that he loved the Father.
00:58:20 For example,
00:58:22 when a Syrophoenician woman
00:58:24 begged Jesus to cure her demonized daughter,
00:58:27 initially Jesus said:
00:58:29 ‘No,  I was sent forth not to the Gentiles
00:58:33 but to the Jews.’
00:58:35 But the woman would not give up,
00:58:37 and showing her faith, she kept asking and asking.
00:58:41 So in light of this exceptional circumstance,
00:58:46 Jesus could see that this was no time
00:58:50 to enforce a general rule or to stereotype people
00:58:55 or to become inflexible or to put her in a category.
00:58:58 ‘Oh, no. You’re a Gentile. You’re Syrophoenician. No, no.’
00:59:02 No, Jesus saw this was a time to bend
00:59:06 in response to higher principles.
00:59:10 Did he remember
00:59:12 how his Father handled that situation with Ruth?
00:59:16 And this moved him to say: ‘My Father did that with Ruth.
00:59:19 ‘Now we have a similar situation.
00:59:21 What would my Father want me to do?’
00:59:24 Jesus helped the Syrophoenician woman.
00:59:28 He was ready to act in imitation of his Father’s love.
00:59:34 Another example  would be what Jesus learned
00:59:37 from his Father about forgiveness.
00:59:40 He watched his Father forgive —forgive people.
00:59:44 He watched his Father forgive David for adultery,
00:59:47 forgive David for the murder of Uriah.
00:59:50 How many others did the Son of God watch?
00:59:53 How many others did he watch his Father forgive?
00:59:56 The Hebrew Scriptures are replete with Jehovah forgiving people.
01:00:00 He’s a largehearted Forgiver.
01:00:02 He’s ready to forgive.
01:00:04 He’s on the lookout to forgive.
01:00:06 That’s what the Son of God learned.
01:00:10 So this no doubt helped him to deal with the frequency
01:00:14 of the imperfections of the apostles and others.
01:00:19 Jesus viewed forgiving others
01:00:22 as an opportunity to imitate his Father
01:00:27 —another opportunity to allow his actions
01:00:31 to declare loud and clear
01:00:34 “like Father, like Son.”
01:00:37 He didn’t just say, “I love the Father.”
01:00:41 He didn’t just feel it; he lived it.
01:00:45 Now we take this discussion out of the classroom
01:00:50 and apply it to your real-life situations.
01:00:54 Right after Jesus said,
01:00:57 “I love the Father,”
01:00:59 he said, “Get up, let us go from here.”
01:01:04 Well, soon you’re going to get up
01:01:07 and you’re going to go from here,
01:01:10 and you don’t know what tests of faith are going to come upon you.
01:01:14 You don’t know.
01:01:16 We can’t anticipate every test that’s going to come upon us of faith.
01:01:20 However,
01:01:22 if you know these four words,
01:01:26 you know enough.
01:01:29 Etch these four words “I love the Father”
01:01:32 on your minds and on your hearts.
01:01:35 Let these four words govern every decision and action of yours.
01:01:41 For example,
01:01:43 if you’re entrusted with authority,
01:01:46 how will you treat people?
01:01:48 How will you treat those under you?
01:01:51 Learn from Jesus on this last night.
01:01:56 His words could’ve been all about himself.
01:02:00 ‘For the world to know
01:02:02 ‘that I am the Son of God,
01:02:07 ‘“the firstborn of all creation.”
01:02:09 I’m the second greatest personage in the universe.’
01:02:12 Or he could’ve said,
01:02:14 ‘I plan to surrender my life for you
01:02:18 as the ransom sacrifice for you.’
01:02:22 Or, ‘I am the one —I’m the one who fulfills all prophecy.’
01:02:27 But none of his thoughts were about himself,
01:02:30 his authority, or his accomplishments.
01:02:34 So like Jesus, don’t focus on your position.
01:02:39 Show by your dealings with others
01:02:41 that your heartfelt desire and motives
01:02:44 are to please your heavenly Father.
01:02:46 That’s what you want to do.
01:02:49 So as you go from here,
01:02:54 who will be your “Ruth”?
01:02:59 Show that you don’t put people in categories.
01:03:03 Show it.
01:03:05 Instead of that department,
01:03:08 that nationality, that language group,
01:03:11 or those sisters,
01:03:15 who will be your “Syrophoenician woman”?
01:03:19 Seize opportunities to be more flexible and reasonable.
01:03:24 Discern when it will be a time to bend
01:03:29 in response to higher principles
01:03:33 rather than always being on the lookout to check and correct.
01:03:38 Work hard to acquire thinking ability
01:03:42 —thinking ability that will assist you
01:03:44 to respond to higher principles.
01:03:49 Developing thinking ability is not easy
01:03:53 because as you begin to think about a person,
01:03:56 often your emotional reactions
01:03:58 toward that person start interfering.
01:04:02 You begin registering likes, dislikes,
01:04:04 respect, disrespect,
01:04:06 trust, distrust
01:04:08 —reacting emotionally before beginning an intellectual appraisal.
01:04:15 But if you make decisions solely based on feelings
01:04:19 that have slipped in under the guise of thoughts,
01:04:23 this often leads to poor decisions.
01:04:28 So listen to what I’m going to tell you right now.
01:04:33 Ask yourself,
01:04:36 ‘Will my decision-making process
01:04:40 ‘—will it be in response to higher principles
01:04:44 or simply because I do or don’t like the person?’
01:04:49 When it’s a response to higher principles,
01:04:52 now you’re strengthening and stabilizing the organization.
01:04:58 Who will be your imperfect, disappointing “apostles”?
01:05:03 Be on the lookout for opportunities to be more forgiving,
01:05:07 more patient with the shortcomings of others.
01:05:10 Maybe you’re an overseer
01:05:12 and your imperfect, disappointing “apostles”
01:05:15 will be those working under you.
01:05:19 For others, it might be a fellow translator
01:05:23 or a workmate in your department that disappoints you.
01:05:27 If this happens,
01:05:29 will these four words govern your thinking?
01:05:34 They did for one sister.
01:05:36 This is what she says:
01:05:39 “Something that happened  in my department hurt me deeply,
01:05:43 “and it shook me to my very core.
01:05:46 “And since then, I struggle with constant feelings of inadequacy.
01:05:50 “I felt completely discouraged and dried up.
01:05:53 “However, I’m not a quitter.
01:05:56 “I will cling to Jehovah and not let go.
01:06:00 “I love Jehovah above everything,
01:06:03 “and I’m sure  that I will overcome my negative feelings
01:06:06 and will become  stronger spiritually and mentally.”
01:06:11 She didn’t just say the words
01:06:14 “I love the Father”;
01:06:16 she lived those words
01:06:18 —four words that gave her a proper perspective
01:06:22 and balance in life.
01:06:26 So it comes down to this:
01:06:30 When you cherish Jehovah’s approval
01:06:35 and your unbreakable bond of love for him
01:06:40 and this spiritual relationship overrides,
01:06:44 or supersedes, our human sphere of activity,
01:06:48 not much else matters.
01:06:51 How do you reach that point?
01:06:55 By thinking deeply on Jehovah’s way of doing things,
01:06:59 then loving those ways,
01:07:01 and then imitating your heavenly Father.
01:07:06 At John 13:15, Jesus said:
01:07:11 “I set the pattern for you.”
01:07:15 And it’s a pattern that we are confident that you will follow.
01:07:20 Like Jesus, show the world.
01:07:22 It’s your opportunity now to show the world
01:07:26 that you too can meet any challenge
01:07:28 and test of faith that comes your way.
01:07:30 We know you can do it; we have confidence in you.
01:07:34 Why do we know you can do it?
01:07:37 Because you are clothed
01:07:39 with the most unbreakable bond in the universe
01:07:43 and empowered by the unfailing four words to live by,
01:07:48 “I love the Father.”
01:08:07 Well, even though you were able to listen to Brother Noumair
01:08:11 and not have a written exercise afterward,
01:08:14 I’m sure, like me, you wrote down those four words:
01:08:17 “I love the Father.”
01:08:20 Thank you very much, Brother Noumair.
01:08:22 We really appreciated that.
01:08:24 And truly, there’s been an abundance of good points
01:08:28 that we’ve learned from the program so far.
01:08:30 And then, all of a sudden, I realized
01:08:33 that this program is going to be broadcast
01:08:36 on JW Broadcasting in 163 languages,
01:08:40 so I don’t have to take notes after all.
01:08:44 What an exciting and upbuilding program!
01:08:47 And don’t forget to tune in later this month
01:08:49 for Parts 2 and 3 of this special event.
01:08:53 To conclude, we’d like to share greetings from Taiwan.
01:08:57 Taiwan is a Southeast Asian island
01:09:00 over 35,000 square kilometers,
01:09:03 or nearly 13,000 square miles, in size.
01:09:07 It’s densely populated with over 23 million inhabitants.
01:09:13 The first Westerner who saw this island
01:09:15 named it Ilha Formosa, or “Island Beautiful.”
01:09:19 And it’s not hard to see why.
01:09:21 Taiwan has a beautiful coastline, fertile land,
01:09:26 and majestic mountains covered in thick, luxuriant forests.
01:09:30 The majority of the population live on the narrow coastal plains,
01:09:34 where you’ll find large bustling cities.
01:09:38 Manufacturing and exporting various goods drives the economy in Taiwan.
01:09:43 The official language of Taiwan is Mandarin Chinese.
01:09:46 However, there are also 16 recognized indigenous language groups.
01:09:51 One of the languages that our brothers reach out to is Amis.
01:09:56 In January 2018,
01:09:58 the Amis remote translation office was opened in Hualien City.
01:10:03 They translate written publications
01:10:06 and produce audio publications in Amis.
01:10:09 In the Hualien Amis Congregation, there are 80 publishers.
01:10:13 Five serve as elders and 22 are regular pioneers.
01:10:18 They conduct over 70 Bible studies each month.
01:10:21 These brothers search out Amis-speaking people in Hualien City,
01:10:26 where they live  alongside Chinese- and Min Nan-speaking people.
01:10:30 In the mountains, Amis-speaking people are more isolated,
01:10:34 so our brothers travel long distances,
01:10:37 using scooters, to share the good news with them.
01:10:40 The brothers and sisters in the Hualien Amis Congregation
01:10:44 send you their warm love.
01:10:47 From the world headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
01:10:49 this is JW Broadcasting.

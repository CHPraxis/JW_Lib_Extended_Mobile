00:01 Welcome to the June program  of JW Broadcasting.
00:24 As you likely remember,
00:25 Gilead graduations are now featured
00:27 as the monthly JW Broadcasting program
00:30 once every six months.
00:32 For this program,  we are excited to share with you
00:35 the first part of the graduation  of the 144th class of Gilead,
00:39 which took place on March 10, 2018.
00:43 This program features Scriptural talks  with intriguing themes.
00:48 We know you’ll enjoy  these thought-provoking discussions.
00:52 In coming weeks, be on the lookout
00:55 for Parts 2 and 3 of the Gilead graduation.
00:58 You’ll have an opportunity  to get to know some of the students better
01:01 during another heart-stirring episode
01:03 of The Inside Story.
01:06 But now, we invite you to enjoy Part 1
01:09 of the graduation  of the 144th class of Gilead.
01:15 You’ll see a picture on the monitors.
01:19 Take a look at it;
01:23 take a good look.
01:28 What’s the occasion?
01:31 I’ll give you a hint.
01:33 The picture was taken
75 years ago last month.
01:40 It’s a picture of the very first day
01:44 of the very first class of Gilead.
01:48 So 75 years ago last month
01:52 was the inception of Gilead.
01:56 Now, Gilead
01:59 —that’s an interesting word, isn’t it?
02:02 What does it mean?
02:05 Well, if you answer “Heap of Witness,”
02:09 it shows that you’re very familiar
02:11 with the 1984 edition  of the New World Translation.
02:16 The 2013 edition says “Witness Pile.”
02:23 Now, there can be a difference  between a heap and a pile.
02:29 Where I come from in Canada,  in the wintertime it gets very cold.
02:33 And to save on heating expenses,
02:36 many families heat with a woodstove.
02:39 And so you go to the backyard,
02:42 and you see  a very neat pile of wood stacked up.
02:47 They’re not careless about it.
02:48 In fact, some of them  are quite meticulous about their woodpile.
02:52 If you appreciate  the appearance of your home,
02:55 some of them are very artistic,  almost sculpted, these woodpiles.
03:00 And we’d never call it a heap  because with a heap you’d think of wood
03:03 that has just been carelessly strewn  right and left.
03:07 But no, this is a woodpile,
03:09 so something rather neat.
03:13 So why are we talking about a “Witness Pile”?
03:17 Well, what was it?
03:19 What was this “Heap of Witness”?
03:22 What was this “Witness Pile”  in the original meaning?
03:26 What purpose did it serve,
03:29 and why does it concern  you members of the graduating class?
03:33 It does.
03:35 In fact, it concerns all of us.
03:37 There’s a lesson that all of us can learn
03:40 from this “Witness Pile” called Gilead.
03:43 Let’s go to the origin,  back in Genesis chapter 31
03:50 —Genesis chapter 31.
03:53 Now, a little context:
03:55 The patriarch Jacob
03:58 was tired of being cheated  by his father-in-law, Laban.
04:03 And as we read the Scriptures,
04:05 we know that Laban  was kind of a shady character;
04:08 you wouldn’t want to buy  a used car from Laban.
04:12 And so Jacob got tired of being cheated,
04:14 and so he ran away  with his wives and his children.
04:19 Well, Laban ran after him.
04:21 And when he caught up with Jacob,
04:23 Laban and Jacob  made a covenant of peace.
04:29 Now, we’ll take up  the reading from verse 43.
04:32 So this is Genesis 31,  beginning with verse 43:
04:37 “Then Laban answered Jacob:
04:40 “‘The daughters are my daughters
04:42 “‘and the children my children
04:44 “‘and the flock my flock,
04:46 and everything you are looking at is mine.’”
04:50 It tells you what kind  of a person he was, doesn’t it?
04:52 Verse 44:
04:54 “‘Now come,  let us make a covenant, you and I,
04:58 “and it will serve  as a witness between us.’
05:04 “So Jacob took a stone  and set it up as a pillar.
05:08 “Then Jacob said to his brothers:
05:10 “‘Pick up stones!’
05:12 And they took stones and made a pile.”
05:16 And notice this:
05:18 “After that they ate there
05:21 on the pile of stones.”
05:24 So scholars tell us  that this “pile of stones”
05:28 must have been quite neatly arranged,
05:31 so that it would form a kind of a table,
05:35 and they had  their meal of peace on this table.
05:39 And, of course,  this was to serve as a monument.
05:42 It was to be a monument  of the covenant of peace
05:45 between Laban and Jacob.
05:48 Now, let’s carry on, verse 47:
05:52 “And Laban began calling it Jegar-sahadutha,
05:57 but Jacob called it Galeed.”
06:01 When the brothers  were picking a name for the school,
06:04 aren’t you glad  they didn’t go with Laban’s?
06:08 How would you students like to be graduates
06:10 of the Watchtower Bible School  of Jegar-sahadutha?
06:15 That would be a mouthful, wouldn’t it?
06:17 So they chose Galeed, or Gilead.
06:21 Verses 48 and 49:
06:23 “Laban then said:
06:25 “‘This pile of stones is a witness
06:29 “between me and you today.’
06:32 That is why he named it Galeed,  and the Watchtower.”
06:37 And isn’t it interesting  that both “Watchtower” and “Gilead”
06:40 are in the name of our school?
06:43 But what was the purpose  of the pile of rocks?
06:47 Verse 52:
06:49 “This pile of stones is a witness,
06:53 “and the pillar is something  that bears witness,
06:56 “that I will not pass  beyond this pile of stones
06:59 “to bring harm to you
07:01 “and you will not pass  beyond this pile of stones and this pillar
07:06 to bring harm to me.”
07:09 So this Gilead,
07:12 this “pile of stones,”
07:14 this “Witness Pile,”
07:17 was really a monument.
07:20 It was a symbol of peace and unity.
07:24 And anytime someone  would pass by that monument,
07:27 that “pile of stones,”  that “witness heap,” if you like,
07:32 they would be reminded of the need for unity.
07:36 Now, the unity between Laban and Jacob
07:41 didn’t come about automatically.
07:43 We read verse 43.
07:44 Did you notice  the accusations that Laban made
07:48 when he first encountered Jacob?
07:51 ‘The daughters are mine;
07:53 ‘the children are mine;
07:55 ‘the flocks are mine;
07:58 everything you see is mine.’
08:01 Well, them were fighting words.
08:05 Jacob had worked very hard  for everything he got.
08:08 He’d worked for 14 years for his wives,
08:11 and Laban changed his wages ten times.
08:15 So Laban had no right  to say that it was all his,
08:18 and Jacob could have taken exception to it;
08:21 but he bit his tongue.
08:22 Why?
08:24 The goal was peace.
08:26 He wanted to make peace.
08:28 So Jacob took the high road.
08:32 Well, today, that name Gilead
08:35 is an appropriate name for our school.
08:38 And it reminds us of the blessed unity
08:41 that must pervade  through the organization today.
08:45 When you think of it,  Gilead has been a tremendous force
08:48 to unify God’s people.
08:50 As missionaries were sent  to the far corners of the earth,
08:54 they were supplicating people to come
08:57 into a peaceful relationship  with Jehovah God.
08:59 And as branches were formed,
09:01 the missionaries understood  how world headquarters worked,
09:04 and they helped to promote unity
09:06 between the branches  and world headquarters.
09:09 So the missionaries were agents of peace.
09:13 Now, of course, the focus of Gilead  is on strengthening the congregations,
09:17 strengthening the circuits,  strengthening the branches,
09:20 forging an unbreakable link
09:23 between the branches  and world headquarters.
09:25 And Gilead plays a part in all this.
09:29 We are “one flock,”  under “one shepherd.”
09:33 Don’t hurt any member of the flock.
09:37 Be a peacemaker.
09:39 If you want peace,  you have to work for it.
09:41 And sometimes to achieve it,  we have to bite our tongues.
09:45 Now, isn’t that a good lesson
09:47 that you members of the graduating class
09:49 and all of us can learn?
09:52 Because we all want to work  for the peace of Jerusalem;
09:55 we all want to work  for the peace of Jehovah’s organization.
10:00 Well, back to the first class of Gilead
10:03 —graduation day, June 23, 1943.
10:09 Wait a minute,
10:11 first day of class, February 1;
10:13 graduation day, June 23.
10:17 That wasn’t five months, was it?
10:19 But they had a lovely graduation day.
10:21 And the first to speak was a member
10:24 of what would later become  the Governing Body,
10:26 Brother W. E. Van Amburgh.
10:29 Well, today at the graduation  of the 144th class,
10:34 we have a member of the Governing Body  who will be first to speak,
10:38 not Brother Van Amburgh,
10:40 but Brother Anthony Morris.
10:42 And Tony is going to speak  to us on the subject
10:45 “Supplicate All the Time!”
10:55 You soon-to-be graduates  are very familiar with the fact
10:59 that in Scripture  there are different forms of prayer.
11:03 You have petition.
11:05 We petition Jehovah for various needs.
11:07 You have thanksgiving  —so much to thank him for.
11:11 And then, of course,  Jehovah always deserves praise,
11:14 so we have these prayers  we offer to praise him.
11:18 However,  I just want to implant in your minds,
11:21 as you get ready to graduate  and go to your assignments,
11:24 this matter of supplication.
11:26 It’s unique;
11:28 it’s just full of emotion  —earnest prayer.
11:33 And I think you understand that.
11:35 We want you to understand  why we’re suggesting
11:38 you should supplicate all the time  —all the time.
11:42 And take, for example, Christ Jesus.
11:46 He set the perfect example for us here.
11:49 And you’ll notice in Hebrews chapter 5
11:53 how priceless his perfect example was.
11:58 At least we try to reach for it.
12:00 But not just you soon-to-be graduates
12:03 but all of us  can benefit from this good counsel.
12:07 Now, notice Hebrews 5:7:
12:12 “During his life on earth,  Christ offered up supplications
12:17 “and also petitions,  with strong outcries and tears,
12:20 “to the One  who was able to save him out of death,
12:24 and he was favorably heard  for his godly fear.”
12:28 Now, did you notice, though,  that “supplications” is plural?
12:32 So, certainly he supplicated throughout  his three-and-a-half-year ministry.
12:37 But we can only imagine  the final weeks, days,
12:42 hours was with tears
12:46 —the supplication.
12:48 So this is the example for us,
12:52 and the closer we get to the end,
12:54 Jehovah wants us to imitate his Son.
12:57 In fact, Jesus made it very clear  how important this was.
13:01 And you’re aware of it,  but sometimes we get so busy
13:04 with the things  we’re dealing with that we can forget.
13:07 Notice what he commanded in Luke.
13:10 So find Luke,
13:12 and we’re going to look at the 21st chapter.
13:14 You’ll quickly remember it
13:19 —Luke chapter 21.
13:22 Now here, just to highlight a little bit
13:25 before we read verse 36,
13:27 you’ll notice in verse 34
13:30 that these are the things  we have to “pay attention to”
13:32 to avoid being “weighed down with overeating
13:34 and heavy drinking and anxieties of life,”
13:37 so that it doesn’t hit us like a snare.
13:40 Now notice verse 36:
13:44 “Keep awake, then,
13:46 “all the time making supplication
13:50 “that you may succeed  in escaping all these things
13:53 that must occur  and in standing before the Son of man.”
13:57 So this is what he said:
13:59 “All the time making supplication.”
14:04 Now, obviously,
14:08 it’s not going to be  something where if you’re driving a car,
14:12 you’re going to stop  and start supplicating on the road.
14:16 But the spirit of his counsel is,
14:18 ‘Do you want to succeed like I succeeded?
14:23 You must supplicate all the time.’
14:26 It just has to be.
14:27 You can’t let a day go by  that you haven’t had supplication,
14:31 and the closer we get to the end,
14:33 the more important that is.
14:36 A lot of us need to focus on supplicating
14:41 —because it’s not what might occur,
14:44 it’s what will occur.
14:47 This is a reality.
14:50 So it’s very obvious,  and it’s understandable
14:54 that we will supplicate
14:56 when we or a loved one face a crisis,
15:00 something happens.
15:02 And then it’s just natural  to get that intense emotion in prayer,
15:07 and there could well be tears;  but it’s intense.
15:09 You’re just focused.
15:11 It’s just gripping you with the emotion
15:15 as you face different things.
15:17 So you may have  a life-threatening illness in the future;
15:21 you’ll start supplicating with that news.
15:23 If you have a loved one  and their life is threatened,
15:27 there’s going to be supplication.
15:29 But even though that’s appropriate
15:32 and Jehovah expects us to do that,
15:36 I just want to have you take back  with you on your assignments
15:40 something that you must supplicate about too.
15:43 And I have to take the same counsel.
15:46 It means a lot to Jehovah.
15:48 It’s very basic,  but look at Matthew chapter 6
15:56 —Matthew chapter 6.
16:02 And this is where Jesus  gave the example of prayer,
16:05 and it certainly extends to supplicating.
16:08 You’ll notice in verse 9 where he mentions:
16:11 “You must pray . . . this way:
16:13 “‘Our Father in the heavens,  let your name be sanctified.
16:17 “‘Let your Kingdom come.
16:19 Let your will take place,  as in heaven, also on earth.’”
16:24 So it’s Jehovah’s name.
16:27 You look at this wicked world,  and it’s getting worse.
16:32 The Bible foretold  it would go “from bad to worse,”
16:35 and it’s just so reproachful  to the holy name of God.
16:39 Everybody is in the face  of anything Scriptural.
16:42 And how terrible that is!
16:45 Supplicate about your concern  to Jehovah himself
16:49 —how that bothers you— and that will touch him.
16:52 And it’s nice because it gets  your mind off yourself
16:56 (which is not always spiritually healthy)
17:00 and focused on Jehovah’s name,
17:02 because it’s his name and the Kingdom
17:06 that are going to rid the whole world  of all the problems anyway.
17:09 So it’s just something  we want you to take with you,
17:12 to supplicate about Jehovah’s name
17:15 and removing the reproach  and that his Kingdom come.
17:19 Do that often.
17:21 All the time, if you will.
17:24 Now just some final thoughts here
17:27 in a very familiar Psalm,  Psalm 83.
17:30 So if you’ll find Psalm 83 here.
17:38 And this connects with supplicating Jehovah
17:42 to have his will done
17:44 and his name vindicated  (as we say in English as well now),
17:49 cleared of the reproach.
17:51 I know you feel the same way I do.
17:53 I’m way over here.
17:55 I just—  It’s disgusting!
17:58 You’ve got to keep up  with some of the news,
18:00 but it’s almost like,  ‘Let me stop!’
18:05 But you’ve got to know  a little something that’s going on.
18:08 And we have connections with our brothers
18:11 from all different parts of the earth;  things are coming up all the time.
18:14 There’s so much to supplicate about,
18:16 and the Kingdom  is going to finally put an end to all of it.
18:19 Now, what I thought you’d appreciate
18:22 if you look at the 83rd Psalm in context,
18:26 in the first five verses  (this is interesting),
18:30 it’s about those who hate Jehovah.
18:33 These arrogant enemies of Jehovah God
18:35 hate him and hate his people.
18:38 They’re cunning; they’re despicable.
18:41 Now, it’s quite fascinating that in verse 5,
18:45 see the “b” part of the verse:
18:48 “They have made an alliance against you.”
18:50 So this was an alliance of nations
18:53 coming against Jehovah’s name people  —an alliance.
18:57 What does that remind you of?
18:59 So by focusing on supplicating all the time,
19:03 you’re really getting yourself ready  for the great tribulation.
19:08 We call it a coalition of nations
19:12 —Gog’s attack.
19:15 It connects with what we see here  that happened in the past.
19:20 And these are beautiful thoughts here.
19:22 Notice verse 17 and verse 18
19:26 of the 83rd Psalm.
19:28 And this is from our heart.
19:30 We want to supplicate this to our Father:
19:33 “May they be put to shame  and be terrified forever;
19:38 “may they be disgraced and perish;
19:42 “may people know that you,  whose name is Jehovah,
19:46 you alone are the Most High  over all the earth.”
19:51 Ah! What a stirring supplication!
19:56 So with whatever you face,  you soon-to-be graduates,
20:00 in the future,  remember the Scriptural advice:
20:04 ‘Supplicate all the time,’  and you are sure to succeed.
20:16 Beautifully done.
20:17 Thank you very much, Brother Morris.
20:20 Now, at the graduation  of the first class of Gilead,
20:23 the next to speak  was a responsible brother.
20:27 And we have a responsible brother  who is going to speak to us next,
20:30 Brother Hermanus van Selm.
20:32 He’s a helper to the Writing Committee,
20:35 and Brother van Selm is going to speak  to us on the interesting theme
20:39 “See and Be Jehovah’s Hand.”
20:47 Think for a moment  of your congregation back home.
20:51 Imagine that Jehovah observes  there a dear elderly sister
20:56 who has suffered  one painful setback after another.
21:00 As a result, she is heartbroken.
21:03 She even feels that Jehovah  doesn’t love her anymore.
21:07 But then through the working of his spirit,
21:09 Jehovah makes you aware of her situation.
21:11 You want to help your dear sister,  but you wonder:
21:14 ‘How can I show her  that Jehovah is still reaching out to her?
21:18 ‘How can I help her to see
21:21 Jehovah’s supporting hand  at work in her life?’
21:25 To answer,  let us consider a few verses
21:28 in the Bible book of Ruth,
21:31 which relates the touching story
21:33 of Naomi, Ruth, and Boaz.
21:37 As we remember,  Naomi’s husband had died.
21:41 Then her two sons got married,
21:43 but sadly,  both of them also died.
21:47 Those blows caused Naomi
21:49 to sink deeper and deeper into despair.
21:53 She even felt  that Jehovah had abandoned her.
21:56 Note at chapter 1, verse 13,  at the end of the verse,
22:01 note what Naomi said:
22:04 “The hand of Jehovah  has turned against me.”
22:09 Verse 20, at the end of the verse:
22:12 “The Almighty has made  my life very bitter for me.”
22:17 Verse 21,  at the end of the verse:
22:21 “Jehovah who opposed me
22:23 and the Almighty who caused me calamity.”
22:27 Now, these were strong statements,
22:30 but, of course,  none of them were true.
22:32 Jehovah had not turned against her.
22:35 Jehovah had not caused her calamity.
22:38 So how did Jehovah react  to Naomi’s bitter words?
22:42 Well, he did not send  fire from heaven to punish her.
22:46 He did not send  a prophet to reprove her.
22:49 Instead,  he used Ruth and Boaz
22:53 to reach out to Naomi
22:55 and pull her gently out of her despair.
22:59 In a sense,  Jehovah gave Ruth and Boaz
23:02 the privilege to serve as His hand
23:05 —that is, the means  through which He could provide
23:08 support to Naomi.
23:12 In this class,  we have 22 Ruth-like sisters
23:17 and 27 Boaz-like brothers.
23:20 Also, there are thousands  of Ruths and Boazes in this audience.
23:25 So how can we be Jehovah’s hand?
23:28 And how can we help  the Naomis in our congregation
23:31 to see Jehovah’s hand at work in their life?
23:35 To answer,  we will consider five steps
23:39 mentioned in the book of Ruth
23:41 that we could follow to help  our fellow worshippers who are in need.
23:48 Step number one:  Have the right motivation.
23:52 Since helping those in need  takes great effort,
23:55 we have to be motivated by love.
23:58 But it needs to be a special kind of love.
24:01 What do we mean?
24:03 Well, love is a bit like coffee.
24:06 Coffee?  In what way?
24:09 Well, coffee comes in different types,
24:11 such as cappuccino, caffe latte, caffe mocha
24:15 —mmm.
24:17 Similarly, love comes in different types,
24:21 such as love for family,  brotherly love, principled love.
24:26 But the love considered in the book of Ruth
24:29 is yet of a different type.
24:31 What is it?
24:33 It is mentioned at chapter 1, verse 8:
24:37 “Naomi said to both of her daughters-in-law:
24:40 “‘Go, return,  each of you to your mother’s home.
24:45 “‘May Jehovah show loyal love to you,
24:50 just as you have shown it to the men  who have died and to me.’”
24:56 “Loyal love.”
24:58 What kind of love is that?
25:00 It’s a very strong kind of love.
25:02 It’s a bit like a double espresso, undiluted.
25:05 It gives you a real boost that helps you  to attach yourself to a brother in need
25:09 and to cling to him until you  have pulled him out of his despair.
25:13 Now, that’s the type of love  we show to our brothers and sisters in need.
25:20 Step number two:  Be persistent.
25:25 When Ruth offered  her helping hand to Naomi,
25:29 Naomi first refused to accept it.
25:34 But Ruth, motivated by loyal love,  did not take no for an answer.
25:38 What was the result?
25:40 Chapter 1, verse 18:
25:43 “When Naomi saw  that Ruth insisted on going with her,
25:47 she stopped trying to convince her.”
25:52 Similarly today,  a sister in despair
25:55 may first refuse to accept our help.
25:58 Even so, loyal love  will move us to cling to that sister,
26:03 hoping that she will eventually accept  our hand of friendship.
26:09 Step number three:  Don’t take it personally.
26:14 When Naomi and Ruth  arrived in Bethlehem,
26:17 Naomi met her former neighbors.
26:19 What did she tell them?
26:21 Chapter 1, verse 21:
26:24 “I was full when I went,
26:28 but Jehovah made me return empty-handed.”
26:36 What did she tell them?
26:38 Now, put yourself in the place of Ruth.
26:43 She had gone out of her way to help Naomi.
26:46 She cried with her, she comforted her,
26:50 she walked with her for days on end.
26:53 And then,  with Ruth standing next to her,
26:57 Naomi said,  ‘I returned empty-handed.’
27:02 She did not even acknowledge  the presence of Ruth.
27:06 How painful that must have been  for our dear Ruth.
27:11 Yet, Ruth stuck with Naomi.
27:15 Likewise today, a brother or sister,
27:18 because of their bitter feelings of despair,
27:20 may speak to us or treat us in a hurtful way
27:23 in spite of all of our efforts to help them.
27:27 But we try not to take it personally.
27:31 We stick with our sister in need  and pray to Jehovah:
27:34 “Please, open the sister’s eyes.
27:37 Let her see your outstretched hand.”
27:40 Step number four:  Give practical help.
27:44 Ruth realized that Naomi’s depression
27:47 prevented her from taking the initiative.
27:49 So, what did Ruth do?
27:52 Chapter 2, verse 2:
27:55 “Ruth . . . said to Naomi:
27:58 “‘Let me go out, please,
28:00 “‘to the fields  and glean among the ears of grain
28:03 behind whoever  looks on me with favor.’”
28:06 Now, today, we also realize  that the brother in despair
28:09 may lack the energy  to take any initiative to help himself.
28:14 So loyal love for our brother moves us
28:18 to take the first step  in giving him practical help
28:22 in and around his house.
28:26 Step number five:  Get encouragement.
28:29 Ruth badly needed encouragement,
28:32 and Jehovah moved Boaz to give it to her.
28:35 Look at chapter 2, verse 12.
28:37 Boaz said to Ruth:
28:41 “May Jehovah reward you  for what you have done,
28:45 “and may there be  a perfect wage for you
28:48 “from Jehovah the God of Israel,
28:50 under whose wings  you have come to seek refuge.”
28:55 Now, after Ruth had been hearing
28:57 negative talk for so long,
29:00 those heartwarming words of Boaz
29:03 deeply touched her.
29:05 In response, in the middle of verse 13  we read that Ruth said to Boaz:
29:08 “You have comforted me
29:10 and [you have] spoken reassuringly  to your servant.”
29:15 The kind and timely words of Boaz
29:18 gave Ruth the strength  she needed to carry on.
29:22 Today,  the kind words of a caring elder
29:25 will have the same uplifting effect
29:27 on those who give their all
29:29 in helping brothers and sisters in need.
29:33 If we follow these five steps,
29:35 Jehovah may give us  the privilege of being his hand.
29:39 With what result?
29:41 Consider what happened next to Naomi.
29:45 The Bible account continues  by telling that Boaz provided
29:48 a generous gift of food  for Ruth and Naomi.
29:52 What was Naomi’s reaction  to Boaz’s generosity?
29:57 Chapter 2, verse 20:
30:01 “At that Naomi said  to her daughter-in-law:
30:05 “‘May he be blessed by Jehovah,
30:08 “‘who has not failed in his loyal love
30:11 toward the living and the dead.’”
30:14 Now,  what a turning point this was for Naomi.
30:17 Earlier she had cried out in pain,
30:19 ‘Jehovah caused me calamity.’
30:22 But then she exclaimed with joy,
30:24 ‘Jehovah has not failed in his loyal love!’
30:27 Finally,  Naomi was able to connect the dots
30:31 and realize that when Ruth had said to her,
30:33 ‘I will stick with you;  I will glean with you,’
30:36 Ruth was acting as Jehovah’s hand.
30:39 And then Boaz had gone  far beyond what was required
30:42 in caring for her and Ruth.
30:44 Boaz had acted as Jehovah’s hand.
30:46 ‘Ahh, now I understand,’  Naomi must have thought.
30:51 ‘Jehovah never left me.
30:53 ‘He has been with me all the time.
30:55 ‘I’m so grateful to Ruth and Boaz
31:00 that they helped me  to see Jehovah’s supporting hands.’
31:04 No doubt all three of them rejoiced
31:08 over the decisive turning point
31:11 they had reached.
31:13 In summary,  what gave Ruth and Boaz
31:17 the strength to pull Naomi  out of her despair?
31:20 Loyal love.
31:22 A strong kind of love that we give,  not to people in general,
31:26 but to our brothers and sisters,  especially those who are in need.
31:31 What was the result?
31:33 Boaz and Ruth had the joy
31:36 of seeing how Naomi  regained her spiritual balance.
31:41 Today,  we may experience the same deep joy
31:45 when we are able to help  our brothers and sisters in need,
31:49 to see Jehovah’s hand  and thus regain their spiritual strength.
31:55 Therefore,  our dear Ruth-like sisters
31:59 and Boaz-like brothers
32:02 of class 144,
32:05 it is our heartfelt prayer
32:08 that the precious education  that you received at Gilead
32:13 may help you more than ever
32:15 to see and to be Jehovah’s hand.
32:27 Well, that was better  than a double espresso, wasn’t it?
32:33 Now we’re going to have a helper  to the Teaching Committee to talk to us,
32:38 and he has the interesting theme
32:40 “Be the Keel”  —K-E-E-L.
32:44 So we’ll listen with interest.
32:49 Like a sailboat in the open sea,  you could be sailing along
32:54 —enjoying life, enjoying your view—
32:57 but then suddenly and unexpectedly
33:00 a turbulent storm, a trialsome situation,
33:03 could be confronting you.
33:05 That could really rock your boat.
33:09 How true are the words  found in The Watchtower
33:12 of the March 1, 1896, issue
33:16 where it stated:
33:18 “The Christian course of self-sacrifice
33:21 “cannot be one of ease  and continuous smooth-sailing and peace.
33:26 “There may be a calm now and then,
33:29 but storms and battles are the rule.”
33:33 Now, if that was the case 122 years ago,
33:37 way before all of us were alive,
33:39 how much more so is that the rule,  or the case, today.
33:45 Life in Satan’s system  is anything but smooth sailing.
33:50 How can you students  help others endure present storms
33:55 and prepare them for future tests  —future storms?
33:59 Be the keel.
34:02 What does that mean?
34:04 The keel is a heavily-weighted fin
34:07 attached to the bottom of a sailboat.
34:09 So when strong, gusting winds fill the sail
34:12 and the vessel leans on its side,
34:15 the keel serves as the ballast  —the counterweight.
34:19 It provides stability.
34:21 It prevents the sailboat  from blowing sideways
34:25 and from capsizing, or keeling over.
34:29 Our brothers and sisters,
34:31 now more than ever,  need to be strengthened.
34:34 They need to be stabilized  so that they can face
34:37 storms of anxiety, natural disasters,
34:41 and wave after wave  of ridicule and persecution.
34:45 That’s the focus of Gilead School
34:49 —to strengthen and stabilize  qualified men and women like you
34:53 so that you, in turn, can strengthen
34:56 and stabilize Jehovah’s organization.
35:00 Empowered with Jehovah’s spirit,
35:02 you can be like those strengthening aids
35:05 in the first century
35:07 who proved to be someone
35:09 who could stabilize  their brothers and sisters.
35:11 And there are many examples.
35:13 But let’s look at Acts 18:24,
35:17 and let’s see why the man Apollos  is someone who we want to follow.
35:22 There in Acts chapter 18,
35:24 let’s read together verse 24.
35:29 And there it reads:
35:31 “Now a Jew named Apollos,  a native of Alexandria,
35:34 “arrived in Ephesus;
35:36 “[and notice] he was an eloquent man  who was well-versed in the Scriptures.
35:41 This man had been instructed  in the way of Jehovah,”
35:45 and notice that he was  “aglow with the spirit,”
35:47 which caused him  to speak and teach accurately
35:50 about the things of Jesus.
35:53 “But he was acquainted  only with the baptism of John.
35:56 “He began to speak boldly in the synagogue,
35:59 “and when Priscilla and Aquila heard him,
36:02 “[What did they do?]
36:03 “they took him into their company
36:05 and explained the way of God  more accurately to him.”
36:10 Well, what outstanding qualities Apollos had
36:13 —qualities that you students have as well!
36:17 Now, Apollos had his strengths;
36:19 but like all of us,  he also had his weaknesses
36:23 and he knew  that he needed to humbly get more help,
36:27 more understanding.
36:29 So how thankful we are, and he was,
36:32 that Aquila and Priscilla filled in the gaps
36:36 —helped him to appreciate  the deeper things of Jehovah
36:39 so that he could speak more accurately.
36:42 Yes, this well-grounded,  spiritually mature couple
36:46 also helped Apollos learn life lessons.
36:51 Like what?
36:53 Like working as a team
36:55 —working in unity.
36:57 They also taught him life lessons  about going the extra mile
37:01 in helping those who needed help spiritually
37:03 as well as materially;
37:06 what it means to be generous,
37:08 to be hospitable;
37:10 and also the key that humility is needed
37:14 in order to support others,
37:16 so that we’re content in our assignment.
37:20 Like Apollos, you accepted  the invitation to come to Gilead
37:24 to receive extra schooling
37:26 to have a deeper understanding  of God’s Word, the Bible.
37:30 And along the way,
37:32 you learned vital life lessons  from this Bethel family,
37:35 who are supporting you.
37:37 You learned what it means  to go the extra mile
37:39 —to be hospitable,  generous, kind, and patient.
37:44 You also learned what it means  to be a giver and not simply a taker.
37:50 You will soon graduate.
37:52 You will have a diploma in your hand.
37:54 Is that it?  You walk away and that’s it?
37:57 That’s all for your instruction?
37:59 Of course not.
38:00 We know Jehovah promises
38:02 that he will continue  to give you instruction.
38:06 In fact, at 1 Peter chapter 5,  notice verse 10.
38:13 There at 1 Peter 5:10,
38:15 Jehovah promises  that he will “finish your training.”
38:20 Well, how will he finish your training?
38:22 It goes on to say  that his continued training
38:25 “will make you firm,”
38:27 it “will make you strong,”
38:29 and “he will firmly ground you.”
38:32 So just as a keel  is filled with heavy weight
38:35 to keep the boat stable and upright,
38:39 so too Jehovah promises  to give you his powerful holy spirit
38:44 so that you  can be strengthened and stabilized
38:47 and help others to do the same
38:49 —to be firmly grounded.
38:52 Now, because Apollos was humble  and he accepted the help,
38:56 he put himself in a position  to be used mightily by Jehovah
39:00 and by his organization.
39:03 Now, what did he do to greatly help  the congregations back then?
39:07 Notice Acts 18:27.
39:11 There at Acts 18:27,
39:15 Apollos not only helped  the congregation in Achaia
39:19 but it says  that “he greatly helped” them.
39:24 And it went on to say  in another translation of this verse
39:28 that “he powerfully reinforced” them.
39:31 So he was really someone  who took the training
39:34 and really made it happen.
39:37 In fact, if you look at verse 28,
39:39 he set an example of someone  who should be zealous in the ministry.
39:43 He used the Scriptures  that he had at the time,
39:46 and he used these as his authority.
39:48 And how did he speak?
39:50 Verse 28 says “with great intensity.”
39:54 So we could say
39:56 that basically Apollos  was a keel with zeal.
40:01 And we look forward to seeing  how you will use your Gilead training
40:06 to greatly help others in your assignments
40:08 and doing so with great intensity.
40:11 Now, when you look at a sailboat,
40:13 what’s the first thing that you normally see?
40:16 Isn’t it the sail?
40:18 Why?
40:19 Because it’s the most prominent,  outstanding thing on a sailboat.
40:23 Now, the keel,  on the other hand, is unseen.
40:27 It’s below the water,  below the boat, but there it is.
40:30 It’s doing its job.
40:31 It’s keeping that sailboat upright,  supported, and stabilized.
40:36 Now, you could hardly imagine  Apollos thinking to himself:
40:40 ‘I know that my assignment as a keel
40:43 ‘—as a support, as a stabilizer—
40:45 ‘is important, but I don’t think  I’m being tapped into my true potential.
40:49 ‘I don’t think the brothers  can really see me down here,
40:52 ‘doing all that I’m supposed to do.
40:54 ‘Yes, I know that I’m not an apostle.
40:57 ‘I’m not being used  to write inspired letters,
41:00 ‘although I would be a logical choice.
41:04 ‘If only, if only, I could have  a more elevated, higher position,
41:09 ‘maybe like the sail.
41:11 ‘If I was the sail, everyone could see me
41:14 ‘and I could get more airtime.
41:16 ‘And then everyone could hear me
41:18 and my words that are so eloquent.’
41:21 Well, we know that that’s ridiculous.
41:23 He never thought that,  and he never acted that way toward others.
41:27 The Bible only reveals just a fraction
41:30 of all that Apollos said and that he did.
41:33 But what we do know
41:35 is that the most outstanding  and most prominent thing about Apollos
41:39 was his humility.
41:41 He was willing, humble,
41:43 to do anything  wherever he was sent to go.
41:48 He never allowed his strengths  to become weaknesses.
41:53 Likewise,  much of what you, Gilead students,
41:56 will do in the future  will be unseen by others.
42:00 But you know  that Jehovah sees everything you do
42:03 and all the work and the stabilizing you do
42:06 in behalf of his precious sheep.
42:09 You students have many gifts,  many strengths, many abilities.
42:14 But your humility must exceed
42:17 any gifts or strengths that you have;
42:20 never allow your strengths  to become your weakness.
42:24 Remember,  ability without humility is a liability,
42:31 but ability with humility is stability.
42:36 And that’s the key to a keel.
42:39 And no doubt  when you look back at your life,
42:41 there were many  that served as a keel for you.
42:45 They were the ones  who stabilized you, balanced you,
42:47 when you needed it most.
42:49 When you were going  through turbulent storms in your life,
42:51 they were there for you.
42:53 Who was your Apollos?
42:55 Who was your Aquila? your Pricilla?
42:58 Remember all that they said and did for you,
43:02 and remember that you can be  that person for someone else.
43:05 They can help you to be balanced,  stable, even-keeled.
43:11 Now it’s your turn.
43:13 Take your Gilead training  and greatly help your brothers and sisters.
43:18 Love them, support them,
43:20 strengthen them, stabilize them.
43:23 Be the keel.
43:32 By the way, I forgot to mention  that was Ron Curzan,
43:35 in case you didn’t know.
43:37 So we appreciate  that spiritual sailing lesson.
43:42 Now, at the first graduation in 1943,
43:46 there were four Gilead instructors
43:49 who gave parting words to the class.
43:53 Three of them
43:55 —three instructors,  not the original instructors—
43:59 three instructors are going  to be on the program today.
44:03 And so the first one is Brother Jim Cauthon,
44:06 and he’s going to speak on the subject
44:08 “Pause and Reset.”
44:13 There are two things that I know about you
44:17 and two things that you know about me.
44:23 The first is we want to serve Jehovah,
44:27 and we want to do so acceptably.
44:29 And the second is we want to be happy.
44:32 Wouldn’t you agree?
44:34 Now, to the first point,  there’s not much of a problem
44:38 because you’ve had five months of study now.
44:41 You’ve been through the Bible.
44:43 You know what Jehovah expects  —what he wants—
44:46 and you’re prepared to do it.
44:48 But, now, as to the second point,
44:50 that can be a little bit more challenging.
44:52 Why do I say that?
44:54 Well, happiness can be tricky.
44:57 We all know people who by all standards
45:01 should seem to be happy, but they’re not.
45:05 On the other hand, we know people who face
45:08 many, many difficult challenges every day,
45:11 but they just seem to radiate happiness.
45:17 We quickly realize that happiness
45:20 is not dependent  on things, on circumstances,
45:24 or even on people.
45:26 Why is that?
45:27 It’s because true happiness  is not an end goal;
45:31 it is a by-product.
45:33 But a by-product of what?
45:36 Well, the answer to that question  lies back in time.
45:40 Open your Bibles, if you would,  to Deuteronomy chapter 16.
45:46 And here, discussing one  of the three annual festivals
45:50 that Jehovah required  the Israelites to attend,
45:54 in verse 15 he gave these words.
45:58 He said: “Seven days you will celebrate  the festival to Jehovah your God
46:03 “in the place that Jehovah chooses,
46:05 “for Jehovah your God will bless  all your produce and all that you do,
46:10 and you will become nothing but joyful.”
46:14 Now, did you notice Jehovah’s words there?
46:18 “You will become nothing but joyful.”
46:22 You see, being joyful  as a worshipper of Jehovah
46:27 was not an option.
46:29 He actually made it an act of worship.
46:32 But why?
46:34 It’s because imperfect humans  can lose their appreciation
46:38 for things that become  a routine part of life,
46:41 even if these things are a reflection  of Jehovah’s loving concern.
46:47 So, what was it about these festivals  that would cause all who attended them
46:51 to “become nothing but joyful”?
46:54 Well, each festival was to be a time
46:57 when the Israelites  stopped what they were doing.
47:00 In other words, they would pause,
47:03 and they would go up to Jerusalem
47:06 to reflect on the blessings  that they had received from Jehovah
47:10 and that they were receiving.
47:12 In other words, they would reset.
47:16 What effect did this pause and reset  have on the Israelites?
47:21 One word  —gratitude.
47:24 You know what happens  when we feel gratitude?
47:28 Happiness always follows.
47:30 You remember Jehovah’s words:
47:32 “You will become nothing but joyful,”
47:35 and Jehovah knows that happiness  is a by-product of gratitude.
47:40 Now, how does this ancient example  help us today?
47:44 Well, life in this old system  is filled with hardships.
47:49 Ahead of you  will be challenges, uncertainties,
47:54 “time and unforeseen occurrence.”
47:56 And really, that’s true for all of us.
47:59 Jehovah knows this,
48:01 but he also knows  that it is precisely during times of crisis
48:06 that we have the most to gain
48:08 by having a grateful perspective.
48:12 Gratitude reminds us that our Creator  loves us and that he cares about us.
48:17 It reminds us that God’s goodness exists
48:21 even in the worst that life has to offer.
48:25 Gratitude doesn’t cure suffering,  but it has the power to heal.
48:29 Gratitude doesn’t erase despair,
48:32 but it has the power to radiate hope.
48:36 Gratitude nullifies negativity.
48:41 “The joy of Jehovah  [becomes our] stronghold.”
48:45 But it’s up to us.
48:47 Because gratitude  is more than just a feeling,
48:49 brothers and sisters;
48:51 it’s a mind-set, it’s a disposition,
48:55 and it’s a choice.
48:57 Why do we say a choice?
48:59 It’s because we can make a conscious decision
49:03 to see blessings instead of curses.
49:06 Jehovah is called “the happy God,”
49:08 and he gives us the recipe to be happy too.
49:13 That recipe is found, in part,
49:15 in Psalm 143.
49:18 Let’s turn there,
49:20 Psalm 143:5.
49:24 David, the psalmist, said this;
49:28 he said: “I remember the days of old;
49:31 “I meditate on all your activity;
49:34 I eagerly ponder  over the works of your hands.”
49:39 What’s the point?
49:41 The psalmist is basically telling us
49:43 that from time to time
49:45 we have to stop  and press the pause button.
49:48 We need to take time to look around.
49:51 Jehovah has bejeweled  our world with daily reminders
49:56 of his goodness, his power,  but most of all, his love for us.
50:02 All we have to do is take the time to look.
50:07 We are immersed in the goodness of God,
50:10 so pause from time to time.
50:13 Take a moment to appreciate  what God is giving you each day.
50:18 Contemplate the abundance
50:20 and the diversity of life.
50:23 Ponder, muse, meditate
50:26 on all the works of the true God.
50:28 Drink in the awesomeness of the universe
50:30 on a starry night.
50:35 No two sunrises and no two sunsets
50:39 are ever exactly alike.
50:43 Look up to the clouds.
50:44 What you see is ever changing.
50:47 There was nothing exactly like it before,  nor will there ever be again.
50:53 The feeling you will experience  is a refreshment of the soul;
50:56 it’s a reset.
50:59 Eyes see only light,  and ears hear only sound;
51:02 but a grateful heart perceives meaning.
51:05 We perceive  that Jehovah created all these things
51:10 as a gift for us.
51:14 That’s right; each day  was to be a very special gift,
51:18 unique unto itself.
51:20 Why?
51:22 To make endless life not just special
51:25 but amazing, wondrous, and always a joy.
51:30 Connecting with Jehovah’s creation
51:33 helps to discharge anxiety.
51:36 It shifts our attention
51:38 to something safe, something enduring,
51:40 something outside ourselves.
51:43 It helps us to accept life’s uncertainties
51:46 by reassuring us  that we are a part of something larger,
51:50 something everlasting,
51:52 something immensely important.
51:55 Yes, we are a part of God’s purpose.
52:01 Gratitude is important
52:04 not only because it helps us feel good
52:07 but because it inspires us to do good.
52:11 A grateful spirit will make you more loving,
52:14 more forgiving,  more feeling, more thoughtful.
52:20 Thankfulness is a soil in which joy thrives.
52:25 So open your hearts  to the blessings around you.
52:30 Let gratefulness flow  from the inside out to others.
52:35 You too “will become nothing but joyful,”
52:38 and that joy will show in your smile,
52:40 in your eyes, in your touch,
52:43 and in your words.
52:44 Why?
52:45 Because gratitude
52:47 is the ability to experience life,
52:50 not as a test, but as a gift.
52:52 It will impact every relationship
52:55 that you have  —your family,
52:57 your marriage, your work,
52:59 even your ministry.
53:02 You’ll be in a much better position to make
53:05 a real difference in the lives of others.
53:07 It will liberate you  from the prison of self-preoccupation,
53:12 and it will replace a critical spirit  with a sense of appreciation.
53:18 So pause regularly
53:22 to reflect on what Jehovah has given you.
53:25 Give the digital world a break.
53:29 Take a walk outside, and don’t just look
53:32 —pause and perceive.
53:36 Try to count all the blessings  that you receive each day,
53:39 and you will find it easier to cope  with the trials and the stresses of life.
53:44 We are never  more than one grateful thought away
53:49 from increased peace of mind  and greater peace of heart.
53:53 Just remember, pause and reflect.
54:04 I think we all agree that we needed that.
54:08 We appreciate that effective presentation.
54:11 Now, the second  of our instructors to speak today
54:14 is Brother Mark Noumair.
54:16 And he’s going to talk on the subject
54:18 “The Unsung Legacy.”
54:22 Legacy.
54:24 The word carries the thought
54:27 of passing on something of value
54:31 to those that come after you.
54:34 But what is an unsung legacy?
54:38 It’s a legacy that’s unknown.
54:41 So if no one knows about you,
54:45 how can you pass on  anything of value to them?
54:50 Can you influence others
54:52 if your work is behind the scenes?
54:57 Yes.
54:58 The Kenites did.
55:00 They’re not included  in the “cloud of witnesses”
55:04 in Hebrews chapter 11.
55:07 Yet the value of their faith,
55:09 what they’ve passed on to you,
55:11 is worth meditating on.
55:14 They never enjoyed the spotlight.
55:17 Yet, in Jehovah’s eyes,
55:19 they are so precious and unforgettable.
55:23 Let’s do some digging
55:25 and unearth the legacy of the Kenites.
55:30 And we want you to learn valuable lessons,
55:32 especially lessons that will help you
55:36 search your hearts and motives.
55:39 The first Kenite mentioned in the Bible
55:42 is Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law.
55:46 When hearing that Jehovah  freed the Israelites from Egypt,
55:50 notice what Jethro said here
55:52 —his response—  at Exodus 18:11.
55:58 Jethro says: “Now I know
56:01 “that Jehovah  is greater than all the other gods,
56:04 “because of what he did
56:06 to those who acted arrogantly  against his people.”
56:09 These are Jethro’s words.
56:11 And now in verse 12,  what he did was offer up sacrifices
56:15 to Jehovah God.
56:17 You see  —this Jethro, this Kenite—
56:20 he recognized that Jehovah God
56:23 was directing the nation of Israel,
56:26 and he recognized  that he was to help Moses.
56:29 Jehovah God was using Moses.
56:32 Moses had been given this exhausting job
56:34 of directing some three million people.
56:37 So Jethro said, ‘How can I assist?’
56:40 He wanted to support Moses —support.
56:43 So he assisted Moses  to reach a God-approved solution.
56:48 ‘Select capable, trustworthy men, Moses,
56:50 ‘and appoint them as chiefs
56:55 over hundreds and fifties and tens’  and so forth.
56:59 Them, not me  —them.
57:02 You see, Jethro was not looking  for a position for himself.
57:06 He simply gave advice  to be of support to Moses.
57:10 Why?
57:11 So that Moses could continue  to do Jehovah God’s work.
57:16 He wanted to be involved in helping.
57:18 He saw Jehovah’s blessing on Moses.
57:21 He didn’t criticize.
57:23 Jethro didn’t sit back and say:  ‘You’re not even a fluent speaker.
57:27 ‘Who do you think you are,  trying to manage three million people?
57:29 I knew you as a shepherd boy,  back with me.’
57:32 He didn’t do that.
57:34 He said, ‘I want to assist.’
57:36 So the support of this Kenite  proved to be invaluable
57:40 not just to Moses
57:42 but ultimately for the entire nation
57:45 that was chosen by God.
57:47 So this is your first big lesson.
57:50 Like Jethro,  look for ways to support
57:54 and to be selfless.
57:57 Don’t look for position.
57:59 Positions come and go,
58:01 but your value to Jehovah God will not.
58:04 That’s what Jehovah is looking for.
58:07 He loves your faithful service, not position.
58:10 And rather than criticize others, help.
58:13 Help your brother succeed at their work.
58:16 Let them take the credit.
58:19 Drain the venom of position  and human recognition from your mind.
58:25 Jesus said,
58:27 “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing.”
58:31 So prove to yourself  and prove to Jehovah God
58:36 that you are more  for the Kingdom than for the glory.
58:41 That’s Jethro.
58:43 But the legacy of the Kenites continues.
58:46 Jethro had a son, Hobab.
58:50 Hobab was Moses’ brother-in-law.
58:52 So when the time now came for the Israelites
58:55 to travel toward the Promised Land,
58:57 Moses requested something from Hobab.
59:00 And that’s found at Numbers chapter 10
59:04 —Numbers 10:31.
59:09 Now, at this Moses  says to Hobab, in verse 31:
59:13 “Please do not leave us,
59:15 “for you know where we  should camp in the wilderness,
59:18 and you can serve as our guide.”
59:20 As the footnote says, our “eyes.”
59:23 You see, Moses wanted Hobab to come.
59:27 Why?  He was familiar with the terrain;
59:30 he knew where to find water;  he knew where to find pasturage.
59:33 Hobab saw the big picture.
59:35 Hobab, come with us;  serve as our “eyes.”
59:38 Use your knowledge;
59:40 use your experience
59:43 as a scout for the nation.
59:45 We need your experience.
59:47 Hobab could have stayed home.
59:49 Why go?
59:50 ‘I have a family; I have my friends;  I have a comfortable life.
59:53 ‘Why should I throw my lot  in with some three million people?
59:56 I have no idea  what’s going to happen to you.’
59:59 But he went.
1:00:01 Hobab,  with no apparent reward for himself,
1:00:04 used his experience to guide the nation
1:00:09 as they traveled toward the Promised Land.
1:00:12 Now, what does this mean for you?
1:00:14 It means something big.
1:00:16 During the past five months,  you have become familiar
1:00:20 with this spiritual terrain
1:00:22 of the 66 books of the Bible.
1:00:25 You’ve been given the big picture.
1:00:27 You got it from Genesis to Revelation
1:00:30 —history lessons,  geography lessons, archaeology lessons,
1:00:33 lesson after lesson, day after day,
1:00:36 written review after written review.
1:00:38 You got it.
1:00:40 Use your experience now.
1:00:42 Use that knowledge  —to do what?
1:00:44 To serve as a guide for others.
1:00:47 For example,
1:00:50 when someone faces a crisis of faith,
1:00:53 they might find it difficult  to travel this unfamiliar terrain.
1:00:57 It could be challenging for them.
1:00:59 Show them from God’s Word  where they can find spiritual water.
1:01:03 Where can they get refreshment?  Where can they get the energy?
1:01:07 Help them travel that terrain.
1:01:10 You owe it to them.
1:01:13 You have been given a beautiful view,  while being here at school,
1:01:17 of the organization
1:01:19 —a unique vista of God’s organization  that many will never see.
1:01:23 You will go back to your assignments,  and many will never experience
1:01:26 what you’ve been able to experience.
1:01:30 Share with them  your memories, your experience.
1:01:33 Strengthen their confidence  in Jehovah God’s organization.
1:01:37 Don’t be stingy  by holding your knowledge hostage.
1:01:41 Train two to become better than you.
1:01:45 Then, they train two,
1:01:48 and then they train two,
1:01:51 and they train two.
1:01:53 Imagine, if you adopt and embrace
1:01:58 this healthy mind-set,
1:02:01 you will help forge a path
1:02:03 toward a strong and unified organization.
1:02:07 That’s your responsibility.
1:02:10 So now we have two  —two generations of Kenites
1:02:15 who loyally supported  Jehovah God and his people.
1:02:19 A legacy had begun.
1:02:22 Would it continue?
1:02:25 Well, let’s jump ahead  to the time of the kings.
1:02:28 We have 1 Chronicles 2:55
1:02:31 that identifies another Kenite named Rechab,
1:02:34 and his son was Jehonadab.
1:02:37 Jehonadab lived  during the time period of King Jehu,
1:02:41 when Jehovah God commissioned Jehu  to go wipe out Baal worship.
1:02:45 And then Jehonadab comes out.
1:02:47 He meets Jehu.
1:02:49 Imagine, he wants to meet him;  he wants to support Jehu.
1:02:52 At 2 Kings 10:15, what did Jehu say?
1:02:55 ‘Jehonadab, is your heart with me?’
1:02:57 ‘It is, my heart is with you.’
1:02:59 ‘Then get up into this chariot.’
1:03:01 He pulled him up in.
1:03:02 Wonderful!
1:03:04 Jehonadab wanted to support [Jehu].
1:03:06 It was a privilege  for Jehonadab to come out publicly
1:03:11 and show his loyalty  for Jehu’s God-given commission
1:03:14 —a privilege.
1:03:15 I’m going to be with you.
1:03:18 When Jehonadab accepted Jehu’s hand,
1:03:21 imagine, he stepped into that chariot.
1:03:23 He didn’t get underneath.
1:03:24 He stood up.
1:03:25 He was proud to be a part of that process.
1:03:28 He in effect was saying:
1:03:30 “Jehu, I’m sticking with you.
1:03:33 “I’ll do whatever you need.
1:03:35 “It doesn’t matter what the job is.
1:03:37 I’m with you.”
1:03:39 Like Jehonadab,  be determined to accept the privilege
1:03:44 of loyally supporting the decisions
1:03:47 made by God’s visible organization.
1:03:50 Support those decisions today, tomorrow,
1:03:53 next week, next month, next year.
1:03:56 Who knows?
1:03:57 But you’re going to be  a part of this, and it’s big.
1:04:02 You know, from a human standpoint  the Kenites had no royal lineage,
1:04:06 no notable accomplishments, no home.
1:04:08 There’s no country of Kenite.
1:04:10 They’re easy to miss and overlook.
1:04:13 Unsung as a people
1:04:17 but not unseen by Jehovah.
1:04:21 Jehovah saw these faithful Kenites  and all they had done for his people,
1:04:25 and he never forgot them.
1:04:27 Jehovah didn’t forget them; he loved them.
1:04:30 How do we know?
1:04:33 Well, again, 1 Chronicles 2:55 says
1:04:36 that they are part of the genealogy of Judah.
1:04:39 They’re tacked on at the end.
1:04:41 Jehovah said, ‘Welcome to the family.’
1:04:43 Beautiful!
1:04:45 First Samuel 15:6 shows  that Jehovah protected them
1:04:49 when Saul was going  against the Amalekites.
1:04:51 And the Kenites,  get out of the way.
1:04:53 Because of your loyal love,
1:04:55 move out of the way  so that you don’t get hurt.
1:04:58 And he rewarded them.
1:05:00 In Jeremiah’s day,  he concluded a covenant
1:05:03 with Jehonadab’s descendants,  the Rechabites,
1:05:05 because of their enduring loyalty  for decades.
1:05:10 Jehovah declared at Jeremiah 35:19:
1:05:15 “There will never fail to be  a descendant of Jehonadab
1:05:19 the son of Rechab [ever]
1:05:22 to serve in my presence.”
1:05:25 Jehovah respected  the loyal endurance of these Rechabites.
1:05:30 He promised that they would survive
1:05:32 the destruction of Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E.
1:05:37 “There will never fail to be a descendant
1:05:40 . . . in my presence.”
1:05:42 Perhaps, just perhaps,
1:05:45 there were descendants  of the Kenites in Jesus’ time
1:05:48 that later became his disciples  and are in heaven right now.
1:05:53 Now, we can’t say for a certainty,
1:05:55 we don’t know.
1:05:57 But we would not be surprised.
1:06:01 This is a valuable lesson for you.
1:06:04 If you’re in a land  where our work is restricted
1:06:07 or an area where few know  the work you are doing,
1:06:11 you might feel alone  without an army of support.
1:06:15 Be assured that Jehovah’s eyes
1:06:18 are on your enduring loyalty,
1:06:22 and he so deeply appreciates  your faithfulness.
1:06:26 You see, like the Kenites,
1:06:28 your work  —it might not be in the spotlight.
1:06:32 At times, you might feel  overlooked, unacknowledged,
1:06:36 maybe unsung by humans.
1:06:39 But, again, never unseen by Jehovah.
1:06:43 And just as Jehovah did with the Kenites,
1:06:46 know that your heavenly Father
1:06:49 cherishes and treasures everything you do
1:06:52 and will never forget your faithful service.
1:06:57 The Kenites teach us what we need to do,
1:07:00 what you and I,
1:07:02 what we need to do  to be approved by Jehovah.
1:07:06 It’s so precious.
1:07:07 What do we need to do?
1:07:09 Nothing spectacular, just be faithful.
1:07:13 It’s not about fanfare.
1:07:15 It’s silent resilience.
1:07:20 The legacy of the Kenites is now yours.
1:07:25 What will you do with it?
1:07:27 Be a Jethro.
1:07:29 Prove that you love  the Kingdom and your brothers
1:07:33 more than your position.
1:07:36 Be a Hobab.
1:07:38 Use your experience  to help your brothers find refreshment,
1:07:42 bolstering their spiritual energy  to climb those difficult terrains.
1:07:48 And be a Jehonadab.
1:07:50 Show your loyal support
1:07:52 —your loyalty  for Jehovah and his organization
1:07:55 by saying,  “I’ll do whatever you need
1:07:57 for however long.”
1:07:59 The job doesn’t matter.
1:08:02 By imitating the Kenites,
1:08:05 their example will live on in you
1:08:08 and their unsung loyal support  will remain unforgettable.
1:08:21 Well, we appreciate  that wise counsel very much.
1:08:26 What a riveting  and faith-strengthening program!
1:08:30 Before we conclude,
1:08:32 we’d like to share  these greetings from Bulgaria.
1:08:36 Bulgaria is a beautiful mountainous country
1:08:38 in southeastern Europe.
1:08:41 Individual farms  are still an important part of life.
1:08:45 Many people still vint their own wine,
1:08:48 can their own fruits and vegetables,
1:08:50 and chop their own firewood  to prepare for the cold winters.
1:08:56 In late 1989, when the upheaval  of Communism shook Bulgaria,
1:09:00 there were less than 50 publishers  in the entire country.
1:09:04 In 1991,  the first Gilead-trained missionaries
1:09:09 were assigned there.
1:09:11 Today, Bulgaria has some 2,500 publishers.
1:09:16 Let’s visit the congregation in Vratsa,
1:09:18 a town where houses are built  right up to the steep mountain cliffs.
1:09:23 The dramatic rock formations,  waterfalls, and caves
1:09:27 attract many tourists.
1:09:30 The Vratsa Congregation has 43 publishers,
1:09:33 of which 5 serve as elders.
1:09:36 The publishers conduct on average
1:09:38 80 Bible studies each month.
1:09:41 Witnesses from other European countries  have moved there
1:09:44 to help in the ministry.
1:09:46 The congregation has 14 regular pioneers,
1:09:49 2 special pioneers, and 2 missionaries.
1:09:54 In the recent past,  the brothers and sisters in Vratsa
1:09:58 could be issued a fine  just for participating in the preaching work,
1:10:02 and some were harassed by the police.
1:10:06 But in October 2017,  the congregation rejoiced when a local court
1:10:10 ruled that limiting  our preaching work is unconstitutional.
1:10:16 We keep our brothers and sisters
1:10:18 in Bulgaria in our prayers.
1:10:20 We love them very much!
1:10:24 From the world headquarters  of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
1:10:27 this is JW Broadcasting.

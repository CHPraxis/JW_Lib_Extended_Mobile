00:00:01.117 --> 00:00:03.119 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Nick, thanks so much for being willing

00:00:03.119 --> 00:00:05.388 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to come along 
and answer some questions for us.

00:00:05.388 --> 00:00:06.856 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Yes, I’m glad to come.

00:00:06.856 --> 00:00:10.694 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, now that we’ve got you here,
the first question I’d like to ask you is,

00:00:10.694 --> 00:00:14.030 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What really are these so-called J-References?

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.132 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well the “J” in the J-References

00:00:16.132 --> 00:00:18.168 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎stands for Jehovah. 

00:00:18.168 --> 00:00:20.804 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And this is mainly a list of Bibles

00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:23.373 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in Hebrew and other languages

00:00:23.373 --> 00:00:26.009 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that use the divine name, Jehovah,

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.945 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the main text 
of the Christian Greek Scriptures

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:31.848 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—or at least some form 
of the name Jehovah. 

00:00:31.848 --> 00:00:34.284 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And this list began to be compiled

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:36.853 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎by the New World Bible Translation Committee

00:00:36.853 --> 00:00:38.888 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the 1940’s.

00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:41.991 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So where would we find a list like that now?

00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:45.495 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, originally there was 
a list of 21 such references

00:00:45.495 --> 00:00:49.699 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the 1950 edition 
of the Christian Greek Scriptures. 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:51.935 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Then, in 1984,

00:00:51.935 --> 00:00:54.871 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎27 such references were included

00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:58.141 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the Reference Bible in English. 

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:02.545 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And since that time, 
many more J-References have been found,

00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:04.881 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and now the list includes

00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:08.151 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎over 90 such translations and reference works. 

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:10.787 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And you can find an up-to-date list

00:01:10.787 --> 00:01:12.789 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in Appendix C4 of the [Study] Bible.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.891 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Very good. 

00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:18.762 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So I guess the main question 
we’re interested in asking you is,

00:01:18.762 --> 00:01:23.133 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Do these J-References prove in themselves

00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:26.436 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that the Tetragrammaton should be 
in the Christian Greek Scriptures?

00:01:26.436 --> 00:01:28.438 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Actually, no; they don’t.

00:01:28.438 --> 00:01:31.841 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Ah, now, I’m sure most of us 
weren’t expecting you to say that. 

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:34.310 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So can you explain it a little bit more please?

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.079 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, 
the New World Translation Committee

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.483 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎did not rely on the J-References
as the basis for their decision

00:01:40.483 --> 00:01:44.120 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to restore the divine name 
in the Christian Greek Scriptures. 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.956 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You already discussed 
the basis for the decision

00:01:46.956 --> 00:01:48.958 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎earlier in the broadcast. 

00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:51.995 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Rather, 
these J-References provide proof

00:01:51.995 --> 00:01:55.532 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that other translators 
have made similar decisions

00:01:55.532 --> 00:01:57.734 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when restoring the divine name

00:01:57.734 --> 00:02:01.504 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to their editions 
of the Christian Greek Scriptures,

00:02:01.504 --> 00:02:03.373 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or the so-called New Testament.

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:06.910 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So, now that you’re talking 
about these other Bible translators,

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.113 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎could you give us an example 
of who you’re talking about?

00:02:10.113 --> 00:02:13.883 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, a number of them 
were well-known Bible scholars. 

00:02:13.883 --> 00:02:18.888 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For example, 19th-century 
Lutheran theologian Franz Delitzsch

00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:21.991 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is still considered to be 
a foremost Bible scholar

00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:24.594 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and a scholar of Biblical Hebrew. 

00:02:24.594 --> 00:02:26.563 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Delitzsch’s translation

00:02:26.563 --> 00:02:30.500 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the New Testament in Hebrew 
was produced in 1877,

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.836 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and it’s one of the J-References. 

00:02:32.836 --> 00:02:35.939 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In fact, it’s still one 
of the best-known New Testaments

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.374 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the Hebrew language. 

00:02:38.374 --> 00:02:42.345 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In that translation, 
he discerned when to use Jehovah’s name

00:02:42.345 --> 00:02:44.480 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in places where the Greek text

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.750 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎contains the term Kyʹri·os, or Lord. 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.320 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The New World Bible Translation Committee

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.857 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎studied all those occurrences 
from his translation

00:02:53.857 --> 00:02:58.728 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as well as the occurrences 
in others of the J-References.

00:02:58.728 --> 00:03:03.299 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So how would you summarize 
what the value is of these J-References?

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.301 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, all the J-References,

00:03:05.301 --> 00:03:08.238 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎including the new ones in the Study Bible, 

00:03:08.238 --> 00:03:11.541 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎represent the view 
of translators and scholars

00:03:11.541 --> 00:03:13.676 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎who arrived at the same conclusion

00:03:13.676 --> 00:03:16.312 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that the New World 
Bible Translation Committee did,

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.250 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎namely, that Jesus Christ and the apostles

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.121 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎used the name Jehovah 
in their teaching and in their writings. 

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:27.257 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And this conclusion is reflected

00:03:27.257 --> 00:03:30.426 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in their translation and reference works.

00:03:30.426 --> 00:03:32.729 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Very interesting. 
That’s fascinating. 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:34.731 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So if I’ve got it right then,

00:03:34.731 --> 00:03:39.402 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎what you’re saying is
that if we go to Appendix C, in C3,

00:03:39.402 --> 00:03:41.804 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎there we’ve got a list of the reasons

00:03:41.804 --> 00:03:44.540 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎why the brothers
on the New World Translation Committee

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.443 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎decided to put
Jehovah’s name in certain verses.

00:03:47.443 --> 00:03:50.480 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And then C4 is virtually

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.916 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a list of other Bible translations

00:03:52.916 --> 00:03:56.052 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where the translators
made exactly the same decision.

00:03:56.052 --> 00:03:57.053 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Is that right?

00:03:57.053 --> 00:03:58.054 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That’s exactly right.

00:03:58.054 --> 00:03:58.721 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Ah, that’s good. 

00:03:58.721 --> 00:04:00.556 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, thank you very much, Nick,
for coming along. 

00:04:00.556 --> 00:04:03.960 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We really appreciated hearing 
those expressions from you. 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.596 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Before you go, though, 
can we ask you, please,

00:04:06.596 --> 00:04:10.767 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Can you take back the love and greetings
and an expression of appreciation

00:04:10.767 --> 00:04:14.570 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to all those hardworking brothers and sisters
there in Translation Services?

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.205 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Yes, I’d be happy to.

00:04:16.205 --> 00:04:17.473 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Thank you very much.

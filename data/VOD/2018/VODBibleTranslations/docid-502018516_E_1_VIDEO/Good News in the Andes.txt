00:15 ‎My name is Faustino Camacho Quispe.
00:19 ‎My family and I speak Quechua or,
00:23 ‎as we say, runa simi
00:26 ‎—the language of the people.
00:29 ‎We live in an agricultural community
00:33 ‎in the mountains of Peru.
00:36 ‎Our way of life depends on farming.
00:39 ‎We grow crops such as corn,
00:42 ‎potatoes, wheat,
00:45 ‎and quinoa.
00:48 ‎We also raise a small amount of livestock.
00:54 ‎Many people who speak Quechua  have moved to larger cities,
00:57 ‎but others, like us, still enjoy
01:00 ‎a more traditional way of life in the country.
01:05 ‎My family and I are Jehovah’s Witnesses.
01:16 ‎Most of our brothers and sisters in this area
01:19 ‎would never have been able to learn the truth
01:21 ‎had there not been anyone  sent here to preach in Quechua.
01:28 ‎In 1992,
01:30 ‎the Peru branch office began to expand
01:33 ‎the work in the Quechua-language field.
01:35 ‎In order to reach  those living in isolated areas,
01:39 ‎zealous brothers and sisters  climbed narrow roads
01:42 ‎in the frigid elevations  of the Andes Mountains.
01:48 ‎Great efforts were made in order
01:50 ‎to bring Quechua-speaking people
01:52 ‎the good news in their own language.
01:56 ‎The people loved having publications in their mother tongue.
02:01 ‎However, there were some challenges
02:04 ‎carrying out this work.
02:06 ‎One problem  was not having a good translation
02:09 ‎of the Holy Scriptures in Quechua.
02:11 ‎The commonly used translations here in Peru
02:14 ‎omit God’s name in the main text.
02:17 ‎It can be found  in the glossary of some Bibles,
02:20 ‎and sometimes  we used that in order to preach.
02:22 ‎But even so,  it didn’t have the same impact
02:26 ‎as seeing it in its proper place.
02:29 ‎That, along with the influence  of false doctrines,
02:32 ‎made it difficult for us to teach the truth.
02:36 ‎When we teach people about the Bible,
02:39 ‎we want them to draw close to God;
02:42 ‎we want them to become his friends.
02:44 ‎But no one can be God’s friend
02:46 ‎if they don’t know his name.
02:49 ‎For people to be able to come to love God,
02:51 ‎they have to know his name,
02:54 ‎and they have to understand what it means.
02:58 ‎It was difficult for us to use the Bible at the meetings,
03:02 ‎in the field ministry,  and in our family worship.
03:17 ‎How could Jehovah’s great name be sanctified
03:20 ‎throughout this mountainous region?
03:23 ‎How could the Quechua people  get to know God
03:25 ‎when his name was hidden?
03:29 ‎The answer to our prayers  came when Quechua congregations
03:32 ‎throughout the country  were invited to a special program
03:35 ‎on May 1, 2016.
03:38 ‎Imagine the great joy we felt when Brother Jackson
03:41 ‎of the Governing Body announced the release
03:43 ‎of the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures
03:47 ‎in two Quechua languages!
03:49 ‎Language number 136:
03:52 ‎It’s the Christian Greek Scriptures
03:56 ‎in Quechua Ayacucho!
04:07 ‎But we also have number 137:
04:10 ‎It’s Quechua Cuzco!
04:16 ‎What a wonderful gift we’ve received today!
04:23 ‎This new Quechua Bible
04:26 ‎is a grand victory for Jehovah’s great name.
04:29 ‎God’s name is no longer hidden from the Quechua people,
04:33 ‎giving them the precious opportunity
04:36 ‎to come to know our loving Creator, Jehovah.
05:04 ‎I feel proud to use our new Bible to teach
05:08 ‎my family and neighbors Jehovah’s name.
05:11 ‎I am thankful every day
05:13 ‎that Jehovah sent  this good news to the mountains
05:16 ‎to us who speak runa simi
05:18 ‎—the language of the people.

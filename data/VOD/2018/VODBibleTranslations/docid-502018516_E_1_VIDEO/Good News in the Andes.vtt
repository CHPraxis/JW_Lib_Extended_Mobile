00:15.202 --> 00:19.832
‎My name is Faustino Camacho Quispe. 

00:19.832 --> 00:23.919
‎My family and I speak Quechua or,

00:23.919 --> 00:26.130
‎as we say, runa simi

00:26.130 --> 00:29.633
‎—the language of the people. 

00:29.633 --> 00:33.554
‎We live in an agricultural community

00:33.554 --> 00:36.557
‎in the mountains of Peru. 

00:36.557 --> 00:39.351
‎Our way of life depends on farming. 

00:39.351 --> 00:42.271
‎We grow crops such as corn,

00:42.271 --> 00:45.816
‎potatoes, wheat,

00:45.816 --> 00:48.110
‎and quinoa. 

00:48.110 --> 00:50.613
‎We also raise a small amount of livestock.

00:54.783 --> 00:57.786
‎Many people who speak Quechua 
have moved to larger cities,

00:57.786 --> 01:00.372
‎but others, like us, still enjoy

01:00.372 --> 01:03.208
‎a more traditional way of life in the country.

01:05.294 --> 01:07.796
‎My family and I are Jehovah’s Witnesses.

01:16.931 --> 01:19.683
‎Most of our brothers and sisters in this area

01:19.683 --> 01:21.977
‎would never have been able to learn the truth

01:21.977 --> 01:25.397
‎had there not been anyone 
sent here to preach in Quechua.

01:28.859 --> 01:30.861
‎In 1992,

01:30.861 --> 01:33.238
‎the Peru branch office began to expand

01:33.238 --> 01:35.491
‎the work in the Quechua-language field. 

01:35.491 --> 01:39.411
‎In order to reach 
those living in isolated areas,

01:39.411 --> 01:42.665
‎zealous brothers and sisters 
climbed narrow roads 

01:42.665 --> 01:45.709
‎in the frigid elevations 
of the Andes Mountains. 

01:48.629 --> 01:50.839
‎Great efforts were made in order

01:50.839 --> 01:52.841
‎to bring Quechua-speaking people

01:52.841 --> 01:56.470
‎the good news in their own language. 

01:56.470 --> 02:01.100
‎The people loved having publications
in their mother tongue. 

02:01.100 --> 02:04.186
‎However, there were some challenges

02:04.186 --> 02:06.855
‎carrying out this work. 

02:06.855 --> 02:09.483
‎One problem 
was not having a good translation

02:09.483 --> 02:11.735
‎of the Holy Scriptures in Quechua. 

02:11.735 --> 02:14.488
‎The commonly used translations here in Peru

02:14.488 --> 02:16.824
‎omit God’s name in the main text. 

02:17.950 --> 02:20.452
‎It can be found 
in the glossary of some Bibles,

02:20.452 --> 02:22.955
‎and sometimes 
we used that in order to preach. 

02:22.955 --> 02:26.667
‎But even so, 
it didn’t have the same impact

02:26.667 --> 02:29.211
‎as seeing it in its proper place. 

02:29.211 --> 02:32.756
‎That, along with the influence 
of false doctrines, 

02:32.756 --> 02:36.385
‎made it difficult for us to teach the truth.

02:36.385 --> 02:39.972
‎When we teach people about the Bible,

02:39.972 --> 02:42.391
‎we want them to draw close to God;

02:42.391 --> 02:44.601
‎we want them to become his friends. 

02:44.601 --> 02:46.812
‎But no one can be God’s friend

02:46.812 --> 02:49.231
‎if they don’t know his name. 

02:49.231 --> 02:51.942
‎For people to be able to come to love God,

02:51.942 --> 02:54.069
‎they have to know his name,

02:54.069 --> 02:58.407
‎and they have to understand what it means.

02:58.407 --> 03:02.953
‎It was difficult for us
to use the Bible at the meetings,

03:02.953 --> 03:06.957
‎in the field ministry, 
and in our family worship.

03:17.968 --> 03:20.679
‎How could Jehovah’s great name be sanctified

03:20.679 --> 03:23.265
‎throughout this mountainous region? 

03:23.265 --> 03:25.768
‎How could the Quechua people 
get to know God

03:25.768 --> 03:29.271
‎when his name was hidden?

03:29.271 --> 03:32.274
‎The answer to our prayers 
came when Quechua congregations

03:32.274 --> 03:35.277
‎throughout the country 
were invited to a special program

03:35.277 --> 03:38.864
‎on May 1, 2016. 

03:38.864 --> 03:41.658
‎Imagine the great joy we felt
when Brother Jackson

03:41.658 --> 03:43.952
‎of the Governing Body
announced the release

03:43.952 --> 03:47.164
‎of the New World Translation
of the Christian Greek Scriptures

03:47.164 --> 03:49.416
‎in two Quechua languages!

03:49.416 --> 03:51.919
‎Language number 136:

03:52.878 --> 03:55.047
‎It’s the Christian Greek Scriptures

03:56.006 --> 03:59.343
‎in Quechua Ayacucho! 

04:07.017 --> 04:10.270
‎But we also have number 137:

04:10.270 --> 04:14.108
‎It’s Quechua Cuzco! 

04:16.610 --> 04:20.572
‎What a wonderful gift we’ve received today!

04:23.325 --> 04:26.245
‎This new Quechua Bible

04:26.245 --> 04:29.748
‎is a grand victory for Jehovah’s great name. 

04:29.748 --> 04:33.877
‎God’s name is no longer hidden
from the Quechua people,

04:33.877 --> 04:36.755
‎giving them the precious opportunity

04:36.755 --> 04:41.760
‎to come to know our loving Creator, Jehovah.

05:04.908 --> 05:08.912
‎I feel proud to use our new Bible to teach 

05:08.912 --> 05:11.373
‎my family and neighbors Jehovah’s name. 

05:11.373 --> 05:13.375
‎I am thankful every day

05:13.375 --> 05:16.170
‎that Jehovah sent 
this good news to the mountains 

05:16.170 --> 05:18.172
‎to us who speak runa simi

05:18.172 --> 05:31.833
‎—the language of the people.

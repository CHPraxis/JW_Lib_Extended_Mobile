00:18.497 --> 00:28.340
Ev’ry day brings decisions, 
and we must choose 


00:28.340 --> 00:36.682
How will we spend our time 
and live for the truth. 


00:36.682 --> 00:41.770
Now, there’s a time to laugh 
and be with our friends, 


00:41.770 --> 00:49.362
But it can’t be all 
we’re living for in the end. 


00:49.362 --> 00:54.950
We need to set time aside 
for what’s most important— 


00:54.950 --> 00:59.663
Prayer, study, 
and godly devotion. 


00:59.663 --> 01:08.505
Make Jehovah real, 
’cause that’s really what matters. 


01:08.505 --> 01:13.302
Throw off those things 
pulling us down. 


01:13.302 --> 01:17.724
Think about the future 
and where we are now. 


01:17.723 --> 01:25.000
Let nothing take the place 
of more important things. 


01:31.612 --> 01:40.245
Life sure can weigh us down 
with bills to pay. 


01:40.245 --> 01:49.505
It can make us lose sight 
and misplace our faith. 


01:49.505 --> 01:54.217
But our fam’ly needs us 
back at home. 


01:54.217 --> 02:01.725
And if we want to be there to help 
and watch them grow— 


02:01.725 --> 02:07.732
We need to set time aside 
for what’s most important— 


02:07.732 --> 02:12.235
Prayer, study, 
and godly devotion. 


02:12.235 --> 02:21.328
Make Jehovah real, 
’cause that’s really what matters. 


02:21.328 --> 02:26.083
Throw off those things 
pulling us down. 


02:26.083 --> 02:30.378
Think about the future 
and where we are now. 


02:30.378 --> 02:39.000
Let nothing take the place 
of more important things. 


02:55.237 --> 03:00.742
We need to set time aside 
for what’s most important— 


03:00.742 --> 03:05.539
Prayer, study, 
and godly devotion. 


03:05.538 --> 03:13.940
Make Jehovah real, 
’cause that’s really what matters. 


03:13.940 --> 03:19.135
Throw off those things 
pulling us down. 


03:19.135 --> 03:23.557
Think about the future 
and where we are now. 


03:23.557 --> 03:52.942
Let nothing take the place 
of more important things.

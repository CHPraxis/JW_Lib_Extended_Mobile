Life is hard,
and it wears us down.

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:26.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s not enough
to go around.

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:32.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I close my eyes,
and there I see

00:00:32.928 --> 00:00:39.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That ev’ry hope
has come to be.

00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:45.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine the time
when there’s no more pain,

00:00:45.357 --> 00:00:52.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When life’s so good
and we are young again.

00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:57.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine the time
when we wake up and say,

00:00:57.953 --> 00:01:07.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Thank you, thank you for this new life
and this brand new day!”

00:01:08.464 --> 00:01:14.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not a sound
has ever touched my ears,

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:20.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And eyes grow dim
with passing years.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But ears will hear
when music plays.

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:33.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And eyes will see
each brand new day.

and this brand new day!”

00:02:14.697 --> 00:02:21.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I might not be
the way I want to be.

00:02:21.912 --> 00:02:28.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But one day soon,
I’ll be running free!

00:02:28.377 --> 00:02:33.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

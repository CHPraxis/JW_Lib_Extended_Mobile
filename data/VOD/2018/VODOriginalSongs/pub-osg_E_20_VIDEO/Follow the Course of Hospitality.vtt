00:12.240 --> 00:30.258
It might be a meal or snacks or coffee
Or fun and games, maybe just talking.


00:30.258 --> 00:43.688
Jehovah is the one who put it on our table.
So could we be able . . .


00:43.688 --> 00:52.071
“Follow the course of hospitality.”
Imitate God above.


00:52.072 --> 01:03.000
Do it with true impartiality.
That’s what it means to love.


01:11.883 --> 01:21.310
The roof above our heads 
is from our heavenly Father.


01:21.310 --> 01:28.733
But if we need to share, 
would it be a bother?


01:28.733 --> 01:38.035
Let’s feel the joy 
that only ever comes from giving!


01:38.035 --> 01:43.165
That’s Christian living.


01:43.165 --> 01:52.758
“Follow the course of hospitality.”
Imitate God above.


01:52.758 --> 02:00.000
Do it with true impartiality.
That’s what it means to love.


02:11.402 --> 02:20.757
Some people don’t have what we have.
It’s up to us to share.


02:20.757 --> 02:29.865
Disaster strikes, then they’re without.
Will we really care?


02:29.865 --> 02:38.875
Could we open up our home 
and host a friend in need?


02:38.875 --> 02:41.265
Do a kindly deed.


02:41.265 --> 02:51.607
“Follow the course of hospitality.”
Imitate God above.


02:51.607 --> 03:00.617
Do it with true impartiality.
That’s what it means to love.


03:00.617 --> 03:20.159
That’s what it means to love.
That’s what it means to love.

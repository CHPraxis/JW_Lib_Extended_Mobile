00:09 Caught up in circles. I don’t know which way to turn.
00:18 My heart rules; Had my head fooled.
00:23 Too late, I’ve fallen in love. To do what’s right
00:29 Is a constant fight. Don’t want to let my heart decide.
00:37 I want God’s Word to be my guide. It’s so hard to break free.
00:50 This desperate heart inside of me Makes wrong feel right and right feel wrong,
00:59 But Jehovah makes me strong. He says: “Know that I love you.
01:08 “I don’t want to lose you. Trust in me in all you do.
01:18 I’ll be here to help you through.”
01:24 Our life is shaped by the choice we make. We have to realize what’s at stake.
01:34 Right from the start,  it’s a war for our heart,
01:38 But it’s ours to give away. To safeguard it means our life.
01:56 Looking back, the choice I made To do things Jehovah’s way
02:05 Seemed so hard, emotion’s strong, But Jehovah helped me along.

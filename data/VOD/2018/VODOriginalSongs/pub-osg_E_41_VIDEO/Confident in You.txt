00:07 Like a tree planted in the ground,  Your words have sunk deep down
00:17 Into my heart and soothed my mind  with gentle thoughts of peace.
00:28 ’Cause no matter what may come,  With this wisdom from above,
00:38 I always have these truths  to keep reminding me to
00:47 Go on; don’t be afraid.  Hold on to what Jehovah says.
00:58 Through all the storms, your words have  Given me strength to endure.
01:08 And every day I am more  confident in you.
01:24 When this world tries to pull me down,  To give up on what I’ve found,
01:35 I turn to you and know that you  are always there.
01:45 It takes time to meditate—  Get the words from off the page
01:55 And in my heart so they can help  and guide me to
02:04 Go on; don’t be afraid.  Hold on to what Jehovah says.
02:14 Look beyond any adversity.  Focus on the things that I can’t see.
02:26 Through all the storms, your words have  Given me strength to endure.
02:36 And every day I am more  confident in you—
02:48 In you.
03:03 Go on; don’t be afraid.  Hold on to what Jehovah says.
03:14 Look beyond any adversity.  Focus on the things that I can’t see.
03:25 Through all the storms, your words have  Given me strength to endure.
03:35 And every day I am more  confident in you.

00:10 Now everyone, it seems to me, Knows just the place he wants to be.
00:20 I know what’s right; I know what’s wrong; And, yes, I know where I belong.
00:29 It feels so good, so good to know Where I should be, where I should go
00:39 To find good friends and company Who build me up and care for me.
00:49 Yes, here in my heart  The feelings are strong.
00:59 Jehovah, it’s you  Who’ll help me get through
01:09 And show me where I belong.
01:23 My heart is sure, it’s clear to me, I’m standing where I want to be.
01:33 I read God’s Word. I make it live. It moves my heart. What can I give?
01:43 And now I know; yes, now I see Where real friends are; that’s where I’ll be.
01:53 They’re all I want; they’re family; Jehovah’s gift with love to me.
02:02 Yes, here in my heart The feelings are strong.
02:12 Jehovah, it’s you Who’ll help me get through
02:22 And show me where I belong.

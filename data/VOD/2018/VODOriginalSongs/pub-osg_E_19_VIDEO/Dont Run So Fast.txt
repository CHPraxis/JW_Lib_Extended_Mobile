00:07 You can walk, but please don’t run. It’s hard to do when you’re having fun.
00:16 But there’s a reason we don’t race; When you’re with the friends,
00:22 It’s not the time or place.
00:26 Don’t run so fast. Take your time and make things last.
00:41 Learn to love the things you do. Just don’t run fast.
00:53 You’ve got things you have to do, People to serve, who depend on you.
01:03 But don’t forget why you’re here; Learn to love the friends;
01:09 Let them know you care.
01:13 Don’t run so fast. Take your time and make things last.
01:28 Learn to love the things you do. Just don’t run fast.
01:40 You can run to someone’s door. Is there someone home?
01:48 Well, you’re not real sure. But look around and see everyone,
01:54 People walking by. Can you talk to one?
02:01 Don’t run so fast. Take your time and make things last.
02:16 Learn to love the things you do. Just don’t run fast.
02:28 Oh. Just don’t run fast!

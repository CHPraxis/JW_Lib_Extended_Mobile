00:00:20 ‎We heard the words ‘seek and you’ll find’ The very priceless pearl of truth.
00:00:32 ‎It was a sea of doubts and questions to God That the search would take us through.
00:00:44 ‎But we carried on with our sails unfurled.
00:00:51 ‎Like merchants on a quest,  we knew that truth was out there.
00:01:02 ‎The search—the search for the key To answer all the things,
00:01:10 ‎Things that we fight to understand:
00:01:16 ‎The origin of man, wondering why we need  God’s Kingdom soon to come.
00:01:28 ‎Searching hard to find.
00:01:31 ‎We had never known God had a name. Jehovah is the one to call on.
00:01:43 ‎When we were shown, we found a piece Of what we were searching for.
00:01:55 ‎And we carried on with our sails unfurled,
00:02:01 ‎Finding truths about where we came from  and where we’re heading.
00:02:13 ‎The search—the search for the key That answered all the things,
00:02:20 ‎Things that we fought to understand:
00:02:27 ‎The origin of man, a paradise that’s promised  in God’s Kingdom soon to come.
00:02:39 ‎Search and you will find.
00:02:43 ‎Now we can never hold back  when others are searching
00:02:49 ‎For the priceless pearl of truth, Sailing a sea of unanswered questions.
00:03:01 ‎So we help them to get through, And we share what we’ve discovered.
00:03:36 ‎The search—the search for the key To answer all the things,
00:03:44 ‎Things that they fight to understand:
00:03:50 ‎The origin of man, living forever in God’s Kingdom soon to come.
00:04:04 ‎Search and you will find.

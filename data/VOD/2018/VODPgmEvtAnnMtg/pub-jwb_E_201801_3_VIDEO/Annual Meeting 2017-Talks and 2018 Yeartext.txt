00:01 What is next on our program?
00:06 Well, we have five talks
00:09 that are going to be given  by five members of the Governing Body.
00:13 Now, as you listen to these talks,
00:16 one of them is going to reveal to us  some adjusted understanding;
00:22 another is going to tell us  about the yeartext for next year.
00:27 Other talks are going to motivate us,
00:30 and then another talk
00:32 is going to show  a change in our ministry.
00:38 Have I got your attention?
00:41 Well, to start off  this intriguing series of talks,
00:45 we’re going to invite  Brother David Splane
00:48 to talk to us on this intriguing title,
00:50 “Ezekiel’s Temple Vision and You!”
01:07 Well,
01:09 did you enjoy your tour?
01:15 Not your tour of Warwick,  Wallkill, Patterson,
01:22 but did you enjoy the tour  that we recently made
01:26 of the temple  that we’ve been reading about
01:30 in the book of Ezekiel?
01:34 Now, that was quite a tour.
01:37 Could you imagine that we were transported
01:41 onto an extremely high mountain,
01:44 and we were given a vision
01:46 of an imposing temple complex?
01:51 And we had quite a tour guide —didn’t we?—
01:53 an angel
01:56 whose appearance was of copper,
01:59 and he showed us some wonderful things.
02:03 Well, it’s all very interesting.
02:06 But what does it mean?
02:10 Now, for many years,  our publications have stated
02:13 that the temple that Ezekiel saw
02:16 was Jehovah’s great spiritual temple,
02:20 and we came to that conclusion  because there are, admittedly,
02:24 some similarities between the tabernacle
02:28 that Moses was connected with
02:31 and the temple of Ezekiel.
02:33 And so the thought was  that the temple of Ezekiel
02:37 and the tabernacle  represented the same thing.
02:40 We know that the tabernacle  represents the spiritual temple
02:45 because the apostle Paul said so.
02:47 Well, it’s true that there are similarities
02:50 between the tabernacle and Ezekiel’s temple,
02:55 but there are major differences as well.
02:59 The tabernacle
03:02 really focuses on the high priest
03:05 and the sacrifice that he made  on the Day of Atonement.
03:09 So we can say that the tabernacle
03:14 is really centered on the future work
03:16 that Jesus was going to do  as the great High Priest
03:20 and the sacrifice that he was going to make.
03:24 Now, what about the temple that Ezekiel saw?
03:29 Is there a high priest?
03:31 No.
03:33 What about the Day of Atonement?
03:35 Is the Day of Atonement mentioned?
03:37 No, it is not.
03:39 So we can see that there are differences
03:43 between the tabernacle
03:46 and the temple of Ezekiel.
03:49 Now, right up front, let’s be clear;
03:52 Ezekiel was not touring
03:56 the spiritual temple.
03:59 Let’s see why not.
04:01 But first, let’s review what Brother Lösch  told us about the spiritual temple.
04:06 What is it?
04:07 Now, Brother Lösch  said that it’s an arrangement.
04:10 But he didn’t stop there, did he?
04:13 He said,  “It’s an arrangement for worship
04:17 based on the sacrifice of Christ.”
04:23 Now, what do we know  about the sacrifice of Christ?
04:25 Let’s take the Bible  and turn to Hebrews chapter 9,
04:34 Hebrews chapter 9,
04:36 and we’re going to read verses 11 and 12
04:40 —Hebrews 9:11, 12.
04:44 Paul writes:
04:46 “However,  when Christ came as a high priest
04:51 of the good things  that have already taken place.”
04:55 So the spiritual temple  was actually in existence
04:59 in Jesus’ day
05:01 because these things  had “already taken place.”
05:04 “He passed through the greater  and more perfect tent
05:07 “not made with hands,  that is, not of this creation.
05:11 “He entered into the holy place,
05:13 “not [not] with the blood
05:17 “of goats and of young bulls,
05:19 “but with his own blood,
05:21 once for all time.”
05:24 So, what do we learn from this?
05:26 Well, we learn  that Jesus’ sacrifice was offered
05:29 “once for all time”
05:31 and that the blood of bulls and goats  doesn’t enter the picture.
05:36 One sacrifice —and that’s enough.
05:39 After that,  there are no grain offerings,
05:43 there are no guilt offerings,
05:45 there are no whole burnt offerings,
05:49 and there are no sin offerings,
05:51 because that one sacrifice  of Christ is enough.
05:56 The spiritual temple is centered  around the sacrifice of Christ.
06:02 Now, what did we see  when we toured Ezekiel’s temple?
06:06 Grain offerings, sin offerings,
06:10 guilt offerings,  the blood of bulls and goats,
06:14 and even purification for the priests,
06:19 who don’t at all seem  to have been declared righteous
06:21 by means of their faith  in the blood of Christ.
06:25 So we can see that there’s something  different about Ezekiel’s temple,
06:30 and really, Ezekiel and Paul  cover different ground.
06:34 So if you’re taking notes,
06:37 this is the time to make a little note.
06:40 From Paul
06:43 we learn about Jehovah’s  arrangement for worship.
06:49 From Ezekiel we learn about Jehovah’s,
06:54 wait for it,
06:57 Jehovah’s standard for worship.
07:01 From Ezekiel we learn
07:03 about Jehovah’s standard for worship.
07:07 Now, what do we learn  about Jehovah’s standards
07:09 from those nine chapters of Ezekiel?
07:12 Well, He has high standards;
07:15 He has very high standards. Now, think about it.
07:18 Where was Ezekiel’s temple located?
07:21 Was it located  on a mountain of average height,
07:24 Mount Moriah maybe  or the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem?
07:28 No,
07:30 it was located  “on a very high mountain.”
07:36 A temple  “on a very high mountain”
07:39 —a house of Jehovah
07:43 “on a very high mountain”
07:45 —maybe even above the tops  of the mountains.
07:50 Where have I heard about that before?
07:52 Didn’t I read something  about that somewhere in the Bible?
07:55 Yes, Isaiah 2:2.
07:59 Let’s read it
08:07 —Isaiah 2:2.
08:10 It says:  “In the final part of the days.”
08:14 That doesn’t sound like 29 C.E.,  does it?
08:18 “In the final part of the days,
08:20 “the mountain of the house of Jehovah
08:22 “will become firmly established  above the top of the mountains,
08:26 “and it will be raised up above the hills,
08:29 and to it all the nations will stream.”
08:33 Well, now, that prophecy  helps us to understand
08:37 when Ezekiel’s temple vision
08:39 finds its major fulfillment
08:42 —not in 29 C.E.
08:45 when we first see  the spiritual temple take shape,
08:49 but “in the final part of the days.”
08:52 Now, what is it that is
08:56 “firmly established  above the top of the mountains”?
08:59 We know the answer to that.
09:01 It’s Jehovah’s worship, isn’t it?
09:03 And so Jehovah’s worship is established
09:05 “above the top of the mountains”  “in the final part of the days.”
09:08 So Ezekiel’s temple vision must be fulfilled
09:13 “in the final part of the days,”  not in 29 C.E.
09:18 Now, the mountain that Ezekiel saw  is not the only thing that’s elevated.
09:22 There are gates leading to the temple area,
09:26 and you know, those gates  are some 100 feet (30 m) tall.
09:30 And there are guard chambers  at the entryways
09:34 so that no unclean person can come in.
09:37 Why?
09:39 Because Jehovah’s high standards of morality
09:43 must be respected.
09:46 Now, there’s another striking feature  of Ezekiel’s temple.
09:50 There was a wall around the entire perimeter,
09:54 the entire temple area.
09:56 Now, each side was almost a mile  (1.6 km) long,
09:58 but the temple itself was only  about 850 feet (260 m) to a side.
10:02 So you have  the little temple area, relatively,
10:05 and then you have  this great expanse all around.
10:08 We have a picture.
10:10 Maybe this will give us an idea.
10:12 Do you see the temple in the middle there
10:14 and then that wide perimeter
10:16 and the wall around the temple?
10:18 Why?
10:20 Jehovah answered at Ezekiel 43:9:
10:24 “Let them put  their spiritual prostitution . . .
10:28 far away from me.”
10:32 Now, someone who was familiar
10:34 with the layout of ancient Jerusalem
10:37 would understand this because,
10:39 really, there was only a wall that separated
10:41 the temple in Jerusalem  from ordinary housing.
10:45 So as the people began to worship idols
10:47 and they brought immorality  and all kinds of horrible things
10:51 into their homes,
10:53 they were actually bringing this  right up against the wall of the temple.
10:56 So Jehovah God is saying: “No more!
10:59 “Enough!
11:00 I want to keep it far away from me.”
11:04 Now, Ezekiel’s temple vision has a major
11:07 and a minor fulfillment.
11:09 So we’ll talk  about the minor fulfillment for a moment.
11:12 In chapter 8,
11:14 Ezekiel described conditions that prevailed
11:17 when the temple of Solomon was functioning:
11:20 Seventy men offering incense
11:22 to “creeping things and loathsome beasts,”
11:26 “25 men . . . bowing down to the sun,”
11:29 ‘women weeping for the god Tammuz.’
11:33 But to his great relief,
11:35 Ezekiel sees none of that  in his temple vision.
11:40 Instead, he sees pure worship  being carried on in the way
11:44 that he would have understood
11:46 and that would have had  Jehovah’s approval back then.
11:48 So after the Jews were released
11:52 from Babylonian captivity,
11:54 they would be able  to worship Jehovah acceptably.
11:59 After the Jews were released  from Babylonian captivity,
12:04 they would be able  to restore pure worship
12:09 in the way that Jehovah approved.
12:11 But now, the title of this talk is
12:13 “Ezekiel’s Temple . . . and You!”
12:17 So where do we fit into the picture?
12:20 Well, it’s simple.
12:22 We are living in the time of the fulfillment
12:27 of Ezekiel’s temple vision.
12:30 And in the major fulfillment,
12:32 we find that true worship has been restored.
12:35 Since when?
12:37 Well, since when in particular  has “the mountain of the house of Jehovah”
12:40 been ‘lifted up above the tops  of the mountains’?
12:43 Since 1919.
12:48 What a coincidence —because in 1919,
12:52 Jehovah’s people were also freed  from captivity to Babylon the Great!
12:57 And so after being freed  from captivity to Babylon the Great,
13:01 now we see an improvement  in pure worship
13:04 —getting better and better.
13:07 And since that time,  Jehovah has progressively guided us
13:11 to adopt his high standards.
13:14 Now think about his high moral standards.
13:17 Nobody is admitted
13:20 to a permanent association  with the organization
13:23 until they have the approval of the elders
13:26 —until the elders say,  “Yes, they are acceptable.”
13:30 Now, I think back 65 years ago  when I started publishing,
13:35 and I know that many of you
13:37 have been publishers a lot longer than that.
13:40 But I can remember back
65 years ago when I started to publish,
13:44 and I just turned in a report;
13:46 nobody asked me any questions.
13:48 You didn’t have to be approved.
13:50 When you got baptized, you didn’t go through  the questions with the elders;
13:54 there were no elders.
13:57 No more, no more.
14:00 We can see how Jehovah  has progressively raised the standard.
14:05 And what about unrepentant wrongdoers?
14:08 They’re not allowed  to remain in the congregation
14:10 —that wasn’t always the case.
14:13 So we can see how Jehovah God  has been progressively guiding us,
14:17 leading us, to a better  and better relationship with him.
14:22 Now, he’s also cleansed  his people spiritually.
14:25 Think about what’s happened since 1919
14:28 —how Jehovah’s people have worked hard
14:30 to keep spiritual uncleanness  far away from pure worship,
14:35 casting off false doctrines and practices
14:38 tainted with idolatry and paganism.
14:41 And what has been the result?
14:43 Jehovah has blessed his people,
14:47 and there is tangible proof of that blessing.
14:50 Nations are streaming  to “the mountain of the house of Jehovah,”
14:54 and they come because they have heard
14:56 that God is with his people.
14:59 So, what have we learned  from this brief discussion?
15:03 This:
15:05 While the spiritual temple  is Jehovah’s arrangement for worship,
15:10 Ezekiel’s temple emphasizes
15:13 God’s standards for worship.
15:17 And what else have we learned?
15:19 This:
15:20 We see the arrangement  of the spiritual temple
15:23 since 29 C.E.,
15:25 but we see the fulfillment  Ezekiel’s temple vision
15:30 since 1919.
15:35 Well, we’re grateful  to our angelic tour guide
15:39 for the remarkable visit  that we’ve had to the temple.
15:42 But we’re also more grateful to Jehovah God
15:45 for helping us to see
15:47 what that remarkable vision
15:50 means for you and for me today.
16:05 We want to thank you very much,  Brother Splane,
16:07 for such a clear explanation.
16:10 And clear as it was,  we’re all looking forward to the replay
16:13 —aren’t we?— so that we can get all those details,
16:17 because that was a very interesting  and exciting discussion.
16:21 Well, next on our program,
16:23 Brother Mark Sanderson of the Governing Body
16:25 is going to talk to us  on this interesting theme,
16:28 “Never Ever Lose Hope.”
16:33 Hope is absolutely essential
16:38 to our strength as Christians.
16:41 No hope equals no power.
16:46 Proverbs 18:14 says:
16:50 “A person’s spirit
16:52 “can sustain him through illness,
16:55 but who can bear a crushed spirit?”
16:58 Or if you look at the footnote:
17:00 “Who can bear complete despair?”
17:04 What’s the point?
17:06 No hope equals no power.
17:11 But then there’s also
17:13 low hope equals low power.
17:16 Proverbs 24:10 says:
17:20 “If you become discouraged  in the day of distress,
17:24 your strength will be meager.”
17:27 Low hope equals low power.
17:31 Well, immediately we see
17:33 why it is so important for us as Christians
17:37 that we never ever lose hope.
17:41 Hebrews 6:19 says
17:44 that ‘hope is the anchor of our souls’
17:48 or, the footnote, ‘the anchor of our lives.’
17:52 But now, brothers, what is hope?
17:54 That’s a word we use all the time,  but what does it really mean?
17:58 The original-language words  that are used in the Bible
18:01 that are translated “hope”
18:03 mean to wait eagerly
18:06 and to expect good.
18:08 So hope is not simply
18:11 the desire for something good.
18:14 It also includes the basis
18:17 for believing that that good thing  is going to come.
18:21 Now let’s look at an illustration:
18:25 We might wish that a friend  would come to our aid
18:29 and help us during a time of trial.
18:32 But now, what if that friend
18:34 had helped us many, many times before?
18:38 Well, now it changes, doesn’t it?
18:40 Now our hope is not simply wishful thinking.
18:44 There is a real reason to believe
18:47 that that friend will help us.
18:50 You see, that is real hope,
18:52 not just the desire for something good,
18:55 but the real basis to believe  that we can receive it.
19:01 Well now, brothers,  what could cause us
19:04 to begin to lose hope?
19:06 Well, I don’t think I need to tell you this,
19:09 but life in this system  is certainly not trouble-free.
19:13 Were you aware of that?
19:16 Most of us, we recognize
19:18 that our physical bodies are breaking down.
19:21 If you’re over 50,
19:23 no doubt you’ve had to learn a new alphabet:
19:26 EKG, MRI,
19:29 HDL, LDL,
19:32 and the list goes on and on.
19:34 If you don’t know what that means,
19:37 well, OK, I give up.
19:40 But in addition
19:42 to our own health problems  and challenges,
19:45 we have to cope  with the health problems
19:48 of our close relatives or perhaps our marriage mate,
19:51 our elderly parents,  or whatever it may be.
19:55 And in addition to that,
19:57 we also have to cope  with the loss
19:59 of some of our very dear  loved ones in death.
20:02 What if you live in Venezuela?
20:05 Because of the unrest in that country,
20:08 the reports that we have received
20:11 as of August 10 indicate that 47,
20:15 47 of our brothers and sisters
20:18 have been murdered in that land.
20:21 And many more have been victims
20:23 of other terrible criminal acts.
20:27 Our hearts go out  to our brothers in Venezuela.
20:31 What if you live in Texas  or Mexico or the Caribbean?
20:35 Well, you know that they have just had  devastating natural disasters.
20:40 Some of our brothers have lost their homes,  their places of worship,
20:43 as well as virtually  all of their material things.
20:47 What if you live in Russia?
20:50 In that land, 175,000 of our brothers
20:54 can now no longer worship  Jehovah in freedom.
20:58 Well, if we were to continue to focus
21:01 our attention on all  of these negative things,
21:03 this would not be the Kingdom Hall;  it would be the Wailing Wall.
21:07 Isn’t that true?
21:09 But I have to tell you, brothers,
21:12 that is not the spirit of Jehovah’s people.
21:16 That is not the spirit in the room right now.
21:20 It is not the spirit of God’s people
21:23 anywhere on the face of this earth.
21:26 Despite all of the challenges  that we are experiencing,
21:30 we do not give up!
21:33 Do you agree?
21:46 Now, why is this the case?
21:49 Isaiah chapter 40 has the answer for us.
21:53 Now let’s begin reading here in verse 26.
21:58 The prophet encourages us to look up.
22:00 It says:  “Lift up your eyes to heaven and see.
22:04 “Who has created these things?
22:07 “It is the One who brings out  their army by number;
22:11 “he calls them all by name.
22:14 “Because of his vast dynamic energy
22:17 “and his awe-inspiring power,
22:19 not one of them is missing.”
22:22 Well, what’s the point?
22:24 You see, the Source of our hope,
22:27 the One we put our confidence in —Jehovah—
22:30 has “vast dynamic energy”;
22:33 he has “awe-inspiring power.”
22:36 Look at verse 28:  “Do you not know?
22:39 “Have you not heard?
22:41 “Jehovah,  the Creator of the ends of the earth,
22:44 “is a God for all eternity.
22:46 “He never tires out or grows weary.
22:50 His understanding is unsearchable.”
22:53 Yes, Jehovah is the ultimate  Power Source in the universe.
22:58 He never grows tired;  he never grows weary.
23:02 But now, how do we benefit?
23:05 Because we put our hope in him.
23:08 Well, look at what verse 29 says:
23:10 “He gives power to the tired one
23:14 and full might to those lacking strength.”
23:18 Well, now, is this something
23:20 that we can connect somehow  to our physical power?
23:23 In other words,  that somehow Jehovah
23:26 invigorates our own physical bodies?
23:29 Well, not really,  because look at verse 30, at what it says:
23:32 “Boys will tire out and grow weary,
23:36 and young men will stumble and fall.”
23:39 So this help from Jehovah  is not connected to our physical strength.
23:44 It’s not connected to our age  or our physical power.
23:48 What really, then,
23:50 is the key to our gaining this power
23:54 from this unlimited  Power Source that is Jehovah?
23:58 Well, verse 31:
24:02 “But those hoping in Jehovah
24:05 will regain power.”
24:08 Well, now, that’s an interesting expression.
24:11 Problems, pressures, persecution,
24:16 ban, imprisonment, natural disaster
24:20 —the list goes on and on and on.
24:22 If we focus our attention
24:25 on all of these problems and difficulties,  what happens?
24:29 We just feel our battery  being completely drained
24:33 —we lose all of our power.
24:36 But what happens when we turn our attention
24:40 to our magnificent God, Jehovah?
24:43 What happens when we remember
24:46 how much Jehovah loves us?
24:48 What happens when we remember
24:50 how many times Jehovah has come through
24:54 and given us exactly what we need
24:56 exactly at the right time?
24:58 We immediately, as verse 31 says,
25:02 we immediately begin to “regain power.”
25:05 We feel it coming back into us.
25:08 And although we may have been like a tree
25:11 that has lost its leaves and just looks  like it’s dead, what happens?
25:14 Well, we put forth new shoots,
25:17 and we begin to come back to life
25:20 because of the power  that’s coming from Jehovah.
25:24 Well, as a result,  what does the end of the verse say?
25:26 “They will soar on wings like eagles.
25:30 “They will run and not grow weary;
25:34 they will walk and not tire out.”
25:38 Brothers, what’s the point?
25:40 No hope, no power;
25:44 low hope, low power;
25:47 hope in Jehovah, unlimited power!
25:52 Would you agree?
26:01 When we hope in Jehovah,
26:04 we can walk, we can run,
26:06 we can fly, we can even soar
26:09 if we never ever lose hope in Jehovah.
26:14 Now, brothers, I want to tell you,
26:16 this is not pop psychology.
26:19 This is not the power of positive thinking.
26:23 Wherever I go on this beautiful earth
26:26 and I have the opportunity  to meet Jehovah’s people,
26:29 I have seen with my own eyes
26:32 how Jehovah is renewing
26:34 the power of his people.
26:36 They are never conquered
26:39 by the situations they are facing.
26:41 The power from Jehovah
26:43 is helping them to remain firm.
26:46 What about our dear brothers in Venezuela?
26:49 Despite the many problems and pressures
26:52 that have come  upon our brothers in that land
26:54 due to the unrest that’s occurring,
26:57 did you know that in 2014
27:00 there were 26,252 regular pioneers in that land
27:05 but this year in May of 2017,
27:09 in the midst of all of these problems  that are occurring in that country,
27:13 they recorded an all-time peak  in regular pioneers
27:18 —34,353,
27:21 an increase of more than 8,000?
27:23 What do you think of that?
27:35 Those dear brothers are not accomplishing  that in their own strength.
27:39 They’re hoping in Jehovah,
27:42 and they’re renewing  or regaining their power.
27:45 What about those brothers  in the disaster relief areas?
27:48 Do you remember what Brother Breaux said
27:50 in the report on JW Broadcasting
27:53 about our brothers on the island of Tortola?
27:56 Their Kingdom Hall,  which they had been using for decades,
28:00 was destroyed, rendered unusable.
28:04 And yet what did the brothers do?
28:06 Every day they went and sat  in the Kingdom Hall parking lot.
28:10 Do you remember that?
28:12 And why?
28:13 Because they knew, they had confidence,
28:16 that this would be the place where the help
28:19 from Jehovah would originate.
28:21 And they were not disappointed.
28:23 Brother Breaux assures me  that now arrangements are being made
28:28 so that that Kingdom Hall is going  to be restored and back up in use
28:31 for the benefit  of our dear brothers in Tortola.
28:35 And what about  those dear brothers and sisters in Russia?
28:40 Well, what did Jehovah do
28:43 to make the spirit  of those brothers and sisters soar,
28:47 even though they were facing  a very, very difficult situation?
28:51 Please watch.
29:18 From elderly people to small children,
29:21 people in every walk of life
29:23 have all wanted  to express themselves in some way
29:26 and tell the authorities in Russia  how they feel
29:29 about this action  on Jehovah’s people worldwide.
29:33 It has had such  a unifying effect on our brotherhood.
29:39 I have no idea what Mr. Putin
29:44 will do when he opens  all these letters,
29:47 not just mine.
29:49 Having written these letters
29:51 shows how the whole organization
29:55 is upholding Jehovah’s sovereignty  in these last days.
30:03 I consider participating in this campaign
30:06 a great privilege.
30:08 Even though we are separated  by language and distance,
30:11 we are united by our love for Jehovah.
30:18 Jehovah’s servants may be considered  as a minority in Russia,
30:22 but we are associated  with a worldwide brotherhood.
30:25 And as a part  of the worldwide brotherhood,
30:28 I wanted to participate  this campaign by writing letters.
30:41 I wrote to the prime minister
30:44 so that he would let  my brothers go to the Kingdom Halls.
30:57 I am sending this letter  to ask the Russian government
31:01 to please allow Jehovah’s Witnesses  and their children
31:04 to worship Jehovah  because they are good.
31:16 “We are hard-pressed in every way,
31:20 “but not cramped beyond movement;
31:22 “we are perplexed,
31:25 “but not absolutely with no way out;
31:27 “we are persecuted, but not abandoned;
31:31 “we are knocked down,
31:33 but not destroyed.”
31:44 Brothers and sisters,  we do not know
31:48 what challenges await us in 2018.
31:51 However, we do know
31:54 that if we never ever lose hope in Jehovah,
31:59 we “will regain power.”
32:01 How appropriate, then,
32:03 that the Governing Body has chosen
32:05 for our 2018 yeartext
32:09 Isaiah 40:31:
32:13 “Those hoping in Jehovah will regain power.”
32:29 Yes, dear brothers and sisters,
32:31 we will always have access
32:34 to the ultimate Power Supply in the universe
32:37 if we never ever lose hope
32:41 in our magnificent,  our wonderful God, Jehovah.
32:53 Thank you very much, Brother Sanderson,
32:55 and we look forward to seeing that yeartext
32:58 continue to remind us of the need of hope.
33:00 Next on our program,
33:02 we have Brother Samuel Herd  of the Governing Body,
33:05 and we notice his title is
33:07 “Protected by Obedience.”
33:16 During this talk  if you should happen to hear
33:20 a new spiritual gem,  put it out of your mind.
33:25 I have nothing new to give you.
33:35 A mother deer parks  her baby fawn in tall grass.
33:40 She tells her baby to stay put,
33:44 and it does.
33:46 She leaves and does not return  for many hours.
33:50 In fact, its protection  depends on its obedience
33:54 to its mother’s command.
33:57 Now think back  when you were small children.
34:01 Didn’t your parents  lay down some commands
34:04 for you to follow  for your protection?
34:07 Let’s take a look at something.
34:09 Let’s go to Ephesians in our Bibles,
34:13 and let’s look at the sixth chapter
34:17 and a couple of the verses.
34:19 It says:  “Children, be obedient to your parents
34:23 “in union with the Lord,  for this is righteous.
34:27 “‘Honor your father and your mother’
34:32 “is the first command with a promise:
34:35 “That it may go well with you
34:37 and you may remain  a long time on the earth.’”
34:43 Now, all of us as adults
34:47 are children  under our heavenly Father, Jehovah.
34:50 And, of course, we’ll always  be children under Jehovah.
34:54 He expects us to be obedient children,
34:57 just like you would expect your child,  if you should have one,
35:01 to be obedient to you  and your suggestions
35:05 and perhaps some of your commands.
35:09 And when we are subjected  to Jehovah to this degree,
35:12 we’re protected.
35:14 And just as the scripture said for the small children,
35:17 it applies to us as well:
35:19 “That it may go well with you.”
35:22 And we want it to go well with us.
35:24 That’s what we’re all about.
35:26 We want to serve Jehovah  loyally and faithfully
35:30 so that we can gain his “well done.”
35:32 And just as a child may ask his dad
35:36 “Why?”
35:38 Have you ever  had a child do you that way?
35:40 “Why?
35:42 Why do birds sing?”
35:44 “Why?
35:45 Why is the sky blue?”
35:47 There’s no end to his why’s.
35:51 In fact, you may have answered,
35:55 “Do it because I told you to do it.”
35:59 Your answer was blunt;
36:02 there’s no doubt about that.
36:04 Now, why would you  answer a child bluntly like that?
36:07 Well, it may be because  of what he asked of you.
36:11 What was behind the why?
36:13 Well, he’s just too young;  he’s too young for you to go
36:17 and try to explain the why.
36:20 It may be that this example
36:25 could be a reality:
36:27 Your five-year-old little girl asks,
36:32 “Mommy, why does Jehovah
36:35 let babies die from lack of food?”
36:38 See, the little girl  just heard that on the television set:
36:42 Babies are dying from lack of food.
36:44 Mommy says, “Honey,”
36:47 and puts her arm around her little girl,
36:49 “it has to do with the issue of sovereignty
36:54 that was raised a long time ago.”
37:01 Some of you may have wondered
37:04 about that question
37:07 when you were small.
37:09 Even when you became adults  without a knowledge of the Bible,
37:13 you may have wondered,  ‘Why does God’
37:16 —you didn’t know him by Jehovah—
37:18 ‘Why does God let little children  starve to death?’
37:21 You’ve seen pictures  on television and in the movies
37:24 where a little baby is just  hanging on to his mother’s breast,
37:27 and there’s not a drop of milk  in that mommy’s breast—not one.
37:32 And you may have asked yourself  ‘Why?’
37:34 But now you have the answer to why,
37:37 and you help so many others  to get the answer to why
37:41 —that God is not responsible
37:43 for the deaths of these children,
37:46 but there’s someone else  who is responsible.
37:49 And why has God delayed?
37:51 Well, we all know it’s because of an issue
37:53 that came on the scene years ago,
37:56 and it has to be settled  beyond question
37:59 —and it’s going to be settled  beyond question.
38:02 Think back,  Jehovah told the Israelites
38:04 to impound their source  of water to keep it clean.
38:08 Why?  He didn’t say.
38:11 Harmful germs could be present
38:14 but couldn’t be seen by the naked eye.
38:17 There was no microscope.
38:19 It wasn’t invented until the 1590’s.
38:24 They had to trust and obey for protection.
38:28 And we have to trust Jehovah too,
38:31 even today, for our protection.
38:33 And when we listen to Jehovah,
38:37 then we’re blessed.
38:39 And we want to listen to Jehovah.
38:41 Why?
38:43 Well, there’s a number of reasons:  He’s our Creator;
38:45 he’s our Life-Giver;  he’s our Life-Sustainer.
38:49 If he did not respond  in this loving way,
38:55 none of us would be here —we would expire.
38:58 And we all know that.  So he’s loving.
39:01 Here’s another reason:  He’s lived longer than we have.
39:04 And if we live forever,  we will never catch up
39:07 to how long he has lived.
39:09 He’s been and seen more
39:13 than we have or ever will see.
39:16 He has more experience.
39:18 He has done things  that we have not done
39:23 and perhaps will never  ever be able to do.
39:27 I’d like to tell you a little story  about when I was a young boy.
39:31 We had a little house;  we had a fireplace.
39:36 In wintertime we’d gather  in the living room near the fireplace
39:40 and put coal in the fireplace,  some wood.
39:44 And at times
39:46 a piece of the fire would blow out,
39:51 come out, of the fireplace
39:53 and onto the living room carpet or linoleum.
39:58 And my dad would just pick it up in his hands
40:01 and toss it back in.
40:03 And I thought,  ‘Well, my, that’s a grand thing to do.’
40:06 So the next time it blew out,
40:09 I grabbed ahold of it.
40:12 Never again.
40:15 I learned my lesson.
40:17 Now, my dad’s hands were calloused
40:19 because he was a mule driver,
40:22 and he held on to the reins
40:25 day in and day out  for years upon years.
40:30 And his hands were just like leather,
40:33 and so he knew  that he could hold that coal
40:36 for a short while and get rid of it,  and it would not burn him.
40:40 I did not have that knowledge.
40:42 I had not lived long enough
40:45 to gain that knowledge,  but my dad had.
40:49 You see, my dad was
56 years old when I was born.
40:54 And today,  if he would be here,
40:59 why, then he would be
138 years old.
41:03 So my dad never  was a young dad for me,
41:07 but he was a good dad.
41:09 And, of course, he was a strong man.
41:12 Jehovah created the sun.
41:15 How hot is the sun?
41:17 Well, they tell us at its surface
41:20 it’s 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit,
41:22 or 5,600 degrees Celsius.
41:25 At its core, or center,
41:28 it’s 27 million degrees Fahrenheit,
41:31 or 15 million degrees Celsius.
41:36 A cremation oven
41:38 is only 1,400 degrees  to 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit (760°-982°C)
41:43 in order to turn a body to ashes.
41:48 Now, just for the sake of impressing us  with Jehovah’s greatness—
41:53 Don’t add any real truth to this
41:56 because we do not know;  we only know that he created the sun.
41:59 But just to impress us  with Jehovah’s greatness,
42:02 we can say that he could juggle  the sun in his hands.
42:09 That’s our God, Jehovah.
42:12 New Jerusalem will not need  the sun for light.
42:15 The Bible tells us  “the glory of God illuminate[s] it.”
42:18 —Revelation 21:23.
42:20 When we obey  the direction Jehovah gives,
42:24 we are totally protected.
42:26 That’s why we are not worried  about the great tribulation.
42:31 What we have to worry about  is what comes up
42:35 before the great tribulation,
42:37 and the Devil is going  to do all that he can
42:40 to destroy our relationship with God.
42:42 Now, you can bet on that.
42:44 And he’s going to start with all of us.
42:48 He’s not going to select just individuals,
42:51 but he wants every one of us
42:53 to come over to his side of the issue.
42:56 And so he’s not going  to leave you without test.
42:59 So we’re going to be tested.
43:01 Now, some of you  may have already been tested to the limit.
43:04 We don’t know,  but Jehovah does.
43:06 If you have, well, then you  will not be tested to any other limit.
43:10 You may have a test,  but you’ve proven
43:12 that you will be able to survive that test.
43:16 But right now we need to learn
43:19 to follow the rules that Jehovah lays out.
43:21 The Bible mentions only two roads  for mankind to follow.
43:25 Here they are.
43:27 Matthew 7:13, 14 says:
43:31 “Go in through the narrow gate,  because broad is the gate
43:34 “and spacious is the road  leading off into destruction,
43:37 “and many are going in through it;
43:40 “whereas narrow is the gate  and cramped the road leading off into life,
43:44 and few are finding it.”
43:47 Now, you’re not  on the spacious road,
43:50 not at all;  disobedient travelers are on it
43:54 —those permitted  to do their own thing.
43:57 Innumerable people “dance”
44:00 along this wicked highway.
44:03 But you have chosen the cramped road,
44:07 and that’s the road that Jehovah
44:09 has pointed out for each and every one of us.
44:12 And he’s drawn us to him
44:15 —all because of what he sees in the heart.
44:18 Now, we may not be able to see  what Jehovah sees in the heart,
44:22 and that can work against us  if we’re not careful.
44:26 We can start talking about a brother  because of what we do see.
44:31 But Jehovah overlooks that,  he lets the blood of Jesus cover that.
44:36 And He looks for the good,  and He sees the good.
44:38 And He wants that person to gain life.
44:40 And He’s going to help that person,  even though we can’t see
44:43 the good that Jehovah God sees.
44:47 Now, perhaps in the near future,
44:52 our obedience will be put  to the test as never before.
44:56 Let’s not depend on the strength
44:59 that we have demonstrated in our past tests.
45:02 Neither should we conclude  that we are too spiritual
45:06 or too holy to cower under pressure.
45:10 Now is the time to make obedience a habit;
45:14 don’t wait till the test comes.
45:17 Peter—one of the strongest  of Jesus apostles—
45:21 and the other apostles  ran for their lives
45:25 the night Jesus was arrested.
45:27 But we find that Peter crept back,
45:29 but he stayed at a distance,  a good distance.
45:32 But when questioned,  he began to curse and swear,
45:35 saying: “I do not know  this man of whom you speak!”
45:40 That’s Mark 14:71.
45:43 Now, that’s Peter.
45:45 Are you as strong as Peter?
45:47 Maybe,
45:49 maybe not.
45:51 And it’s that maybe not that we care about.
45:55 So let’s not depend  on how long we’ve been in the truth;
45:59 let’s stay in the truth.
46:01 And the only way we’re going  to do that is to stay with Jehovah.
46:04 He’s helped us  to get his spiritual balance,
46:09 and we want to capture it
46:12 with every ounce of energy  that we possibly can
46:15 so that we do not falter  in any way and fall.
46:20 So thanks to Jehovah and Jesus,  we are here,
46:23 but let’s trust Jehovah 100 percent.
46:26 The Bible tells us:
46:27 “The one trusting in Jehovah  will be protected,”
46:30 and that’s what this talk is all about
46:33 —obedience
46:35 and praying for protection.
46:38 We need help to stay awake spiritually.
46:41 Help comes from our brothers and sisters.
46:44 The Bible says:
46:46 “Consider one another so as  to incite to love and fine works,
46:50 “not forsaking our meeting together,  as some have the custom,
46:55 “but encouraging one another,
46:57 and all the more so  as you see the day drawing near.”
47:00 Now, here’s an example:
47:03 You’re driving a car at night,  and it’s raining.
47:06 You can hear the rain hitting  against the top of the car,
47:10 and you can hear windshield wipers  slapping against the side of the windshield.
47:15 The lights from oncoming cars  are somewhat blinding.
47:19 All these things are sleep-inducing.
47:22 You begin to nod;  you’re about to fall asleep.
47:25 Your wife slaps you!
47:28 She’s sitting in the passenger seat.
47:32 She slaps you.
47:35 You regain control of yourself.
47:38 Aren’t you grateful for the slap?
47:42 She is.
47:47 Every meeting we attend is a slap
47:49 from Someone who loves us  to keep us awake spiritually.
47:53 So be obedient;  be there; be protected.
47:58 Your life depends on it.
48:12 Thank you very much, Brother Herd.
48:15 Now, I don’t know about you, but I got  at least two new points out of that.
48:18 I wrote them down
48:20 —don’t be thin-skinned,  and be willing to be slapped.
48:25 Do you know —I love that talk.
48:28 I used to give talks  like that once too,
48:34 and then they made me the chairman.
48:41 I’m sorry, Brother Herd,  I had to wait 12 months to say that.

WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:04.420
Well, now we look forward 
to the next speaker. 


00:04.420 --> 00:06.422
This is Brother Stephen Lett, 


00:06.422 --> 00:07.890
also of the Governing Body. 


00:07.890 --> 00:10.127
He gives us the theme here: 


00:10.127 --> 00:14.000
“Never Give Up Much for Little.”


00:22.272 --> 00:27.110
Jesus gave a parable about a young man 


00:27.110 --> 00:30.847
who exchanged peace and prosperity 


00:30.847 --> 00:32.915
in his father’s household 


00:32.915 --> 00:37.420
for a debauched, miserable, desperate life. 


00:37.420 --> 00:39.522
Foolishly 


00:39.522 --> 00:43.292
he exchanged much for little. 


00:43.292 --> 00:47.597
It’s the story of the prodigal son, 
Luke chapter 15. 


00:47.597 --> 00:50.700
In contrast, in Matthew chapter 13, 


00:50.700 --> 00:54.970
Jesus gave a story about a traveling merchant 


00:54.970 --> 00:57.907
who sold everything he had 


00:57.907 --> 01:01.277
to buy one pearl of high value. 


01:01.277 --> 01:04.580
When we understand 
the meaning of that parable, 


01:04.580 --> 01:06.582
in actuality 


01:06.582 --> 01:09.819
he exchanged a little for much. 


01:09.818 --> 01:12.555
Now, obviously you brothers and sisters 


01:12.555 --> 01:15.892
do not want to imitate the prodigal son. 


01:15.892 --> 01:18.829
You want to imitate the traveling merchant, 


01:18.828 --> 01:22.031
and Jehovah doesn’t want you 


01:22.032 --> 01:25.469
to give away much for little. 


01:25.468 --> 01:28.705
He wants you to give away little for much. 


01:28.705 --> 01:32.475
And Jehovah is anxious to give you this much. 


01:32.475 --> 01:35.545
That’s why he’s recorded parables 


01:35.545 --> 01:37.947
such as the two we just mentioned 


01:37.947 --> 01:41.684
and also real life stories in his Word 


01:41.683 --> 01:46.321
that depict both scenarios 
so that we can be wise. 


01:46.322 --> 01:49.392
In fact, let’s briefly discuss 


01:49.392 --> 01:51.895
four Bible examples 


01:51.895 --> 01:55.665
of ones who foolishly 
gave up much for little, 


01:55.665 --> 01:58.000
and then we’ll talk 
about four Bible examples 


01:58.000 --> 02:01.537
of ones 
who gave up little for much.


02:01.537 --> 02:04.540
Our first example: Satan. 


02:04.540 --> 02:07.477
Now, Satan gave up a priceless, 


02:07.477 --> 02:11.347
honored position of trust 
in Jehovah’s service 


02:11.347 --> 02:13.984
that he may have enjoyed 


02:13.983 --> 02:16.920
for aeons of time. 


02:16.920 --> 02:20.457
And what did he receive for what he gave up? 


02:20.457 --> 02:22.859
A relatively short, 


02:22.858 --> 02:25.895
miserable life of independence from Jehovah, 


02:25.895 --> 02:29.165
and ultimately 
he will have earned for himself 


02:29.165 --> 02:31.200
the “lake of fire.” 


02:31.200 --> 02:34.970
We know right now 
that Satan cannot be happy at all. 


02:34.970 --> 02:41.210
Jehovah is described as a “happy God” 
(1 Timothy 1:11); 


02:41.210 --> 02:46.315
Jesus, the happy Potentate 
(1 Timothy 6:15); 


02:46.315 --> 02:52.255
“happy is the nation whose God is Jehovah” 
(Psalm 33:12), 


02:52.255 --> 02:56.158
but Satan is never described 
as anything close to happy, is he? 


02:56.158 --> 03:00.763
He’s described as an enraged roaring lion, 


03:00.763 --> 03:05.033
an accuser who accuses day and night, 


03:05.033 --> 03:08.571
one who has great anger 
because he knows his time is short. 


03:08.572 --> 03:11.274
Does that sound like a happy person? 


03:11.273 --> 03:14.310
But what caused Satan 


03:14.310 --> 03:17.113
to give up so much for so little? 


03:17.113 --> 03:19.115
Pride. 


03:19.115 --> 03:21.750
Pride actually caused him to think 


03:21.750 --> 03:24.287
that he was smarter than Jehovah. 


03:24.287 --> 03:27.724
Can you imagine that the clay 
was smarter than the potter? 


03:27.723 --> 03:30.493
Pride caused him to think 


03:30.493 --> 03:34.130
that life without Jehovah 
would actually be a better life. 


03:34.130 --> 03:37.800
Well, may we never pridefully feel 


03:37.800 --> 03:41.503
that we know better than Jehovah in any area


03:41.503 --> 03:44.340
—for example, 
how to treat disfellowshipped ones, 


03:44.340 --> 03:47.043
the need to avoid bad association, 


03:47.043 --> 03:50.580
marrying only in the Lord are a few examples. 


03:50.580 --> 03:53.783
May we never pridefully feel 


03:53.783 --> 03:58.186
that the so-called freedom 
from Jehovah that the world offers 


03:58.187 --> 04:00.290
will bring happiness. 


04:00.290 --> 04:02.558
Let’s learn from Satan. 


04:02.558 --> 04:05.828
Never allow pride to cause you 


04:05.828 --> 04:09.098
to give up much for little.


04:09.098 --> 04:11.800
Now our second example:
Adam and Eve. 


04:11.800 --> 04:15.638
Satan offered them 
opportunity to be like God, 


04:15.638 --> 04:17.706
his own aspiration. 


04:17.707 --> 04:20.009
And stupidly


04:20.008 --> 04:22.478
—I mean stupidly—


04:22.478 --> 04:26.348
they bought into his hoax. 


04:26.348 --> 04:29.318
They selfishly 


04:29.318 --> 04:32.655
gave up their invaluable family ties 


04:32.655 --> 04:35.057
with the best Father they could ever have. 


04:35.057 --> 04:37.327
They gave up their Paradise home, 


04:37.327 --> 04:39.362
perfect everlasting life, 


04:39.362 --> 04:42.132
their children’s future welfare. 


04:42.132 --> 04:44.567
All for what? 


04:44.567 --> 04:46.902
A relatively short, 


04:46.902 --> 04:49.772
miserable life of independence from Jehovah 


04:49.772 --> 04:52.209
and finally nonexistence


04:52.208 --> 04:54.210
—a total loss. 


04:54.210 --> 04:58.080
What an outstanding example 
of giving up much for little! 


04:58.080 --> 05:01.017
So may we learn from Adam and Eve. 


05:01.017 --> 05:04.354
Never allow Satan’s lies 


05:04.353 --> 05:09.058
to cause you to give up much for little


05:09.058 --> 05:13.061
—lies such as 
“Material things will make you happy” 


05:13.062 --> 05:16.332
or “Immorality will make you happy.” 


05:16.332 --> 05:18.334
Unlike Adam and Eve, 


05:18.333 --> 05:21.203
let’s refuse to allow Satan’s lies 


05:21.203 --> 05:24.440
to cause us to give up much for little.


05:24.440 --> 05:27.377
Esau, our third example, 


05:27.377 --> 05:31.547
knew the history of Satan and Adam and Eve. 


05:31.547 --> 05:33.884
But did he learn from them? 


05:33.883 --> 05:38.053
No, he too lacked appreciation 
for sacred things. 


05:38.053 --> 05:41.090
Esau was Isaac’s firstborn son,


05:41.090 --> 05:43.960
and in Bible times, 
this had great value, 


05:43.960 --> 05:48.630
but he thought only 
of his immediate physical cravings. 


05:48.630 --> 05:51.067
Genesis 25:32 says 


05:51.067 --> 05:53.970
that he became very hungry and cried out: 


05:53.970 --> 05:57.707
“I am about to die!” 


05:57.707 --> 06:00.710
Was he really? 


06:00.710 --> 06:04.113
Should he not have endured 
a little bit longer 


06:04.113 --> 06:06.515
rather than sell his birthright? 


06:06.515 --> 06:09.485
Now pretty quick, he realized his mistake. 


06:09.485 --> 06:11.553
He sold something with real value. 


06:11.553 --> 06:13.555
For what? 


06:13.555 --> 06:15.425
What did he receive? 


06:15.425 --> 06:17.893
Some bread and lentil stew. 


06:17.893 --> 06:20.000
Apparently, this stew 
didn’t even have any meat in it. 


06:24.267 --> 06:27.804
We Bethelites, 


06:27.803 --> 06:30.831
we can get bread, lentils, and meat 


06:30.832 --> 06:34.000
for free in the Bethel pantry. 


06:37.780 --> 06:40.817
What is a lesson that we can learn from Esau? 


06:40.817 --> 06:44.820
Well, open up 
to Hebrews chapter 12, please. 


06:44.820 --> 06:46.988
And here’s a very interesting lesson 


06:46.988 --> 06:49.000
Jehovah teaches us about Esau. 


06:50.493 --> 06:52.828
Hebrews 12:16: 


06:52.828 --> 06:55.798
“And watch that among you 


06:55.798 --> 07:00.703
“there is no one who is sexually immoral 


07:00.703 --> 07:04.973
“nor anyone who does not appreciate 
sacred things, 


07:04.973 --> 07:07.008
“like Esau, 


07:07.008 --> 07:09.911
“who gave up his rights as firstborn 


07:09.912 --> 07:13.082
in exchange for one meal.” 


07:13.082 --> 07:15.117
But, you know, interestingly, 


07:15.117 --> 07:18.454
Jehovah compares a person 
who commits sexual immorality 


07:18.453 --> 07:20.456
to what Esau did. 


07:20.457 --> 07:24.627
And if you think about it, 
both lack self-control 


07:24.627 --> 07:26.762
and give in to fleshly desires. 


07:26.762 --> 07:27.964
That’s what Esau did. 


07:27.963 --> 07:31.000
That’s what a person 
who commits sexual immorality does. 


07:31.000 --> 07:34.770
Well, may none of us allow immorality 


07:34.770 --> 07:38.073
to cause us to sell 
our figurative birthright,


07:38.073 --> 07:40.375
our inheritance in Jehovah’s new world. 


07:40.375 --> 07:42.378
And think about this: 


07:42.378 --> 07:45.681
How long did that bread 
and lentil stew 


07:45.682 --> 07:47.717
last Esau? 


07:47.717 --> 07:49.719
How long did it benefit him? 


07:49.718 --> 07:51.753
A few hours? 


07:51.753 --> 07:53.823
Soon he would have been hungry again. 


07:53.823 --> 07:55.925
Well, similarly, 
how long does 


07:55.925 --> 07:59.062
the so-called pleasure 
of an immoral person last? 


07:59.062 --> 08:03.799
Only a short time 
followed by horrible consequences, 


08:03.798 --> 08:07.101
including a bad conscience.


08:07.102 --> 08:09.139
Now our fourth example: 


08:09.138 --> 08:12.006
the rich young ruler in Jesus’ day. 


08:12.007 --> 08:16.045
He held a high position 
and had many possessions. 


08:16.045 --> 08:18.813
Jesus even felt love for him. 


08:18.813 --> 08:22.050
But was he prepared to give up his wealth 


08:22.050 --> 08:26.255
for something infinitely 
more valuable and permanent, 


08:26.255 --> 08:28.958
the treasure of following Jesus? 


08:28.958 --> 08:30.960
No. 


08:30.960 --> 08:33.495
When Jesus invited him, the Bible says: 


08:33.495 --> 08:36.298
“He went away grieved.” 


08:36.298 --> 08:40.468
He couldn’t bring himself 
to give up his many possessions. 


08:40.468 --> 08:43.505
Instead, he gave up a wonderful future. 


08:43.505 --> 08:46.342
Obviously, he gave up 
the wrong thing, didn’t he? 


08:46.342 --> 08:49.812
Where are those who did follow Jesus now? 


08:49.812 --> 08:52.315
Immortal kings and priests 


08:52.315 --> 08:55.852
with Christ in heaven in Jehovah’s presence. 


08:55.852 --> 08:59.522
But unless that young ruler 
later changed his ways, 


08:59.522 --> 09:04.000
he and all that was his are now dust. 


09:05.127 --> 09:10.032
What a classic example 
of giving up so much for so little! 


09:10.032 --> 09:12.735
May we never allow 


09:12.735 --> 09:17.005
any of the material attractions of this world 


09:17.005 --> 09:20.142
to cause us to give up 
our wonderful future 


09:20.142 --> 09:22.245
in Jehovah’s new world.


09:22.245 --> 09:25.413
Well, we’ve considered 
our four negative examples, 


09:25.413 --> 09:29.118
but now let’s move 
to our four positive examples


09:29.118 --> 09:31.786
—ones who gave up little for much. 


09:31.787 --> 09:33.789
First: Abraham. 


09:33.788 --> 09:35.925
At Jehovah’s invitation, 


09:35.925 --> 09:39.928
Abraham gave up a comfortable life 


09:39.928 --> 09:42.665
in upscale Ur. 


09:42.665 --> 09:45.433
At Jehovah’s invitation, 


09:45.433 --> 09:48.670
he took his family 
on a long, dangerous trek 


09:48.670 --> 09:50.673
to the land of promise, 


09:50.673 --> 09:54.676
and there he willingly 
lived the rest of his life in tents. 


09:54.677 --> 09:58.714
But what did Abraham 
receive for what he gave up? 


09:58.713 --> 10:02.685
He gained a permanent place 
in Jehovah’s heart. 


10:02.685 --> 10:06.755
Jehovah himself called him “my friend.” 


10:06.755 --> 10:09.525
Because of his faith, Jehovah swore 


10:09.525 --> 10:12.160
that through one of his descendants 


10:12.160 --> 10:15.463
all nations would be blessed 


10:15.463 --> 10:18.833
and that descendant
—the Messiah, Jesus—


10:18.833 --> 10:21.770
will soon resurrect Abraham 


10:21.770 --> 10:24.607
to enjoy the real life. 


10:24.607 --> 10:27.042
But now, are we willing 


10:27.042 --> 10:30.279
to give up material possessions and comforts  


10:30.278 --> 10:33.248
in order, for example, 
to enter the full-time ministry? 


10:33.248 --> 10:36.451
Or maybe be able to move 
and serve where the need is greater 


10:36.452 --> 10:38.820
in order to secure 


10:38.820 --> 10:42.325
a permanent place in Jehovah’s heart? 


10:42.325 --> 10:44.327
Like Abraham, 


10:44.327 --> 10:47.930
are we willing to give up little for much?


10:47.930 --> 10:50.833
Our second example: Moses. 


10:50.833 --> 10:53.568
Centuries after Abraham, 


10:53.568 --> 10:56.538
Moses also gave up the right things. 


10:56.538 --> 10:59.308
Raised as royalty 


10:59.308 --> 11:02.310
in Pharaoh’s palace, 


11:02.310 --> 11:05.815
he was groomed for greatness 
in the world of his day. 


11:05.815 --> 11:10.652
He knew all about Egypt’s 
advanced civilization and culture. 


11:10.652 --> 11:14.157
But the Bible doesn’t elaborate on anything


11:14.157 --> 11:17.225
that Moses accomplished in Egypt. 


11:17.225 --> 11:19.228
Why? 


11:19.228 --> 11:21.896
Because anything he may have achieved there 


11:21.897 --> 11:24.534
was utterly insignificant 


11:24.533 --> 11:27.201
compared to what he did 
in Jehovah’s service. 


11:27.202 --> 11:29.472
Moses received the Law 


11:29.472 --> 11:33.009
that led Israel to the Messiah. 


11:33.008 --> 11:36.178
No other prophet knew Jehovah 


11:36.178 --> 11:38.213
“face-to-face.” 


11:38.213 --> 11:42.518
He did well in giving up life in Egypt 


11:42.518 --> 11:45.320
in order to carry out God’s commission. 


11:45.320 --> 11:48.790
As for the wealth and grandeur 
of ancient Egypt, 


11:48.790 --> 11:51.760
we can see crumbling remnants of it 


11:51.760 --> 11:53.762
in museums. 


11:53.762 --> 11:56.932
But Moses gained God’s favor. 


11:56.932 --> 11:58.834
He gained the real life. 


11:58.833 --> 12:03.371
He gained a permanent place 
in our spiritual heritage 


12:03.372 --> 12:07.910
and a permanent place 
in all of our hearts.


12:07.910 --> 12:11.013
Well, let’s go 
to our third example: Jesus


12:11.013 --> 12:14.950
—the best example 
of gaining a lot more than he gave up. 


12:14.950 --> 12:17.385
Like Abraham and Moses, 


12:17.385 --> 12:20.455
he willingly gave up a comfortable life


12:20.455 --> 12:24.560
—now in his case, 
life in heaven alongside Jehovah. 


12:24.560 --> 12:27.730
But he emptied himself, 
became a human, 


12:27.730 --> 12:30.565
ministered to other humans, 


12:30.565 --> 12:33.168
even gave his life 


12:33.168 --> 12:37.606
trusting that Jehovah 
would give life back to him. 


12:37.607 --> 12:40.409
He gained the great joy 


12:40.408 --> 12:44.180
of fulfilling his Father’s righteous purpose 


12:44.180 --> 12:47.850
and redeeming those 
he was especially fond of


12:47.850 --> 12:49.852
—humans. 


12:49.852 --> 12:53.922
If you think about it, 
apparently, Jesus didn’t really realize 


12:53.922 --> 12:57.225
how much he would receive 
for what he gave up. 


12:57.225 --> 12:59.528
Because remember at John 17:5, 


12:59.528 --> 13:02.396
he said: “Father, glorify me . . . 


13:02.397 --> 13:05.700
“with the glory that I had alongside you 


13:05.700 --> 13:07.703
before the world was.” 


13:07.703 --> 13:12.240
In other words: ‘Father, please 
give me back what I had before.’ 


13:12.240 --> 13:15.610
But Jehovah gave him a lot more, didn’t he? 


13:15.610 --> 13:18.747
And that’s always true of Jehovah, 
really, if you think about it. 


13:18.747 --> 13:20.549
You can’t outgive Jehovah. 


13:20.548 --> 13:24.220
Jehovah gave him a name 
more excellent 


13:24.220 --> 13:27.122
than the angels. 


13:27.122 --> 13:30.225
Jehovah gave him all authority 


13:30.225 --> 13:32.260
in heaven and earth. 


13:32.260 --> 13:36.132
He even gave him immortality 


13:36.132 --> 13:39.067
and incorruption. 


13:39.067 --> 13:43.472
And we know that means 
an indestructible life, 


13:43.472 --> 13:48.377
an indestructible organism, or body.


13:48.377 --> 13:50.980
Now a fourth example: 


13:50.980 --> 13:53.982
Jesus’ apostles. 


13:53.982 --> 13:57.285
Peter, Andrew, James, and John 


13:57.285 --> 14:00.488
abandoned their fishing businesses,
didn’t they? 


14:00.488 --> 14:03.958
All the other apostles, 
the Bible says, “left all things.” 


14:03.958 --> 14:06.061
And remember, Peter asked: “Look! 


14:06.062 --> 14:09.399
“We have left all things and followed you; 


14:09.398 --> 14:12.400
what, then, will there be for us?” 


14:12.400 --> 14:14.570
Well, Jesus assured him 


14:14.570 --> 14:17.773
that anyone who gives up material things 


14:17.773 --> 14:20.341
or even family relationships


14:20.342 --> 14:22.912
for him or for the sake 
of the good news


14:22.912 --> 14:26.315
would receive a hundredfold even now. 


14:26.315 --> 14:31.853
If you think about that, 
that’s a 10,000 percent return. 


14:31.853 --> 14:35.523
Plus, he will get everlasting life. 


14:35.523 --> 14:37.025
In fact, think about it. 


14:37.025 --> 14:39.027
Where are these apostles now? 


14:39.027 --> 14:43.932
Like Jesus—immortal, 
incorruptible spirit creatures. 


14:43.932 --> 14:46.202
Open up to Revelation chapter 20, 


14:46.202 --> 14:49.772
and notice what is said about these ones. 


14:49.772 --> 14:52.540
Revelation chapter 20, please, 


14:52.540 --> 14:55.310
and notice verse 6. 


14:55.310 --> 14:59.848
It says: “Happy [notice that word happy] 


14:59.848 --> 15:03.085
“and holy is anyone having part 


15:03.085 --> 15:05.487
“in the first resurrection; 


15:05.487 --> 15:09.592
“over these the second death 
has no authority, 


15:09.592 --> 15:12.762
“but they will be priests 
of God and of the Christ, 


15:12.762 --> 15:16.832
and they will rule as kings 
with him for the 1,000 years.” 


15:16.832 --> 15:19.469
So they’re going to be happy 
in their assignment. 


15:19.468 --> 15:22.003
This is assured in this scripture. 


15:22.003 --> 15:24.540
Why are they going to be so happy? 


15:24.540 --> 15:29.412
Acts 20:35: “There is more happiness 
in giving than . . . receiving.” 


15:29.412 --> 15:33.315
And what an occasion 
the thousand years will be for giving! 


15:33.315 --> 15:35.952
Can you imagine assisting humans 


15:35.952 --> 15:39.020
to transform the entire planet 


15:39.020 --> 15:41.857
into its originally intended condition? 


15:41.857 --> 15:46.362
Imagine working closely 
with the Christ to empty the grave 


15:46.362 --> 15:49.599
and gradually helping humans 


15:49.598 --> 15:51.900
to come to perfection


15:51.900 --> 15:54.470
and then, 
after the thousand years, 


15:54.470 --> 15:56.672
being able to share in the final crushing 


15:56.672 --> 15:59.609
of evil Satan and his wicked demons. 


15:59.608 --> 16:03.311
What happifying work all of this will be! 


16:03.312 --> 16:06.215
But what will be 
their main source of happiness? 


16:06.215 --> 16:10.118
Well, being part of the main instrument, 
the Kingdom,


16:10.118 --> 16:12.320
that Jehovah will use 


16:12.320 --> 16:17.000
to sanctify and vindicate his holy name. 


16:30.605 --> 16:32.640
I thought I’d go ahead and put to work 


16:32.640 --> 16:36.278
that new understanding 
Brother Jackson revealed earlier. 


16:36.278 --> 16:38.313
But it’s true 


16:38.313 --> 16:42.216
to vindicate 
Jehovah’s name, his reputation, 


16:42.217 --> 16:45.287
that will bring 
the greatest happiness to them. 


16:45.287 --> 16:47.289
You can be sure 


16:47.288 --> 16:50.425
that when the apostles 
gave up their little fishing businesses 


16:50.425 --> 16:54.597
and the other apostles 
their worldly pursuits, 


16:54.597 --> 16:57.032
they had no idea 


16:57.032 --> 17:00.502
how much 
they would receive in return.


17:00.502 --> 17:05.107
Well, now we’ve discussed 
Abraham, Moses, Jesus, the apostles. 


17:05.107 --> 17:07.142
And there’s no doubt about it, 


17:07.142 --> 17:10.879
they would all wholeheartedly agree 
that what they gave up 


17:10.878 --> 17:14.683
was very small compared to what they gained. 


17:14.683 --> 17:16.785
Well, what about us? 


17:16.785 --> 17:21.157
We all give up things, don’t we, 
great and small for Jehovah? 


17:21.157 --> 17:24.860
We may give up time, 
energy, money, possessions. 


17:24.860 --> 17:29.197
We may have to give up a little face, 
prestige in this world. 


17:29.197 --> 17:31.467
But we will experience 


17:31.467 --> 17:35.337
what all those good Bible examples did. 


17:35.337 --> 17:40.000
What we get back 
always far outweighs any loss. 


17:41.077 --> 17:43.545
In fact, most of us would probably say 


17:43.545 --> 17:46.515
that we feel like 
we haven’t given up anything. 


17:46.515 --> 17:49.585
We’re receiving, like those men of old, 


17:49.585 --> 17:53.422
a hundred times more now. 


17:53.422 --> 17:57.025
And we are sure to gain life, 


17:57.025 --> 17:59.060
the real life, 


17:59.060 --> 18:04.000
if we never give up much for little.


18:17.012 --> 18:21.317
I’m sure we all totally enjoyed 
that encouragement. 


18:21.317 --> 18:24.920
Well now, at this point, 
you’re probably thinking that we said 


18:24.920 --> 18:29.090
there was an adjusted understanding: 
got that one; 


18:29.090 --> 18:32.393
a lot of encouragement, 
yes; 


18:32.393 --> 18:35.463
then there was the one 
about the yeartext, yes. 


18:35.463 --> 18:37.465
What was the other one? 


18:37.465 --> 18:39.502
Well, we’ve come to the final talk. 


18:39.502 --> 18:43.872
If we don’t get it now, 
it’s not going to come. 


18:43.872 --> 18:48.310
Remember, we said an adjustment 
to the way we do our ministry. 


18:48.310 --> 18:51.680
So with eager anticipation, 
we look forward to hearing 


18:51.680 --> 18:53.682
from Brother Anthony Morris 


18:53.682 --> 18:58.000
who will talk to us about 
“Making Our Blows Count.”


19:09.397 --> 19:13.969
We are involved 
in the greatest preaching campaign 


19:13.968 --> 19:16.505
in all history. 


19:16.505 --> 19:21.042
We publish quality literature 


19:21.042 --> 19:23.412
in 240 lands. 


19:23.412 --> 19:25.147
It’s amazing. 


19:25.147 --> 19:28.584
However, we’re not about seeking praise 


19:28.583 --> 19:31.553
for the quality of our magazines 


19:31.553 --> 19:33.661
or the hundreds of languages 


19:33.662 --> 19:36.090
that we’re translating in. 


19:36.090 --> 19:38.860
What’s our focus? 


19:38.860 --> 19:41.230
Well, we want to imitate 


19:41.230 --> 19:44.198
what the apostle Paul wrote about himself. 


19:44.198 --> 19:48.036
And the Governing Body 
really wants this message 


19:48.037 --> 19:51.474
to be clear to all of God’s people 


19:51.473 --> 19:54.910
who are preachers 
and teachers of the Kingdom. 


19:54.910 --> 19:57.578
So find what I’m referring to 


19:57.578 --> 20:01.000
in 1 Corinthians chapter 9. 


20:06.855 --> 20:09.357
And you’ll remember 


20:09.357 --> 20:13.362
he’s describing 
his pursuit of the prize. 


20:13.362 --> 20:17.132
And it’s quite profound 
when you reflect on it. 


20:17.132 --> 20:19.534
And you’ll see where it fits everyone of us 


20:19.533 --> 20:21.970
that are dedicated to the true God. 


20:21.970 --> 20:24.505
Verse 26: 


20:24.505 --> 20:26.542
“Therefore, 


20:26.542 --> 20:29.979
“the way I am running is not aimlessly; 


20:29.978 --> 20:33.015
“the way I am aiming my blows 


20:33.015 --> 20:38.120
is so as not to be striking the air.” 


20:38.120 --> 20:42.992
So you can picture running aimlessly. 


20:42.992 --> 20:45.660
It’s a waste of time and energy


20:45.660 --> 20:48.530
—striking the air, 


20:48.530 --> 20:53.368
a waste of time and energy. 


20:53.368 --> 20:57.105
So the time left is reduced. 


20:57.105 --> 21:00.875
The end is so close. 


21:00.875 --> 21:04.545
Like I’ve told folks, if you look around 


21:04.545 --> 21:07.983
and you don’t see
how different it is and how close it is, 


21:07.983 --> 21:09.985
you must be in a coma. 


21:09.985 --> 21:11.987
And that’s OK. 


21:11.987 --> 21:14.624
God can bring you out of a coma 


21:14.623 --> 21:17.291
if you were all right before that. 


21:17.292 --> 21:20.129
But the Governing Body is concerned 


21:20.128 --> 21:23.331
that with the limited time 
we have left 


21:23.332 --> 21:27.735
that we make our blows count. 


21:27.735 --> 21:31.407
So to truly make our blows count, 


21:31.407 --> 21:35.544
what should be the focus of our work?


21:35.543 --> 21:39.948
We’re not left without knowing 
how Jehovah thinks. 


21:39.948 --> 21:42.116
It’s been here all along. 


21:42.117 --> 21:45.687
But sometimes we can individually 


21:45.687 --> 21:48.657
and even organizationally get distracted. 


21:48.657 --> 21:51.000
Turn to Acts chapter 13


21:55.263 --> 21:58.733
—Acts chapter 13. 


21:58.733 --> 22:00.868
And they were preaching 
there in the first century, 


22:00.868 --> 22:02.870
and we get some results, 


22:02.870 --> 22:06.442
but we also get God’s thinking on the matter 


22:06.442 --> 22:10.045
and what he wants us to focus on. 


22:10.045 --> 22:13.915
Acts 13:48: 


22:13.915 --> 22:17.918
“When those of the nations 
heard this [this message], 


22:17.918 --> 22:21.590
they began to rejoice 
and to glorify the word of Jehovah.” 


22:21.590 --> 22:23.592
Now notice: 


22:23.592 --> 22:26.862
“All those who were rightly disposed 


22:26.862 --> 22:31.000
for everlasting life became believers.” 


22:33.268 --> 22:35.270
There it is. 


22:35.270 --> 22:39.173
That’s the focus of our work: 


22:39.173 --> 22:44.145
searching for those 
“rightly disposed for everlasting life.” 


22:44.145 --> 22:46.548
It’s not complicated. 


22:46.548 --> 22:51.386
And to try to help somebody 
who’s not rightly disposed, 


22:51.387 --> 22:53.555
frankly, is a waste of time. 


22:53.555 --> 22:55.557
Now, we don’t read hearts. 


22:55.557 --> 22:59.729
We understand that people can change, 
and we continue with that. 


22:59.728 --> 23:02.596
But overall, Jehovah wants us to understand: 


23:02.597 --> 23:05.434
Let’s search out 


23:05.433 --> 23:09.370
for those who are rightly disposed 
for everlasting life 


23:09.370 --> 23:13.508
because no one comes to the truth, 
remember, as Jesus taught us, 


23:13.508 --> 23:16.511
unless Jehovah draws him. 


23:16.512 --> 23:20.015
We don’t want to get 
to thinking that our personality 


23:20.015 --> 23:22.050
draws people to the truth. 


23:22.050 --> 23:24.052
You might be likable. 


23:24.052 --> 23:26.054
That’s wonderful. 


23:26.053 --> 23:30.591
However, Jehovah draws 
those rightly disposed. 


23:30.592 --> 23:32.927
And you become friends and such 


23:32.927 --> 23:35.297
if you have the privilege 
to study with people. 


23:35.297 --> 23:37.299
But that’s what it’s about: 


23:37.298 --> 23:39.935
searching for those rightly disposed ones. 


23:39.935 --> 23:41.937
That’s who he draws. 


23:41.937 --> 23:46.340
Those who are righteously—
He reads the heart. 


23:46.340 --> 23:48.777
And so we’re in this search work, 


23:48.777 --> 23:53.215
but we’re looking to focus 
on those rightly disposed.


23:53.215 --> 23:56.752
So with that clear, 


23:56.752 --> 24:00.289
the Governing Body 
has identified two problems. 


24:00.288 --> 24:03.858
And this is what we want to pass on, 


24:03.858 --> 24:08.000
and it can adversely affect 
our effectiveness in the ministry. 


24:09.097 --> 24:11.232
This is what we’re about: 


24:11.232 --> 24:13.635
a preaching and teaching organization. 


24:13.635 --> 24:15.637
This is who we are. 


24:15.637 --> 24:19.640
So for many years, 
and we acknowledge it, 


24:19.640 --> 24:23.678
there was a focus on placing magazines, 


24:23.678 --> 24:27.048
developing magazine routes. 


24:27.048 --> 24:31.185
That helped some come 
into the truth, no denying it, 


24:31.185 --> 24:34.455
because our literature 
is the best on the earth. 


24:34.455 --> 24:37.892
Others have accepted our magazines 


24:37.892 --> 24:41.162
for many years, 


24:41.162 --> 24:43.199
many years, 


24:43.198 --> 24:46.000
and they’ve never 
done a thing about the truth. 


24:47.268 --> 24:50.738
But they’re still going back. 


24:50.738 --> 24:53.541
You know, coming back 
from a day of service, 


24:53.542 --> 24:56.044
“How many magazines did you place?” 


24:56.043 --> 24:58.613
Now, they mean well. 
God loves us. 


24:58.613 --> 25:03.000
But excuse me, 
that’s not the focus of our work. 


25:04.452 --> 25:08.557
It has to refocus on what we’re all about. 


25:08.557 --> 25:12.394
And just think about it, 
Jesus commanded: 


25:12.393 --> 25:17.365
“Go, therefore, and make disciples 
of people of all the nations.” 


25:17.365 --> 25:20.602
We don’t have the authority to change 


25:20.602 --> 25:23.104
what the head of the congregation has said 


25:23.103 --> 25:25.506
and go along the lines of, 


25:25.507 --> 25:29.410
‘Go, therefore, 
and place a lot of literature’; 


25:29.410 --> 25:31.780
that’s not our focus, 


25:31.780 --> 25:34.315
even though it’s the best on the planet. 


25:34.315 --> 25:38.353
We’re about searching 
for the rightly disposed 


25:38.353 --> 25:40.855
so they can become disciples of Christ. 


25:40.855 --> 25:42.857
And you know, these ones 


25:42.857 --> 25:45.760
who have taken our literature for years 


25:45.760 --> 25:49.430
(and you know, as we said, 
individuals might change) 


25:49.430 --> 25:52.933
they remind us of 
what happened in Ezekiel’s day. 


25:52.933 --> 25:56.536
And some of you are Bible readers


25:56.537 --> 25:58.607
—scholars, if you will—


25:58.607 --> 26:01.910
but let’s read it anyway in Ezekiel 33 


26:01.910 --> 26:05.680
and find what he faced. 


26:05.680 --> 26:07.982
And we face this. 
It’s a reality. 


26:07.982 --> 26:11.019
So given the limited time, 


26:11.018 --> 26:14.188
we have to make sure 
that Jehovah’s spirit 


26:14.188 --> 26:16.256
is moving us this way, 


26:16.257 --> 26:19.294
and that we accept that this is the way it is 


26:19.293 --> 26:22.530
in our day as well. 


26:22.530 --> 26:28.000
Now notice verse 31 
of Ezekiel 33:31, 32: 


26:29.337 --> 26:33.309
“They will crowd in 
to sit before you as my people; 


26:33.308 --> 26:37.111
“and they will hear your words, 
but they will not do them. 


26:37.112 --> 26:39.547
“For with their mouth they flatter you, 


26:39.547 --> 26:42.517
“but their heart 
is greedy for dishonest gain. 


26:42.517 --> 26:44.519
“Look! 


26:44.518 --> 26:46.955
“You are to them like a romantic love song, 


26:46.955 --> 26:49.423
“sung with a beautiful voice 


26:49.423 --> 26:52.360
“and skillfully played 
on a stringed instrument. 


26:52.360 --> 26:55.297
“They will hear your words, 


26:55.297 --> 26:59.969
but no one will act on them.” 


26:59.968 --> 27:03.170
That’s every territory. 


27:03.170 --> 27:05.740
And as you’ve worked it for many years, 


27:05.740 --> 27:09.810
you can have faces 
come to mind just like that, 


27:09.810 --> 27:12.980
come to occasional meetings and such. 


27:12.980 --> 27:15.583
Well, time is running out. 


27:15.583 --> 27:18.753
God is making that very clear to us. 


27:18.753 --> 27:21.555
We need to help people come into the truth. 


27:21.555 --> 27:25.327
We don’t need the flattery and such


27:25.327 --> 27:27.329
—that kind of experience. 


27:27.328 --> 27:30.565
This is a time for decision. 


27:30.565 --> 27:34.502
We’re looking for people 
who will act on what they learn. 


27:34.502 --> 27:38.039
That’s where our blows 
are going to be effective. 


27:38.038 --> 27:40.441
People have to act on it. 


27:40.442 --> 27:42.644
And if you’re not seeing that, 


27:42.643 --> 27:44.645
just get searching 


27:44.645 --> 27:47.182
and let the angels 
and Jehovah’s spirit 


27:47.182 --> 27:50.585
take you to the rightly disposed ones. 


27:50.585 --> 27:54.955
And something that we forget, 
our work is twofold. 


27:54.955 --> 27:57.525
We can forget that sometimes. 


27:57.525 --> 28:02.330
We’re searching and bringing in 
the rightly disposed, 


28:02.330 --> 28:06.133
and the other is we’re praising 
and honoring Jehovah, 


28:06.133 --> 28:08.135
like Brother Lösch mentioned, 


28:08.135 --> 28:11.638
because they’re hearing 
about Jehovah’s judgment day. 


28:11.638 --> 28:13.875
So it’s twofold. 
It’s a warning work. 


28:13.875 --> 28:15.810
You could go a whole morning 


28:15.810 --> 28:18.278
and not have what you thought 
was an effective day


28:18.278 --> 28:21.215
—no literature—
but you praised God 


28:21.215 --> 28:24.785
because they’re still thinking 
about Jehovah’s Witnesses 


28:24.785 --> 28:28.355
and your efforts to preach in that territory. 


28:28.355 --> 28:31.425
So we have to keep that in mind.


28:31.425 --> 28:33.762
So that’s the one problem. 


28:33.762 --> 28:37.000
Here is problem two that we want to address. 


28:39.233 --> 28:43.203
We have so many tools 
to use in the ministry; 


28:43.203 --> 28:46.440
it can be overwhelming and confusing 


28:46.440 --> 28:48.777
even to the best minds. 


28:48.777 --> 28:51.645
So you older ones, don’t feel: 


28:51.645 --> 28:54.415
‘I’m slipping here. 
I’m confused.’ 


28:54.415 --> 28:57.718
No, the young ones are trying too, 


28:57.718 --> 29:00.755
often overwhelmed and confused. 


29:00.755 --> 29:02.823
So our Teaching Toolbox 


29:02.823 --> 29:05.660
that we emphasized in recent years, 


29:05.660 --> 29:09.000
what happened is 
that it became a huge toolshed. 


29:12.433 --> 29:14.435
A lot of you are nodding your heads. 


29:14.435 --> 29:16.703
That’s OK. 
That’s not disloyal. 


29:16.703 --> 29:18.706
It’s true. 


29:18.707 --> 29:21.042
It’s become a huge toolshed. 


29:21.042 --> 29:25.147
Now, we appreciate the sample presentations
at the midweek meeting, 


29:25.147 --> 29:27.949
but frankly, 
many of us are so busy 


29:27.948 --> 29:31.118
we can’t keep up with 
all the latest presentations 


29:31.118 --> 29:32.653
no matter how good they are. 


29:32.653 --> 29:34.021
‘Well, that was good.’ 


29:34.022 --> 29:36.357
And then Saturday morning or Sunday: 


29:36.357 --> 29:39.094
‘OK, what am I doing today? 


29:39.093 --> 29:42.163
‘We had three of them 
at our midweek meeting. 


29:42.163 --> 29:45.700
I don’t know, 
what am I supposed to do here?’ 


29:45.700 --> 29:48.537
And then if you get a critic nearby, 


29:48.537 --> 29:50.572
you know, ‘Oh, Lord.’ 


29:50.572 --> 29:53.942
You know? 


29:53.942 --> 29:56.377
Plus many struggle to keep up 


29:56.377 --> 29:59.080
with reading all the magazines. 


29:59.080 --> 30:01.548
You’re not a bad person. 


30:01.548 --> 30:04.685
Jehovah loves you. 


30:04.685 --> 30:07.755
We understand. 


30:07.755 --> 30:11.292
So in view of this, 


30:11.292 --> 30:13.260
the Governing Body is adjusting 


30:13.260 --> 30:15.263
the focus of our ministry. 


30:15.263 --> 30:17.298
You’re getting the message; 


30:17.298 --> 30:19.166
we are addressing these two problems. 


30:19.167 --> 30:23.070
And we are 100 percent 
with this, unanimous. 


30:23.070 --> 30:27.108
Everybody in the departments 
connected are with it. 


30:27.108 --> 30:29.543
They can sense Jehovah’s spirit moving, 


30:29.543 --> 30:31.778
and this is what Jehovah’s doing. 


30:31.778 --> 30:35.148
It’s his chariot. 
He’s the driver. 


30:35.148 --> 30:38.085
So here are the adjustments. 


30:38.085 --> 30:41.688
Starting January 2018, 


30:41.688 --> 30:46.000
there will only be 
three public editions of The Watchtower. 


30:52.233 --> 30:55.001
For those who are tied in, 


30:55.002 --> 30:58.305
I heard some expressions down in front here. 


30:58.305 --> 31:00.642
I couldn’t help it. 


31:00.642 --> 31:03.510
Only three public editions of The Watchtower 


31:03.510 --> 31:06.380
and three of the Awake! magazines


31:06.380 --> 31:08.983
—the whole year. 


31:08.983 --> 31:10.985
Yeah. 


31:10.985 --> 31:13.000
I’m excited too. 


31:14.555 --> 31:16.557
I really am. 


31:16.557 --> 31:18.560
Now— 


31:18.560 --> 31:20.562
And what’s beautiful about this, 


31:20.562 --> 31:24.499
they’re going to cover one subject 
in the whole magazine


31:24.498 --> 31:26.766
—start to finish—


31:26.767 --> 31:29.270
one subject.


31:29.270 --> 31:33.440
Now, I have here a hard copy 


31:33.440 --> 31:36.043
of the first one. 


31:36.043 --> 31:37.478
So I’m excited about it. 


31:37.478 --> 31:40.581
And mind you, these are special. 


31:40.582 --> 31:43.350
This one is special. 
It’s the first one. 


31:43.350 --> 31:45.553
And Jehovah is moving it toward 


31:45.553 --> 31:48.188
those rightly disposed for everlasting life 


31:48.188 --> 31:51.158
because he knows his day and hour. 


31:51.158 --> 31:53.293
And this one 


31:53.293 --> 31:56.663
is quite easy 
to start a conversation with, 


31:56.663 --> 32:00.435
and once you have a question, 
you’re in a conversation already. 


32:00.435 --> 32:02.937
So whether it’s 
“Get off my porch” 


32:02.937 --> 32:07.442
or they want to get involved 
in the answering of that question, 


32:07.442 --> 32:09.444
it’s effective. 


32:09.443 --> 32:12.213
And the rightly disposed 
are going to be intrigued. 


32:12.213 --> 32:14.581
The first one, this question here: 


32:14.582 --> 32:19.000
“Is the Bible Still Relevant Today?” 


32:20.388 --> 32:24.058
Certain territories, maybe not, 


32:24.058 --> 32:27.395
but there may be 
righteously disposed ones there. 


32:27.395 --> 32:29.997
You have a nice cover picture


32:29.997 --> 32:33.200
—a woman in the back reading her Bible 
as the train is going by, 


32:33.200 --> 32:38.038
people distracted with their watches, 
their phones, etcetera. 


32:38.038 --> 32:40.708
And then, on the inside


32:40.708 --> 32:42.910
—and you’re going to become 
familiar with this. 


32:42.910 --> 32:44.945
You got plenty of time to use it—


32:44.945 --> 32:46.982
this tool, over and over. 


32:46.982 --> 32:49.050
Oh, yeah. 
You’ll know right where to go. 


32:49.050 --> 32:51.185
You might decide, well, 


32:51.185 --> 32:53.988
I’ll go where it comments 


32:53.988 --> 32:56.023
“Outdated or Ahead of Its Time?” 


32:56.023 --> 32:58.408
depending on what 
the person may have said. 


32:58.408 --> 33:00.728
You have that freedom. 


33:00.728 --> 33:04.115
So appropriate: 
“Help to Avoid Problems,” 


33:04.115 --> 33:06.883
“Help to Resolve Problems,” 


33:06.883 --> 33:09.420
“Help to Cope With Problems.” 


33:09.420 --> 33:11.422
Boy, do people need that. 


33:11.422 --> 33:13.442
And those that are 


33:13.442 --> 33:16.627
rightly disposed for everlasting life 


33:16.627 --> 33:18.629
know they have problems. 


33:18.628 --> 33:20.665
They’re honest about it. 


33:20.665 --> 33:24.718
And so this will touch their heart, 
and Jehovah will draw them.


33:24.718 --> 33:26.720
Now, what’s nice about it 


33:26.720 --> 33:30.957
is that you’re going to be able 
to get very familiar with it, use it,  


33:30.957 --> 33:35.000
and it’ll become part 
of our permanent Teaching Toolbox. 


33:36.642 --> 33:39.567
And it’ll go in the Teaching Toolbox. 


33:39.567 --> 33:43.387
Even like these skilled craftsmen
—they have their toolbox. 


33:43.387 --> 33:46.524
Why are they so good 
at what they do in many cases? 


33:46.523 --> 33:49.076
Because they keep using these tools. 


33:49.077 --> 33:51.562
It’s not rocket science. 


33:51.562 --> 33:54.265
These are craftsmen with these tools. 


33:54.265 --> 33:56.267
“I need this; I need that,” 


33:56.267 --> 33:58.485
to accomplish what they need here. 


33:58.485 --> 34:01.642
So we only need so many tools in the box


34:01.642 --> 34:05.644
—the ones that we can get 
very good at using. 


34:05.643 --> 34:07.678
And what’s nice, 


34:07.678 --> 34:11.481
when it’s in a permanent 
Teaching Toolbox there, 


34:11.482 --> 34:14.185
you’re not changing all the time. 


34:14.185 --> 34:17.772
And was all that sincere? 


34:17.772 --> 34:21.257
Yes, but I could tell you stories, 


34:21.257 --> 34:23.294
but time is running out, 


34:23.293 --> 34:25.480
of some of the things 
I’ve heard out in the ministry. 


34:25.480 --> 34:28.000
And I could tell they never read that. 


34:31.518 --> 34:34.005
But they’re out there. 
God love them. 


34:34.005 --> 34:36.140
They were knocking on doors with me. 


34:36.140 --> 34:39.277
You get familiar with the tool. 


34:39.277 --> 34:43.865
Now, what we’ll do is 
we’ll evaluate after two years. 


34:43.865 --> 34:47.768
And it might be, we’ll see 
what the Governing Body decides, 


34:47.768 --> 34:50.738
that we think we’ve got sufficient subjects 


34:50.738 --> 34:53.740
in the magazines for the toolbox, 


34:53.740 --> 34:56.377
and then we’ll just reprint 


34:56.377 --> 34:59.357
what’s already been written. 


34:59.357 --> 35:02.134
So you’ve got your tools.


35:02.133 --> 35:04.301
Now, you’re going to get more details 


35:04.302 --> 35:07.105
on the Teaching Toolbox soon. 


35:07.105 --> 35:11.158
And you’ll also be pleased to know this 


35:11.158 --> 35:13.443
that (the brothers 
have been working hard on this) 


35:13.443 --> 35:15.846
there’s going to be an update on the box


35:15.847 --> 35:18.924
—Teaching Toolbox—
and the JW Library. 


35:18.923 --> 35:21.585
And we love the JW Library. 


35:21.585 --> 35:23.888
It’ll be on the home page there. 


35:23.888 --> 35:26.823
It’ll be happening in the near future. 


35:26.823 --> 35:30.393
And this question will arise now 
because territories are different. 


35:30.393 --> 35:32.413
We understand that. 


35:32.413 --> 35:35.640
What if you find that the Teaching Toolbox 


35:35.640 --> 35:39.670
doesn’t contain a tool that you have found
effective in your territory, 


35:39.670 --> 35:42.440
like a video that you think is 


35:42.440 --> 35:45.292
and you’ve experienced effectiveness with it? 


35:45.292 --> 35:47.279
It’s OK. 


35:47.278 --> 35:49.413
Put it in your “Favorites” section. 


35:49.413 --> 35:51.415
That’s all. 


35:51.415 --> 35:53.417
Don’t write in and say, 


35:53.417 --> 35:56.220
“I think that should be 
in the Teaching Toolbox.” 


35:56.220 --> 35:59.123
We’ve gone through 
all of this at headquarters. 


35:59.123 --> 36:01.425
It’s OK. 


36:01.425 --> 36:05.830
But you go ahead and put it 
in your “Favorites” section and use it. 


36:05.830 --> 36:07.832
Not a problem.


36:07.832 --> 36:09.890
Not a problem.


36:09.890 --> 36:11.940
Now, so that’s covered, 


36:11.940 --> 36:15.673
those with the preaching 
and the focus of our ministry. 


36:15.673 --> 36:18.390
And there’s another adjustment 


36:18.390 --> 36:22.390
that I’ve been asked to announce here. 


36:22.390 --> 36:27.252
We all enjoy the latest reports 
on the worldwide work


36:27.252 --> 36:31.439
that we have on jw.org 
and JW Broadcasting. 


36:31.438 --> 36:33.573
We love it. 


36:33.573 --> 36:38.261
And I know recently someone 
told me they didn’t know about Venezuela. 


36:38.262 --> 36:43.374
It was on jw.org, but you don’t want 
to try and make him feel bad. 


36:43.373 --> 36:47.023
But there’s so much we’re getting 
all throughout the year, 


36:47.023 --> 36:49.356
and it’s timely and a blessing. 


36:49.357 --> 36:53.394
So with this in mind, 
the Governing Body has decided 


36:53.393 --> 36:55.563
that with all of the information 


36:55.563 --> 36:59.166
on jw.org and JW Broadcasting, 


36:59.167 --> 37:03.237
that as of 2018, 
we will no longer produce 


37:03.237 --> 37:06.090
the Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


37:06.090 --> 37:08.208
Especially if you’ve been 
in the truth a long time, 


37:08.208 --> 37:12.780
yes, the 2017 is your last one. 


37:12.780 --> 37:14.807
So that’s historic. 


37:14.807 --> 37:17.000
But come on, 


37:20.540 --> 37:23.777
try to convince me 
you’ve seen everything we’ve put 


37:23.777 --> 37:28.279
on jw.org and JW Broadcasting. 


37:28.278 --> 37:31.406
God is watching. 


37:31.407 --> 37:33.417
You’re well-fed. 


37:33.417 --> 37:36.000
You’ve got plenty there. 


37:38.638 --> 37:42.393
These latest developments 
are indeed exciting. 


37:42.393 --> 37:44.628
And as the end fast approaches, 


37:44.628 --> 37:48.898
let’s honor Jehovah and make our blows count. 


37:48.898 --> 37:51.406
Let’s go forth and make disciples 


37:51.407 --> 37:54.757
of people that are righteously disposed 


37:54.757 --> 37:57.000
for everlasting life.


38:09.737 --> 38:12.089
What an exciting announcement! 


38:12.088 --> 38:14.940
I don’t know about you, 
I’m really excited about this 


38:14.940 --> 38:18.462
because we can see the end is so close. 


38:18.462 --> 38:22.282
And really, isn’t the main thing 
that we should be thinking about 


38:22.282 --> 38:24.302
is helping people to know Jehovah? 


38:24.302 --> 38:26.320
That’s the prime goal. 


38:26.320 --> 38:30.040
So the Governing Body is helping us 
to see how to have this toolbox. 


38:30.040 --> 38:33.127
We’re all looking forward 
to seeing what’s in the toolbox. 


38:33.127 --> 38:35.140
In addition to that, 


38:35.140 --> 38:37.765
we’ve got a few 
other announcements to make. 


38:37.765 --> 38:40.367
We’d like to inform you 
of some changes 


38:40.367 --> 38:44.739
that are planned with regard 
to the study edition of The Watchtower. 


38:44.738 --> 38:49.326
Now, since 2011, 
in English we’ve been producing 


38:49.327 --> 38:52.797
two different versions 
of the study edition. 


38:52.797 --> 38:56.100
We’ve had the standard edition 
and the simplified. 


38:56.100 --> 38:59.703
And each of those 
has filled a vital need. 


38:59.703 --> 39:03.106
However, in recent months 
the Governing Body 


39:03.107 --> 39:06.510
has asked the Writing Committee 
to investigate ways 


39:06.510 --> 39:10.982
to simplify the style 
of the standard edition. 


39:10.982 --> 39:15.085
Additionally, the Governing Body 
has approved a new design 


39:15.085 --> 39:17.090
for the standard edition, 


39:17.090 --> 39:20.323
which allows for a larger font style 


39:20.323 --> 39:25.095
and also has certain features 
that are only in the simplified edition, 


39:25.095 --> 39:28.365
such as “Some Expressions Explained.” 


39:28.365 --> 39:32.135
So with this in mind, 
the Governing Body has decided 


39:32.135 --> 39:36.007
as of January 1, 2019, 


39:36.007 --> 39:39.557
they are going to combine 
both versions of the magazines. 


39:39.557 --> 39:44.240
This will not only simplify our work 
but it will also be less confusing, 


39:44.240 --> 39:47.657
and we all will have 
the same magazine that we’re using. 


39:47.657 --> 39:49.924
Now, you’ll be interested to note 


39:49.923 --> 39:52.258
that many of the larger languages 


39:52.258 --> 39:54.640
that were producing two editions


39:54.640 --> 39:58.278
—languages such as Spanish, 
Portuguese, French, and Italian—


39:58.278 --> 40:01.815
have recently already 
combined their editions, 


40:01.815 --> 40:05.853
trying to simplify the language 
used in their standard edition. 


40:05.853 --> 40:08.088
And this has been very successful. 


40:08.088 --> 40:11.740
We will continue to produce 
an electronic version 


40:11.740 --> 40:14.362
of the English simplified magazine, 


40:14.362 --> 40:17.380
and that will be used mainly by translators 


40:17.380 --> 40:20.050
to help them to make sure their translation 


40:20.050 --> 40:22.720
is still clear and understandable.


40:22.720 --> 40:24.923
Now, in addition, 


40:24.923 --> 40:28.358
we’d like to let you know 
that early next year 


40:28.358 --> 40:31.145
we’ll be receiving a new publication, 


40:31.145 --> 40:33.280
and it will be one of the ones 


40:33.280 --> 40:36.090
that we use in the toolbox. 


40:36.090 --> 40:41.005
It is called How to Remain in God’s Love. 


40:41.005 --> 40:43.423
And you see it here on the screen. 


40:43.423 --> 40:46.790
It’s 256 pages, 


40:46.790 --> 40:49.863
and it uses the same simplified style 


40:49.863 --> 40:51.998
as the Teach Us book. 


40:51.998 --> 40:54.000
So it’s going to replace 


40:54.000 --> 40:56.137
the current “God’s Love” book. 


40:56.137 --> 40:58.340
These two publications,


40:58.340 --> 41:00.540
that is, How to Remain in God’s Love 


41:00.540 --> 41:02.543
and the Teach Us books 


41:02.543 --> 41:05.411
will be used in the toolbox 


41:05.412 --> 41:08.957
for helping students to become disciples. 


41:08.957 --> 41:11.000
Now, you look forward to getting that.


41:18.792 --> 41:21.645
Well, I know we’ll be going away from here, 


41:21.645 --> 41:23.940
our minds and hearts spinning around 


41:23.940 --> 41:34.092
thinking of all the interesting changes 
and developments.

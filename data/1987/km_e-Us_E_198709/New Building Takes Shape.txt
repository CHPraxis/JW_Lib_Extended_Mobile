New Building Takes Shape
Last FebruaryÂ 10, all congregations were notified about the excellent opportunity the Society had to acquire property next to Bethel at 97 Columbia Heights. Now the framework of the building is up, and bricklaying has been completed. It is going to be a very useful and attractive 11-story building. Soon the construction company used for the first stage of the work will turn the structure over to the Society. Brothers will go in then to complete all interior work, which will require about one year. We look forward to the time when these additional housing facilities will be available so more volunteers can come here for Bethel service.
Donations sent in specifically for the support of the 97 Columbia Heights project have covered a part of the first stage of construction, and these are very much appreciated. Additional funds will be needed to complete this large building. If you desire to share in this, please send your contribution to the Society, designating the purpose for which it should be applied. Any who may have funds they wish to let the Society use for a time and yet have them available for future personal needs should write inquiring about the conditional donation arrangement. Thank you for your assistance.
Further construction progress reports will be given later on.

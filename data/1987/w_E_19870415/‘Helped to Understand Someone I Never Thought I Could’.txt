‘Helped to Understand Someone I Never Thought I Could’
In the following letter to the Watch Tower Society, a person describes where she received such help.
“Dear Sirs:
“I would like to let you know how much your books are helping me to understand Someone I never thought I could. The Bible is now the most fascinating book I’ve ever read because of the help you have given me through your books.
“Could you please send me a list of all the books you publish, if possible?
“Enclosed is $2.50 for two copies of Reasoning From the Scriptures . . . I must share this great ‘little helper.’”
We would also like to make available to you the 448-page Bible handbook Reasoning From the Scriptures. It is only $1.25.
Please send, postpaid, the hardcover Bible handbook Reasoning From the Scriptures. I enclose $1.25 (U.S.).

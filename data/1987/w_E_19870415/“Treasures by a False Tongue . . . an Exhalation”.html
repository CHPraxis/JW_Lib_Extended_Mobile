<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THESE days, lying and cheating are often viewed as legitimate​—and eminently successful—​business tactics. This was true in Bible times. The psalmist Asaph wrote of those who “have increased their means of maintenance,” evidently by fraudulent schemes. Such ones can appear to be “at ease indefinitely” because of the wealth their treachery has brought them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:8-19:73:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 73:8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:12-19:73:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 12</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Christians today, however, must avoid ‘loving dishonest gain’ and resorting to shady or dishonest business maneuvers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:2-60:5:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:2</a>) Warns <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:6-20:21:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 21:6</a>: “The getting of treasures by a false tongue is an exhalation driven away, in the case of those seeking death.” Yes, any “treasures” obtained by lying and fraud are bound to be as temporary as “an exhalation,” as evanescent as a vapor. “The treasures of the wicked one will be of no benefit” in the long run. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:2-20:10:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 10:2</a>) Really, the lying one is “seeking death” by pursuing a death-dealing course. His life could be cut short prematurely as his lying schemes backfire. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:7:10-17:7:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Esther 7:10</a>.) Or at the very latest, his life will be terminated on God’s day of judgment.</p>

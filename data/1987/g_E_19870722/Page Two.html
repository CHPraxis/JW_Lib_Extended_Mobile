<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Iguaçú Falls, one of the natural wonders of the world. Varying between 200 and 270 feet high, 2 1/2 miles wide, with 450,000 cubic feet of water per second plunging over some 275 separate waterfalls or cataracts, Iguaçú (ē-gwä-sōōʹ) lives up to the meaning of its name, “great water.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Falls forms a boundary between Brazil and Argentina. Both countries have created national parks to preserve its beauty. Exotic plants grow lush in the mists. Jaguars, ocelots, tapir, and deer roam the surrounding forest. Birds of many varieties delight the eye. Clouds of butterflies flutter about and often settle to rest on visitors. Rainbows glisten in the mists that billow upward from the crashing waters.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">How long will Iguaçú’s breathtaking beauty be allowed to enthrall its 3,000,000 yearly visitors? Already there has been talk of harnessing the Falls to provide electric power. Will man destroy Iguaçú’s beauty, as he has done to so much of planet Earth? Or will he preserve this “great water” spectacular to thrill and awe his children and their children?</p>

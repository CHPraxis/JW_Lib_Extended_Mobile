<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">As Jehovah’s Witnesses zealously carry out the responsibility to preach “this good news of the kingdom” in all the inhabited earth, they have in mind the counsel given by the apostle Paul to Timothy, namely: “Fully accomplish your ministry.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:5-55:4:5" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 2 Tim. 4:5</a>) This moves them to use every appropriate means to reach people with the Kingdom message, as the following reports show.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">PUERTO RICO AND THE VIRGIN ISLANDS: The first witnesses of Jehovah visited there in the early 1930’s. Today, Kingdom Halls throughout the islands are packed and overflowing. Every nook and corner in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands is receiving a witness regularly. Some territories are worked every week or so, and new ones are continuing to respond favorably to Bible truth.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">SWITZERLAND AND LIECHTENSTEIN: For 95 years Jehovah’s servants there have been publicizing the fact that lasting peace on earth will come only under the Kingdom of God, and they have done it in the face of much opposition. They have gone into the most remote alpine mountain valleys to preach. Their attention has been directed not only to those who speak the four Swiss national languages but also to the many thousands of “guest workers” who have moved into the country. Large numbers of these have appreciatively accepted the good news.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO: During the past 74 years the territory has been covered repeatedly, but the zeal of Jehovah’s Witnesses has not abated. In recent years over 50 percent have participated in the auxiliary pioneer service during certain months, and as the report shows, their labors have not been in vain.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">May these accounts help you to remain firm in faith and to accomplish your ministry thoroughly.</p>

<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page66" class="pageNum" data-no="66" data-before-text="66"></span><strong>Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands</strong></p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">PUERTO RICO is one of the more densely populated areas in the world. Additionally, the pleasant climate and sandy beaches attract many visitors. There is appealing variety in the land, as the mountains of the interior give way to low hills and fertile plains in coastal regions. But this is a relatively small place, measuring only about 110 miles (180 km) from east to west and 40 miles (64 km) from north to south.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This Caribbean island has some 3,500,000 inhabitants. About a million of them are located in and around San Juan, the capital. Large numbers are also found in Ponce on the south coast, Mayagüez to <span id="page67" class="pageNum" data-no="67" data-before-text="67"></span>the west, Arecibo to the north, and Caguas in the midst of the mountains.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The original Indian population was practically exterminated by Spanish explorers. So who live here today? They are largely descendants of the Spanish and of slaves that were brought in from Africa. Because of this heritage, Spanish is the dominant language, and many of the people are Roman Catholic. But in 1898, after the Spanish-American War, the island was ceded to the United States, thus opening the way to a diversity of Protestant groups.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The first Spanish governor here, early in the 16th century, named the original colonial settlement Puerto Rico (meaning “rich port”) because they were shipping out much gold. More recently, however, there were people who came, not to exploit the wealth of the land, but to help the inhabitants to benefit personally from riches far more precious than gold.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>GETTING THE KINGDOM WORK UNDER WAY</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">While making a tour of Latin America in the early 1930’s, Robert Montero visited Puerto Rico to determine what could be done to share with others the priceless good news of God’s Kingdom. In his report to the Watch Tower Society’s main office in New York, he stated that Puerto Rico was a fertile field for the preaching work and recommended that the Society send full-time Kingdom proclaimers, or pioneers, to the island. He reported that there was just one Witness: John Dahlberg, who was about 70 years old and was engaged in the fishing business at Puerto Real on the east coast. Brother Dahlberg’s <span id="page68" class="pageNum" data-no="68" data-before-text="68"></span>preaching activity was quite limited at the time because he had very little knowledge of Spanish, but he offered complete cooperation to any Witnesses that might come to Puerto Rico to spread the Kingdom message.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The first to respond to the invitation to serve here were Brother and Sister Colin McLarty, a couple in their early 70’s. They arrived in the winter of 1932. With Bible literature announcing God’s Kingdom, they called at the governor’s mansion and at police headquarters. They placed publications with a judge of the U.S. District Court. They also witnessed to schoolteachers during recess periods. For four or five months they visited people in their homes and places of business. Accompanying their meager knowledge of Spanish with some sign language, they endeavored to interest others in the truth of God’s Word. But when they were preparing to leave, they reported that what they had accomplished was “nothing in view of the work that is needed to be done.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>TWO PIONEER SISTERS ARRIVE</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">In 1935 two pioneer sisters, Lillian Carr and Marie Hawkins, came from Rochester, New York, to share the life-giving Kingdom message with the warmhearted Puerto Ricans. Being in new surroundings, they at first worked together. Later they concentrated on separate areas. In Aguadilla and Mayagüez on the west coast and in Ponce to the south, Sister Carr primarily placed Bible literature with people, as she was unable to converse in Spanish. However, in that way many “seeds” of Kingdom truth were sown during the next 15 years.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Meanwhile, Sister Hawkins worked for ten years <span id="page69" class="pageNum" data-no="69" data-before-text="69"></span>in San Juan and other cities in the northern and eastern parts of the island. Like Sister Carr, she had only very limited knowledge of Spanish. But she made an effort to call back on persons who showed interest, and she conducted Bible studies to the best of her ability.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>FIRST PUERTO RICAN WITNESSES</strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Sister Hawkins did not witness personally to Ambrosio Rosa García near Arecibo, but she did place a booklet with a friend of his. In 1938 that friend gave the booklet, <em>Universal War Near, </em>to Mr. Rosa. Though Mr. Rosa was a practicer of spiritism, he was deeply impressed by the contents of this publication. At once he obtained more literature by mail from the Society’s New York office. Soon he became convinced that what he was reading was the truth, and he began to share this newfound knowledge with others.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Recognizing the Roman Catholic religion to be false, he refused to allow his eldest daughter to take first Communion in the church. That led to a visit from the local priest. But Ambrosio was well able to defend what he believed, making good use of the knowledge he had acquired from the Bible.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">He realized that he must share the good news with others, so he went preaching from house to house, even though it meant doing so alone and without training. Here was a man of faith who had strong love for Jehovah! As far as he knew, he was the only servant of Jehovah on the island. Yet, he was willing to go right ahead and teach others what he knew of God’s purposes. When he learned that in the United States recorded Bible messages were being used to <span id="page70" class="pageNum" data-no="70" data-before-text="70"></span>spread the truth, he ordered a portable phonograph and some records in Spanish from the Society. And he put these to good use.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">One day when he was playing the phonograph across the street from the Catholic church in Arecibo, a man asked him to put on the discourse “Face the Facts.” Part of this exposed the political activity of the Catholic Church. When the recording told about the practices of the church during the Spanish civil war, the man ran to fetch the local priest. The priest accused Brother Rosa of being a “fifth columnist” and anti-American, but Brother Rosa knew the facts. Strengthened by Jehovah’s spirit, he was able to point out that it was, in fact, the priests who were the “fifth column” and anti-American because of their support for Hitler and Mussolini. He also asked the priest why he had people address him as “Father” when the Bible forbids such a practice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:9-40:23:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 23:9</a>) The priest retreated, but now a policeman threatened to arrest Brother Rosa. Once again he stood his ground, explaining that he had a constitutional right to preach God’s Word in the public square. At this the priest and the policeman held a consultation; then both disappeared.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Among those to whom Ambrosio witnessed in Arecibo was Santiago Rodríguez, Sr., a store clerk who was in his 40’s. At first Santiago told Brother Rosa that he had his own religion and really was not interested. But after a while Ambrosio persuaded him to subscribe for the Spanish <em>Watchtower </em>magazine for just six months. When the magazines came, Santiago read them and soon recognized that what he was learning was the truth. Before long he was out preaching with Brother Rosa.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><span id="page71" class="pageNum" data-no="71" data-before-text="71"></span>Jehovah blessed their efforts, and a small group of interested persons began to gather together. It was then that these two men began to realize the need to “consecrate” (or, dedicate) themselves to Jehovah and to get baptized. But who was there to baptize them? They knew of no other Witnesses in Puerto Rico. What would they do? After prayerful thought, they gathered the group together and all went to a small river near Arecibo, where Ambrosio first baptized Santiago and then Santiago baptized Ambrosio, to become the first native baptized witnesses of Jehovah in Puerto Rico. This was on January 18, 1940. Later, others in the group were baptized, and on June 8 of that year the Arecibo Company (or, Congregation) of Jehovah’s Witnesses was organized.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>BEING A WITNESS WAS NOT EASY</strong></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">In the meantime another group of Jehovah’s servants was developing in Santurce, a large section of the capital city of San Juan. When working in that area, Marie Hawkins had conducted a study with Mrs. Leonor Román, and she, too, began to spread <span id="page72" class="pageNum" data-no="72" data-before-text="72"></span>the good news. Her husband joined her, conducting Bible studies in their home, and their six-year-old daughter accompanied her mother in the field service. This small group in Santurce was organized into a congregation in May 1940. But when Sister Román became ill, activity died down. So on September 1, 1941, this small congregation was removed from the list.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Three years later another congregation was formed in San Juan. But, again, because of the lack of leadership, it did not thrive at that time.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Yet, some seemed to be willing to exert themselves in Jehovah’s service even though there were very few Witnesses. Two individuals who lived in the interior submitted applications for pioneer service. They were assigned the entire district of Guayama, on the south side of the island. Their work proved to be largely one of distributing literature. No doubt this aided some to come in touch with the truth. Unfortunately, however, it seems that the principal motive of these two men was to sell books. So after a while their activity ceased.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Being one of Jehovah’s servants was not easy. Often there was little encouragement available from others. Each one had to put up a hard fight for the faith.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>ARRIVAL OF GILEAD GRADUATES</strong></p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Soon a new era dawned in Puerto Rico. Some of the first missionaries to graduate from the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead were assigned to Puerto Rico. In March of 1944 when the <em>China Clipper </em>landed at Isla Grande Airport in San Juan, four of those missionaries were on board: Leo and Eunice Van <span id="page73" class="pageNum" data-no="73" data-before-text="73"></span>Daalen, Leo’s brother Emil, and their cousin Donald. Sister Hawkins was there to meet them, thrilled that now there would be mature help to cultivate the Puerto Rican field.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">What attitudes and practices did these missionaries find among the people in Puerto Rico? Generally, they were kind, generous, hospitable people, content with a place to sleep and with food and clothing. They were also religious, mostly of the Catholic faith. It was quite common to see a statue of a “patron saint” being carried in a procession by chanting priests and other worshipers. In many homes could be seen tiny altars bedecked with images and pictures of “saints” before which candles burned constantly. Spiritism was widely practiced, but generally those involved in it were good Catholics as well. There were also quite a few, known as <em>evangélicos, </em>who had broken away from Catholicism and embraced the Protestant sects introduced by North Americans.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="ss"><strong>MISSIONARIES BEGIN TO PREACH</strong></p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">The people were, for the most part, receptive to the Kingdom message when the missionaries called at their doors. No slamming of doors in their face; no short, curt answers; instead, at nearly every home they were invited in. Before they could present the Kingdom message, however, certain questions often had to be answered in order to satisfy the householder’s curiosity. “Where are you from?” “Are you married?” “Do you have any children?” Finally a witness could be given. Frequently the conversation would terminate with coffee or even an offer to share a meal.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb"><span id="page74" class="pageNum" data-no="74" data-before-text="74"></span>The missionaries knew very little Spanish. Fortunately, at that time the portable phonograph was being used in the field service. So, after greeting the householder, an invitation was extended to listen to a brief recorded message. At least one of the missionaries had a problem, however. After he set up the phonograph and offered to play a recording about the Bible, the householder usually replied, <em>“¡Como no!” </em>Hearing the word <em>“no” </em>and not being able to converse further in Spanish, the missionary would close up his phonograph and go to the next door. It took a little while before he found out that <em>“¡Como no!” </em>really means “Why not!” and that householders were actually inviting him to proceed. But the people in general were kind, and if they could, they would help the missionaries to find the right words.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Much literature was placed, especially in business places. However, the missionaries wanted to “teach.” As their grasp of the language grew, they put forth an effort to make return visits and start Bible studies, using the book <em>Children. </em>Then one day they were overjoyed when they came upon José Sosa, who had studied with Ambrosio Rosa in Arecibo but then had lost contact with the brothers after moving to San Juan. He immediately began to accompany the missionaries in field service and was a great help to them with their Spanish.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="ss"><strong>MORE MISSIONARIES ARRIVE</strong></p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">At that time there were over two million people on the island; it was evident that more workers were needed. How happy the brothers were, then, when additional missionaries arrived! Over the years, more than 100 missionaries have served here, as many as <span id="page75" class="pageNum" data-no="75" data-before-text="75"></span>60 at the same time. These have been willing workers, eager to share in whatever way they could to spread the Kingdom message. They have helped to open up the work in most of the principal cities and in numerous smaller towns.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">Their interest, however, was not only in sowing new seed but also in cultivating what had already been sown. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:6-46:3:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 3:6-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:36-44:15:36" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Acts 15:36</a>.) So some of those from San Juan decided to visit their brothers in Arecibo to encourage them in the faith. Since a need for mature help with meetings and field service arrangements was evident, arrangements were made for Emil Van Daalen and his cousin Donald to assist the small group in Arecibo. In time they were joined by Arthur, another one of the Van Daalens.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">Back in San Juan the number of Witnesses was beginning to grow. Some who truly proved to be faithful brothers were coming along in the truth. Miguel Bari was one. In the old city of San Juan where his tiny room was located, people lived, as it were, in the passageways of buildings. As others walked into buildings they could see the cooking stoves, tables, and other furniture there in the passageways, with maybe one very small room for sleeping. Amid such surroundings Brother Bari did his work as a tailor. He had little in the way of material possessions, but he did have the qualities that motivated him to share faithfully in preaching God’s Word right up till his death.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">José Feliciano was another one of the early Witnesses who served faithfully until death. Ángel Figueroa, who at that time sold oranges on the street, also became our brother. From all walks of life <span id="page76" class="pageNum" data-no="76" data-before-text="76"></span>honesthearted ones were becoming “men of goodwill.”</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="ss"><strong>OUR FIRST CONVENTION</strong></p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">Assemblies play an important role in the lives of Jehovah’s people. And in 1945 the time came to hold the first convention of worshipers of the true God in Puerto Rico. This was to be at the same time that conventions were held in 300 cities throughout the United States. A small union hall was obtained in Old San Juan near the entrance to the Fortaleza (the governor’s mansion). All the talks had to be prepared by the missionaries with their very limited Spanish. Attendance, of course, was small for the regular sessions.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">The public talk “The Meek Shall Inherit the Earth” was scheduled to be given on Sunday at 3:00 p.m. at the Assembly Hall of the Tropical School of Medicine just east of the capitol building. To publicize it, 10,000 handbills were distributed on the streets; announcements were made on the radio and in newspapers. A large cloth banner was strung across Ponce de León Avenue. At the beginning of the talk it was somewhat disappointing to see only some 20 persons present, mainly the brothers. But by the end of the program, there were 250 in the audience.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="ss"><strong>ENCOURAGING VISIT BY BROTHERS KNORR AND FRANZ</strong></p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">At the time that more missionaries arrived in Puerto Rico, in March 1946, the Watch Tower Society’s president, N. H. Knorr, and the then vice president, F. W. Franz, also came on their tour of Caribbean lands. What a happy time this was!</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb"><span id="page77" class="pageNum" data-no="77" data-before-text="77"></span>Arrangements were made for a two-day assembly in the Ateneo Puertorriqueño at the entrance to the old city of San Juan. The public lecture, on the subject “Be Glad, Ye Nations,” was delivered by Brother Knorr, with F. W. Franz as translator. It had been advertised with 65,000 handbills distributed from house to house and on the streets throughout the city. People from all walks of life were present. Brothers from Arecibo were also on hand. In all, the attendance was 260. What a time of rejoicing this was for the 35 Kingdom publishers then active in Puerto Rico! They could see that the truth was now getting well established here.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb">During their visit, Brothers Knorr and Franz met with the missionaries to outline plans for future expansion. To enable the missionaries to devote their full attention to the Kingdom work, a missionary home arrangement was being instituted, in which the Society would set up the home and provide food and lodging for the missionaries, most of whom had left behind home and relatives to serve in a foreign land. How greatly those zealous workers appreciated that loving provision! Also, Brother Knorr announced that a branch office of the Watch Tower Society was to be established in Puerto Rico on April 1, 1946. The two-story building that was thereafter obtained at Calle Lafayette 704, Santurce, served as the center of theocratic activity in Puerto Rico for the next 20 years.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="ss"><strong>PUBLIC MEETINGS SPREAD THE GOOD NEWS</strong></p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb">One of the methods used to good effect to spread the Kingdom message was public meetings. These <span id="page78" class="pageNum" data-no="78" data-before-text="78"></span>were really public, held for the most part in public parks and plazas. Since the climate in Puerto Rico is warm all year around, they could be held almost every week. Nevertheless, it required great faith and a willing spirit to go ahead with arrangements for such meetings. Why?</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sb">Consider four talks scheduled to be held in the Barrio Obrero Plaza in Santurce in July of 1946. Who were the speakers? Well, the native brothers were all too new in the truth, so the missionaries had to do the best they could with their limited Spanish. Many of them read manuscripts prepared by copying paragraphs from various publications and then putting them in a sequence appropriate to the subject. On one occasion, after a missionary had read his talk, an interested person approached him to ask a question. But the missionary could not understand a thing the man said and had to refer him to someone who could speak Spanish. However, with the help of holy spirit these willing brothers were having a share in preaching the good news.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="sb">Various parks and plazas, including the main plaza across from the City Hall in San Juan, were used for these talks. As might be expected, the religious leaders did not like this as much as the people in general did. Pressure was put on the mayor to deny this freedom of expression to Jehovah’s Witnesses. Announcement was made in the public press that the public park should not be used for a “church service.” The brothers went to a friendly lawyer about this, and he advised them to wait awhile and then ask for permission again. This was done, with good results. Evidently the mayor realized that she could not legally deny this right.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="sb"><span id="page79" class="pageNum" data-no="79" data-before-text="79"></span>The brothers from San Juan also scheduled discourses in the plazas of nearby towns. One evening when the Witnesses had just finished their lecture in Juncos, a Pentecostal preacher wanted to ask some questions over the sound system. When his petition was denied, he began to shout in a loud voice, contradicting what the speaker had said. Although pointed answers from the Bible showed that he had the wrong viewpoint, he refused defeat. A large crowd gathered to listen to the discussion. After about an hour, they got tired of his arrogance and told him to keep quiet. He hotly denounced them as “sinners.” At that, one of the men in the crowd called for a show of hands as to how many favored the <em>“americano” </em>in the argument. All but four or five of the hundred or more present raised their hands.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sb">In Bayamón, a suburb to the west of San Juan, the mayor refused permission to have discourses in the public plaza, saying that the crowd would damage the plants around the park. However, when the brothers found out that another organization was using the park, they decided to go ahead with their series of talks. As handbills advertising the first talk were being distributed on the streets, the mayor came by and was also invited. Soon thereafter, the missionary was called to the police station. There the mayor insisted that the talk would not be given. But when he left, the police chief told the brothers to go ahead and he would provide police protection. When the sound equipment was being set up, the mayor demanded that a policeman arrest the speaker, but the policeman refused, stating that the Witnesses had every right to hold their talks. The following week the brothers found that the electricity for the sound system <span id="page80" class="pageNum" data-no="80" data-before-text="80"></span>had been cut off. However, they had an emergency generator, and the talk was given without mishap.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sb">Many who today are Jehovah’s Witnesses had their first contact with the truth by means of such open-air Bible lectures.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="ss"><strong>NATIVE PIONEERS EXPAND THE WITNESS</strong></p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sb">The zealous example set by the missionaries was an encouragement to native Witnesses to take up the full-time service. One of the first to become a pioneer was Theódulo Otero (usually called Teo), a brother in his late 20’s. He had learned the truth by reading the book <em>Children </em>and with the help of a Bible study conducted in a home across the street from where he lived and worked. He quickly grasped the Bible’s teachings, was baptized at the first assembly held in Puerto Rico in 1945, and was one of the happy delegates to the international assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1946. Later that same year he was appointed a “general” pioneer. Since he did not have family responsibilities that might limit where he could serve, he was assigned to Cayey, situated in a verdant valley high in the mountains south of San Juan. About ten years earlier, Ramón López Núñez, a barber in Cayey, had obtained some literature from Marie Hawkins and later had severed his ties with false religion. When he came down the mountain to attend a convention in San Juan in 1946, the brothers were overjoyed to learn that there was such a person in Cayey. So Theódulo Otero was sent to help him. Together they worked from house to house, and soon another congregation was formed.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sb">Meanwhile, in Arecibo, Santiago Rodríguez, Sr., <span id="page81" class="pageNum" data-no="81" data-before-text="81"></span>had become a pioneer. He had his wife and ten children to care for, so pioneering called for careful planning. However, his small pension helped him to make ends meet financially. Not content with preaching only in Arecibo, he reached out, like the apostle Paul, to other fields. This tall, energetic brother was seen preaching in Barceloneta, Manatí, Hatillo, Camuy, Quebradillas, Lares, and Utuado. To reach these places he traveled 15 to 20 miles (24 to 32 km) along winding mountain roads.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sb">Brother Rodríguez was 52 years of age when he enrolled as a regular pioneer, and he remained in that full-time service till shortly before his death in 1977 at the age of 83. Residents of the area became accustomed to seeing him hurry along the road as he went from house to house. To work in the field service with Chago, as he was called, was an inspiring experience. A person almost had to trot to keep up with him. His gestures and facial expressions gave evidence that he was putting his whole soul into his work. He had no fear of man and would preach to anyone in any place.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="ss"><span id="page82" class="pageNum" data-no="82" data-before-text="82"></span><strong>KINGDOM TRUTH REACHES THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS</strong></p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="sb">Directly east of Puerto Rico lie the Virgin Islands. St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix were purchased from Denmark by the United States in 1917. In times past there was considerable agriculture there, and slave labor was usually used to work the fields. The countryside is still dotted with the ruins of old estates, with a great house in the middle surrounded by adobe huts that were used to house the slaves. Locations are still designated by the names of these estates, such as Estate Carlton or Estate Richmond. But the sugar industry has moved out; the sugar mill is no longer operating. Tourism has become one of the principal sources of income.</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="sb">It was to these islands that the Society assigned Brother and Sister Theophilus Klein, a missionary couple, to open up the Kingdom-preaching work in January 1947. The reception was amazing. During the first four months, they obtained 750 new subscriptions for the Society’s magazines. Local residents quickly began to share in the preaching work. <span id="page83" class="pageNum" data-no="83" data-before-text="83"></span>In fact, in the first eight months, 29 publishers joined in preaching the good news, not only from house to house but also on the streets with the magazines. On Saturday morning the main street in St. Thomas was often filled with publishers presenting <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake!</em></p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sb">A former staff writer for <em>Life </em>magazine described her impression in this way: “Among the sights which struck us when we first walked through the streets of St. Thomas was the number of men and women standing on street corners wearing canvas bags on which was written <em>THE WATCHTOWER </em>. . . The most vocal of them, a well-dressed, prosperous-looking man in his middle forties, had called on me on board [the boat] the <em>Love Junk </em>once, asking for a few minutes in which to talk. But I was fully occupied with some food on the fire at the time and sent him away; therefore I did not know anything about the Watchtower.</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sb">“It was with some surprise that I recognized this gentleman, immaculate as usual in a white suit, stiff-collared shirt and tie, crouched over the engine with Harry. . . . As time went on, and the man did not leave, I began to wonder what was happening to my good Presbyterian husband. If he was being converted, I wondered to what. Perhaps all this was leading up to baptism by immersion; we certainly were in the ideal spot for it. . . . But far from the fire and brimstone oratory I had expected, the words coming out of the Watchtower man were so softly spoken that I could not make out what he was saying. His actions were even less revealing. . . . ‘What’s he doing in there, John-Thomas?’ I asked . . . ‘Is he <span id="page84" class="pageNum" data-no="84" data-before-text="84"></span>converting Mr. Harman?’ . . . ‘I doesn’t think so. . . . The Watchtower man hold de wrench for de Chief.’ . . . I saw it all clearly. The Watchtower man was not only a missionary, but an expert psychologist as well. At that particular time, there was no more direct way to Harry’s soul than through his engine.</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="sb">“Finally the Watchtower man emerged. . . . I could not wait to go into the engine room and talk to Harry. ‘Nice fellow,’ he commented. ‘Offered to come and discuss the Bible with me once a week.’ ‘Who is he?’ I asked. ‘He’s a Jehovah’s Witness,’ Harry said. ‘Certainly do admire his dedication. . . . I had to do something for him in return; he won’t take contributions.’ ‘What, Harry,’ I asked, ‘did you say you would do for him?’ ‘Oh I took a year’s subscription to <em>Awake!’”</em></p>
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="ss"><strong>FREED FROM BONDAGE TO A BAD HABIT</strong></p>
<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="sb">A group of the missionaries who arrived late in 1946 were assigned to Puerto Rico’s then second-largest city, Ponce, on the south coast. The territory was fruitful, and in less than a year a congregation was formed there.</p>
<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="sb">One who began to study there in 1948 was a silver-haired lady named Susana Mangual. After a few months of study, she learned that an assembly was going to be held in San Juan. Though she had always stayed at home before she began to study the truth, she decided to attend. She also wanted to get baptized, but she had a serious problem. She was a heavy smoker, and she knew that she would have to quit that unclean habit first. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:7:1-47:7:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Cor. 7:1</a>) Could she break free from its bondage? En route to the assembly <span id="page85" class="pageNum" data-no="85" data-before-text="85"></span>she made a firm decision, and relying on Jehovah for help, she held to it. Because of her smoking, she had always had a bad cough. Now her health greatly improved. She became a regular pioneer and continued in that service till the age of 86.</p>
<p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="sb">Susana preached everywhere and anywhere. She never did get accustomed to territory assignments and maps, but one would see that dear silver-haired lady telling out the good news wherever her heart willed her to be. Not only was she a familiar figure in Ponce but she also commuted to other towns to preach. In two of them, Guayanilla and Peñueles, there are now thriving congregations.</p>
<p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="ss"><strong>MILITARY MEN LEARN THE TRUTH</strong></p>
<p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="sb">The message of the Kingdom was reaching out to the hearts of all sorts of men. Miguel Quirós, a soldier stationed at the army camp in Cayey in 1947, had obtained a copy of <em>Awake! </em>magazine and then sent to the Society for more information. He received the book <em>“The Truth Shall Make You Free” </em>and showed it to a fellow soldier, Pedro Hernández. Realizing that this was the truth, they shared it with Samuel Delucca, who was also a soldier, and the three studied together.</p>
<p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="sb">Before long, they found out that there was a barber in Cayey who was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. So they got in contact with Ramón López and, through him, with Teo Otero, who was pioneering in the area. They immediately began to attend meetings, and dressed in civilian clothes, they went from house to house preaching the Kingdom message.</p>
<p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="sb">Soon, however, they realized that if they were going to live in harmony with God’s Word, they must <span id="page86" class="pageNum" data-no="86" data-before-text="86"></span>make themselves “no part of the world” in the complete sense. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:16-43:17:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 17:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/33:4:1-33:4:3" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Mic. 4:1-3</a>) Because they refused to participate in certain activities in the army, they were sentenced to six months in prison. They were confined in a military prison in Fort Buchanan near San Juan. Did this change their minds as to serving Jehovah? Not at all. They continued to study the Bible in prison. Eleven other prisoners also became interested, and they had a fine study together​—that is, until the army chaplain heard about it.</p>
<p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="sb">One day an army colonel came to the prison and, of course, the prisoners saluted him​—except for these three brothers. He became furious and entered the office to speak to the one in charge of the prison. “Well, what do you want me to do?” asked the warden. “These men are already in jail for refusing to salute officers on the outside. Do you want me to dig a hole deep down under the prison in order to put them deeper down into prison?”</p>
<p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="sb">After serving their sentences, the brothers were discharged from the army, and each went to his own hometown to take up the preaching work.</p>
<p id="p70" data-pid="70" class="ss"><strong>BRINGING THE TRUTH HOME TO ST. JOHN</strong></p>
<p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="sb">Edmead George was also serving in the army when he came in contact with Jehovah’s Witnesses in the United States. His appetite stimulated, he got in touch with the branch office of the Society when he was transferred to Puerto Rico. Regular Bible studies strengthened his faith.</p>
<p id="p72" data-pid="72" class="sb">Upon release from military service, he returned to his home on St. John, in the Virgin Islands, bringing along a love for Bible truth. There he lived in a tiny <span id="page87" class="pageNum" data-no="87" data-before-text="87"></span>village known as East End​—a fitting name because that is where the village was located on the island. Eagerly he shared with friends and neighbors the good things he had learned. His preaching was reinforced in 1949 when the Society’s schooner <em>Sibia </em>visited St. John with four missionaries aboard. The crew consisted of Gust Maki, Arthur Worsley, Stanley Carter, and Ronald Parkin, who were assigned to spread the Kingdom message in the Lesser Antilles. What a hearty welcome they received when they put into port at East End! During their stay, the 1,000 inhabitants of St. John were given a thorough witness.</p>
<p id="p73" data-pid="73" class="ss"><strong>PROTESTANT CLERGY STIR UP OPPOSITION</strong></p>
<p id="p74" data-pid="74" class="sb">During 1949 four missionaries were assigned to Mayagüez, known as <em>Sultana del Oeste </em>(Sultana of the West). It was not long until they were holding meetings in the front room of the small missionary home, and by the following year, a congregation was formed.</p>
<p id="p75" data-pid="75" class="sb">This activity did not go unnoticed by the clergy. Peggy Maykut (now Sister Arthur Van Daalen) started a study with Lolita Merle, who was viewed as a pillar in the Presbyterian Church. She showed so much interest that she went with the missionaries from Mayagüez to attend an assembly in St. Thomas. On returning home, she began to feel the heat of persecution. The minister visited her to dissuade her from association with the Witnesses. After a lengthy discussion, she arranged for the minister to come to her home to discuss the Trinity doctrine with the missionary who was conducting studies with her. He never came. Instead, she received a letter advising <span id="page88" class="pageNum" data-no="88" data-before-text="88"></span>her to appear before the church committee. Her reply was a letter of resignation. She is still an active servant of Jehovah, though now physically blind and over 90 years old.</p>
<p id="p76" data-pid="76" class="sb">After Sister Merle’s departure from the Presbyterian Church, considerable opposition came from that religious body. The Protestant churches had by agreement divided up the island among themselves. So the ministers accused the Witnesses of invading their pastures and taking away their “sheep.” “Why don’t you go to the ‘unbelievers,’ those who do not have any religion?” they demanded. In their concern about safeguarding what they viewed as their private domain, they ignored the fact that those who truly are “sheep” belong to the Lord Jesus Christ, not to one or another of the religious denominations in Christendom.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:31-40:25:33" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 25:31-33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> John 10:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p77" data-pid="77" class="sb">In spite of such opposition, the Mayagüez Congregation continued to grow. By 1955 the missionaries were moved to other assignments, and the local publishers branched out to witness to other towns in the area. Today there are eight congregations in Mayagüez itself, with many more in nearby communities.</p>
<p id="p78" data-pid="78" class="ss"><strong>EX-BOXER BECOMES ZEALOUS FIGHTER FOR THE FAITH</strong></p>
<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="sb">By 1950 the Ponce Congregation was up to some 70 publishers. The missionaries there had moved the missionary home and also the Kingdom Hall to the third floor of a building in the heart of the city.</p>
<p id="p80" data-pid="80" class="sb">During this year Francisco Torruellas (known as Paco) and his wife Leonor began to study the Bible with Lillian Kammerud. Paco had been a professional <span id="page89" class="pageNum" data-no="89" data-before-text="89"></span>boxer and baseball player and was currently engaged in the auto-repair business. The whole family took part in the study. At first his progress was slow, but they decided to attend the last day of a small circuit assembly in Mayagüez in April 1950. He was very much impressed with the assembly and the association, even offering his car to transport baptismal candidates to the immersion site at the beach.</p>
<p id="p81" data-pid="81" class="sb">After this assembly, he was fired with zeal for Jehovah’s service, going out alone when the brothers did not come for him. He witnessed to his friends, his neighbors, and his employees, and he conducted many studies with these people. The combined attendance at three of his studies was 35 persons, and of these, 14 began to declare the good news. By July he wanted to be baptized, not being willing to wait for the district convention in October. So a special baptism was arranged for ten persons, most of whom were his own family and those with whom he was conducting studies. He proved to be zealous for the truth, serving as “congregation servant,” city overseer for Ponce, and assembly overseer for the circuit. Since his retirement from his secular work, he is also a regular pioneer.</p>
<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="ss"><strong>WILLING TO DO WHAT THEY COULD</strong></p>
<p id="p83" data-pid="83" class="sb">One town that did not have a missionary home was Jayuya, a small community high in the mountains in the center of the island. However, the truth reached this remote place too. How? By means of Aurea Cortés, who had learned the truth in the Dominican Republic. On returning to her hometown, Jayuya, she did what she could to share Bible truth with others. She talked to her friends and relatives who <span id="page90" class="pageNum" data-no="90" data-before-text="90"></span>lived in the country not far from town. Among these was the large Pierluissi family. Those who were most interested were among the children. Soon meetings were organized in the home, with one of the sons, Joaquín, conducting. He and his cousin Ángel began to share in the field service.</p>
<p id="p84" data-pid="84" class="sb">Other towns were also receiving a witness as publishers moved out into new areas. Two of the first Witnesses in Arecibo, Alfonso López and his wife, were among these. They moved to Las Marías, a small town in the mountains east of Mayagüez. Their home was about two miles (3 km) out of town and about a half mile (1 km) off the highway along what was sometimes a very muddy road. The only means of transportation was on foot or by public cars. They were an elderly couple but did what they could to spread the good news. Much seed was sown and some later bore fruit. In time, special pioneers were assigned there, and now there is a congregation of some 50 publishers. Among them is a former leader in the Evangelical Church, Jaime Custodio, as well as the former mayor and his family, to all of whom Brother López witnessed. Sister López, now well up in years, is still doing what she can in Jehovah’s service.</p>
<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="ss"><strong>WHERE PROGRESS WAS SLOW AT FIRST</strong></p>
<p id="p86" data-pid="86" class="sb">When missionaries were assigned to Caguas in 1949, they worked diligently and soon were holding meetings in the front room of their missionary home. However, progress was slow at first. The hearts of many of the early ones who associated did not prove to be the right kind of soil, so after a time they ceased serving Jehovah. However, other seed took root and produced manyfold.</p>
<p id="p87" data-pid="87" class="sb"><span id="page91" class="pageNum" data-no="91" data-before-text="91"></span>For example, when Dolores Vázquez was introduced to the truth, she and her oldest daughter, Carmen, studied regularly. At times her three oldest sons also sat in on the study. Dolores progressed well and was soon attending meetings. She wanted Jehovah’s approval not only for herself but also for her whole family. Over the years, nearly all her sons and daughters as well as their families have embraced the privilege of serving the only true God. There are well over 30 persons among her sons, daughters, and grandchildren who are dedicated servants of Jehovah or are having a share in preaching the good news. Two of her sons and one of her grandsons are now serving as elders.</p>
<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sb">Missionaries continued to work in Caguas for many years, and with much patience the congregation began to grow. Now there are 13 congregations in Caguas, and others have sprung up in neighboring towns.</p>
<p id="p89" data-pid="89" class="sb">To the west of San Juan, in Bayamón, a number of years passed before expansion could really be felt. Oh, yes, nine publishers reported during the first year of missionary activity in that area known for its cattle ranches. In four years, the total had risen to 66. But the next year it was down to 31. Then the city began to grow as new housing developments opened up. Many who moved into these were away from their relatives, so those who listened appreciatively to the Kingdom message were not as inclined to be as concerned about whether others would approve. That town of 15,000 has now mushroomed into a city with a population of some 200,000. Today <span id="page92" class="pageNum" data-no="92" data-before-text="92"></span>Bayamón has 21 congregations and there are many more in surrounding towns.</p>
<p id="p90" data-pid="90" class="ss"><strong>REACHING INTO A STRONGHOLD OF SPIRITISM</strong></p>
<p id="p91" data-pid="91" class="sb"><em>La Ciudad de los Brujos </em>(The City of Witches) also has been given opportunity to hear the Kingdom message. There in Guayama, on the south coast, spiritism has a strong grip on the people. Some prominent businessmen and civic leaders are spiritists.</p>
<p id="p92" data-pid="92" class="sb">George Snodgrass, a missionary, became acquainted with the president of the spiritist movement there and was invited to present the Bible’s view of spiritism to their members in the spiritist temple. Because George had only limited knowledge of Spanish, he invited Ivan Truman, a missionary serving in Caguas, to give the discourse. At one point during the program one of the members became very excited, began to interrupt the speaker, and objected strongly to the statements made. However, he was calmed down by the one in charge, and Brother Truman was allowed to finish his talk. A good witness was given.</p>
<p id="p93" data-pid="93" class="sb">Slowly the congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Guayama began to grow. An elderly brother, Pablo Bruzaud, who had learned the truth in the Dominican Republic, returned to his hometown and pioneered there for many years till his death. Sometime later, Randy Morales, who had learned the truth in New York, also returned to Guayama and became a pioneer. Later he attended Gilead School, and now he serves as a member of the Branch Committee in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p id="p94" data-pid="94" class="ss"><span id="page93" class="pageNum" data-no="93" data-before-text="93"></span><strong>RADIO HELPS TO SPREAD THE GOOD NEWS</strong></p>
<p id="p95" data-pid="95" class="sb">The radio has been used extensively in Puerto Rico to preach the Kingdom message. Often, public talks given at assemblies were broadcast, so the entire island could hear the Bible’s message if they wanted to do so.</p>
<p id="p96" data-pid="96" class="sb">At one time there were as many as 16 radio stations broadcasting the Kingdom message. This has helped people, particularly in country areas, to learn the truth. When the Witnesses began to penetrate into isolated areas, the people were receptive because they had heard the message on the radio. However, because of increased operational costs, nearly all the stations began to request paid programs, so we chose to use our resources to reach people on a more personal basis.</p>
<p id="p97" data-pid="97" class="ss"><strong>A TRAGIC ACCIDENT</strong></p>
<p id="p98" data-pid="98" class="sb">Leo and Eunice Van Daalen, who were among the first missionaries in Puerto Rico, planned to make a trip to visit their relatives in the United States right after the Memorial in 1952. This would be the first trip for their son Mark, who was about two years old. However, almost as soon as the plane left the ground at Isla Grande Airport, it began to experience difficulties. Within minutes it crashed into the Atlantic Ocean about five miles (8 km) offshore. Both Leo and Eunice lost their lives. It was reported that Eunice went under after she gave her life belt to a woman who could not swim. Amazingly, their two-year-old son was picked up floating on the surface of the waves. He was later adopted by his aunt in the United States and is a faithful Witness to this day.</p>
<p id="p99" data-pid="99" class="sb">The Van Daalens were well known in Puerto Rico, <span id="page94" class="pageNum" data-no="94" data-before-text="94"></span>so local newspapers gave much publicity to what had happened to them. This opened the way to talk to many people about the Scriptural hope of the resurrection that the Van Daalens cherished.</p>
<p id="p100" data-pid="100" class="ss"><strong>FIERCE OPPOSITION IN COROZAL</strong></p>
<p id="p101" data-pid="101" class="sb">In a number of places there was intense opposition to the activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses, but it did not stop their work. Corozal, a town in the mountains southwest of San Juan, was such a place.</p>
<p id="p102" data-pid="102" class="sb">Before Rosaura Fuentes learned what the Bible says about the adoration of images, she had given permission to a Catholic group to bring an image of the Virgin to her home in connection with the worship of Mary. But upon learning how God views this practice, she wrote to the group to tell them not to bring the image. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:14-46:10:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:14</a>) When this got to the ears of the priest, he immediately paid her a visit to dissuade her from further studying the Bible with the Witnesses. Then, to intimidate her, he put up a loudspeaker on a nearby house through which he spoke against the Witnesses and denounced this lady. Instead of capitulating, she continued to grow in knowledge of God. Shortly thereafter, Soledad González, a special pioneer, visited her to strengthen her and take her in the field service.</p>
<p id="p103" data-pid="103" class="sb">Then it was decided to hold a series of public Bible talks in the public plaza in Corozal, right next to the church. This really infuriated the priest. He came out of the church, approached the speaker, and shook his fist in the speaker’s face. The next week the priest decided to put on his own lecture and, with his loudspeaker going full blast, began to denounce the brothers in an effort to drown out the one who was <span id="page95" class="pageNum" data-no="95" data-before-text="95"></span>then giving a public talk in the plaza. All of this only served to strengthen our new sister. Even though generally the people in this town were fearful, some began to listen; among them was a family from which two girls later went into the special pioneer service. Today, there is a Kingdom Hall in Corozal from which two congregations carry on their ministry.</p>
<p id="p104" data-pid="104" class="ss"><strong>PEOPLE COULD SEE THE DIFFERENCE</strong></p>
<p id="p105" data-pid="105" class="sb">By 1952 there were 19 congregations on the island, and more were to come. In a sense, the island-wide elections for governor contributed to the expansion at that time. How was that? This was a fiery campaign in which the Roman Catholic Church openly participated, later even forming a separate party called the PAC (Christian Action Party). Two bishops came out in favor of one of the candidates and opposed the controlling Popular Democratic Party.</p>
<p id="p106" data-pid="106" class="sb">Many sincere Catholics strongly objected to this meddling of religion in politics and they supported the Popular Democratic Party, which won by a large majority. Because of what took place during that election campaign, quite a few sincere Catholics left the church. Some of these listened to the truth and became servants of Jehovah. They could see the difference between those who really are separate from the world, as Jesus said would be true of his followers, and those who are not. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:16-43:17:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 17:16</a>) Others who had previously been nasty to the Witnesses showed a more receptive attitude.</p>
<p id="p107" data-pid="107" class="ss"><strong>THE <em>SIBIA </em>REACHES TORTOLA</strong></p>
<p id="p108" data-pid="108" class="sb">In September of 1952 the Puerto Rico branch began to oversee the Kingdom preaching in the British <span id="page96" class="pageNum" data-no="96" data-before-text="96"></span>Virgin Islands, which lie to the northeast of the U.S. Virgin Islands. About 30 islands and islets make up these British islands, but only the larger ones are inhabited: Tortola with a population of about 9,000; Virgin Gorda with about 1,000; Jost Van Dyke, Anegada, Peter, and Salt islands with a few hundred inhabitants. These form a British colony with a governor appointed by the Crown, but most of their commerce and communications are with the United States.</p>
<p id="p109" data-pid="109" class="sb">Some preaching work had been done on Tortola many years before the second world war. However, the British government put a ban on the Society’s literature during the war. Later on, in 1949, the missionary schooner <em>Sibia </em>arrived at Road Town, Tortola. For about two months, the four brothers on this boat preached to the people. Leaving the boat early in the morning, they were often out preaching for up to ten hours before returning. In the evenings they would have public talks in town, sometimes every night. Usually these were out in the open, under a tree, with a gas lamp for illumination. Sometimes a bandstand was used. Hundreds would attend, and the question session that followed often lasted longer than the talk itself.</p>
<p id="p110" data-pid="110" class="sb">The <em>Sibia </em>made two more visits to Tortola, in 1950 and 1951. The clergy were, of course, angry and tried to stir up arguments. In fact, a Seventh-Day Adventist preacher got so infuriated when Brother Parkin would not argue with him that he literally jumped on Brother Parkin’s back and tried to drag him back by force to continue the discussion. Our brothers wisely avoided such debates.</p>
<p id="p111" data-pid="111" class="ss"><span id="page97" class="pageNum" data-no="97" data-before-text="97"></span><strong>MISSIONARY HELP FROM THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC</strong></p>
<p id="p112" data-pid="112" class="sb">When severe persecution caused first-century Christians in Jerusalem to be dispersed to other areas, this resulted in a spreading of the good news. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:1-44:8:1" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 8:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:4-44:8:4" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 4</a>) In a similar way, when the Dominican Republic banned the work of Jehovah’s Witnesses and deported the missionaries, this contributed to expansion in the Puerto Rican field.</p>
<p id="p113" data-pid="113" class="sb">On August 3, 1957, ten of these missionaries arrived at Isla Verde Airport in San Juan. There were four married couples​—Lennart and Virginia Johnson, Raymond and Rhudelle Johnson, George and Nellie Droge, Roy and Juanita Brandt—​and two single sisters​—Kathryn Glass and Dorothy Lawrence. These were quickly assigned to various towns in the island, and new missionary homes were opened.</p>
<p id="p114" data-pid="114" class="sb">One of these missionaries, Raymond Johnson, was in his new assignment in Caguas only a short time. He was making the last house-to-house call one morning with his wife and had just placed a <em>“Let God Be True” </em>book when he sat down in a chair and died of a heart attack. At his funeral 192 were present and a good witness was given, even as he had given a faithful witness during his lifetime.</p>
<p id="p115" data-pid="115" class="ss"><strong>OFF TO THE “DIVINE WILL” INTERNATIONAL ASSEMBLY</strong></p>
<p id="p116" data-pid="116" class="sb">The year 1958 saw much activity in Puerto Rico. The brothers were especially happy that three pioneers from Puerto Rico were having the opportunity to attend the Gilead missionary school. These were in the class that graduated during the “Divine <span id="page98" class="pageNum" data-no="98" data-before-text="98"></span>Will” International Assembly at Yankee Stadium, New York. But they were not the only ones present from this part of the world.</p>
<p id="p117" data-pid="117" class="sb">About 400 brothers and sisters from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands made the trip to New York to attend this historic assembly. These comprised approximately one fifth of all the publishers here at that time. Several chartered planes were needed to provide transport. When this group returned, they were filled with enthusiasm and were eager to do their part in the preaching work.</p>
<p id="p118" data-pid="118" class="sb">Puerto Rico had its own “Divine Will” Assembly in Caguas in September, a six-day assembly with essentially the same program that was presented in New York. Then all the publishers were very busy distributing the special resolution that was adopted at the assembly. That resolution contained a concise statement of truths that people everywhere need to know. In all, about 200,000 copies were distributed throughout Puerto Rico.</p>
<p id="p119" data-pid="119" class="ss"><strong>ST. CROIX JOINS IN PRAISING JEHOVAH</strong></p>
<p id="p120" data-pid="120" class="sb">The largest of the Virgin Islands is St. Croix, lying 40 miles (64 km) south of the main group. When <span id="page99" class="pageNum" data-no="99" data-before-text="99"></span>Edwin Bobb and his wife went there to make known the Kingdom message, some responded appreciatively, and in 1949 the first congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses was formed there. Later, Ted Klein and his wife shared in building on that foundation. Other brothers from the United States came to share in the work. As a result, today there are four congregations there, two English and two Spanish, that unitedly praise Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p121" data-pid="121" class="ss"><strong>CHANGES IN A GROWING ORGANIZATION</strong></p>
<p id="p122" data-pid="122" class="sb">The organization was on a firm footing here by the late 1950’s. The missionaries were dearly loved and their work was much appreciated. But the time had come when many of them could beneficially be moved out of Puerto Rico to other fields. So some were reassigned to Argentina. Others went to the Dominican Republic, since the ban had been lifted and there was still much work to be done there.</p>
<p id="p123" data-pid="123" class="sb">Changes were also taking place in the branch organization. Donald Elder had been assisting the branch overseer, but in April 1960, because of his wife’s poor health, they had to leave, and he was replaced by Ronald Parkin. When Brother Parkin attended the special ten-month Gilead course in 1962, Lennart Johnson was brought into the branch to assist Emil Van Daalen, who had been overseeing the work there for the past eight years. After Emil attended the special Gilead course in 1963, he was given another assignment, in the Bahamas, and Brother Parkin was entrusted with responsibility for the branch in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p id="p124" data-pid="124" class="ss"><span id="page100" class="pageNum" data-no="100" data-before-text="100"></span><strong>BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS BY COURT ORDER</strong></p>
<p id="p125" data-pid="125" class="sb">Many of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Puerto Rico have had their faith put to the test because they have heeded the Bible’s command to ‘abstain from blood.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:28-44:15:29" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 15:28, 29</a>) Most have stood firm in their determination to obey Jehovah’s command. A few have compromised. A great number have had blood forced on them by court order. How has this come about? The doctor or a relative would go to a judge and obtain an order from him to administer blood in spite of the objections of the patient or those responsible for him. This was done even though the patient had signed a statement requesting that no blood be used and relieving the hospital and doctors of responsibility for complications attributed to this refusal.</p>
<p id="p126" data-pid="126" class="sb">Such a situation confronted Ana Paz de Rosario. In 1961, during pregnancy, she was told by her doctor that an operation was necessary or both she and her baby would most likely die. She was taken to the hospital and was waiting for the operation when the doctor became furious because she refused a blood transfusion. A call was promptly made to the professional building to contact Dr. Basilio Dávila. He agreed to take the case. Even though her blood count was very low, the operation was successful. Later, however, the baby did die.</p>
<p id="p127" data-pid="127" class="sb">Our sister was at home when complications set in. She had to return to the hospital. Her cousin decided that she needed blood so, through a lawyer, he went to a judge. Without consulting the doctor in charge of the case, the judge issued a court order for a blood transfusion and even had a policeman sent to make sure the order was carried out. However, <span id="page101" class="pageNum" data-no="101" data-before-text="101"></span>another court order was requested to counter the first judge’s order, but that legal action was not necessary because, according to the doctor, blood was not needed. She recovered well.</p>
<p id="p128" data-pid="128" class="sb">Then, 15 years later, in 1976, she became ill and went to the hospital for an examination. It was found that she had developed gangrene in her colon and the infected section would have to be removed. The doctor agreed to operate without a blood transfusion. The surgery was performed and she was recovering, though still in critical condition.</p>
<p id="p129" data-pid="129" class="sb">But the same relative, who had obtained the court order 15 years before, learned of her sickness and immediately went to work as before, determined to force her to accept blood. Again, the judge was contacted, and a court order was issued without consulting the doctor. When the doctor stated that he had already performed the operation and there was no need for transfusion, an order was issued for his arrest. Although he explained why he had not administered blood, another court order was issued for the hospital to administer blood in spite of the patient’s wishes. To carry out this order, five armed policemen were dispatched to the hospital. When Sister Rosario saw the men, she screamed: “Don’t do this to me! I’m not a delinquent!” But she was quickly subdued. They tied her hands and feet to the bed and forced the transfusion on her, even cutting her neck to reach her jugular vein to force the blood into her, as they were unable to do so through her arm. At this she went into shock and never recovered consciousness.</p>
<p id="p130" data-pid="130" class="sb">Details of this dastardly act against freedom of <span id="page102" class="pageNum" data-no="102" data-before-text="102"></span>conscience and human dignity were published in <em>Awake! </em>magazine of May 22, 1977. Copies were presented personally to all the doctors, nurses, lawyers, and judges in Puerto Rico, and this edition was distributed extensively throughout the island.</p>
<p id="p131" data-pid="131" class="sb">There are a few doctors here who agree to operate without blood. The branch office has a list of these and refers the brothers to them if they ask for assistance in this regard. Nevertheless, cases are still reported, often in the public press, where blood transfusions are administered by court order over the objections of the patient. Many of these cases involve minors, who are viewed by many doctors and judges as having no authority over their own bodies, and a considerable number involve adults. In an endeavor to cope with this, a number of Witnesses make sworn affidavits before they enter the hospital, so that the hospital personnel will respect their wishes not to receive blood.</p>
<p id="p132" data-pid="132" class="ss"><strong>OBSTACLES THAT TURNED INTO BLESSINGS</strong></p>
<p id="p133" data-pid="133" class="sb">There was much excitement in 1963 because many brothers were preparing to attend another international assembly at Yankee Stadium in New York. This time about 500 were able to enjoy this grand experience. Then, on October 3-6 the same information was presented at a convention in Ponce.</p>
<p id="p134" data-pid="134" class="sb">Actually, the assembly was to have been held a week earlier. But a powerful organization of coffee growers had asked for the baseball park in Ponce, and by mistake the same dates had been assigned to the Witnesses and to the Coffee Growers Association. The Park Authority asked the Witnesses to <span id="page103" class="pageNum" data-no="103" data-before-text="103"></span>reschedule their convention. Much work had to be done to make the change and advise the brothers. Interestingly, however, the very week of the coffee growers’ convention a small hurricane passed close by Ponce and the roads became impassable. The following weekend the weather was just fine for our assembly.</p>
<p id="p135" data-pid="135" class="sb">Next we learned that the governor of Puerto Rico had scheduled a special ball game for Thursday night. Well, that, too, required extra work on our part. Our evening session was rescheduled for Friday morning. Following the afternoon session, the platform was removed and the brothers cleared the stadium. Then at about 6:00 p.m. a large truck ran into a light pole nearby, knocking out the transformer. There was no electricity in the ballpark Thursday evening, so there was no ball game, nor was there a lot of debris for us to clean up afterward.</p>
<p id="p136" data-pid="136" class="ss"><strong>SERVING WHERE THE NEED IS GREATER</strong></p>
<p id="p137" data-pid="137" class="sb">By 1964 there were 60 congregations reporting in Puerto Rico. Many of these were formed as a result of the work of special pioneers. During the 1960’s many native Puerto Ricans, both brothers and sisters, took up the special pioneer work. Having grown up among the people, they were more readily accepted in some communities than the missionaries were. These special pioneers were assigned to the smaller towns where missionaries had not been assigned, and in some cases they replaced missionaries who were being assigned elsewhere. Thus congregations sprang up in Isabela, Yauco, Arroyo, Ceiba, Dorado, Corozal, Naranjito, and many other towns.</p>
<p id="p138" data-pid="138" class="sb"><span id="page104" class="pageNum" data-no="104" data-before-text="104"></span>To build up these new congregations and to organize others, publishers were encouraged to move from the larger cities to places where the need was greater. Among those who accepted the invitation were Brother and Sister Bonifacio Ríos, who moved from San Juan to Aguas Buenas in the mountains to the west of Caguas. Working together, they were able to develop a book study group; then arrangements were made for a regular <em>Watchtower </em>Study. Finally, in November 1963, a congregation was formed.</p>
<p id="p139" data-pid="139" class="sb">Sister Ríos was already a pioneer. In time Brother Ríos also enrolled, and the two became special pioneers on the island of Vieques off the southeast coast of Puerto Rico. Now they are in the circuit work.</p>
<p id="p140" data-pid="140" class="sb">Manfredo Vencebí was another who wanted to serve where his help was most needed. So he and his wife along with their young sons left New York, where they had learned the truth, and settled in Guayanilla. Although he had a family, he was able to serve as a special pioneer. After a congregation was established in Guayanilla, they moved on to Guánica to help strengthen the congregation in that locality. When increased family responsibilities made it necessary for Manfredo to give up the special pioneer service, he took up regular pioneer work with the Yauco Congregation. From there the family moved to Canóvanas to build up that congregation. Their three boys are grown up now. All of them have served at Brooklyn Bethel, and one is still there with his wife. As for Manfredo, that desire to serve where the need is greater remains strong. <span id="page105" class="pageNum" data-no="105" data-before-text="105"></span>Though still rearing a teenage daughter, he is a circuit overseer.</p>
<p id="p141" data-pid="141" class="ss"><strong>WHERE TO HOLD AN INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION</strong></p>
<p id="p142" data-pid="142" class="sb">As 1966 arrived, there was much excitement in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Why? Because Puerto Rico had been selected as the location for one in a series of international conventions that would be held in Central and South America, reaching here in January of 1967.</p>
<p id="p143" data-pid="143" class="sb">But what facilities would be suitable? Only two places afforded adequate room. One was the spacious new Hiram Bithorn Municipal Stadium. The other was a deteriorating stadium called Sixto Escobar. Arrangements were made to use the Hiram Bithorn stadium. All seemed to be going well until it was realized that the baseball finals would be played the very week of the convention. So efforts were then made to use the older stadium. When the Parks Administrator learned of this, he disapproved. He felt that it was not appropriate to invite people from all over the world to a stadium that was a dilapidated wreck.</p>
<p id="p144" data-pid="144" class="sb">Finally, it was decided to try once more to obtain the Sixto Escobar stadium, trusting in Jehovah. Prayer was offered up to Jehovah, and then Brother Parkin picked up the phone and called the head man in the Parks Authority. As the phone rang, this very man, Julio Monagas, was standing right by it. The secretary handed him the phone, and on hearing our final plea, he gave consent. What rejoicing there was in the branch office! But there was a big job ahead to clean the place up and <span id="page106" class="pageNum" data-no="106" data-before-text="106"></span>make it presentable for the brothers and sisters expected.</p>
<p id="p145" data-pid="145" class="sb">This convention proved to be the biggest till that time for Puerto Rico. Three thousand visitors came from the United States and a few from other Caribbean countries. Caring for them all was a big job. The entire program was presented in both English and Spanish. For the first time, Bible dramas were part of the program, and the same cast put on the dramas for both language groups. Everything went smoothly for the five days, and all were delighted with the combined attendance of 8,604 on the final day. These had come from 19 countries and islands of the sea.</p>
<p id="p146" data-pid="146" class="ss"><strong>EXPANSION REQUIRES NEW BRANCH FACILITIES</strong></p>
<p id="p147" data-pid="147" class="sb">Conventions have been milestones in our theocratic history. And at the convention in 1968 we received a publication that has proved to be a powerful instrument in aiding honesthearted persons to make the truth their own. It is the study book <em>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life. </em>This book, referred to by the brothers as <em>“la bomba azul” </em>(the blue bomb), came to be greatly feared by clergymen of Christendom. After its release, book placements soared in one year from 64,000 to 167,000, and home Bible studies rose to one per publisher. There is hardly a home in Puerto Rico that does not have this book.</p>
<p id="p148" data-pid="148" class="sb">So much literature was coming into Puerto Rico from the Society’s factory in Brooklyn that there was just not enough room to store it till it could be moved out to the congregations. The garages to the <span id="page107" class="pageNum" data-no="107" data-before-text="107"></span>rear of the Bethel Home had been remodeled and converted into a stockroom, but now this was overflowing. Even the entranceway to the branch office was lined with cartons of books. So permission was received from the Society’s headquarters to look for property to build a new branch office, Bethel Home, and Kingdom Hall.</p>
<p id="p149" data-pid="149" class="sb">The new building was put up in its entirety by brothers. Certain ones worked every day; then at night and on weekends hundreds of volunteers came. Some 16 congregations took turns in preparing the midday meal for the work force. On April 29, 1969, after seven months of hard work, the branch office moved into its spacious new facilities. A few days later, Brother Knorr was present to share in the dedication program.</p>
<p id="p150" data-pid="150" class="ss"><strong>KINGDOM HALLS IN WHICH TO MEET</strong></p>
<p id="p151" data-pid="151" class="sb">With congregations growing rapidly and new ones being formed, there was an ever-increasing need for adequate meeting places. At first the congregations met in private homes. As the congregations grew, halls were rented. Some of them were in very bad condition and in need of much work to make them presentable. In Mayagüez a large hall was rented above a shoe store called <em>La Gloria, </em>so their place of meeting came to be known as <em>Los altos de la Gloria </em>(The High Place of Glory).</p>
<p id="p152" data-pid="152" class="sb">Then congregations began to build their own Kingdom Halls. Probably the first hall in Puerto Rico built by the brothers was the one in Saint Just, a rural congregation near the town of Carolina. Since then, other congregations have either built their own halls or remodeled houses or other <span id="page108" class="pageNum" data-no="108" data-before-text="108"></span>existing buildings, converting them into comfortable and attractive meeting places. About 140 Kingdom Halls have been built to date by the brothers in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Recently, two Kingdom Halls were built at right angles to each other on the same lot in Levittown; each is used by two congregations. And in Ponce a large two-story building was remodeled, with one Kingdom Hall on each floor, to accommodate another four congregations. Now, in Bayamón a complex of three Kingdom Halls has been built on one large lot to care for the needs of the Witnesses in that area.</p>
<p id="p153" data-pid="153" class="ss"><strong>INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION IN 1973</strong></p>
<p id="p154" data-pid="154" class="sb">In 1973 a contract was made for the use of the Hiram Bithorn Municipal Stadium for an international convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Most of the visitors came from the United States in 13 large jets, chartered flights of Pan American airways. Others came from various Caribbean islands. Transporting the brothers from the airport to their hotels and to and from the convention each day was a tremendous job. Also, special tours were organized so the visiting brothers could see some of the interesting things in San Juan and the countryside. One of the tours took the brothers to the famous mountain El Yunque, which has a rainfall of about 200 inches (510 cm) a year and luxuriant vegetation found nowhere else in the world.</p>
<p id="p155" data-pid="155" class="sb">As far as could be determined, there were over 7,000 visitors. In addition to the regular program, special English sessions were held in which brothers from the various Caribbean countries that were represented, as well as from Puerto Rico, put on interesting <span id="page109" class="pageNum" data-no="109" data-before-text="109"></span>programs to acquaint the visiting brothers with what had been done to further the Kingdom-preaching activity in their respective lands.</p>
<p id="p156" data-pid="156" class="sb">Despite heavy rain on the final day, this proved to be the biggest convention ever held in Puerto Rico till that time. A torrential downpour even enhanced the realism of the drama about the days of Noah. The seating capacity of the stadium is about 15,000, but a total of 30,840 packed the stadium and the area used for the English sessions. More recently, in 1983, even without the large international delegations, it was necessary to use three stadiums simultaneously to accommodate the large crowds that flock to these gatherings of Jehovah’s people!</p>
<p id="p157" data-pid="157" class="ss"><strong>PHENOMENAL INCREASE IN PUBLISHERS</strong></p>
<p id="p158" data-pid="158" class="sb">The 1970’s showed a tremendous increase in the number of Kingdom publishers. The 1970 service year began with 5,530 publishers. By March 1971 there were 8,000 publishers. At the time of the 1973 international convention, this figure was 11,206. New congregations were being formed every month. In June 1977 the number of publishers peaked at 16,761, and then came some decrease.</p>
<p id="p159" data-pid="159" class="sb">Apparently a number of publishers were serving Jehovah, not with eternity in view, but having in mind the year 1975. When their expectations regarding that year did not materialize, they cooled off in their love for Jehovah and abandoned his organization. The number of publishers fell to 14,775 in August 1978, a drop of almost 2,000 in one year. For three years the decrease continued. New ones were coming in, but more were going out. Besides, because of the difficult economic situation in <span id="page110" class="pageNum" data-no="110" data-before-text="110"></span>Puerto Rico, many were moving to the United States. At last, in January 1982 a new peak in publishers was reached once more.</p>
<p id="p160" data-pid="160" class="sb">Since then the Kingdom work has taken on renewed momentum. Publishers now number upwards of 21,700. And the intensity of the witness has increased as the number of pioneers has gone up. Since 1982 the total regular pioneers has more than doubled. Including the auxiliary pioneers, in Puerto Rico we average 1,535 in full-time service each month. In the Virgin Islands, too, nearly 10 percent of the publishers are in the pioneer service, and the zealous band of Kingdom proclaimers in those islands devoted upwards of 110,000 hours last year to making public proclamation of their confidence that God’s Kingdom is the only hope for humankind.</p>
<p id="p161" data-pid="161" class="ss"><strong>THE NEED FOR SUITABLE ASSEMBLY HALLS</strong></p>
<p id="p162" data-pid="162" class="sb">For many years circuit assemblies have been a regular feature of Kingdom activity. In the early days small halls were obtained for this purpose. As our numbers increased and the congregations became larger, small baseball parks were used. These are found in nearly every town in Puerto Rico. They may be used free of charge, but an enormous amount of work had to be done to make them presentable for an assembly. Often chairs had to be rented and trucked to the site to provide additional seating. Cafeteria facilities had to be installed. The brothers worked hard for several days prior to a circuit assembly. Sometimes large halls were rented, but usually these were just a shell; everything had to be brought <span id="page111" class="pageNum" data-no="111" data-before-text="111"></span>in. One time, an assembly was held in a town plaza, with the City Hall on one side and the Catholic church on the other. Rainy weather often disrupted our assemblies.</p>
<p id="p163" data-pid="163" class="sb">As time went on, it was getting increasingly difficult to obtain even these facilities. Frequently, when baseball parks were secured, the arrangements were later canceled to give priority to a sports event. So the brothers began to think seriously about building their own Assembly Halls.</p>
<p id="p164" data-pid="164" class="sb">On the south coast, between Ponce and Mayagüez, land was purchased. For several years while the brothers were raising needed funds and building the hall, they met under a metal roof at the building site, much as they had done in baseball parks. But here they did not have to set it all up and tear it down again for each assembly. Now they have a very fine Assembly Hall that accommodates over a thousand people.</p>
<p id="p165" data-pid="165" class="sb">East of Arecibo the brothers leased some land <span id="page112" class="pageNum" data-no="112" data-before-text="112"></span>where they put up temporary assembly facilities until they could build. However, the land did not prove to be suitable for a permanent assembly site, so other property was sought. Finally, in 1976 land was purchased in a rural area of Caguas, right next to a highway that was being built to link Ponce with San Juan. In due time, a comfortable Assembly Hall seating 1,500 people was erected here.</p>
<p id="p166" data-pid="166" class="sb">These two Assembly Halls now provide facilities for all the circuit assemblies in Puerto Rico. Attendances are unusually high, averaging over 160 percent of the total publishers.</p>
<p id="p167" data-pid="167" class="ss"><strong>LOOKING AHEAD</strong></p>
<p id="p168" data-pid="168" class="sb">Congregations are growing fast. Kingdom Halls are packed and overflowing. New congregations are being formed. New halls are being built and dedicated. In 1986, there were 57,328 present for the commemoration of the Lord’s Evening Meal.</p>
<p id="p169" data-pid="169" class="sb">There is now a ratio of one publisher to every 164 persons. Every nook and corner in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands is receiving a witness regularly. Some territories are worked every week or so. There is no unassigned territory. How many more will respond favorably to the Kingdom message we do not know, but the door is still open and the local organization of Jehovah’s people is geared for increase.</p>
<p id="p170" data-pid="170" class="sb">Certainly Puerto Rico has proved to be a “rich port” for over 21,700 persons who have found true riches, the kind that will lead to eternal life. May many more find these riches before Jehovah closes the door of opportunity when the “great tribulation” strikes.</p>

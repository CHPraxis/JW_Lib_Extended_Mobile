● How is the hour requirement determined for one who enrolls as a pioneer after the beginning of the service year?
Regular pioneers should meet the requirement of 1,000 hours when enrolled for a complete service year, which begins on September 1 and ends August 31. Pioneers starting after the beginning of the service year should meet an hour requirement proportionate to the number of months remaining in that service year. For example, one who starts regular pioneer service on March 1 will have pioneered six months by the conclusion of the service year on August 31 and would need to have reported a minimum of 500 hours.
Reporting 90 hours each month is a goal for which we strongly encourage pioneers to strive, regardless of when they begin. By scheduling 90 hours of field ministry each month, a pioneer should be able to attend assemblies and conventions as well as take vacation time without getting far behind in the yearly hour requirement. By holding to the 90-hour monthly schedule, he will not come under pressure because of having to overcome a sizable hour deficit as the service year draws to a close.
The circumstances of some pioneers, such as those doing seasonal work, may require them to vary their approach to meeting the yearly hour requirement. But each pioneer should keep a schedule that will enable him to meet the hour requirement by the end of the service year, whether 1,000 hours for the entire service year or that portion of 1,000 hours corresponding to the number of months he pioneered during the service year.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● An adequate supply of forms for use during the 1988 service year is being sent to each congregation. Since considerable expense is involved in printing and shipping, these forms should be used conservatively and only for their intended purpose. Some congregations have had to reorder forms before the end of the service year because so many were used improperly, such as for writing notes. Congregations should make other arrangements for scratch pads and not allow Society forms to be wasted.</p>

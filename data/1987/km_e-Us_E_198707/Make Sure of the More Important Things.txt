Make Sure of the More Important Things
1 The insert to the February 1987 issue of Our Kingdom Ministry announced arrangements starting September 1987 for a special assembly day to be scheduled for each circuit. Wholesome spiritual instruction that is needed for our times will be presented. In many cases it will be possible for a qualified Bethel speaker or district overseer to share in the program along with the circuit overseer and other capable elders in the circuit. Arrangements will also be made for a baptism.
2 The theme of the first special assembly day program will be “Make Sure of the More Important Things.” (Phil. 1:9, 10) Individuals who desire to put themselves in line for the deliverance that Jesus promised must act wisely and without delay. (Luke 21:28) They need help to get answers to their questions, overcome doubts, and take a firm stand for the truth. Practical information will be provided on how to direct new ones to the organization.
3 In addition to being diligent in helping Bible students to grow spiritually, each one of us also needs to continue making spiritual advancement. The program gives attention to this matter of serious concern by offering helpful suggestions along with a practical discussion to show just what can be accomplished by searching into the deeper things of God’s Word.​—1 Cor. 2:10.
4 A portion of the program will call attention to convincing evidence of our being adequately qualified to serve as God’s ministers. In the concluding part, you will hear interesting experiences and reports showing that Jehovah’s progressive organization is moving ahead, and you will be encouraged to keep pace with it.
5 Your circuit overseer will let you know what arrangements have been made for the special assembly day in your circuit. Make sure that you will be there for the full day’s program.

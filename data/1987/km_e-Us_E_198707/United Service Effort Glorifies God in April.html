<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">We Rejoice in New Peak of 746,956 Publishers</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">With one accord all of us, including many new ones, glorified Jehovah by giving a tremendous witness during April. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:6-45:15:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 15:6</a>) A few encouraging highlights of the report are given below:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="si">Total Publishers: 746,956. This all-time publisher peak is 2,037 over the number reporting last August, and 21,157 more than we had in April one year ago.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="si">Auxiliary and Regular Pioneers: These totaled 148,885, or 7,015 more than last April.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="si">Total Hours: 16,237,743. This is 823,855 hours more than our April 1986 peak.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="si">Return Visits: 5,465,816. A 7-percent increase, 380,151 more than our previous peak reached last April.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="si">Home Bible Studies: 549,023. An increase of 7,741 over our peak in March of this year and a 4.5-percent increase over last April.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">We obtained a total of 152,275 new subscriptions during April. That was 12,471 more than during last October’s subscription campaign.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">It is commendable to see that congregation publishers devoted more time to field service, averaging 10.1 hours per publisher for the month.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Surely Jehovah is pleased with the effort put forth by new ones along with experienced publishers, old and young alike, in making known the good news and in bringing praise to him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:12-19:145:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 145:12, 13</a>.</p>

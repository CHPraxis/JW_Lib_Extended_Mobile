Comfort in Trying Times
That is what so many of us need. A woman from Ohio explains where she found such comfort:
“I just have to write to express my appreciation for the recordings of the Scriptures I am enjoying today for the first time.
“I have never had anyone sit down and quietly read the Bible to me, like a loving mother. No wonder children love to be read to! How comforting, calming, and reassuring it is when we need it so much in the times we’re living in.
“Please be certain of my heartfelt thanks for providing such a welcome aid.”
This woman had obtained the cassette recordings of the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, which are now available in attractive brown vinyl albums. The album, complete with the entire “New Testament” (18 cassettes), is $30. Two albums of the “Old Testament” are also available, the first has Genesis through Ruth on 18 cassettes and is $30; the second album has 21 cassettes containing 1 Samuel through Psalms and is $33.25.
Please indicate by marking the respective boxes what cassette albums you want, and remit the designated amount of money.

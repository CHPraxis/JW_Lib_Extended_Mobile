<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The 1987 service year came to a close in August with a new peak of 773,219 publishers. This is an increase of 26,263 over last April’s report. Truly this gives us cause for rejoicing. The new peak of 53,143 regular pioneers in the field is an additional cause for rejoicing. As we move forward in the ministry, may we continue to put our trust in Jehovah’s holy name!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:33:21-19:33:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 33:21</a>.</p>

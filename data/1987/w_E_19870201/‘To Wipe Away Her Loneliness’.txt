‘To Wipe Away Her Loneliness’
A man on a work assignment in the Sultanate of Oman wrote the branch office of the Watch Tower Society in India. “A few days back,” he said, “I happened to see the book Happiness​—How to Find It in the house of one of my friends here. Needless to say the book as a whole is a real asset. To be frank, this small book influenced me a lot, and I want to present this very loving book to my wife as a wedding anniversary gift to wipe away her present loneliness. Kindly favour me by sending a copy of this book to my wife on my behalf as early as possible. Her address is given above.”
This 192-page book not only provides encouraging help in dealing with stressful situations but points the way to the lasting solutions to problems of life.
Please send me, postpaid, the hardbound book Happiness​—How to Find It. I enclose $1 (U.S.).

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">AN African man called Isaac, along with several other men, broke away from the Apostolic Church of his village because it did not practice what it preached. Later all, including their wives, became Jehovah’s Witnesses​—except Isaac. They decided to visit him and tell him they had found the truth. Isaac, meanwhile, had become a successful witch doctor and had several wives. After studying the brochure <em>Enjoy Life on Earth Forever! </em>dealing with his life-style, Isaac gave up his witch-doctor practice, which was very lucrative, and also his wives except his senior one. He legalized his marriage to his senior wife, then 63 (he was 68). He says he feels “very happy and free, no longer in fear of the spirits.”</p>

Attend the 1987 “Trust in Jehovah” District Convention
WHAT a fine theme we have for our 1987 district conventions: “Trust in Jehovah”! Surely our trusting in Jehovah sets us apart from the rest of the world. All others put their trust in such things as their riches, their wisdom, their might, or their political and religious rulers and leaders. Soon all such will come to bitter disappointment.​—Psalm 146:3, 4.
What does it mean to put our trust in someone or something? According to lexicographers, “trust implies an absolute and assured resting on something or someone.”a Yes, and that is the way we feel about it. We absolutely and assuredly rest our confidence in Jehovah.
The importance of trusting in Jehovah is called to our attention ever so often in God’s Word. The psalmists repeatedly tell of their trusting in Jehovah: “But as for me, in Jehovah I do trust.” “In you I have put my trust, O Jehovah.” Their expressions call to mind the words of one of our Kingdom songs: “Jehovah is our refuge,/​Our God in whom we trust . . . Jehovah is a stronghold,/​A haven for all the just.”​—Psalm 31:6, 14.
The Scriptures time and again command us to put our trust in God: “Trust in Jehovah and do good.” “Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding.” (Psalm 37:3; Proverbs 3:5) God’s Word also tells us of Jehovah’s faithful servants who were rewarded because they put their trust in him during times of great peril. Among such were King Hezekiah, Ebed-Melech, the three Hebrews, and Daniel.​—2 Kings 18:5; Jeremiah 39:18; Daniel 3:28; 6:23.
How do we show that we trust in Jehovah? One way is by getting to know him and taking him at his Word. Jesus Christ gave us a very simple formula: “Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.” Yes, if we trust in Jehovah with all our heart, we will put the interests of his Kingdom first in our lives and follow a course of upright conduct.​—Matthew 6:33.
Why does our trust in Jehovah need to be strong? Because of the pressures brought against us on every hand. For some it is outright persecution, for others temptations to wrongdoing. Still others have their trust tested by the requirement of endurance. Our coming district convention is among the many helps that Jehovah has provided in these last days.
This year the convention will be for three full days, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. By adjustments in the length of the sessions, the program will virtually contain the same amount of material as last year. The purpose of all the features of the program, we may be sure, will be to strengthen our trust in Jehovah as well as in the visible organization he is using at the present time.
So let each Christian witness of Jehovah be resolved to attend at least one of these conventions. Bring your children. Be on hand for the opening song and prayer on Friday morning and remain until the closing song and prayer on Sunday afternoon. Come prepared with Bible, songbook, notebook, and pencil. Enter fully into the spirit of what is presented, including the songs and prayers. Pay close attention to what is being presented. And let us make certain that at all times our grooming and our conduct are above reproach.
The Scriptural principle ‘sow bountifully, reap bountifully’ applies to our attending the “Trust in Jehovah” District Convention. The more earnest we are in taking in the entire program, the more blessings we will carry away from the convention and the greater blessing we will be to others.​—2 Corinthians 9:6.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A man on a work assignment in the Sultanate of Oman wrote the branch office of the Watch Tower Society in India. “A few days back,” he said, “I happened to see the book <em>Happiness​—How to Find It </em>in the house of one of my friends here. Needless to say the book as a whole is a real asset. To be frank, this small book influenced me a lot, and I want to present this very loving book to my wife as a wedding anniversary gift to wipe away her present loneliness. Kindly favour me by sending a copy of this book to my wife on my behalf as early as possible. Her address is given above.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This 192-page book not only provides encouraging help in dealing with stressful situations but points the way to the lasting solutions to problems of life.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Please send me, postpaid, the hardbound book <em>Happiness​—How to Find It. </em>I enclose $1 (U.S.).</p>

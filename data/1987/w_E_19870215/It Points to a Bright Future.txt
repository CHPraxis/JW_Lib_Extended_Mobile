It Points to a Bright Future
Gloom and doom are so often the forecasts as the world faces one crisis after another. What a contrasting message in the new book Worldwide Security Under the “Prince of Peace”! “Upon opening it, a look of sheer delight sprang to my eyes,” writes one reader. “The illustrations are so beautifully thought-provoking, and how delightfully the final illustration depicts the entire universe at peace.”
She continues: “My heart is so full of gladness over this book. I just could not help but excitedly read out loud portions of it to my husband, and now I cannot put the little book​—with the big message—​down, but keep drinking from it as often as possible during the day. It is more refreshing than the coolest mountain stream.”

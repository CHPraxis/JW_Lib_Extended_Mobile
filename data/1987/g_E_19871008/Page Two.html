<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The beauty, variety, and design in creation lead many to believe there must be an intelligent Creator. Yet, for many others, the biggest stumbling block to their belief in God is the existence of suffering and evil in the world. If ‘God is love,’ why does he allow so many bad things to happen to good people? Are there valid reasons for God’s permitting evil? Is there reason to believe that evil will end in the near future?</p>

Glaciers​—“Awesome Ice”
GLACIERS are formed when massive amounts of unmelted snow, crystals closely packed together, accumulate on mountainsides. This type is called a valley glacier. When the pileup becomes very heavy, its weight starts to slide the ice mass downward toward a valley or the sea. Icebergs are great chunks of glacier ice that have fallen off the tip of the glacier into the sea.
Some valley glaciers are as large as great rivers. Indeed, they are “ice rivers.” Other forms, called continental glaciers, cover vast areas, such as we see in Antarctica and Greenland.
They are all storehouses of frozen water that produce “the sparkle of awesome ice,” another creation of Jehovah.​—Ezekiel 1:22; Job 37:10.

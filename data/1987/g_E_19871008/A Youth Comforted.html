<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Late one summer, Denise became friends with a fellow lifeguard. When this friend was young her mother had died. And recently she had lost her father in death. “I sent her a six-month gift subscription for the <em>Awake!” </em>Denise explained. A couple of months later, Denise received the following letter from her friend:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I read the first two issues of <em>Awake! </em>and two of the articles really helped me. One was on finding comfort after losing someone close and the other was on ways to overcome depression. I can’t tell you how much they have helped me. The latter quoted <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:7-50:4:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Philippians 4:7</a>, ‘The peace of God that excels all thought will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.’ Reading that immediately gave me new hope. Thank you so much for subscribing me to <em>Awake!”</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Do you know someone who could benefit from the <em>Awake! </em>magazine? Why not send them a gift subscription? You can do so by simply filling out and mailing us the coupon, enclosing $5 with the coupon.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Please send a gift subscription of one year for <em>Awake! </em>to the following person, as well as a letter explaining that it is a gift from‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐(your name). I enclose $5 (U.S.).</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">GLACIERS are formed when massive amounts of unmelted snow, crystals closely packed together, accumulate on mountainsides. This type is called a valley glacier. When the pileup becomes very heavy, its weight starts to slide the ice mass downward toward a valley or the sea. Icebergs are great chunks of glacier ice that have fallen off the tip of the glacier into the sea.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Some valley glaciers are as large as great rivers. Indeed, they are “ice rivers.” Other forms, called continental glaciers, cover vast areas, such as we see in Antarctica and Greenland.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">They are all storehouses of frozen water that produce “the sparkle of awesome ice,” another creation of Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:1:22-26:1:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezekiel 1:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:37:10-18:37:10" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Job 37:10</a>.</p>

“Trust in Jehovah” District Convention​—Do Not Miss It!
Three full, rewarding days of Bible instruction and wholesome Christian association await you at the “Trust in Jehovah” District Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses. During June, July, and August, over 125 conventions are scheduled throughout the United States alone, so there will be one not far from your home. Plan to be present from the opening session beginning at 10:20 a.m. Friday, and stay until the concluding session Sunday afternoon.
The opening session will feature the informative talk “A People Set Apart From the World.” In the afternoon, frank and pointed counsel will be directed to parents and then to youths. Youths will be helped to guard against living what could be called a double life. Then this matter will be highlighted in a heart-moving modern-day drama.
Saturday morning will feature the discourse on dedication and baptism, as well as instruction on the ways we can manifest our trust in Jehovah, in keeping with the convention theme. “Responsible Childbearing in This Time of the End” will be a principal address on the afternoon program, which will conclude with a symposium of talks on the theme “The Word of God Is Alive.”
The Sunday program will feature the discourse “Detest Utterly the World’s Disgraceful Course,” as well as a full-costume Bible drama illustrating the urgency of our times. In the afternoon, the public talk “In Our Fearful Times, Whom Can You Really Trust?” will be another highlight of the convention.

There is great disparity in health services available worldwide.  In some places these are very extensive and highly scientific. In other parts of the world, they hardly meet basic needs, or they do not exist. Yet, even when health services are highly developed, they still fall behind in prevention as well as curing of diseases.
Will basic health services be available for all in the foreseeable future? What hope is there for a complete cure and total prevention of all diseases?

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">Have you found the recent issues of <em>The Watchtower </em>to be of practical value? Then see if you can recall the following:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>□ What does it mean to be marked for survival by the prophetic man with the secretary’s inkhorn in Ezekiel’s vision? (</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:9:2-26:9:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Ezekiel 9:2-6</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">It means that one has dedicated oneself to God to do his will, has been baptized as a disciple of Jesus Christ, and has put on the Christlike personality.​—4/15, pages 11, 12.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>□ What purposes are served by Bible prophecy?</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">Prophecies make known the truth about God, his will, and his moral standards. They clarify man’s relationship to Jehovah so as to bring mankind back into harmony with His purpose, leading up to its full accomplishment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:18-23:1:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 1:18-20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:1-23:2:5" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2:1-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:8-23:55:11" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 55:8-11</a>)​—5/1, page 5.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>□ What death-dealing famine pervades the whole earth today?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">A spiritual famine, “for hearing the words of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:8:11-30:8:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Amos 8:11</a>)​—5/1, pages 10, 11.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>□ What is “the fear of Jehovah”? (</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:7-20:1:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Proverbs 1:7</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">It is a wholesome dread of displeasing Jehovah because we appreciate his loving-kindness and goodness. It also means acknowledging Jehovah as the Supreme Judge and the Almighty, trusting in him completely, and hating what is bad in his sight. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:2:11-19:2:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 2:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:115:11-19:115:11" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 115:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:13-20:8:13" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Proverbs 8:13</a>)​—5/15, page 28.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>□ What guidelines are outlined in </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:1-54:5:25" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>1 Timothy 5</strong></a> <strong>regarding caring for the elderly?</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn">Though family members bear first responsibility, the problems of the elderly are the concern of the entire congregation; their care should be properly organized; such care should be limited to those truly in need.​—6/1, pages 9, 10.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn"><strong>□ In what four general ways has Jehovah refined his people during the past 69 years?</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn">(1) Organizationally; (2) sharing in the field ministry; (3) increasing light of truth; (4) discarding unclean practices.​—6/15, pages 17-20.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"><strong>□ In what two ways is the word “stand” used in relation to Michael in </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:1-27:12:1" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>Daniel 12:1</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sn">Michael is described as “standing in behalf of the sons of your people.” Christ Jesus has been exercising authority in this regard on behalf of his people on earth since 1914 when he was enthroned as the reigning King of God’s Kingdom. Daniel also says: “And during that time Michael will stand up.” This refers to his rulership’s entering a new phase in which he will yet act in an outstanding way to save Daniel’s people. Thus, they will not be annihilated by the human governments at “the time of the end” for the king of the north and the king of the south. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:40-27:11:45" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Daniel 11:40-45</a>)​—7/1, pages 18, 19.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Millions of families have enjoyed <em>My Book of Bible Stories. </em>Its 116 Bible accounts give the reader an idea of what the Bible is all about. Earlier this year a person in Western Australia illustrated how effective the book is, explaining:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I am a teacher by profession and seek to inspire the children under my care to devote all their schoolwork to God and Jesus, as I do likewise in my work for the children. I have made it a point of duty to read to the class your ‘Book of Bible Stories’ that I purchased from one of your calling Witnesses. The children love the book, the stories in it, and beg for more when I put the book down.”</p>

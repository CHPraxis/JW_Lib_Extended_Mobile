<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“THE sign of the cross has been a symbol of great antiquity, present in nearly every known culture. Its meaning has eluded anthropologists, though its use in funerary art could well point to a defense against evil. On the other hand, the famous <em>crux ansata </em>of Egypt, depicted coming from the mouth, must refer to life or breath. The universal use of the sign of the cross makes more poignant the striking lack of crosses in early Christian remains, especially any specific reference to the event on Golgotha. Most scholars now agree that the cross, as an artistic reference to the passion event, cannot be found prior to the time of Constantine.”​—<em>Ante Pacem—​Archaeological Evidence of Church Life Before Constantine </em>(1985), by Professor Graydon F. Snyder, page 27.</p>

‘Children Just Love It’
Millions of families have enjoyed My Book of Bible Stories. Its 116 Bible accounts give the reader an idea of what the Bible is all about. Earlier this year a person in Western Australia illustrated how effective the book is, explaining:
“I am a teacher by profession and seek to inspire the children under my care to devote all their schoolwork to God and Jesus, as I do likewise in my work for the children. I have made it a point of duty to read to the class your ‘Book of Bible Stories’ that I purchased from one of your calling Witnesses. The children love the book, the stories in it, and beg for more when I put the book down.”
Are there children you know who also would enjoy My Book of Bible Stories? You can receive a copy by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon. The book has 256 pages, the same page size as this magazine. It has over 125 large illustrations, most of them in beautiful color.

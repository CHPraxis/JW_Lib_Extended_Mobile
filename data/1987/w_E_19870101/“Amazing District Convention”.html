<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THIS was the headline of a newspaper in Martinez de la Torre, Veracruz, Mexico, about a convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses held in that city. The newspaper commented: “The large attendance at the district convention of [Jehovah’s Witnesses] held at the local Exposition Grounds is the most eloquent demonstration of an outstanding happening all over the world in our days: the increasing distrust people have in the doctrines of the so-called ‘Christian’ churches and the firm conviction that the magnitude of the problems alarmingly transcends the power of governments to solve them.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Never has a political meeting or social event gathered such a crowd displaying such order and cleanliness. It was simply amazing to see 5,000 people carefully following a program built exclusively around information from the Bible and dealing with aspects of daily life from raising children and living together as a family to morality and spiritual health, along with Bible story dramatization and its application in modern times.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">After commenting on the “overwhelming demonstration of coordinated efficiency and organization,” the news report observed: “The importance of the activity carried out by the local Jehovah’s Witnesses can be measured by the results that have been obtained in just a few years. Today it is an association that grows by leaps and bounds, that worries not at all about the negative comments that usually surround them. Whatever negative thing that could be attributed to them becomes nonexistent when one observes their stand on the things that surround them, the orderly way in which they expand, their respect for authority, and the great appreciation they have for cleanliness and good speech.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“These Bible students are made up almost 100 percent of former activists of different religions, mostly Catholics, that have noticed religion’s drifting toward politics and its acceptance and approval of un-Biblical practices like interfaith, immorality, and violence. It has been a source of satisfaction for them to conform to Scriptural principles of conduct without resorting to idolatry or traditions of obscure origin. This has given them a praiseworthy unity of faith that seems to distinguish them wherever they are found.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">These comments remind us of the principle that Jesus stated: “By their fruits you will recognize them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:16-40:7:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 7:16</a>) Many honesthearted ones in Mexico are recognizing the Scripturalness of the teachings of Jehovah’s Witnesses, are associating with them, and are being richly blessed spiritually by Jehovah God.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Not long ago the following letter was received by the publishers of <em>The Watchtower:</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sg">“Dear Sir:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Last month in Philadelphia my teenage daughter had her wallet stolen from her backpack bookbag. Last week in the mail she received a package containing her wallet and her license and other important cards. The package was sent by someone who wished not to be identified, except that the package also contained a copy of your publication <em>The Watchtower. </em>Whoever did this act of brotherly love (from the city of brotherly love) went to some trouble and expense to return the wallet to my daughter. My family and I are grateful to this kind person . . . it was a great way to ‘witness,’ especially to my teenagers (3 of them).”</p>

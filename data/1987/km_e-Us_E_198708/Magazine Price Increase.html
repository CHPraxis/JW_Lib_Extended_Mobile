The price to pioneers will increase from 10¢ to 15¢. The September 1 and September 8 issues should be charged for and placed at the new rates, even though received and distributed in August. There will be no change in the requesting of pioneer credit for magazines, as the amount of credit per magazine remains the same.</p>

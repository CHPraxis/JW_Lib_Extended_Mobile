Magazine Price Increase
Beginning with the September 1987 issues, the price of distributors’ magazines to the congregation and the public will increase from 20¢ to 25¢. The price to pioneers will increase from 10¢ to 15¢. The September 1 and September 8 issues should be charged for and placed at the new rates, even though received and distributed in August. There will be no change in the requesting of pioneer credit for magazines, as the amount of credit per magazine remains the same.
The new subscription rate effective September 1 will be $5.00 for each one-year subscription or $2.50 for a six-month subscription. The rate for magazines published monthly will be $2.50 for each one-year subscription. Pioneers will pay one half the subscription rate.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IMAGINE my surprise when I heard the strange sound of tinkling bells, a violin, and people dancing outside an ancient inn in the Cotswold village of Broadway, England. As I drew closer, I saw groups of dancing men dressed in white, wearing straw hats bedecked with flowers and ribbons, with little bells tinkling harmoniously from their shins. They were Morris dancers. I was watching a custom that goes back hundreds of years. Intrigued, I decided to find out more about this strange all-male dancing.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One source says the name Morris comes from the Spanish <em>morisco, </em>meaning “Moorish.” Some believe it was developed from the <em>morisco </em>dance, or Spanish fandango. Although in England it goes back at least to the time of Henry VII (1457-1509), it became popular in village festivities during the reign of Henry VIII (1509-47). Similar dances are common in other parts of Europe, the Middle East, India, and areas of Central and South America. But what do the Morris dances represent?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><em>The New Encyclopædia Britannica </em>explains that a common feature of many of them is a group of dancing men “attendant on a pagan god who celebrates his revival after death. Often the dancers wear white clothes and dance with bells fastened to the legs or body. A feeling that the dances have magic power or bring luck persists wherever they are traditionally performed.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">A variation of the Morris dance is the horn dance held annually at Abbots Bromley in Staffordshire, England. The same encyclopedia explains: “This dance-procession includes six animal-men bearing deer antlers . . . a man-woman, or Maid Marian, and a fool, both carrying phallic symbols.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Although for many Morris dancing may seem to be an innocent pastime, it is wise for conscientious Christians to be aware of its origin.​—<em>Awake! </em>staff writer.</p>

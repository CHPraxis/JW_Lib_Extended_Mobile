For instance, God’s servants were stoned and slaughtered with the sword. They suffered ill-treatment and tribulation. Yet they did not waver in faith.

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Faith is not mere belief; it must be proved by works or actions.

For instance, by the faith of Joshua and others “the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days.” But “by faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with those [faithless residents of Jericho] who acted <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>disobediently.” Why? “Because she received the [Israelite] spies in a peaceable way,” proving her faith by hiding them from the Canaanites. Rahab’s faith had a solid basis in reports that “Jehovah dried up the waters of the Red Sea” from before the Israelites and granted them victory over Amorite kings Sihon and Og. Rahab made proper moral changes and was blessed for her active faith by being preserved along with her household when Jericho fell and by becoming an ancestress of Jesus Christ.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:2:1-6:2:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Joshua 2:1-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:6:20-6:6:23" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 6:20-23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:1-40:1:1" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Matthew 1:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:5-40:1:5" data-bid="5-4" class="b"> 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:24-59:2:26" data-bid="5-5" class="b"> James 2:24-26</a>.</p>

Thus, by faith and with a band of only 300 men, Judge Gideon was empowered by God to crush the military might of the oppressive Midianites.

True, he eventually became their blinded captive. But Samson brought death to many of them when he pulled down the pillars of the house in which they were presenting a great sacrifice to their false god Dagon. Yes, Samson died with those Philistines but not as a despairing suicide. In faith he relied upon Jehovah and prayed to him for the strength needed to wreak vengeance upon those foes of God and His people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:16:18-7:16:30" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Judges 16:18-30</a>) Jephthah, to whom Jehovah granted victory over the Ammonites, also displayed faith that gave evidence of his complete reliance upon Jehovah.

Why? “In order that they might not be made perfect apart from” Jesus’ anointed followers, for whom “God foresaw something better”​—immortal heavenly life and privileges of corulership with Christ Jesus. By their resurrection, beginning after the Kingdom’s establishment in 1914, anointed Christians are “made perfect” in the heavens before Jehovah’s witnesses of pre-Christian times are resurrected on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:50-46:15:57" data-bid="44-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:50-57;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:1-66:12:5" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> Revelation 12:1-5</a>) For those earlier witnesses, being “made perfect” must relate to their earthly resurrection, their eventually being “set free from enslavement to corruption,” and their attaining human perfection through the services of the High Priest Jesus Christ and his 144,000 heavenly underpriests during his Millennial Reign.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:20-45:8:21" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Romans 8:20, 21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:26-58:7:26" data-bid="45-2" class="b"> Hebrews 7:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:1-66:14:1" data-bid="45-3" class="b"> Revelation 14:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:4-66:20:6" data-bid="45-4" class="b"> 20:4-6</a>.</p>

<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">17, 18. (a) To succeed in our race for eternal life, what must we do? (b) How is Jesus Christ the “Perfecter of our faith”?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>Having discussed the acts of pre-Christian witnesses of Jehovah, Paul <span id="page20" class="pageNum" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>pointed to the prime example of faith. (<em>Read </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:1-58:12:3" data-bid="46-1" class="b"><em>Hebrews 12:1-3</em></a><em>.</em>) What a source of encouragement to have ‘so great a cloud of witness bearers surrounding us’! This prompts us to put off every weight that would impede our spiritual progress. It helps us to avoid the sin of loss or lack of faith and to run with endurance the Christian race for everlasting life. To reach our goal, however, we must do something more. But what is that?</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>18 </sup>If we are to succeed in our race for eternal life in God’s new system, we need to “look intently at the Chief Agent [or, Chief Leader] and Perfecter of our faith, Jesus.” The faith of Abraham and other integrity keepers living prior to Jesus Christ’s earthly ministry was imperfect, incomplete, in that they did not understand then unfulfilled prophecies about the Messiah. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:10-60:1:12" data-bid="47-1" class="b">1 Peter 1:10-12</a>.) But by Jesus’ birth, ministry, death, and resurrection, many Messianic prophecies were fulfilled. Thus faith in a perfected sense “arrived” through Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:24-48:3:25" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Galatians 3:24, 25</a>) Moreover, from his heavenly position Jesus continued to be the Perfecter of the faith of his followers, as when pouring out upon them the holy spirit at Pentecost of 33 C.E. and by revelations that progressively developed their faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:32-44:2:33" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Acts 2:32, 33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:17-45:10:17" data-bid="49-2" class="b"> Romans 10:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:1-66:1:2" data-bid="49-3" class="b"> Revelation 1:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:16-66:22:16" data-bid="49-4" class="b"> 22:16</a>) How thankful we are for this “Faithful Witness,” this “Chief Leader” of Jehovah’s Witnesses!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:5-66:1:5" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Revelation 1:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:10-40:23:10" data-bid="50-2" class="b"> Matthew 23:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">19. Why should Jesus be ‘considered closely’?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>19 </sup>Since it is not easy to endure the reproaches of the faithless, Paul urged: “Consider closely the one [Jesus] who has endured such contrary talk by sinners against their own interests, that you may not get tired and give out in your souls.” Indeed, if we keep our eyes fixed on “the Faithful Witness,” Jesus Christ, we will never tire of doing the divine will.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:34-43:4:34" data-bid="51-1" class="b">John 4:34</a>.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">20. What are some things you have learned about faith by considering <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:1-58:12:3" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:1–12:3</a>?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>From the ‘great cloud of witnesses’ we learn much about the facets of faith. For instance, faith like that of Abel enhances our appreciation for Jesus’ sacrifice. True faith makes us courageous witnesses, even as Enoch boldly spoke Jehovah’s message. As with Noah, our faith moves us to follow God’s instructions closely and serve as preachers of righteousness. Abraham’s faith impresses us with the need to obey God and trust in His promises, even though some of them have not yet been fulfilled. Moses’ example shows that faith enables us to keep unspotted by this world and stand loyally by Jehovah’s people. Exploits of Israel’s judges, kings, and prophets prove that faith in God can sustain us amid persecution and trials. And how grateful we are that the superlative example of Jesus Christ makes our faith firm and unshakable! Therefore, with Jesus as our Leader and in the strength of our God, let us continue to manifest enduring faith as Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>

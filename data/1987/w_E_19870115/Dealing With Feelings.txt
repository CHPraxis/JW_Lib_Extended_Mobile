Dealing With Feelings
To deal with our feelings successfully is a real challenge. A youth tells her experience: “I was feeling happy, but the next minute I was in a deep depression. Sometimes I didn’t even know what I was feeling. It was as if I was completely lost in the dark. I couldn’t express myself and what my emotions were no matter who I talked to, not even to myself. I felt like I wasn’t getting attention from people around me, especially my schoolmates, because I wasn’t attractive enough. Eventually all these feelings were killing me inside, and I began hating myself and my personality.”
The girl got a copy of the book Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. “It was all very interesting,” she writes, “so I wanted to read the chapter ‘Moving into Womanhood.’ I couldn’t believe what I was reading because the chapter described exactly how I’ve felt lately, and it gave the answer. It was so encouraging to read that it was not so unusual to feel this way. I just have to know the right way to handle it.”
Besides helping youths to deal with their feelings, this book discusses such matters as masturbation, and it answers the questions, Should youths drink alcoholic beverages? and, Should they have sex relations before marriage? Receive a copy for only $1 by filling in and mailing the coupon.

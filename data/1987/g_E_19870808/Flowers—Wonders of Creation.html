<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHAT a wonder it is to plant seeds of different kinds in the same soil and then later see flowers of such variety and beauty! Their gorgeous displays of color, and their fragrance, are a delight!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">True, some may say that the color and fragrance of flowers are necessary to attract insects that pollinate the plants. But if that were the only reason for such beauty, variety, and fragrance, why is it that flowers are such a source of delight for humans? Why are they also such a source of peace of mind and well-being for us?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Without a doubt, hearts are gladdened by the sight of flowers. A colorful bouquet can immediately brighten the day of a wife or a mother, cheer a sick friend, lift a depressed heart, even cause friendship to sprout and love to flourish. Walking through a field decorated with flowers surely is enriching. And what window has not been beautified or kitchen enhanced or living room transformed by the presence of lovely, delicate flowers? How much less pleasant the world would be without flowers!</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The 250,000 varieties of flowers did not just happen. They are an expression of the love that our Creator, Jehovah God, has for the human family. And although the earth today is marred by man, the time is soon coming when it will be restored to the Paradise that God purposed for it. Then, as God’s inspired Word foretells: “The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad, the desert shall rejoice and blossom; like the crocus it shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice with joy and singing.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:1-23:35:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 35:1, 2</a>, <em>Revised Standard Version.</em></p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE collision of birds with commercial airliners has been not only costly to airlines but dangerous as well. In an effort to reduce the number of such midair collisions, Japanâ€™s All-Nippon Airways has discovered a novel way to frighten away birds flying perilously close to their planes. How?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">By painting menacing-looking eyes on the engine intakes of its jet aircraft, notes <em>International Wildlife </em>magazine. The article explains that the airline painted eyes on 26 of its large-body aircraft and left the remaining aircraft unpainted. At the conclusion of the one-year experiment, an average of only one bird had hit each of the engines painted with the menacing-looking eyes. In contrast, an average of <em>nine </em>birds had struck the unpainted jet engines.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The damage during the one-year test period was estimated to be $720,000, down from $910,000. Because of the success of the experiment, All-Nippon Airways plans to have the eyes painted on all its large-body aircraft.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">On September 2, 1986, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) released a series of stamps depicting historical German coins. The first in the series is shown below. The coin depicted is dated 1633. However, of particular interest are the four radiant Hebrew characters shown imprinted on the coin. What do they mean? <em>Briefmarkenwelt, </em>a German magazine on philately, gives this explanation: “Two angels, suspended over the town profile, are carrying between them the name Jehovah.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">During the 16th and 17th centuries, it was very common to mint such coins in Europe. A German encyclopedia dated 1838 remarks: “The term Jehovah-coins includes all coins and medals that depict the word יהוה, Jehovah, as radiating, either alone or together with the word Jesus, . . . often with the motto in reference thereto; since this is primarily found on many Talers [silver coins issued by various German states between the 15th and 19th centuries], they have been classed together under the name Jehovah-talers.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Likely, most people using the stamps do not know that the Hebrew letters represent the name of God. But Jehovah’s Witnesses are happy to point out this feature on the stamp and to explain the meaning and importance of Jehovah’s name. Thus, from an unexpected quarter they are helped to “praise the name of Jehovah.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:135:1-19:135:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 135:1</a>.</p>

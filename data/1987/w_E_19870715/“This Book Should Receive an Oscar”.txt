“This Book Should Receive an Oscar”
The following letter was received from East Orange, New Jersey, U.S.A.
“Dear Sir:
“I recently had the pleasure of reading the book Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? I picked it up by accident while working in the mail room on my job. And I thought the book was just fascinating. The people who composed this wonderful piece of work deserve to be complimented. I don’t give out free compliments, but they certainly have my sincere compliments.
“I have two lovely daughters, eleven and seven years of age. I’m certain this book would prove to be a valuable instrument in the primary education they are now receiving. The book was very well written with large print​—great for Dear Old Dad’s eyes. This book should receive an Oscar [an award] because it is colorful, superbly illustrated and masterfully laid out. . . . Please tell me where and how to order. I want three copies, so please send some order forms and the price as soon as possible.”

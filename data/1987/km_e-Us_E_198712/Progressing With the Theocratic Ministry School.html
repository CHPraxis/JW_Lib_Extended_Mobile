<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>We rejoice greatly that Jehovah has given us “the tongue of the taught ones.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:50:4-23:50:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 50:4</a>) The Theocratic Ministry School has been an important teaching instrument that Jehovah has used to provide us with theocratic education for more than 44 years. Now we have our new Theocratic Ministry School Schedule. Have you carefully reviewed the instructions for the school during 1988?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The No. 1 assignment, Bible highlights, and No. 2 talk will follow the same pattern as during the previous year. But talks No. 3 and 4 will differ in that they will take us into two teaching aids we use extensively in the field ministry, namely, <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth </em>and <em>Reasoning From the Scriptures.</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>The No. 3 talk will be based alternately on the <em>Reasoning </em>book and the <em>Live Forever </em>book. When based on the <em>Live Forever </em>book, it should be assigned primarily to sisters who are new in the truth or younger in years. This will give them valuable experience and familiarity with this field instrument. The No. 4 talk will be regularly based on the <em>Reasoning </em>book.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>As we prepare for the school each week, our progressively covering the <em>Reasoning </em>book will enable us to become much more familiar with what it contains, and then we will more readily think of using it when questions or objections arise. This will help us to become more effective in the field ministry as our educated tongue speaks the truth with greater persuasiveness.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:2-44:17:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 17:2, 3</a>.</p>

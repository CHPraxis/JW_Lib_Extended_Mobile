Now You Have Help!
Have you ever been asked questions about the Bible you wished you could answer? Now a Bible handbook is available. A minister from England called it “of invaluable use,” explaining:
“The information on the main subjects, such as Armageddon, Creation, Evolution, Fate, Kingdom, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Last Days, Suffering, and Wickedness, are so useful in explaining Bible truths to people.”
You can now receive a personal copy of this valuable Bible handbook for only $1.25.
Please send, postpaid, the hardcover, 448-page handbook Reasoning From the Scriptures. I enclose $1.25 (U.S.).

A Catholic Enjoys It
One of Jehovah’s Witnesses had a flat tire in a rural area of Virginia, U.S.A. A house was nearby, and she knocked on the door. The lady of the house let her in to call for road service. Later the Witness sent a thank-you note, enclosing a gift copy of the book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. The following, in part, is the reply she received:
“I shall be very frank and honest with you. I am a Roman Catholic. And whenever anyone comes to my door with Watchtower or any other tracts, I try not to accept them. If they are forced upon me, I throw them into the trash can. I have had Catholicism deeply engrained in me since I was a small child.
“However, I was attracted to your book because it had ‘Paradise’ within the title and because the reading was clear and easy. The questions at the foot of the pages encouraged reading, and the pictures were attractive to me. I particularly loved page 11 because I am trying to create such a paradise here for the birds and animals. I have deer, rabbits, chipmunks, squirrels, wild turkeys and birds of all kinds. . . .
“You really accomplished something by getting a Catholic to read a book in another religion. Ha! I doubt that I shall ever convert to another religion. But I read the book, and my husband is now reading it. Thanks again!”

When It Touches On Science, the Bible Is Scientific
“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” (Genesis 1:1) Scientists teach a beginning, the Big Bang.
“He is . . . hanging the earth upon nothing.” (Job 26:7) The Egyptians said it was supported by pillars; the Greeks said by Atlas; others said by an elephant.
In the eighth century B.C.E., Isaiah wrote of Jehovah’s “dwelling above the circle of the earth.” The Hebrew hhug, translated “circle,” can also mean “sphere,” as Wilson’s Old Testament Word Studies shows. Hence, Moffatt’s translation of Isaiah 40:22 reads: “He sits over the round earth.”
The Bible states: “Star differs from star in glory.” Scientists now know that there are blue stars, yellow ones, white dwarfs, neutron stars, and others.​—1 Corinthians 15:41.
Centuries before naturalists were aware of migration, Jeremiah wrote (seventh century B.C.E.) “The stork in the sky knows the time to migrate, the dove and the swift and the wryneck know the season of return.”​—Jeremiah 8:7, The New English Bible.
A thousand years before Christ, Solomon wrote in figurative language about the circulation of the blood. (Ecclesiastes 12:6) Medical science did not understand it until the 15th century C.E.
The Mosaic Law (16th century B.C.E.) reflected awareness of disease germs thousands of years before Pasteur.​—Leviticus, chapters 13, 14.
The creation account of Genesis is accurate biology​—testified to by the fossil record and by modern genetics—​when it says that each family kind was to reproduce “according to its kind.”​—Genesis 1:12, 21, 25.
The genetic blueprint in the fertilized human egg cell contains programs for all the bodily parts before any hint of their presence. Compare Psalm 139:16: “Your eyes [Jehovah’s] saw even the embryo of me, and in your book all its parts were down in writing, as regards the days when they were formed and there was not yet one among them.”

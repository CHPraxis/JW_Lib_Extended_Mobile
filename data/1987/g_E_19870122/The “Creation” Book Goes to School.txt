The “Creation” Book Goes to School
I am 12 years old and attend 7th grade at Hazel Park Junior High School in St. Paul, Minnesota. When my science teacher mentioned our next unit would be on animals and where they come from, she suggested we would be discussing evolution. I thought it was a perfect opportunity to take to school our book Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?
When she looked at it, the illustrations caught her eye. She asked if she could take it home and look it over. It so happened we had a two-week break. When she returned to school, she asked if there was a way she might purchase this book. Of course, I said. It is only $2.50.
She said this book would help her because of a law prohibiting teaching religion in school. She could now make information on creation available to her classes without teaching religion herself. Many times in the classroom she would hold the book up and point out illustrations suitable to what she was teaching that day. After referring to the book many times in this way, she invited the students to check the book out whenever they wanted. She also made available a copy of the Bible, so the students could read the Genesis account of creation.
When our unit was almost complete, I looked at the list to see how many checked the new Creation book out. I was so surprised to see how many of the students I go to school with really cared about whether we evolved or were created. My teacher said she has read our literature before, but she really liked this book.​—A. P., United States.

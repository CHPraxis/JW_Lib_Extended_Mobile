Where Are They Going?
It’s spring, and these Canada geese are returning to summer in Canada. Their striking V formation is more than just eye-catching, it is also wise. It saves energy. As each bird flies, an upward spiraling eddy is created at the wing tips. The bird behind flies above this eddy and gains lift from it.
Why Are They Here?
Six reasons​—to bring forth these goslings. The female builds a nest of grasses and mosses, lines it with down from her breast, and lays her eggs. As the goslings emerge from the shell, each one makes eye contact with the mother. Bonding takes place. In due time the gander leads the family on an outing.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:1-1:1:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 1:1</a>) Scientists teach a beginning, the Big Bang.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“He is . . . hanging the earth upon nothing.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:26:7-18:26:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 26:7</a>) The Egyptians said it was supported by pillars; the Greeks said by Atlas; others said by an elephant.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the eighth century B.C.E., Isaiah wrote of Jehovah’s “dwelling above the circle of the earth.” The Hebrew <em>hhug, </em>translated “circle,” can also mean “sphere,” as Wilson’s <em>Old Testament Word Studies </em>shows. Hence, Moffatt’s translation of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:22-23:40:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:22</a> reads: “He sits over the round earth.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Bible states: “Star differs from star in glory.” Scientists now know that there are blue stars, yellow ones, white dwarfs, neutron stars, and others.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:41-46:15:41" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:41</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">A thousand years before Christ, Solomon wrote in figurative language about the circulation of the blood. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:6-21:12:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 12:6</a>) Medical science did not understand it until the 15th century C.E.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The Mosaic Law (16th century B.C.E.) reflected awareness of disease germs thousands of years before Pasteur.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:13:1-3:13:59" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Leviticus, chapters 13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:14:1-3:14:57" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The creation account of Genesis is accurate biology​—testified to by the fossil record and by modern genetics—​when it says that each family kind was to reproduce “according to its kind.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:12-1:1:12" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 1:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:21-1:1:21" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:25-1:1:25" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 25</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The genetic blueprint in the fertilized human egg cell contains programs for all the bodily parts before any hint of their presence.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">I have just read the issue on “Hope for the Mentally Ill” and wish to compliment you for doing such an excellent job. (September 8, 1986) I am sure that some of your objectives in such articles were to be understandable, accurate, informative, and to be helpful and encouraging to those with a mental illness. In my professional opinion you have achieved your objectives.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">I have just read “A Letter From the Mother of an Unborn Child.” (July 22, 1986) It seemed as though the person was actually writing about me and describing my feelings. I also trust that the blood of Jesus Christ will purify my serious sins, but the memory of what I have done is always present. Keep on writing such articles so that others may be helped to avoid doing such a bad thing.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">I have just read “A Letter From the Mother of an Unborn Child,” and “From Our Readers” in the issue of October 22, 1986. I think this was good for young ones just entering high school. I am 13 years old and will be entering high school next year. If the girls now in the higher grades could read this material, at least a few of them would change their minds about sex and abortion. When I read the letter I cried. Sometimes sad things get the point across. Thank you for publishing that letter.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>Recovering From Drug Abuse</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Thank you for your article “Young People Ask . . . How Can I Recover From Drug Abuse?” (July 8, 1986) For eleven months I have been suffering from a confused mind, the result of regularly taking LSD. The last time I took LSD, I took several other things as well. The combined effect was incredibly frightening. When I woke up the next day, I thought I was dead and believed this for three months. When I slowly came to realize that I was still very much alive, I decided to find out, before it happened, what would happen to me when I died. Jehovah’s Witnesses helped me to study the Bible and find the truth on this subject. It was not until I was shown God’s view on this matter from the Bible that I finally found the incentive that has enabled me to give up my long-term habit of smoking cannabis. My life has improved greatly, though I continue to have problems identifying my emotions. Having read your article, I realize that the way I feel is normal for recovering drug abusers and I feel much better. When things don’t go too well, I reread the article, as it gives me real encouragement to keep fighting.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Thank you for the wealth of information that we have learned through your magazine. The bound volumes of past issues are like encyclopedias of knowledge on just about any subject. And it’s all upbuilding material that points us to the hope of a bright future, even if we face so many problems in this world today.</p>

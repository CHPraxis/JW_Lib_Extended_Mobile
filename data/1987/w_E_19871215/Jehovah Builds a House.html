<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><span id="page27" class="pageNum" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span>SATURDAY, March 21, 1987, was a day that the staff of the Watch Tower Society’s South Africa branch will never forget. It was a historic occasion. The new complex at Roodekrans was dedicated​—the culmination of six years of hard work. But the honor goes to Jehovah. As Solomon expressed it: “Unless Jehovah himself builds the house, it is to no avail that its builders have worked hard on it.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:127:1-19:127:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 127:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Let us briefly trace the growth of Jehovah’s Witnesses in South Africa. In 1902 the first two local individuals started studying the Society’s publications and preaching to others. In 1910 Will Johnston was directed by Brother Russell to open a one-man branch office in Durban. The next year one of the first African congregations was organized in nearby Ndwedwe. During the crucial year of 1914, the first convention was held in Durban and had an attendance of 50. The branch was moved to Cape Town in 1923, and the following year a simple press was put in use. The branch was moved to larger premises in 1933, but there was no Bethel Home.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Still another important move took place in 1952, to Elandsfontein​—some 1,500 kilometers north of Cape Town and about 20 kilometers east of Johannesburg. It was the first of the buildings in South Africa that was actually designed by the Society, so it included ample space for printing as well as a Bethel Home, or residence. Meanwhile, the Kingdom work was opening up in several countries cared for by the South Africa branch. So the branch needed to be expanded in 1959, again in 1971, and yet again in 1978. Then there was no room for further expansion at that site.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The original two publishers in South Africa had increased to about 28,000. It was time to look for a new place, which involved a long search. At last a fine farm of 87 hectares <strong>[216 acres] </strong>was found at Roodekrans, which is some 60 kilometers from Elandsfontein. Jehovah’s guidance and help were very evident in the finding and purchasing of this lovely place.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>Overcoming Problems</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">However, serious problems had to be overcome. The initial cost seemed huge, and special permits were needed to build a factory, offices, and a residence in a municipal area. An added complication was the desirability of having black Witnesses who were translators live there. It seemed miraculous how these obstacles were overcome, giving evidence that Jehovah was building the house. Another problem was a serious lack of artisans. But volunteer workers were quick to learn the various trades. This included sisters. One overseer remarked: “Refined young girls who don’t fit on a building site became expert tilers. I’ve never seen better.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Construction work went slowly at first. Then volunteers flocked to Roodekrans​—blacks, whites, Colored, and Indians. Brothers even came from other countries, such as New Zealand and the United States. This was very unusual in South Africa. “It’s beautiful to see brothers and sisters working together, different nationalities and races from different backgrounds,” said one volunteer. Many gave up good jobs or took long leaves to help with the construction at Roodekrans. They included experienced mechanics, an architect, an engineer, qualified draftsmen, and construction overseers. Much expensive machinery was donated or loaned.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">How about the enormous cost involved? The Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses made provision for a very substantial loan, and local Witnesses of all races and all ages contributed generously. A girl <span id="page28" class="pageNum" data-no="28" data-before-text="28"></span>of six wrote: “I was saving this money to buy a doll, but I am sending it to you. I hope you can finish Roodekrans with this money. When I am big, I also want to go to Roodekrans and work there.” A five-year-old Indian boy contributed his pocket money from the previous six months!</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">On weekends hundreds of additional Witnesses came to share in this vital project. Other volunteers came on a daily basis, often making real sacrifices and putting forth great effort to do so. Non-Witness visitors shook their heads in disbelief at seeing the massive, enthusiastic support. Many people living in the vicinity were deeply impressed. Local commercial firms vied for business at Roodekrans, and their representatives often commented on the atmosphere of peace and unity.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>A Majestic Building in a Beautiful Setting</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Rocky hills on the southern side of the construction site overlook a pleasant valley and stream. Although the property is near an attractive suburb, there is still wildlife present, such as guinea fowl and hares. Black eagles and jackals often pay a visit too. The residence building, strung along the lower slopes of the hills for some 360 meters, is of red brick. It has three stories, with beautiful views. In the center is a service area with a dining room, a kitchen, a laundry, and an infirmary. Nearby are the office block and a huge printery, which is roughly the size of Noah’s ark. It houses the large four-color TKS offset press.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">To the west of the residence building is a farming area and a large barn, which was used as the dining room and kitchen during the construction. Fields of grass and alfalfa provide fodder for a herd of milk cows. There are hundreds of protea shrubs on the hills behind the residence. In addition to existing tall eucalyptus trees, many new trees, colorful flower beds, and spacious lawns have been planted.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>The Dedication Program</strong></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">A crowd of about 4,000 gathered in an open space near the residence building for the dedication on Saturday afternoon, March 21, 1987. A temporary platform faced the hills, giving the effect of an amphitheater. The chairman, Brother R. F. Stow, read supportive messages from 17 countries. The most moving of these was from Maud Johnston, the wife of the first branch overseer in Durban. At 92 years of age, she is still serving in the Australia Bethel.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">P. J. Wentzel, overseer of the Service <span id="page29" class="pageNum" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>Department, was the first speaker, and he gave a brief summary of the history of Kingdom work in South Africa. He compared the attendance of 50 at the first assembly in 1914 with the attendance of 99,000 at the 1986 conventions. Next, J. R. Kikot, factory overseer, described the printing of literature in many languages and the work of over 50 translators. He mentioned also that in 1979 a large TKS press, a gift from the Japan branch, was installed, but it printed in only two colors. Recently, two more units, also a gift from Japan, were added to the press. As a result, <em>The Watchtower </em>of April 1, 1987, was printed in full color, to the delight of all.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">C. F. Muller, the coordinator of the Branch Committee, described how Jehovah helped to provide the site, the funds, the experts, and the skilled workers. God’s spirit also produced fine harmony among the various races. Though at one stage it seemed impossible to build a factory in a prime residential area and for blacks to live there, Jehovah opened the way, so he was the real Master Builder!</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The next speaker was Carey Barber, a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses. His fine talk was based on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:17-23:65:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:17-19</a>, which foretells how Jehovah’s people will “exult . . . and be joyful forever.” The speaker explained that “exult” means “to leap for joy” and that it is the supreme form of happiness. It certainly was a very happy day for those present. The dedication talk was given by Milton Henschel, also of the Governing Body. He offered a special prayer to Jehovah, giving thanks for providing the building, which was now dedicated to Him.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The next day 28,250 Witnesses and interested persons gathered in the Rand Stadium, Johannesburg, where they heard a brief summary of the program at Roodekrans. In a talk translated into Zulu, Henschel showed how Jehovah’s Witnesses, led by Jehovah and Jesus, are triumphant everywhere and spreading “a sweet odor of Christ” and other Bible knowledge. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:2:14-47:2:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 2:14-17</a>) He concluded with many encouraging experiences that delighted the vast audience.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">During the next few days, similar gatherings were held in Durban and Cape Town. These were occasions that will never be forgotten by Jehovah’s Witnesses in South Africa. The Bethel family at Roodekrans will certainly long remember the dedication of their new home. With over 40,000 Witnesses currently active in South Africa instead of the 28,000 when work began at Roodekrans, the ‘house that Jehovah built’ fills an urgent and vital need.</p>

Search for the Truth Rewarded
FINDING little satisfaction as a lay preacher in the Presbyterian Church, a gentleman started looking for God’s true church. He drew up ten requirements that he felt the true church should have. He already had an accurate understanding of the unscripturalness of hellfire, immortality of the soul, and so forth. For 30 years he conducted this search. When contacted by one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, he began firing his questions, such as: “Who is the little flock? Who are the 144,000 and the other sheep?” Getting satisfying answers, he agreed to a Bible study. After three months he said to the Witness: “Well, Brother, the true church of God is Jehovah’s Witnesses.” He is now 71 years of age and happy that he has found the true church after a 30-year search!

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">FOR years the back page of <em>The Watchtower </em>has carried an advertisement for Bible literature. Recently, a letter from Georgia, U.S.A., praised these advertisements. The writer explained that the married couple with whom she and her husband study the Bible have responded to these ads and have obtained, among other publications, cassette tapes of <em>My Book of Bible Stories. </em>Later, they purchased the <em>Bible Stories </em>book itself. The writer explains the effect that this book has had upon that couple:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“They have been given a historical background from Adam forward that just this week resulted in their being able to see the different races of men in the proper light. After reading a few scriptures, such as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:26-44:17:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 17:26 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:10:1-1:10:32" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Genesis chapter 10</a>, and referring to man’s history from the <em>Bible Stories </em>book, Jim observed: ‘I said I wasn’t prejudiced before, but for the first time, tonight I can say it and really mean it.’”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The writer concluded: “Truly, your advertisements have led to much spiritual growth in a short time.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><em>My Book of Bible Stories </em>contains 116 Bible accounts that give the reader an idea of what the Bible is all about. You can receive the cassette tapes or the volume <em>My Book of Bible Stories, </em>or both, by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon.</p>

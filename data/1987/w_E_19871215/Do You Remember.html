<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">From the time of Abel forward, God has been noting, as if writing down in a book, those of redeemable mankind who are worthy of being remembered as to everlasting life.

In this way Moses failed to ‘sanctify God before the eyes of the people.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:27:12-4:27:14" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Numbers 27:12-14</a>)​—10/15, page 31.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A basic tenet of the Roman Catholic Church has always been that it is the one true Apostolic Church. Catholics have been taught that the unity of the church is proof of its authenticity. But today Catholics are confronted with a church that is divided on questions of theology, morals, church government, and liturgy.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Papal decisions on important matters of faith and morals are being contested by Catholic theologians and are not being followed by many of the faithful. A Catholic archbishop has set up an international chain of seminaries for training dissident priests. More and more sincere Catholics are perplexed and ask, ‘Why is my church divided?’</p>

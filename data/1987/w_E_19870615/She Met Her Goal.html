<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">During a Bible talk, a minister said that Christians should set personal goals and then strive to meet them. A four-year-old girl who heard the talk announced to her parents the following morning that she had set the goal of listening to the entire 256-page <em>My Book of Bible Stories </em>that is recorded on tapes. Her mother writes:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“She arranged herself comfortably with pillow, recorder, tapes, and book, and requested that snacks be served throughout the day. Not really taking her seriously, I agreed, thinking that she would tire in just a short time. During the morning, I checked on her several times to see how she was doing. After about two hours, I suggested that perhaps it had been long enough and we could finish tomorrow. But she was determined. Later on in the afternoon, she came out of the room, stretching and a little stiff, but with a very proud smile. It had taken almost six hours, but she had reached her goal!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Since this time she has started school, and her teacher says that she is the best oral reader they have ever heard.”</p>

She Met Her Goal
During a Bible talk, a minister said that Christians should set personal goals and then strive to meet them. A four-year-old girl who heard the talk announced to her parents the following morning that she had set the goal of listening to the entire 256-page My Book of Bible Stories that is recorded on tapes. Her mother writes:
“She arranged herself comfortably with pillow, recorder, tapes, and book, and requested that snacks be served throughout the day. Not really taking her seriously, I agreed, thinking that she would tire in just a short time. During the morning, I checked on her several times to see how she was doing. After about two hours, I suggested that perhaps it had been long enough and we could finish tomorrow. But she was determined. Later on in the afternoon, she came out of the room, stretching and a little stiff, but with a very proud smile. It had taken almost six hours, but she had reached her goal!
“Since this time she has started school, and her teacher says that she is the best oral reader they have ever heard.”

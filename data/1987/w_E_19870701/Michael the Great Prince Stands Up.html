<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“And during that time Michael will stand up, the great prince who is standing in behalf of the sons of your people.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:1-27:12:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">DANIEL 12:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 1. What future course of world events is foreseen in the Bible, and what question arises about God’s people because of this?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">JEHOVAH has given fair warning: There will never be peace on earth as long as the rivalry between the king of the north and the king of the south continues. These two powers would always have conflicting interests. Moreover, at the climax of their enmity, the king of the north will threaten the spiritual estate of God’s people before he ‘comes all the way to his end.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:44-27:11:45" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Daniel 11:44, 45</a>) Will God’s people survive the assault? And what happens to the king of the south when his great rival comes to his end?</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 2, 3. (a) What prophecy do we find in the book of Ezekiel that helps us to understand the prophecy about the king of the north and the king of the south? (b) According to Ezekiel’s prophecy, what will be the outcome of the great final attack on God’s people?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>A prophecy by Daniel’s contemporary Ezekiel helps us to answer these questions. Ezekiel, too, was inspired to speak about “the final part of the days,” and he <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>warned of a coming attack of ‘Gog of Magog’ against the land of God’s people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:38:2-26:38:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ezekiel 38:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:38:14-26:38:16" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 14-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:10:14-27:10:14" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Daniel 10:14</a>) In that prophecy, Gog pictured Satan, and his armies pictured all of Satan’s earthly agents who would make a last, desperate attempt to wipe out God’s people. Since this attack, like that of the king of the north, takes place in the final part of the days, it is reasonable to conclude that the king of the north’s ‘planting of his palatial tents between the grand sea and the holy mountain of Decoration’ is in support of Gog’s attack. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:40-27:11:40" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Daniel 11:40,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:45-27:11:45" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 45</a>) Will the attack succeed?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Ezekiel prophesied: “‘It must occur in that day, in the day when Gog comes in upon the soil of Israel,’ is the utterance of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah, ‘that my rage will come up into my nose. And I will bring myself into judgment with him, with pestilence and with blood; and a flooding downpour and hailstones, fire and sulphur I shall rain down upon him and upon his bands and upon the many peoples that will be with him.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:38:18-26:38:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ezekiel 38:18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:38:22-26:38:22" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 22</a>) No, the attack will not succeed. True Christians will be rescued, and Gog’s crowd will be destroyed.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:39:11-26:39:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezekiel 39:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 4. Will the king of the south survive the end of the king of the north? What other prophecies support this answer?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Evidently, then, the time of the end of the king of the north is the time of the end for Gog and all his crowd, including the king of the south. This harmonizes with other prophecies in the book of Daniel. For example, we read that after God’s Kingdom was established, it would “crush and put an end to <em>all </em>these kingdoms [including both the king of the north and the king of the south], and it itself will stand to times indefinite.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Daniel 2:44</a>) Also, in Daniel’s vision of the ram and the he-goat, the Anglo-American political power is represented by a little horn. This little horn, “in the final part of their kingdom,” is destroyed by a superhuman agency, not by the king of the north: “It will be without [human] hand that he will be broken.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:24-27:7:27" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Daniel 7:24-27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:8:3-27:8:10" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 8:3-10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:8:20-27:8:25" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 20-25</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span><strong>Michael the Great Prince</strong></p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 5. Who will be Jehovah’s Chief Agent for the salvation of His people, and why is this fitting?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>The angel next reveals the Agent that Jehovah will use to bring about the end of all these powers. He says: “And during that time Michael will stand up, the great prince who is standing in behalf of the sons of your people. And there will certainly occur a time of distress such as has not been made to occur since there came to be a nation until that time. And during that time your people will escape, every one who is found written down in the book.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:1-27:12:1" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Daniel 12:1</a>) At the beginning of the angel’s prophecy, Michael was reported as fighting for Israel against the princes of Persia and Greece. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:10:20-27:10:21" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Daniel 10:20, 21</a>) Now, as the prophecy draws to a close, this same Michael is “standing” for Daniel’s people. Who is this champion of the people of God?</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 6, 7. (a) According to some scholars of Christendom, who is Michael? (b) What Biblical evidence helps us to make a proper identification of Michael?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Back in the early 1800’s, Bible scholar Joseph Benson stated that the description of Michael as found in the Bible “manifestly points out the Messiah.” Nineteenth-century Lutheran E. W. Hengstenberg agreed that “Michael is no other than Christ.” Similarly, theologian J. P. Lange, when commenting on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:7-66:12:7" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Revelation 12:7</a>, wrote: “We take it that Michael . . . is, from the outset, Christ in warlike array against Satan.” Does the Bible support this identification? Yes, it does.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>For example, according to the angel, Michael is to “stand up.” In the angel’s prophecy, “to stand” or “to stand up” (Hebrew, ‛<em>a·madhʹ</em>) can mean “to give support.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:1-27:11:1" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Daniel 11:1</a>) It can also variously imply “to prevail,” “to rebel,” “to oppose,” or “to withstand.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:6-27:11:6" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Daniel 11:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:11-27:11:11" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:14-27:11:17" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 14, 15, 16a, 17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:25-27:11:25" data-bid="13-4" class="b"> 25</a>) But frequently, it refers to the action of a king, either taking up his royal power or acting effectively in his capacity as king. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:2-27:11:4" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Daniel 11:2-4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:7-27:11:7" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:16-27:11:16" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 16b,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:20-27:11:21" data-bid="14-4" class="b"> 20, 21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:25-27:11:25" data-bid="14-5" class="b"> 25</a>) This is the meaning that fits best the angel’s words in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:1-27:12:1" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Daniel 12:1</a>. And it certainly supports the fact that Michael is Jesus Christ, since Jesus is Jehovah’s appointed King, commissioned to destroy all the nations at Armageddon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:15-66:11:15" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Revelation 11:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:14-66:16:16" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 16:14-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:11-66:19:16" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 19:11-16</a>) It also harmonizes with the other prophecies that point to the time when God’s Kingdom, under Jesus Christ, acts against this world’s nations.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Daniel 2:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:13-27:7:14" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 7:13, 14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:26-27:7:27" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 26, 27</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Michael has long been associated with ‘Daniel’s people,’ the Israelites. He was with them in the wilderness, and he supported them against the spirit “princes” of ancient empires. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:10:13-27:10:13" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Daniel 10:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:10:21-27:10:21" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:23:20-2:23:21" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> Exodus 23:20, 21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:9-65:1:9" data-bid="18-4" class="b"> Jude 9</a>) And he was born on earth as the man Jesus to be the long-hoped-for Messiah, the “seed” promised to Daniel’s ancestor Abraham.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>But now the angel says that Michael is going to act in a particular way. Using the word ‘stand’ twice, he says: “And during that time Michael will <em>stand </em>up, the great prince who <em>is standing </em>in behalf of the sons of your people.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:1-27:12:1" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Daniel 12:1</a>) What does it mean that Jesus ‘stands up’? And how can he “stand up” if he is already “standing in behalf of [Daniel’s] people”? Before we answer these questions, consider some background information.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">11. In what way would it be proper to say that Jesus has been “standing” since 1914?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>After his resurrection in 33 C.E., Jesus told his followers: “All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:18-40:28:18" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matthew 28:18</a>) Jesus has long exercised such authority over his anointed servants on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:13-51:1:13" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Colossians 1:13</a>) However, the time had not yet come for Jesus to exercise authority as King of God’s Kingdom.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:21-20:2:22" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:21, 22</a>) Listen to the terrified reaction of unfaithful mankind at that time: “They keep saying to the mountains and to the rock-masses: ‘Fall over us and hide us <span id="page20" class="pageNum" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>from the face of the One seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb, because the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?’”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:16-66:6:17" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Revelation 6:16, 17</a>.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>The result of this “time of distress” on Satan’s earthly forces is described in Ezekiel’s prophecy against Gog of Magog: “On the mountains of Israel you will fall, you and all your bands and the peoples that will be with you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:39:4-26:39:4" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Ezekiel 39:4</a>) Jeremiah, speaking of the same time of distress, said: “Those slain by Jehovah will certainly come to be in that day from one end of the earth clear to the other end of the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:25:33-24:25:33" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Jeremiah 25:33</a>) It will be a time of distress indeed.

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>18 </sup>While God’s people will feel the effects of enemy hostility, this will be “a time of distress” primarily for the wicked. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:20-19:37:20" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Psalm 37:20</a>) The angel tells Daniel: “And during that time your people will escape, every one who is found written down in the book.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:1-27:12:1" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Daniel 12:1</a>) Many of ‘the sons of Daniel’s people’ will have died and received their heavenly reward by this time. These ones will undoubtedly share with Michael in this great military victory.

<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">19. (a) How will Michael’s ‘standing up’ bring peace to the earth? (b) What question remains to be answered?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>19 </sup>These will be privileged to see the establishment of a genuine earth-wide peace. They will witness the fulfillment of Jehovah’s promise: “For evildoers themselves will be cut off, but those hoping in Jehovah are the ones that will possess the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:9-19:37:9" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Psalm 37:9</a>) Because God’s Kingdom will then be the sole government over the earth, every human alive will be a servant of Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:9-23:11:9" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:9</a>) Thus, at “the time of the end” of the two kings, Michael “will stand up” to bring peace to mankind. No superpower arms buildup or other maneuvers can stop this development. Does that mean, though, that we have to wait until then to enjoy peace? No, there is a peace that Christians can enjoy even now​—really, a better kind of peace than the mere absence of war. What is this peace? The angel’s prophecy to Daniel goes on to shed light on this.</p>

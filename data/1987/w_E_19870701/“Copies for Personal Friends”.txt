“Copies for Personal Friends”
Because they have enjoyed the book Making Your Family Life Happy so much, many have shared copies with others. For example, a person from Indiana, U.S.A., writes:
“I would like to compliment you on the wonderful book I have just read, Making Your Family Life Happy. It is a well-written and easily understood book, and our young people as well as old would benefit from reading it.
“I would like extra copies for personal friends, and I would also like to use the book as bridal-shower gifts.
“I am of the Nazarene faith . . . and would not appreciate materials, other than the book, sent my way . . . If it would be possible for me to purchase ten copies of the book at a reasonable price, I would appreciate hearing from you.”
Perhaps you feel about the Family book much the way this person does. Do you know someone with whom you would like to share it? Why not send that person a gift copy? You can do so by simply filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon, enclosing just $1 with the coupon.
Please send, postpaid, the hardcover, 192-page book Making Your Family Life Happy as well as a letter explaining that it is a gift from ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐
I enclose $1 (U.S.).

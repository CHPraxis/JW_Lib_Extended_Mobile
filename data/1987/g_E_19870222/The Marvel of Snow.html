<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Many consider the earth to be at its prettiest when it is draped by a blanket of dazzling snow. But snow provides more than beauty. Animals can burrow into this fluffy natural covering and keep warm. Snow holds heat in the lower ground levels, and preserves seeds from freezing to death. It provides such fine insulation that Eskimos within their igloos can keep warm from the heat of their own bodies. It is with significance, then, that the Bible says that God “is giving snow like wool.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:147:16-19:147:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 147:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:37:5-18:37:6" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Job 37:5, 6</a>.</p>

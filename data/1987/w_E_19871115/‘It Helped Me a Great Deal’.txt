‘It Helped Me a Great Deal’
Youths surely need help today, what with an epidemic of teenage suicides, pregnancies, alcoholism, drug abuse, and other problems. But where can they receive it? A youth from Buffalo, New York, wrote the Watchtower Society:
“I have read your book . . . Your Youth​—Getting the Best Out of It. I must say that you have written a good book. It has helped me a great deal, and I know that it can do the same for someone else. . . . I have passed my book to a friend, and he has made some progress. Thank you, Sir, a million times, for writing such a good, good book.”
You too can receive this valuable handbook for young people by simply filling in and mailing the coupon, with your contribution.
Please send, postpaid, the hardcover, 192-page book Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. I enclose $1 (U.S.).

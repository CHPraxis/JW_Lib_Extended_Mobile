<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Youths surely need help today, what with an epidemic of teenage suicides, pregnancies, alcoholism, drug abuse, and other problems. But where can they receive it? A youth from Buffalo, New York, wrote the Watchtower Society:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I have read your book . . . <em>Your Youth​—Getting the Best Out of It. </em>I must say that you have written a good book. It has helped me a great deal, and I know that it can do the same for someone else. . . . I have passed my book to a friend, and he has made some progress. Thank you, Sir, a million times, for writing such a good, good book.”</p>

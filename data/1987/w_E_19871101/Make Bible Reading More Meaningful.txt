Make Bible Reading More Meaningful
THE New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures​—With References really does this.
An appreciative reader recently wrote regarding the New World Translation Reference Bible: “It is the answer to my prayers. When I do my Bible reading, I check many of the references. They help me see other important principles that are related to the account. It surely broadens my understanding, and I can make better personal application.”
This scholarly publication is bound with a handsome dark-maroon hard cover and contains more than 11,000 footnotes, an extensive concordance, and maps. Only $9.
Please send, postpaid, the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures​—With References. I enclose $9 (U.S.). (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures​—With References </em>really does this.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">An appreciative reader recently wrote regarding the <em>New World Translation Reference Bible: </em>“It is the answer to my prayers. When I do my Bible reading, I check many of the references. They help me see other important principles that are related to the account. It surely broadens my understanding, and I can make better personal application.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This scholarly publication is bound with a handsome dark-maroon hard cover and contains more than 11,000 footnotes, an extensive concordance, and maps. Only $9.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Please send, postpaid, the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures​—With References. </em>I enclose $9 (U.S.). (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)</p>

It has been calculated that from 1970 to 1980 the number of hungry people in the world increased by about 1.5 million a year. But the first half of the 1980’s saw the pool of hungry jump by nearly 8 million a year, reaching 512 million in 1985​—this despite a commitment of the United Nations World Food Council back in 1974 to eradicate world hunger within ten years.

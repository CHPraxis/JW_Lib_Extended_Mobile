Now Available! A Subscription to The Watchtower on Cassette Tapes
HOW fine to have someone read to you, especially when you have failing eyesight! A new provision makes this pleasure available to you whenever you wish.
Beginning with its January 1, 1988, issue, in English only, The Watchtower on cassette tapes will be available to subscribers.

For persons certified as blind or physically unable to read normal reading material, the year’s subscription will be only $12. Outside the United States and Canada, subscriptions are available only to the blind and visually impaired. Write the U.S. office concerning rates and certification.

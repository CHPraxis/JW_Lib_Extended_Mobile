<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“WE ARE breeding a nation of cripples,” worries chiropodist Adrian Grier of the town of Luton, England. In his hospital clinic, he sees children as young as six years of age with disfigured feet. The cause: poorly fitting shoes. In just one year, out of more than 3,000 children examined by Grier, 600 of them had foot problems attributed to shoes that did not fit properly. “The earlier children start to wear a fashion shoe, the quicker deformities come and the worse they will be,” states Grier in Luton’s <em>Herald. </em>But ill-fitting shoes are not the only cause of foot deformities. Babies’ feet can be initially deformed when parents put them into all-in-one sleepers, and socks that are too small may be equally damaging, claims Grier.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Being alert to the dangers and adopting a sensible approach in the purchase of well-shaped shoes will do much to prevent deformities, ingrown toenails, bunions, and even arthritis in later life. Grier suggests that shoes for children be 3/4 inch (2 cm) longer than the child’s foot (to allow for growth) and have a rounded toe.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When it comes to clothing, as well as shoes, this time-proved piece of advice given to Christian women can benefit all: ‘Be modest and sensible about your clothes.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:9-54:2:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Timothy 2:9</a>, <em>Today’s English Version.</em></p>

When Your Head Aches
WHAT do you do for relief? A headache remedy that for some people may work just as well as medicine is an ice pack. Long used to relieve fevers and sprains, ice can also ease headache pain, according to a recent study. Of 90 patients who suffered from acute headaches, including migraines, use of an ice pack brought relief to 71 percent. Over half noted an immediate decrease in pain. Why does it work?
“A headache is caused by the swelling or dilation of blood vessels,” explains Dr. Seymour Diamond, director of a headache clinic in Chicago. “Cold will cause these vessels to constrict.” He recommends putting crushed ice in a plastic bag and pressing it against your forehead for 30 to 45 minutes while either sitting or lying down. Some relief may be felt immediately because of the numbing effect of the ice.

‘Like Bread and Water to the Heart’
That is what a Protestant minister from Málaga, Spain, said the Watchtower and Awake! magazines were like to him. He explained:
“I have been a Protestant pastor for several years, and I can assure you that in all my theological studies, I have not found the simplicity and clarity that your publications have. To me, Jehovah’s Witnesses are admirable people; in a hypocritical world, they live according to what they believe. . . .
“At the moment, due to personal problems, I can’t study with you as I would like to, but thanks to God, I do receive your magazines, and they are ‘bread’ and ‘water’ to my heart, which hungers and thirsts for the living God.”

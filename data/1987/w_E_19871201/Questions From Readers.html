<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>▪ Some scholars contend that “rope” should replace “camel” at </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:24-40:19:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 19:24</strong></a><strong>, which reads: “It is easier for a camel to get through a needle’s eye.” Which word is correct?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Certain Bible scholars mistakenly conclude that Jesus’ words here were originally recorded in Aramaic. The Aramaic word used in such versions (<em>gam·la’ʹ</em>) can mean “camel.” Depending on the context, however, it can also be rendered “a large rope and a beam.” But according to Papias of Hierapolis, perhaps a contemporary of the apostle John, Matthew wrote his Gospel account originally in Hebrew, not Aramaic, thereafter translating it into Greek. The Hebrew word for camel (<em>ga·malʹ</em>) is quite different from the words translated rope (<em>cheʹvel</em>) or cord (<em>‛avothʹ</em>), and it is certain that Matthew would have selected the correct Greek term.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The oldest and most reliable Greek manuscripts (Sinaiticus and Vatican No. 1209) have the word <em>kaʹme·los, </em>which means camel. This same word is used at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:24-40:23:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 23:24</a>, where there is little doubt that “camel” is intended.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Through the centuries some have tried to soften Jesus’ biting hyperbole. Some even took liberties with the sacred text. From about the fifth century, a similar word <em>kaʹmi·los </em>is found at this text in some Greek manuscripts. This rare word means “rope, ship’s cable.” According to <em>A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament </em>by Arndt and Gingrich, it “has no place in the NT [New Testament].” Greek scholars Westcott and Hort blame this substitution on fifth-century professed Christian Cyril of Alexandria, who asserted that the word used by Matthew (<em>kaʹme·los</em>) could mean a cable, saying: “It is the custom of those well versed in navigation to call the thicker cables ‘camels.’” Yet, of this idea Westcott and Hort state: “It is certainly wrong.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The idea of a huge camel trying to fit through the eye of a tiny sewing needle “savours of Eastern exaggeration,” according to one reference work. In fact, in discussing some individuals renowned for such shrewdness that they seemed to do the impossible, <em>The Babylonian Talmud </em>states: “They draw an elephant through the eye of a needle.” So Jesus was using a typical Oriental image to emphasize the impossibility of something by way of a vivid contrast. Indeed, it would be impossible to thread any large object through a needle’s eye​—whether rope, camel, or elephant.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Jesus was not saying that it was impossible for a rich person to gain life, for some wealthy individuals became his followers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:57-40:27:57" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 27:57;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:2-42:19:2" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Luke 19:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:9-42:19:9" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:19:38-43:19:39" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> John 19:38, 39</a>) But just before Jesus gave this ‘hard saying,’ a rich young man had turned down great spiritual opportunities because of a greater love for his “many possessions.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:16-40:19:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 19:16-22</a>) It would be impossible for any rich man with this attitude to inherit everlasting life. Only with God’s extreme help could such a person change and receive the salvation that must come through God’s power.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:25-40:19:26" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 19:25, 26</a>.</p>

An Armchair Visit to Central Europe and the Caribbean Islands
You can enjoy such a visit to Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Trinidad, Tobago, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands through the pages of the 1987 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Read the encouraging stories about the opening up of Kingdom preaching in these places, as well as an up-to-date report on the activities of Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide.
Please send, postpaid, the 1987 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses. I enclose $1 (U.S.).

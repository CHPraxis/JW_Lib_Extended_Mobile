“Awake!” Shares in Spreading the Good News
Here you see two of Jehovah’s Witnesses making use of Awake! in preaching the good news of God’s Kingdom in Austria. This same preaching work is being accomplished in more than 200 lands and islands of the sea worldwide. Over three million Witnesses spend their time in this work. Why?
Because a comparison of Bible prophecy with world events shows that since World War I, we have been living at the climax of human history, the conclusion of this system of things. God’s Kingdom by Christ Jesus has been established in the heavens and will soon intervene in earth’s affairs to remove all wickedness and bring in a peaceful and secure system of things earth wide.​—Daniel 2:44; Matthew 6:9, 10; 24:3-35.
More than 60 years ago, Awake! entered into this preaching activity under the name The Golden Age. By the end of its first decade, more than 75,000 copies of each issue were being distributed. As we near the end of the seventh decade of this magazine’s existence, over ten million copies of each issue, in 53 languages, are being printed for distribution.
Together with its companion magazine, The Watchtower, Awake! presents the most significant message of this century. The next time Jehovah’s Witnesses call at your door, invite them in and let them explain how this message can benefit you and your family.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">ONE day James saw his daughter Rebecca walking with unusual slowness to meet the school bus. Though Rebecca could see the bus coming, she walked even slower and deliberately missed the bus.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">That same evening James and his wife, Veronica, discussed the matter by reviewing the story of “Jonah and the Big Fish” from <em>My Book of Bible Stories. </em>It was one of Rebecca’s favorites. After finishing the story, the parents tied it in with their daughter’s problem. She really got the point and said: “Even though Jonah ran away and got into trouble in the sea, and he was swallowed by the fish and was vomited out​—his work for Jehovah was still waiting for him to do.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The next day Rebecca went to school with a new attitude and <em>My Book of Bible Stories </em>under her arm.</p>

‘Rhythms That Calm the Heart’
Surely, these are most desirable in these hectic times. In this connection, a young mother from Japan wrote regarding the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses:
“When I first went to the Kingdom Hall and heard the songs of praise, I thought, ‘What beautiful music, . . . rhythms that calm the heart!’ . . . I had been wondering for some time whether there were cassette tapes or records of these songs of praise. If there are any, I would like to buy them. . . . I consider the songs of praise to be exactly right. If we had the cassette tapes, I could listen to them while I do my housework and when playing with my child, and that would be wonderful.”
We are pleased to say that such cassette tapes are available. A beautiful album entitled “Sing Praises to Jehovah,” containing eight cassettes of delightful piano music, is available for only $15. You can receive your album by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon, along with your payment.
Please send, postpaid, the album “Sing Praises to Jehovah” with the eight cassette music tapes. I enclose $15 (U.S.). (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)

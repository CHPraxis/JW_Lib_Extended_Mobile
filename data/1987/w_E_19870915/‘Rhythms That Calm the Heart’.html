<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Surely, these are most desirable in these hectic times. In this connection, a young mother from Japan wrote regarding the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“When I first went to the Kingdom Hall and heard the songs of praise, I thought, ‘What beautiful music, . . . rhythms that calm the heart!’ . . . I had been wondering for some time whether there were cassette tapes or records of these songs of praise. If there are any, I would like to buy them. . . . I consider the songs of praise to be exactly right. If we had the cassette tapes, I could listen to them while I do my housework and when playing with my child, and that would be wonderful.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">We are pleased to say that such cassette tapes are available. A beautiful album entitled “Sing Praises to Jehovah,” containing eight cassettes of delightful piano music, is available for only $15. You can receive your album by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon, along with your payment.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Please send, postpaid, the album “Sing Praises to Jehovah” with the eight cassette music tapes. I enclose $15 (U.S.). (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)</p>

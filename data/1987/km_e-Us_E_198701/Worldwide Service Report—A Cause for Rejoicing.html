<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>The worldwide service report for 1986 gives clear evidence that Jehovah’s people responded enthusiastically to the urging of the yeartext: “Go . . . , declare abroad the kingdom of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:9:60-42:9:60" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 9:60</a>) It also shows that Jehovah has richly blessed our endeavors in the ministry. How happy we all are to have had a part in raising up a great shout of praise to Jehovah’s name!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:95:1-19:95:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 95:1, 2</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>As we closely examine the 1987 <em>Yearbook </em>report, we will no doubt be moved to praise Jehovah even more, reflecting the spirit of David’s inspired expression when he said: “I will laud you, O Jehovah, with all my heart; . . . I will rejoice and exult in you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:9:1-19:9:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 9:1, 2</a>) Praises are certainly due Jehovah because of the way in which he has removed obstacles, overcome opposition, and made our ministry a success.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:6-46:3:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:6, 7</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:9:7-19:9:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 9:7-11</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>OUTSTANDING SERVICE REPORT</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Yes, the 1986 service year was outstanding in every way. Literature placements increased greatly over the previous year. Bound book placements were up 23.9 percent, for a total of 23,828,314. Just think about the millions of individuals who have had opportunity to read extensively the Kingdom message contained in these books!</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>We get an idea of just how busy Jehovah’s servants were during the year when we contemplate a total of 680,837,042 hours spent in field service. That was an increase of 15 percent over 1985. Many millions of those hours were used in conducting 2,726,252 home Bible studies on the average each month, a remarkable 14.6-percent increase.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>The effectiveness of this ministry in making disciples is clearly <span id="page2" class="pageNum" data-no="2" data-before-text="2"></span>evident. The 225,868 baptized represent an amazing 19-percent increase over 1985. The average number of publishers increased by 6.9 percent. During the year there was a monthly average of 3,063,289. The peak number came to 3,229,022. The 21.2-percent increase in pioneers, to a monthly average of 391,294, was outstanding.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>The fine increase in Kingdom publishers made it necessary for us to form many new congregations during the year. The worldwide total reached 52,177, which is 2,461 more congregations than in 1985.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>All will be thrilled to know that 8,160,597 attended the Memorial celebration on March 24. This was a 4.7-percent increase over the previous year. When we consider what was accomplished in 208 lands during this past service year and the potential indicated for continued growth, we do have great cause for rejoicing and for thanking Jehovah for his goodness.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:22:22-19:22:22" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 22:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>UNITED STATES REPORT</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>What about the United States report? Our literature and magazine placements exceeded the figures for the previous year in percentages comparable to what was done throughout the world. We had 710,344 average publishers, a 5-percent increase. In August we reached the peak of 744,919. Our Memorial attendance was 2 percent higher than in 1985, and in the United States we ended the service year with 8,336 congregations. Particularly outstanding was the increase in the regular pioneer ranks. These swelled from a monthly average of 35,931 in 1985 to 44,664 in 1986. We also maintained a fine average in hours for congregation publishers, reflecting sustained enthusiasm and regularity in the field ministry.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>In this country there were 41,697 baptized during the year, a 21-percent increase. Thousands more are making progress through Bible studies and are being directed to the organization and helped toward dedication and baptism.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:2-47:6:2" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Cor. 6:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="ss"><strong>WHAT LIES AHEAD</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>As we move along in the 1987 service year, we continue to look to Jehovah for his blessing upon all our activity. There is yet “plenty to do in the work of the Lord.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:58-46:15:58" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:58</a>) Millions of people everywhere are gladly listening to the Kingdom message. We are happy that the printed page continues to serve well in reaching them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 5:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:6-40:5:6" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>As we continue to have a full share in preaching the Kingdom good news during 1987, may we be spurred on by the words of our yeartext at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:24:15-6:24:15" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Joshua 24:15</a>: “As for me and my household, we shall serve Jehovah.” The increases that Jehovah gives during this service year will bring further praise to his name.</p>

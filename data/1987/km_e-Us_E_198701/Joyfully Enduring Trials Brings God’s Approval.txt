Joyfully Enduring Trials Brings God’s Approval
1 Jesus foretold that his followers would face persecution and hatred even as he did. (John 15:20; Matt. 24:9) While we do face such trials, many also endure trials such as economic and health problems and difficulties on the secular job or at school. How can we joyfully cope with such trials?
2 The theme of our next series of circuit assemblies beginning February 1987 will be “Joyfully Enduring Trials Brings God’s Approval.” We will be helped to understand why we can expect trials, the benefits that come from enduring, and why we can be joyful. The public talk on the subject “You Can Enjoy Life in Peace Now” will be of special interest. The information presented will help interested persons appreciate the source of peace and how they can enjoy it now. All will want to make plans to be present both days.
3 Jesus found delight in doing his Father’s will, even though he faced persecution. By joyfully enduring trials to the point of death, he gained God’s approval. (Heb. 12:2) The new circuit assembly program will encourage us to copy his fine example.​—1 Pet. 1:21.

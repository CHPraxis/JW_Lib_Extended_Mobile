<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Who should receive a copy of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>is designed to provide help and encouragement for those who share in the field ministry. Therefore, it is not for general distribution. All baptized publishers and approved associates should receive a copy. Those who regularly attend the Service Meeting and who are making progress toward sharing in the field ministry should also receive a copy. Be sure to reserve a copy for the Kingdom Hall library. Disfellowshipped persons should not be given a copy of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry.</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Some congregations have found it advantageous to make a list of all persons who qualify and then divide the list up according to Congregation Book Study groups. This list can be used by the study conductors to facilitate distribution, perhaps even typing or neatly writing each person’s name on his copy. Each one who receives a copy of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>should take care of it and use it in preparing for the Service Meeting and for field service. Many have found it helpful to keep a file of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>in their personal theocratic library for future reference.</p>

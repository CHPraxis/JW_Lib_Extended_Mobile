<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Literature offer for <strong>February: </strong>Any of the following 192-page books for a contribution of 50¢: <em>Choosing, Commentary on James, “Eternal Purpose,” Evolution </em>(old edition), <em>Good News, Holy Spirit, Life Does Have a Purpose, Peace and Security </em>(old edition), <em>This Life, Truth, </em>and <em>World Government. </em>Supplies of <em>Choosing, Commentary on James, Holy Spirit, </em>and <em>Truth </em>may be ordered from the Society. Congregations may request credit for all books obtained by publishers and pioneers. The pioneer rate for the pocket-size books for this campaign is 30¢ each for regular and special pioneers. <strong>March: </strong><em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth </em>for a contribution of $2.50. Small-size edition is $1.25. <strong>April and May: </strong><em>Watchtower </em>subscription for one year for a contribution of $4.00. If subscription is not taken, offer two magazines and a brochure for 70¢.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● On Saturday, May 9, 1987, the Brooklyn Bethel home and factory and Watchtower Farms buildings will be closed for spring cleaning, so there will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on that day.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● The Memorial celebration will be held Sunday, April 12, 1987. Although the talk may start earlier, please remember that the passing of the Memorial bread and wine <em>should not begin until after sundown. </em>Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. Since no other meetings are to be conducted on that date, appropriate adjustments should be made according to local circumstances. If more than two congregations are using the same Kingdom Hall in areas where daylight saving time will be in effect, it may be necessary to arrange for alternate meeting places in order to avoid having some congregations hold their Memorial celebration very late at night. Circuit overseers will also adjust their schedule that week so that only the Memorial celebration will be scheduled for April 12.</p>

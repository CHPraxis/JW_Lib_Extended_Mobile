‘One of the Most Outstanding Books in History’
What publication could the writer from New Zealand have in mind? His letter explains: “We were all overjoyed to receive what must be one of the most outstanding works in the history of modern publishing, the book Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?
“The research that has preceded this outstanding and scholarly work is evident from the very start, and the clear and concise way in which each subject is dealt with has at least one scientist at our local Horticultural research centre of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries eager to read the book through.”

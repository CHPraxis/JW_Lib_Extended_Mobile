Include Meetings in Your Vacation Plans
1 “Now that I have made arrangements for my vacation, how can I locate the nearest Kingdom Hall?” Does that question come up at times when you plan a vacation? Many find that some of their most memorable experiences on vacation are enjoyed when they attend meetings and share in field service with the local congregation. This helps them to “widen out” in their hearts, resulting in a greater appreciation “for the whole association of brothers.”​—2 Cor. 6:11-13; 1 Pet. 2:17.
2 You may travel to areas where you are already acquainted with the local congregation because of previous visits. But how can you locate the nearest congregation when you have not been in that area before? Some local newspapers give the Kingdom Hall address along with meeting times. The local telephone directory may have a listing under “Jehovah’s Witnesses” or “Kingdom Hall.” Otherwise, you may find a policeman, postman, or other knowledgeable resident who can either direct you to the Kingdom Hall or assist you in contacting brothers living in the community. It is a good idea to look up the congregation as soon as you arrive in the area.
3 Meeting times are about the same in most places. However, keep in mind that Kingdom Halls in some areas may have meetings in different languages. By telephoning the Kingdom Hall in advance, you can make sure that the meeting you plan to attend is in your language, and you can ask for directions to help you find the hall.
4 Vacation time gives us an opportunity to be away from our secular activity and enjoy a few days of relaxation. However, we do not want to take time off from serving Jehovah. When attending meetings and sharing in the field ministry with the congregation where we are spending our vacation, we may find special refreshment for ourselves as well as be a source of encouragement to the local brothers.​—Heb. 10:24, 25; 13:15, 16.

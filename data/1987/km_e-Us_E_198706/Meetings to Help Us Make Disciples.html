<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">NOTE: <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>will schedule a Service Meeting for each week during the summer. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the district convention and then for a 30-minute review of the program highlights at the Service Meeting the following week. The day-by-day review may be assigned in advance to two or three qualified brothers who will be able to focus in on key points. This well-prepared review will help the brothers to remember key points for personal application and use in the field. Any experiences used or occasional comments from the audience should be brief and to the point.</p>

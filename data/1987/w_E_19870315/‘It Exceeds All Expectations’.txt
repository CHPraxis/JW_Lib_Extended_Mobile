‘It Exceeds All Expectations’
A man in the Netherlands employed as a scientific researcher writes: “It is not often that I take my pen to express my appreciation for things I have read. But the publication Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? really is a unique book.”
The man explains that he comes in daily contact with biologists and that “it would take a miracle for such a one ever to be convinced of creation. But this book really does exceed all expectations. The logical buildup of the chapters and the illustrations are scientifically so up-to-date that you would have to be blind to raise any objections to them. . . . What more than anything else makes this book credible are the literature references, in which famous evolutionists are allowed to speak . . . I certainly intend to bring this book to the notice of some of my (former and future) colleagues.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Community leaders in first-century Rome told the Christian apostle Paul: “We want to hear what you believe, for the only thing we know about these Christians is that they are denounced everywhere!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:22-44:28:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 28:22</a>, <em>The Living Bible</em>) Those persons wanted to hear from the source rather than from outside critics alone.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Today, Jehovah’s Witnesses are also often spoken against, and it would be a mistake to expect to learn the truth about them from prejudiced sources. So we are pleased to offer three 32-page brochures that describe the beliefs of Jehovah’s Witnesses, namely, <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Twentieth Century, School and Jehovah’s Witnesses, </em>and <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses​—Unitedly Doing God’s Will Worldwide, </em>for only $1.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Please send, postpaid, the three brochures <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Twentieth Century, School and Jehovah’s Witnesses, </em>and <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses​—Unitedly Doing God’s Will Worldwide. </em>I enclose $1 (U.S.).</p>

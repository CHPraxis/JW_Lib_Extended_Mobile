What Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Believe?
Community leaders in first-century Rome told the Christian apostle Paul: “We want to hear what you believe, for the only thing we know about these Christians is that they are denounced everywhere!” (Acts 28:22, The Living Bible) Those persons wanted to hear from the source rather than from outside critics alone.
Today, Jehovah’s Witnesses are also often spoken against, and it would be a mistake to expect to learn the truth about them from prejudiced sources. So we are pleased to offer three 32-page brochures that describe the beliefs of Jehovah’s Witnesses, namely, Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Twentieth Century, School and Jehovah’s Witnesses, and Jehovah’s Witnesses​—Unitedly Doing God’s Will Worldwide, for only $1.
Please send, postpaid, the three brochures Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Twentieth Century, School and Jehovah’s Witnesses, and Jehovah’s Witnesses​—Unitedly Doing God’s Will Worldwide. I enclose $1 (U.S.).

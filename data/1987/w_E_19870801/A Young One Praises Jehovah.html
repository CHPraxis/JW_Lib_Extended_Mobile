<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">MANY opportunities for witnessing are open to young ones when they have a strong desire to serve Jehovah. This was seen in the experience of a five-year-old boy in western Kenya.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:1-21:12:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 12:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">His mother asked him: “What do you want to be when you grow up?” The boy had observed a special pioneer in the congregation and replied: “I want to become a special pioneer like Brother F​——.” The mother answered: “But this is not possible; you cannot even be a regular pioneer because you do not have a Bible study.” The boy asked: “What can I do then?” His mother suggested he try to teach his playmates from his copy of <em>My Book of Bible Stories.</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The five-year-old got his <em>Bible Stories </em>book and went calling on his friends, inviting them to study the Bible with him. The result?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">He formed a group of ten that he could study with. He made good use of the pictures, raised many searching questions, and asked review questions at the end of the study. If they did not remember, he would go over the material with them again. The mother explained that it was really a joy to see all these children sitting on the ground in front of her house studying together! There was her five-year-old son asking questions, and then all the hands would go up to answer.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">It was a further joy to the mother, as well as to the congregation, to see eight of these children attend congregation meetings. The other two were too small. All of this happened because a five-year-old wanted to praise Jehovah and help others.</p>

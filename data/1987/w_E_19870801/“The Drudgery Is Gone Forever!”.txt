“The Drudgery Is Gone Forever!”
So commented one user of the Watch Tower Publications Index 1930-1985. She adds: “What a difference personal study is. . . . Can’t get over how much I can look up in just a short period of time.”
This new book has indexed every publication produced by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society since 1930. By using it with your library of Watch Tower publications, you can with ease find specific information on literally thousands of subjects, such as:
□ the dos and don’ts of discipline in child training
□ how to prepare for a job interview
□ what a prayer should not include
□ the role of DNA in cell replication
□ the Christian view of birth control
□ the secrets of attractive dress
Please send, postpaid, the Watch Tower Publications Index 1930-1985. I enclose $7.00 (U.S.). (Outside the U.S.A., write to local Watch Tower branch for information.)

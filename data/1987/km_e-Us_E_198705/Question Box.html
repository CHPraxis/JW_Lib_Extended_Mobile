<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>‚óè Is it proper for elders to review the questions with more than one baptism candidate at a time, and how long should each session last?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">There are definite advantages in reviewing the questions in <em>Our Ministry </em>with baptism candidates individually. By having each candidate answer every question, the elders will get a clearer picture of his depth of understanding, leaving no doubt as to whether he is ready for baptism or not. Additionally, the one requesting baptism may be more inclined to express himself if he is meeting privately with an elder.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">There may be circumstances, however, that could make it appropriate to meet with more than one candidate at a time. It may be practical to meet with a husband and a wife or other family members as a group, especially if they have studied together and plan to be baptized at the same time. Or if there are few elders and an unusually large number preparing for baptism, it may be necessary to meet with the candidates in groups of not more than two or three. Good judgment should be exercised in this.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Generally, each session would last about one hour, but there is no objection to using more time if that is necessary. (This may be the case when a group of two or three is involved or when more time is required in order for the elders to make sure the candidate is ready for baptism.) Neither the elder nor the candidate should be rushed in getting through the questions.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The newly dedicated one should be well prepared, having already considered the questions privately and having looked up and read as many of the cited scriptures as possible. There is no need for someone to go over the questions with him before he meets with the elders. ALL the numbered questions are to be considered. The elders will also take up the optional questions that are appropriate for the candidate.</p>

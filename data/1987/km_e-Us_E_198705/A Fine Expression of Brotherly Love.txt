A Fine Expression of Brotherly Love
1 As discussed in Our Kingdom Ministry for December 1986, there continues to be an urgent need for more Kingdom Halls. The brothers are making regular contributions in support of the Society Kingdom Hall Fund, and this is indeed gratifying. It is in harmony with the Christian spirit of always being “ready to share.” Generous giving by the brothers shows that we are resting our hope on God, who “furnishes us all things richly for our enjoyment.”​—1 Tim. 6:17, 18.
2 In addition to financial support from congregations and individuals, there has been a loving response in other ways. Skilled workers donate valuable time and abilities to assist in the construction of needed Kingdom Halls. Others have contributed equipment and materials. While some of the congregation’s skilled craftsmen have been away to assist in Kingdom Hall construction, other publishers have increased their support of local field service activity. It is encouraging to note the wholehearted cooperation of so many. Since all of us “have gifts differing according to the undeserved kindness given to us,” let us continue making full use of these.​—Rom. 12:4, 6.
3 Does not your recent Memorial attendance make you keenly aware of the continuing need for more Kingdom Halls? The apostle Paul encouraged the Thessalonians to show their “brotherly love . . . in fuller measure.” (1 Thess. 4:9, 10) As you continue doing this in the practical ways here mentioned, you will be exhibiting the Christlike spirit of sharing. (Matt. 10:8; Acts 20:35) By all means, “let your brotherly love continue.”​—Heb. 13:1.

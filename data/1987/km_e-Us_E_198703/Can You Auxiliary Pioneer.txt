Can You Auxiliary Pioneer?
1 Organized to Accomplish Our Ministry, page 114, states: “Whatever your personal circumstances, if you are baptized, are of good moral standing, can arrange to meet the requirement of spending 60 hours a month in the field ministry and believe you could serve one or more months as an auxiliary pioneer, the congregation elders will be pleased to consider your application for this privilege of service.” So the auxiliary pioneer service is within the reach of most baptized publishers at some time during the year. Can you make room for this privilege?
2 Do not be quick to rule out the possibility of your serving. Old and young​—some with good health and others with poor health—​have joyfully shared in the auxiliary pioneer work for one or more months. It takes sacrifice and exertion, but the blessings to be received make it worth while.​—Luke 13:24; 1 Cor. 9:16.
3 It is helpful to outline a practical schedule that fits your circumstances and allows you to average at least two hours in service each day. Be sure to take the matter to Jehovah in prayer, and do not hesitate to invite others to work along with you. All of this will help you to meet the 60-hour requirement.
4 To apply, you can request an application from the presiding overseer of your congregation. This should be done well in advance of the time you wish to serve. If the Congregation Service Committee approves your application, your appointment will be announced to the congregation. This will alert others to the opportunity of working with you as their circumstances permit, and your example can encourage them. We heartily invite you to join the many that share regularly in the auxiliary pioneer work.

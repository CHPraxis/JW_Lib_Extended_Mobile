The Truth About the Kingdom of God

Jesus taught his followers to pray: “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified. Let your Kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also on earth.” (Matthew 6:9, 10) What is God’s Kingdom? What does it do? And why should we pray for it?




Jesus is the King of God’s Kingdom.
Luke 1:31-33: “You are to name him Jesus. This one will be great and will be called Son of the Most High, and Jehovah God will give him the throne of David his father, and he will rule as King over the house of Jacob forever, and there will be no end to his Kingdom.”
The Kingdom was the central theme of Jesus’ preaching.
Matthew 9:35: “Jesus set out on a tour of all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the good news of the Kingdom and curing every sort of disease and every sort of infirmity.”
Jesus gave his disciples a sign to help them know when the Kingdom was about to come.
Matthew 24:7: “For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another.”
Jesus’ disciples now preach about the Kingdom earth wide.
Matthew 24:14: “And this good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.”

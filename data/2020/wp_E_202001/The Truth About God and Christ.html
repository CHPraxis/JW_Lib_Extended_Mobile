<div class="openingContent"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">Although humans worship many gods, there is only one true God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) He is “the Supreme One,” the Creator of everything and the Source of all life. He alone is worthy of our worship.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:18-27:7:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Daniel 7:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Revelation 4:11</a>.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>What Is God’s Name? </strong>God himself says: “I am Jehovah. That is my name.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:8-23:42:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 42:8</a>) The personal name of God appears some 7,000 times in the Bible. However, many Bible translations improperly substitute this name with a title, such as “Lord.” God wants you to be his friend, so he encourages you to “call on his name.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:105:1-19:105:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 105:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><strong>Jehovah’s Titles. </strong>The Bible refers to Jehovah by such titles as “God,” “Almighty,” “Creator,” “Father,” “Lord,” and “Sovereign.” Many prayers are recorded in the Bible in which Jehovah is addressed by both a respectful title and his personal name, Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:9:4-27:9:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Daniel 9:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span><strong>God’s Form. </strong>God is an invisible spirit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:24-43:4:24" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 4:24</a>) The Bible confirms that “no man has seen God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:18-43:1:18" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 1:18</a>) The Bible reveals his feelings. People can cause him grief, or they can “bring pleasure to him.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:20-20:11:20" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 11:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:78:40-19:78:41" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Psalm 78:40, 41</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>God’s Wonderful Attributes. </strong>God is impartial toward people of all nations and backgrounds. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:34-44:10:35" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 10:34, 35</a>) He is also “merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and abundant in loyal love and truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:6-2:34:7" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Exodus 34:6, 7</a>) However, four attributes of God are especially appealing.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Power. </strong>Since he is “God Almighty,” he has unlimited power to accomplish whatever he promises.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:17:1-1:17:1" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Genesis 17:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><strong>Wisdom. </strong>God’s wisdom surpasses that of anyone else. In that sense the Bible says that he “alone is wise.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:16:27-45:16:27" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Romans 16:27</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>Justice. </strong>God always does what is right. His actions are “perfect,” and he “is never unjust.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:4-5:32:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><strong>Love. </strong>The Bible says that “God is love.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:8-62:4:8" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 John 4:8</a>) Not only does God show love​—he is the very personification of love. His superlative love influences everything he does, and it benefits us in many ways.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><strong>God’s Friendship With Humans. </strong>God is our loving heavenly Father. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9</a>) If we put faith in him, we can be his friends. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:25:14-19:25:14" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Psalm 25:14</a>) In fact, God invites you to draw close to him in prayer and to “throw all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:7-60:5:7" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:8-59:4:8" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> James 4:8</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><strong>Jesus Is Not God. </strong>Jesus is unique​—he is the only person created directly by God. That is why the Bible calls him God’s Son. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:14-43:1:14" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John 1:14</a>) After creating Jesus, Jehovah used his firstborn as “a master worker” to create everything and everyone else.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:30-20:8:31" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Proverbs 8:30, 31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:15-51:1:16" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Colossians 1:15, 16</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span><strong>Jesus Christ never claimed to be God. </strong>Instead, he explained: “I am a representative from [God], and that One sent me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:29-43:7:29" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 7:29</a>) When speaking to one of his disciples, Jesus called Jehovah “my Father and your Father” and “my God and your God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:20:17-43:20:17" data-bid="21-1" class="b">John 20:17</a>) After Jesus died, Jehovah resurrected him to life in heaven and gave him great authority at His right hand.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:18-40:28:18" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Matthew 28:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:32-44:2:33" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Acts 2:32, 33</a>.</p>
<h3 id="p16" data-pid="16"><strong>Jesus Christ Can Help You Draw Close to God</strong></h3>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><strong>Jesus came to the earth to teach us about his Father. </strong>Jehovah himself said about Jesus: “This is my Son, the beloved. Listen to him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:9:7-41:9:7" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Mark 9:7</a>) Jesus knows God better than anyone else. He said: “No one knows who the Father is except the Son and anyone to whom the Son is willing to reveal him.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:22-42:10:22" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Luke 10:22</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><strong>Jesus reflects God’s qualities perfectly. </strong>Jesus imitated his Father’s qualities so closely that he could say: “Whoever has seen me has seen the Father also.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:9-43:14:9" data-bid="25-1" class="b">John 14:9</a>) Jesus drew people to God by reflecting his Father’s love in his own words and deeds. He said: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:6-43:14:6" data-bid="26-1" class="b">John 14:6</a>) He also said: “True worshippers will worship the Father with spirit and truth, for indeed, the Father is looking for ones like these to worship him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:23-43:4:23" data-bid="27-1" class="b">John 4:23</a>) Imagine that! Jehovah is looking for people like you who want to know the truth about him.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb">IT IS Sunday morning in Jerusalem. The year is 33 C.E., and it is the day of Pentecost. A group of about 120 disciples are gathered together in the upper room of a house. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:13-44:1:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 1:13-15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:1-44:2:1" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2:1</a>) A few days earlier, Jesus had instructed them to remain in Jerusalem because they were to receive a special gift.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>“Suddenly there [is] a noise from heaven, just like that of a rushing, stiff breeze.” The sound fills the whole house.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:8-44:1:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 1:8</a>) They become the first to be anointed by holy spirit<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> and given the hope of ruling with Jesus in heaven.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>Why did those at Pentecost have no doubt that they were anointed by holy spirit?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>If you were one of those disciples gathered in the upper room that day, you would never forget it. Something that looked like a tongue of fire came to rest on your head, and you began to speak in tongues! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:5-44:2:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 2:5-12</a>) <span id="page21" class="pageNum" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>There would be no question in your mind that you were anointed by holy spirit. But do all those who are anointed by holy spirit receive their anointing in some spectacular manner and at the same time in their life? No. How do we know?</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>Did all anointed ones in the first century receive their calling at the same time in their life? Explain.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Let us consider the matter of <strong><em>timing. </em></strong>That group of about 120 Christians were not the only ones anointed by holy spirit at Pentecost, 33 C.E. Later that day, about 3,000 others also received the promised holy spirit. Their anointing occurred when they got baptized. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:37-44:2:38" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 2:37, 38,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:41-44:2:41" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 41</a>) But in the years that followed, not all anointed Christians received their anointing at their baptism. The Samaritans received their anointing sometime after their baptism. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:14-44:8:17" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 8:14-17</a>) And in what certainly was an exceptional instance, Cornelius and his household were anointed even before they got baptized.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:44-44:10:48" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 10:44-48</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:21-47:1:22" data-bid="35-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 1:21, 22</a>, what happens when someone is anointed by holy spirit?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Let us also consider <strong><em>what happens </em></strong>when a person is anointed by holy spirit. Some who are anointed may at first find it hard to accept that Jehovah has chosen them. They may wonder, ‘Why did God choose me?’ Others may not have that reaction. Whatever the case, the apostle Paul explains what happens to all who are anointed: “After you believed, you were sealed<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> by means of him with the promised holy spirit, which is a token in advance of our inheritance.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:13-49:1:14" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Eph. 1:13, 14</a>; ftn.) So Jehovah uses his holy spirit to make it absolutely clear to these Christians that he has chosen them. In this way, the holy spirit is “a token [a pledge or promise]” given to assure them that in the future they will live forever in heaven <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>and not on earth.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:21-47:1:22" data-bid="11-1" class="b"><strong>2 Corinthians 1:21, 22</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>What must an anointed Christian do to receive his heavenly reward?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>If a Christian is anointed, will he automatically receive his heavenly reward? No. He is sure that he has been chosen to go to heaven. However, he must remember this admonition: “Brothers, be all the more diligent to make your calling and choosing sure for yourselves, for <strong><em>if you keep on doing these things, </em></strong>you will by no means ever fail.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:10-61:1:10" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Pet. 1:10</a>) So even though an anointed Christian has been chosen, or called, to go to heaven, he will get his reward only if he remains faithful.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:12-50:3:14" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Phil. 3:12-14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:1-58:3:1" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Heb. 3:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:10-66:2:10" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Rev. 2:10</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>But how does a person know that he or she has the heavenly calling? The answer is clearly seen in Paul’s words to those in Rome who were “called to be holy ones.” He told them: “You did not receive a spirit of slavery causing fear again, but you received a spirit of adoption as sons, by which spirit we cry out: <em>‘Abba, </em>Father!’ <strong><em>The spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are God’s children.” </em></strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:7-45:1:7" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Rom. 1:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:15-45:8:16" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 8:15, 16</a>) So by means of his holy spirit, God makes it clear to anointed ones that they have this heavenly calling.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:2:12-52:2:12" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Thess. 2:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Jehovah leaves no doubt whatsoever in the minds and hearts of those who receive his invitation to go to heaven. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:20-62:2:20" data-bid="16-1" class="b"><strong>1 John 2:20,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:27-62:2:27" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> <strong>27</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Of course, anointed Christians need to be taught by Jehovah through the congregation just like everyone else. But they do not need anyone to confirm that they are anointed. Jehovah has used the most powerful force in the universe, his holy spirit, to make it absolutely clear to them that they are anointed!</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Most of God’s servants today may find it difficult to understand what happens to someone when God anoints him. This is normal because they themselves have not been anointed. God created humans to live forever on earth, not in heaven. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:28-1:1:28" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Gen. 1:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Ps. 37:29</a>) But Jehovah has chosen some to live in heaven. So when he anoints them, he changes their hope and way of thinking drastically, so that they look forward to life in heaven.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:18-49:1:18" data-bid="18-1" class="b"><strong>Ephesians 1:18</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>What does it mean to be “born again”? (See also footnote.)</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>When Christians are anointed by holy spirit, they are “born again,” or “born from above.”<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span> Jesus also indicated that it is impossible to explain exactly to someone who has not been anointed how it feels to be “born again,” or to be “born from the spirit.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:3-43:3:8" data-bid="19-1" class="b">John 3:3-8</a>; ftn.</p>

Before Jehovah anointed these Christians, they treasured the hope of living forever on earth. They looked forward with great eagerness to the time when Jehovah would remove all wickedness and make the earth a paradise. Perhaps they imagined themselves welcoming back a family member or a friend who had died. But after they were anointed, they started to think differently. Why is that? They did not become dissatisfied with that earthly hope. They did not change their mind because of emotional stress or turmoil. They did not suddenly feel that they would find living forever on earth to be boring. Instead, Jehovah used his holy spirit to change the way that they think and the hope that they cherish.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:3-60:1:4" data-bid="38-1" class="b">1 Peter 1:3, 4</a>, how do anointed Christians feel about their hope?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Someone who has been anointed may feel unworthy of this precious privilege. But he does not for one minute doubt that Jehovah has chosen him.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>So does this mean that anointed ones want to die? The apostle Paul answers that question. He compared their human body to a tent and said: “In fact, we who are in this tent groan, being weighed down, because <strong><em>we do not want to put this one off, </em></strong>but we want to put the other on, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:5:4-47:5:4" data-bid="21-1" class="b">2 Cor. 5:4</a>) These Christians have not lost interest in this life, wanting it to end quickly. On the contrary, they enjoy life and want to use each day to serve Jehovah with their family and friends. Yet, no matter what they are doing, they always remember the glorious hope that they have for the future.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:53-46:15:53" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:53;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:4-61:1:4" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 2 Pet. 1:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:2-62:3:3" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> 1 John 3:2, 3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:6-66:20:6" data-bid="22-4" class="b"> Rev. 20:6</a>.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Perhaps you are wondering if you have been anointed by holy spirit. If so, think about these important questions: Do you have a burning desire to do Jehovah’s will? Do you feel that you are especially zealous in the preaching work? Are you a keen student of God’s Word who loves to learn about “the deep things of God”? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:10-46:2:10" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Cor. 2:10</a>) Do you feel that Jehovah has given you wonderful results in the preaching work? Do you have a deep inner feeling of responsibility to help others spiritually? Have you seen proof that Jehovah has helped you in many specific ways in your life? If you answer these questions with a resounding yes, does this prove that you now have the heavenly calling? No, it does not. Why not? Because <strong><em>all </em></strong>of God’s servants can feel this way, whether they are anointed or not. And by means of his holy spirit, Jehovah can give the same power to any of his servants, no matter what their hope is. In fact, if you are wondering whether you have been anointed by holy spirit, such doubt in itself would mean that you have <strong><em>not </em></strong>been. Those called by Jehovah do not wonder whether they have been anointed or not! They know!</p>

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Can You Explain Your Faith?




If someone asked you why you believe in creation, what would you say? In order to answer confidently, you must do two things: First, you need to prove to yourself that creation is true. (Ro 12:1, 2) Then, you must think about how to explain your faith to someone else.​—Pr 15:28.
WATCH THE VIDEOS AN ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON EXPLAINS HER FAITH AND A ZOOLOGIST EXPLAINS HIS FAITH TO SEE THE REASONS OTHERS HAVE FOR BELIEVING IN CREATION, AND THEN ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS:





  Why does Irène Hof Laurenceau believe in creation rather than in evolution?






  Why does Yaroslav Dovhanych believe in creation rather than in evolution?

  How would you explain to someone why you believe in creation?

  What resources from Jehovah’s organization are available in your language to help you prove to yourself and others that God created all things?

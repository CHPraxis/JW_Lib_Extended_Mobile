TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | GENESIS 6-8
“He Did Just So”




6:9, 13-16, 22
Imagine how much effort was required for Noah and his family to build the ark without modern tools and construction methods.
  The structure was enormous​—about 437 feet (133 m) long, 73 feet (22 m) wide, and 44 feet (13 m) tall

  Trees had to be cut, hewn, and lifted into place

  Both the inside and outside of the massive structure had to be covered with tar

  A one year’s supply of food had to be stockpiled for Noah’s family and the animals

  The project likely took 40 to 50 years to complete


How can this account encourage us when we find it difficult to do what Jehovah asks of us?

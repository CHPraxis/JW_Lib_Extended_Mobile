TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | GENESIS 3-5
The Devastating Consequences of the First Lie




3:1-6, 15-19





Satan has been misleading humans ever since he lied to Eve. (Re 12:9) How do the following lies that are promoted by Satan hinder people from drawing close to Jehovah?
  There is no all-powerful divine being

  God is a mysterious Trinity

  God does not have a name

  God torments people forever in a burning hell

  Everything that happens is God’s will

  God does not care about humans


How do these lies about God make you feel?
How can you help to clear God’s name?

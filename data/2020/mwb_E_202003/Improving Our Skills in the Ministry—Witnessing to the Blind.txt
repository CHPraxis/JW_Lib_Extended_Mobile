LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Improving Our Skills in the Ministry​—Witnessing to the Blind




WHY IMPORTANT: Many who are blind do not feel comfortable talking to strangers. Therefore, it takes skill to give such ones a witness. Jehovah shows loving concern for the blind. (Le 19:14) We can imitate his example by taking the initiative to help the blind spiritually.
HOW TO DO IT:
  “Search out” the blind. (Mt 10:11) Do you know someone who has a blind family member? Does your territory have schools, nursing homes, or other facilities that would like publications designed for the blind?

  Show personal interest. Your genuine friendliness and sincere interest will help put a blind person at ease. Try to start a conversation on a subject of local interest

  Provide spiritual help. To assist those who are visually impaired, the organization has produced literature in various formats. Ask the individual how he prefers to learn. The service overseer should confirm that the literature servant fills requests for literature in a blind person’s preferred format





Literature for the visually impaired is available in several languages in these formats:
  Audio files from our app and website

  Large print

  Braille

  Electronic files for notetakers (portable electronic devices with a speech synthesizer and a refreshable braille display)

  Electronic files for screen readers (computer programs that read audibly whatever is on the monitor)

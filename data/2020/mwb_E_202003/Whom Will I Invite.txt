LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Whom Will I Invite?




Each year we make a special effort to invite people in the territory to join us in observing the Memorial. Most of them are strangers to us. We should also invite people whom we know. People who receive an invitation from an acquaintance are often more likely to attend. (yb08 11 ¶3; 14 ¶1) Who are some individuals whom you could invite?
  Relatives

  Workmates or schoolmates

  Neighbors

  Return visits and past and present Bible students


In addition, the elders will invite those who are inactive. What if an acquaintance does not live in your area? You can find out the time and location of the Memorial where he lives by clicking the ABOUT US tab at the top of the jw.org home page and selecting “Memorial.” As you prepare for this year’s observance, think about those you can invite, and then extend a personal invitation.

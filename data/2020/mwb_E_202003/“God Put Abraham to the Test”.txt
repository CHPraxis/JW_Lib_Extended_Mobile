TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | GENESIS 22-23
“God Put Abraham to the Test”




22:1, 2, 9-12, 15-18
The pain that Abraham suffered as he prepared to sacrifice Isaac helps us to imagine Jehovah’s pain when He offered His Son, Jesus Christ, as the ransom. (Joh 3:16) How do Jehovah’s words in verse 2 reflect his own tender feelings?





How does Jehovah’s love motivate you?​—1Co 6:20; 1Jo 4:11

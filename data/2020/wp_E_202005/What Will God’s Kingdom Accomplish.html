<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Bible says that on taking Kingdom power, Jesus would expel Satan and his demons from heaven. Their activity is now restricted to the earth, which is one of the reasons why things have become so bad since the year 1914.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:7-66:12:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 12:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:9-66:12:9" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 9</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Despite worsening world conditions, Jesus, as King of God’s Kingdom, has done things to help people around the earth. Thanks to the worldwide Bible educational work that Jesus foretold, many are learning and applying Bible principles in their daily life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:2-23:2:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>) Millions have learned to have a balanced view of work, to improve their family life, and to enjoy material things without becoming slaves to them. These people are learning to benefit themselves now and are becoming the kind of people God wants as subjects of his Kingdom.</p>

<div class="openingContent"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">Have you ever prayed for God’s Kingdom to come? Over the centuries, millions have repeated the words “Thy kingdom come.” Why have they prayed that way? Because Jesus told his followers to pray for God’s Kingdom.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">At first, Jesus’ followers did not understand everything he said about the Kingdom. They once asked him: “Lord, are you restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time?” They were probably surprised when Jesus did not give them a direct answer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:6-44:1:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 1:6, 7</a>) Does that mean we cannot find out what God’s Kingdom is and when it will come? Not at all!</p>

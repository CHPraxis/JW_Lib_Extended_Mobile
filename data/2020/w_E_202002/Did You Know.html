<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">FOR many years, Bible critics claimed that King Belshazzar, who is mentioned in the book of Daniel, never existed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:5:1-27:5:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Dan. 5:1</a>) They held that view because archaeologists could find no evidence that he had actually lived. However, that changed in 1854. Why?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In that year, a British consul named J. G. Taylor explored some ruins in the ancient city of Ur, in what is now southern Iraq. There, located in a large tower, the explorer found several clay cylinders. The cylinders, each about four inches (10 cm) long, are engraved with cuneiform writing. The writing on one of the cylinders includes a prayer for the long life of Babylonian King Nabonidus and his oldest son, Belshazzar. Even critics had to agree: This finding proves that Belshazzar did exist.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">However, the Bible states not only that Belshazzar existed but also that he was a king. Again, critics were skeptical. For example, the 19th-century English scientist William Talbot wrote that some state that “Bel-sar-ussur [Belshazzar] was co-regent with Nabonidus his father. But of this there is not the slightest evidence.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">That controversy was settled, however, when the writings on other clay cylinders revealed that Belshazzar’s father, King Nabonidus, was away from the capital city for years at a time. What happened during his absence? “When Nabonidus went into exile,” states the <em>Encyclopaedia Britannica, </em>“he entrusted Belshazzar with the throne and the major part of his army.” So Belshazzar served, in effect, as a coruler in Babylon during that time. Thus, archaeologist and language scholar Alan Millard stated that it was appropriate for “the Book of Daniel to call Belshazzar ‘king.’”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Of course, for God’s servants, the principal evidence that the book of Daniel is trustworthy and inspired by God is found within the Bible itself.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:16</a>.</p>

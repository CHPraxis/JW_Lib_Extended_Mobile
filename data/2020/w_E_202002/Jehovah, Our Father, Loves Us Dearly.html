<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">IMAGINE that you are living some 2,500 years ago in Persia. You want to speak to the king of the land about a matter, so you travel to the royal city of Shushan. You would not even think of approaching the monarch without first receiving his permission. To do otherwise could very well cost you your life!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/17:4:11-17:4:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Esther 4:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>2. </strong>How can we feel about approaching Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>How thankful we are that Jehovah is not like that Persian king! Jehovah is vastly superior to any human ruler, and yet he welcomes us at any time. He wants us to feel free to approach him. For example, although Jehovah bears such lofty titles as Grand Creator, Almighty, and Sovereign Lord, we are invited to call on him using the familiar term “Father.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 6:9</a>) How touching that Jehovah wants us to view him in such a warm and intimate way!</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>Why can we call Jehovah “Father,” and what will this article discuss?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>We can rightly call Jehovah “Father”​—he is the Source of our life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:36:9-19:36:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 36:9</a>) Because he is our Father, we have a responsibility to obey him. When we do what he asks of us, we will enjoy marvelous blessings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:9-58:12:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Heb. 12:9</a>) Those blessings include everlasting life, whether in heaven or on earth. We also enjoy benefits now. This article will discuss how Jehovah acts as a loving Father now and why we can be sure that he will never abandon us in the <span id="page3" class="pageNum" data-no="3" data-before-text="3"></span>future. But first, let us consider why we can be confident that our heavenly Father loves us dearly and cares for us.</p>

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>Why do some find it difficult to view Jehovah as their Father?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Do you find it difficult to think of God as your Father? Some may feel small and insignificant in comparison to Jehovah. They doubt that Almighty God cares about them as individuals. Yet, our loving Father does not want us to feel that way. He gave us life and wants us to have a relationship with him. After stating this truth, the apostle Paul explained to his listeners in Athens that Jehovah “is not far off from each one of us.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:24-44:17:29" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 17:24-29</a>) God wants each one of us to go to him just as a child naturally goes to a loving and caring parent.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>What do we learn from the experience of one Christian sister?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Others may find it hard to view Jehovah as their Father because their own human father showed them little or no love and affection. Consider the comments of one Christian sister. “My father was very abusive,” she says. “When I first began to study the Bible, it was difficult for me to relate to a heavenly Father. But after I came to know Jehovah, that all changed.” Do you have similar feelings? If so, be assured that you too can come to see Jehovah as the best possible Father.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:27-40:11:27" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Matthew 11:27</a>, what is one way that Jehovah has helped us to view him as our loving Father?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>One way that Jehovah has helped us to view him as our loving Father is by having Jesus’ words and actions recorded in the Bible. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:27-40:11:27" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 11:27</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Jesus so perfectly reflected his Father’s personality that he could say: “Whoever has seen me has seen the Father also.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:9-43:14:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 14:9</a>) Jesus often spoke about the role that Jehovah fulfills as a Father. In the four Gospels alone, Jesus used the term “Father” some 165 times in reference to Jehovah. Why did Jesus speak so much about Jehovah? One reason is that people might be convinced that Jehovah is a loving Father.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:25-43:17:26" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 17:25, 26</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>What do we learn about Jehovah from the way that he treated his Son?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Consider what we learn about Jehovah from the way that he treated his Son, Jesus. Jehovah always heard Jesus’ prayers. He not only heard Jesus’ prayers but also answered them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:41-43:11:42" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 11:41, 42</a>) No matter what trials Jesus faced, he sensed his Father’s love and support.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:42-42:22:43" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Luke 22:42, 43</a>.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>In what ways did Jehovah provide for Jesus?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Jesus acknowledged that his Father was the Source and Sustainer of his life when he stated: “I live because of the Father.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:57-43:6:57" data-bid="12-1" class="b">John 6:57</a>) Jesus completely trusted in his Father, and Jehovah supplied his physical needs. Most important, Jehovah cared for Jesus spiritually.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:4-40:4:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 4:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>How did Jehovah prove to be a loving and caring Father to Jesus?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>As a loving Father, Jehovah made sure that Jesus knew he had his Father’s backing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:53-40:26:53" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 26:53;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:16-43:8:16" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> John 8:16</a>) While Jehovah did not shield Jesus from all injury, He helped him to endure trials. Jesus was assured that any harm he <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>might suffer would be temporary. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:2-58:12:2" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Heb. 12:2</a>) Jehovah proved that he cared for Jesus by listening to him, providing for him, training him, and supporting him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:20-43:5:20" data-bid="16-1" class="b">John 5:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:28-43:8:28" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 8:28</a>) Let us now see how our heavenly Father cares for us in similar ways.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup><em>Jehovah listens to our prayers. </em>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:66:19-19:66:20" data-bid="17-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 66:19, 20</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>He does not want us to limit our prayers; he urges us to pray often. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:17-52:5:17" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 Thess. 5:17</a>) We can respectfully approach our God at any time, no matter where we are. He is never too busy to listen to us; he is always available and attentive. When we appreciate that Jehovah listens to our prayers, we are drawn to him. “I love Jehovah,” said the psalmist, “because he hears my voice.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:116:1-19:116:1" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 116:1</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Our Father not only listens to our prayers but also answers them. The apostle John assures us: “No matter what we ask according to [God’s] will, he hears us.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:14-62:5:15" data-bid="20-1" class="b">1 John 5:14, 15</a>) Of course, Jehovah may not answer our prayers in the way that we expect.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:8-54:5:8" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:8</a>) He cares for the material needs of his children.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Most important, Jehovah provides for our spiritual needs. Through his Word, he has revealed the truth about himself, his purpose, the meaning of life, and the future. He showed us personal attention when we first learned the truth, using our parents or another teacher to help us come to know him. And we continue to receive kind assistance from loving congregation elders and other mature brothers and sisters. In addition, Jehovah instructs us through our congregation meetings, where we learn alongside our spiritual family. In these and other ways, Jehovah shows his fatherly interest in all of us.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:32:8-19:32:8" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ps. 32:8</a>.</p>

So as part of our training, our loving Father disciplines us when necessary.

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>We see proof of Jehovah’s love for us in the way he responded to the problems that first arose within his earthly family.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"><strong>3-4. </strong>Who has emerged as the king of the north? Explain.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, God’s people in that vast region enjoyed “a little help”​—a period of freedom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:34-27:11:34" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Dan. 11:34</a>) As a result, they were able to preach freely, and before long the number of publishers in the former Communist bloc rose to hundreds of thousands. Gradually, Russia and its allies emerged as the king of the north. As discussed in the preceding article, for a government to fill the role of the king of the north or the king of the south, it must do three things: (1) interact directly with God’s people, (2) show by its actions that it is an enemy of Jehovah and his people, and (3) compete with the rival king.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Note why we can say that today the king of the north is Russia and its allies. (1) They have had a direct impact on God’s people, banning the preaching work and persecuting hundreds of thousands of brothers and sisters who live in areas under their control. (2) Those actions show that they hate Jehovah and his people. (3) They have been competing with the king of the south, the Anglo-American World Power. Let us see how Russia and its allies have filled the role of the king of the north.</p>

The passage highlights the rivalry between the king of the north and the king of the south. As foretold by Daniel, in the time of the end, the king of the south would engage with the king of the north “in a pushing,” or he would “lock horns with him.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:40-27:11:40" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Dan. 11:40</a>; ftn.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>The king of the north and the king of the south continue to compete for world domination. For example, consider what happened after World War II when the Soviet Union and its allies gained influence over much of Europe. The actions of the king of the north forced the king of the south to form an international military alliance, known as NATO. The king of the north continues to compete with the king of the south in an expensive arms race. The king of the north fought his rival in proxy wars and insurgencies in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In recent years, Russia and its allies have spread their influence across the globe. They have also engaged with the king of the south in cyber warfare. The kings have accused each other of using destructive computer programs in an effort to damage their economies and political systems. And as foretold by Daniel, the king of the north continues his attack on God’s people.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:41-27:11:41" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Dan. 11:41</a>.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>What is “the land of the Decoration”?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:11:41-27:11:41" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Daniel 11:41</a> says that the king of the north will enter into “the land of the Decoration.” What is that land? In ancient times, the literal land of Israel was considered to be “the most beautiful of all the lands.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:20:6-26:20:6" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ezek. 20:6</a>) But what made that land especially precious was that it was the location where true worship was practiced. Since Pentecost 33 C.E., that “land” is not a single, literal geographic location; it cannot be, for Jehovah’s people are spread throughout the earth. Rather, “the land of the Decoration” today is the realm of activity of Jehovah’s people that includes such things as their worship of Jehovah through meetings and the field ministry.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>How has the king of the north entered into “the land of the Decoration”?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>During the last days, the king of the north has repeatedly entered into “the land of the Decoration.” For example, when Nazi Germany filled the role of <span id="page14" class="pageNum" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>the king of the north, particularly during the second world war, that king entered into “the land of the Decoration” by persecuting and killing God’s people. After World War II when the Soviet Union took on the role of the king of the north, that king entered into “the land of the Decoration” by persecuting God’s people, exiling them.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>In recent years, how have Russia and its allies entered into “the land of the Decoration”?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>In recent years, Russia and its allies have also entered into “the land of the Decoration.” How? In 2017, this current king of the north banned the work of Jehovah’s people and threw some of our brothers and sisters into prison. He also banned our publications, including the <em>New World Translation. </em>Further, he confiscated our branch office in Russia as well as Kingdom Halls and Assembly Halls. After these actions, in 2018 the Governing Body identified Russia and its allies as the king of the north. However, even when Jehovah’s people are severely persecuted, they refuse to participate in any action to subvert or change human governments. Rather, they follow the Bible’s counsel to pray for “all those who are in high positions,” especially when such ones are making decisions that could affect freedom of worship.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:1-54:2:2" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:1, 2</a>.</p>

They are described as the various parts of a giant metal image. The last human government in that series is depicted as the feet of the image that are made of iron mixed with clay.

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Sometime after the start of the great tribulation, “the kings of the entire inhabited earth” will form a coalition of nations.

What will provoke the attack? Speaking of this time, the apostle John saw a storm of unusually large hailstones raining down on God’s enemies. That symbolic hailstorm may take the form of a hard-hitting judgment message delivered by Jehovah’s people. It could be that this message provokes Gog of Magog into attacking God’s people with the intention of wiping them off the earth.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:21-66:16:21" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Rev. 16:21</a>.</p>

I was told that many immigrants fraudulently lived off social benefits and that they were more prone to criminal behavior. This made it difficult for me to accept them. However, I did not characterize my feelings as prejudice, because this was how the majority of people viewed immigrants.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sc">“In time, however, I realized that my negative attitude toward immigrants was in fact prejudicial. The practical wisdom of the Bible has helped me to be more loving toward them. Now I do not avoid them. On the contrary, I greet them and speak with them. I try to get to know each of them as a person. Now my feelings toward them are positive, and I feel very comfortable with them.”</p>

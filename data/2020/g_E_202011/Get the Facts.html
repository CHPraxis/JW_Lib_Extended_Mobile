<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Prejudice is often based on misinformation. Consider the following examples:</p>
<ul><li><p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="su">  Some employers have mistakenly believed that women are unqualified for scientific or technical jobs.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="su">  In medieval Europe, Jews were falsely accused of poisoning wells and spreading disease. During Nazi rule, Jews were again slandered. But this time they were accused of causing the economic crisis in Germany. Both cases resulted in the Jews becoming victims of extreme prejudice, some of which is still evident today.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">  Many people wrongly conclude that everyone who has a disability is sad or bitter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">People who believe myths such as those may point to examples or alleged evidence that seems to confirm their bias. And they think that anyone who disagrees with them is ignorant.</p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sc">Jovica, quoted earlier in this series of articles, grew up hearing his countrymen, the news, and television programs give negative reports about a minority group. “I became filled with prejudice​—and even hatred—​for those people,” he says. “And I thought I was completely justified in feeling that way.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sc">“However, while in the army, I had no choice but to live and work with fellow soldiers from that minority group. In time, I learned more about them. I even started to learn their language and to listen to their folk songs. I began to have pleasant dealings with them, and I started to view them differently. Still, prejudicial feelings can surface. So I avoid news reports that put that ethnic group in a negative light. Also, I do not watch movies or popular comedies that mock them. I know that prejudicial feelings can grow into anger and hatred.”</p>

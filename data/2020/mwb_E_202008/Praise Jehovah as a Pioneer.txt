LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Praise Jehovah as a Pioneer




The Israelites had remarkable reasons to praise Jehovah. He had brought them out of Egypt and had rescued them from Pharaoh’s army! (Ex 15:1, 2) Jehovah continues to show goodness to his people. How can we show our gratitude?​—Ps 116:12.
One way is by serving as an auxiliary or a regular pioneer. You can pray for the desire and the power to serve as a pioneer. (Php 2:13) Many start first as an auxiliary pioneer. You may choose either a 30- or a 50-hour requirement during the months of March and April and during the month of the circuit overseer’s visit. After tasting the joy of serving as an auxiliary pioneer, you may want to reach out to serve as a regular pioneer. Even some who work full-time or who have health limitations have been able to serve as regular pioneers. (mwb16.07 8) Most certainly, Jehovah is worthy of any effort we put forth to praise him!​—1Ch 16:25.

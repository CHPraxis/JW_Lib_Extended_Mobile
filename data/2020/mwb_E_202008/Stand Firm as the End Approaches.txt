LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Stand Firm as the End Approaches




WHY IMPORTANT: Awe-inspiring events will soon test our courage and trust in Jehovah as never before. The great tribulation will begin with the destruction of false religion. (Mt 24:21; Re 17:16, 17) During that tumultuous time, we may well deliver a hard-hitting judgment message. (Re 16:21) We will face an attack by Gog of Magog. (Eze 38:10-12, 14-16) In response, Jehovah will bring “the war of the great day of God the Almighty.” (Re 16:14, 16) To strengthen our courage for these future events, we need to stand firm during current tests of faith.

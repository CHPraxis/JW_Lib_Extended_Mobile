TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | EXODUS 19-20
The Ten Commandments and You




20:3-17
Christians are not under the Mosaic Law. (Col 2:13, 14) So, then, what purpose do the Ten Commandments and the rest of the Law serve today?
  They reveal Jehovah’s viewpoint on certain matters

  They highlight our responsibilities toward Jehovah

  They define our relationship with our fellowman


What do you learn about Jehovah from the Ten Commandments?

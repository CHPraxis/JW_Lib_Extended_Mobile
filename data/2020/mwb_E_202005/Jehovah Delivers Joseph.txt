TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | GENESIS 40-41
Jehovah Delivers Joseph




41:9-13, 16, 29-32, 38-40
Joseph suffered as a slave and a prisoner for about 13 years before Jehovah delivered him. Rather than becoming bitter, Joseph let this experience refine him. (Ps 105:17-19) He knew that Jehovah never abandoned him. How did Joseph make the best of his situation?





  He showed industriousness and trustworthiness, giving Jehovah a basis to bless him.​—Ge 39:21, 22






  He took an interest in others instead of plotting revenge against those who mistreated him.​—Ge 40:5-7


How does Joseph’s experience help me endure my problems?
Until Jehovah delivers me at Armageddon, how can I make the best of my situation?

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Are You Prepared?




If a natural disaster strikes your area, are you prepared? Earthquakes, hurricanes, forest fires, and floods can occur suddenly and be very destructive. In addition, terrorist attacks, unrest, and epidemics can occur anywhere and without warning. (Ec 9:11) We should not assume that such events will never occur where we live.
Each of us must take reasonable steps to prepare for a disaster. (Pr 22:3) Although Jehovah’s organization provides a measure of assistance in times of disaster, this does not mean that we have no personal responsibility.​—Ga 6:5, ftn.

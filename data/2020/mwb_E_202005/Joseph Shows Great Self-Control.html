<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="noTopMargin">Can you imagine the strong emotions that Joseph may have felt when he unexpectedly came face-to-face with his brothers? He could have immediately identified himself and then either embraced them or taken revenge. But he did not act on impulse. What will you do if you are the victim of injustice from family members or others? Joseph’s example teaches the value of exercising self-control and remaining calm rather than following our treacherous heart and acting on imperfect impulses.</p>

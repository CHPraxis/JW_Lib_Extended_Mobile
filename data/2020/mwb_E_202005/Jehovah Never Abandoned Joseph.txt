TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | GENESIS 38-39
Jehovah Never Abandoned Joseph




39:1, 12-14, 20-23
During Joseph’s many trials, Jehovah made “everything that he did successful” and granted him “favor in the eyes of the chief officer of the prison.” (Ge 39:2, 3, 21-23) What lessons can we learn from this account?
  Our trials do not mean that we have lost Jehovah’s favor.​—Ps 34:19

  We should try to discern how Jehovah is blessing us and be thankful.​—Php 4:6, 7

  We should look to Jehovah to sustain us.​—Ps 55:22

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Be Like Joseph​—Flee From Immorality




Joseph provides a good example for us if we are tempted to commit sexual immorality. Each time the wife of his master tried to seduce him, he refused. (Ge 39:7-10) His reply: “How could I commit this great badness and actually sin against God?” indicated that he had already given thought to Jehovah’s view of marital faithfulness. Then when the situation became critical, he fled instead of lingering and giving the woman a chance to weaken his resolve.​—Ge 39:12; 1Co 6:18.

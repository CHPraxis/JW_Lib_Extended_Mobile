TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | LEVITICUS 10-11
Love for Jehovah Stronger Than Love for Family




10:1, 2, 4-7





Our loyalty to Jehovah can be greatly tested when a loved one is disfellowshipped. Jehovah’s instruction to Aaron provides a clear message to those who must cut off association with a disfellowshipped relative. Our love for Jehovah must be stronger than our love for unfaithful family members.
What blessings can come to those who work along with Jehovah’s instructions regarding disfellowshipped ones?​—1Co 5:11; 2Jo 10, 11

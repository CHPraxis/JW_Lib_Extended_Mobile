LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Are You Willing to Apply for the School for Kingdom Evangelizers?




Are you between the ages of 23 and 65 and in full-time service? Do you have good health, and are you able to serve wherever there is a greater need? If you answered yes to these questions, have you considered applying for the School for Kingdom Evangelizers? Since the first class, thousands of married couples, single brothers, and single sisters have applied. However, we need more single brothers to apply. Ask Jehovah to increase your desire to please him and to imitate his Son. (Ps 40:8; Mt 20:28; Heb 10:7) Then consider ways to reduce secular or personal obligations in order to qualify.
What avenues of service have opened to graduates after they received this theocratic training? Some graduates have been assigned to serve in areas where other languages are spoken or to share in special metropolitan public witnessing. Other graduates later serve as substitute circuit overseers, as circuit overseers, or as field missionaries. As you ponder prospects in Jehovah’s service, may you echo the words of the prophet Isaiah: “Here I am! Send me!”​—Isa 6:8.

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
We Show Love by Supporting Jehovah’s Discipline




Disfellowshipping protects the congregation and disciplines unrepentant wrongdoers. (1Co 5:6, 11) When we support such discipline from Jehovah, we show love. How can this be true when disfellowshipping causes emotional pain to all involved, including close relatives and the judicial committee?
Above all, we show love for Jehovah’s reputation and his standard of holiness. (1Pe 1:14-16) We also show love for the person who was disfellowshipped. Strong discipline, though painful, can yield “the peaceable fruit of righteousness.” (Heb 12:5, 6, 11) We interfere with Jehovah’s discipline if we associate with a disfellowshipped person or with one who has disassociated himself. Remember, Jehovah disciplines his people “to the proper degree.” (Jer 30:11) As we support Jehovah’s discipline and maintain our spiritual routine, we keep hoping for the person to return to our merciful Father.​—Isa 1:16-18; 55:7.

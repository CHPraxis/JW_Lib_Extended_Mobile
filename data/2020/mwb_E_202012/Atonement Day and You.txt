Atonement Day and You




16:12-15
What can we learn from the use of incense on Atonement Day?
  The acceptable prayers of Jehovah’s faithful servants are like incense. (Ps 141:2) Just as the high priest brought the incense to Jehovah with great respect, we approach Jehovah in prayer with awe and respect

  The high priest had to burn incense before he could offer up the sacrifices. Similarly, before Jesus could offer up his life as a sacrifice, he had to prepare the way for Jehovah to accept his sacrifice by living a life of integrity and loyalty







How can I make sure that my sacrifices to Jehovah will be acceptable to him?

Pure Worship Requires Cleanness




15:13-15, 28-31
To remain in God’s love, we need to be clean on the inside as well as on the outside. This means that we adhere faithfully to Jehovah’s standards of physical, moral, and spiritual cleanness, regardless of how the world around us acts. We refrain from touching anything that our heavenly Father views as unclean.





How do I benefit from rejecting this world’s ungodliness?

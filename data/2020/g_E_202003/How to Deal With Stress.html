<div class="openingContent"><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">To deal effectively with stress, you need to think about your physical health, the way you interact with others, and your goals and priorities in life​—that is, what you consider to be truly important. This article will review some practical principles that can help you to deal better with stress and perhaps even reduce it.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Never be anxious about the next day, for the next day will have its own anxieties.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:34-40:6:34" data-bid="1-1" class="b">MATTHEW 6:34</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Meaning: </strong>Daily anxieties are a part of life. But do not increase today’s anxieties by adding tomorrow’s to them. Try to live one day at a time.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">  Stress can cause anxiety. So try this: First, recognize that some stress is inevitable. Fretting over things you cannot prevent increases your stress. Second, understand that quite often things do not turn out the way we may fear they will.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">“The wisdom from above is . . . reasonable.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:17-59:3:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">JAMES 3:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>Meaning: </strong>Do not be a perfectionist. Avoid setting unrealistically high standards for yourself or others.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="su">  Be modest, set reasonable standards, and know both your limitations and those of others. When you do this, you will reduce stress all around and even encourage greater success. Also, keep a sense of humor. When you laugh​—even when something goes wrong—​you relieve tension and brighten your mood.</p>

<h2 id="p12" data-pid="12"><span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span><strong>Know What Stresses You</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">“A discerning man will remain calm.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:27-20:17:27" data-bid="3-1" class="b">PROVERBS 17:27</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><strong>Meaning: </strong>Negative emotions can cloud clear thinking, so try to stay calm.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="su">  Identify what stresses you, and note your response. For example, when you feel stressed, note your thoughts, feelings, and behavior, perhaps even making a record of them. By becoming more aware of your response to stress, you may be able to deal with it more effectively. Also, think of ways to eliminate stressful things from your life. If that is unrealistic, look for ways to reduce their impact, perhaps by managing your tasks or time more efficiently.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="su">  Try to see things in a different light. What stresses you may not stress someone else. The difference may be in viewpoint. Consider these three suggestions:</p>
<ol><li><p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sm">               Do not be quick to assume bad motives. A person may cut ahead of you in a line. If you attribute his act to rudeness, you may become upset. Instead, why not assume that his motive was good? You may be right!</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sm">               See the positive side of a situation. A long wait at a doctor’s office or an airport is easier to bear if you use the time to do some reading or to catch up on work or e-mail.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sm">               Keep the big picture in mind. Ask yourself, ‘Will this problem be a big issue tomorrow or next week?’ Distinguish between minor or short-term issues and more serious ones.</p>

<ul><li><p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="su">  We like a reasonable amount of order in life. One thing that can contribute to disorder​—and stress—​is procrastination, and this may lead to a growing list of unfinished tasks. Why not try these two suggestions?</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb"><strong>Meaning: </strong>Workaholics can deprive themselves of the benefits of their “two handfuls of hard work.” They may have no time or energy left to enjoy what they worked for.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="su">  Have a realistic view of work and money. More money does not mean more happiness or less stress. In fact, the opposite can be true. “The plenty belonging to the rich one does not permit him to sleep,” says <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:5:12-21:5:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 5:12</a>. So try to live within your means.</p>

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb"><strong>Meaning: </strong>Regular exercise promotes better health.</p>
<ul><li><p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="su">  Develop healthful habits. Physical activity can lift your mood and improve your body’s response to stress. Eat nutritious food, and try to avoid skipping meals. Be sure to get enough rest.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="su">  Avoid harmful “solutions” to stress, such as smoking or drug and alcohol abuse. In the long run, these heighten stress, perhaps by robbing you of your health and hard-earned money.</p>

<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sc">The book <em>Overcoming Stress </em>has a chapter entitled “Kill Your Stress with Kindness.” Treating others kindly, according to the author, Dr. Tim Cantopher, can promote health and happiness. On the other hand, an unkind or cruel person makes himself unhappy because he alienates himself from others.</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="sc">We may also get stress relief by treating ourselves kindly. For example, we should not make harsh or unrealistic demands on ourselves. Nor should we belittle or malign ourselves. “You must love your neighbor <em>as yourself,” </em>Jesus Christ said.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:31-41:12:31" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Mark 12:31</a>.</p>

What Causes Stress?




“Most adults report being under increasing levels of stress,” says the well-known Mayo Clinic. “Modern life is filled with change and uncertainty.” Consider just some of the changes and uncertainties that contribute to stress:
  divorce

  the death of a loved one

  severe illness

  serious accidents

  crime

  a hectic pace of life

  disasters​—natural or man-made

  pressures at school or work

  worries about employment and financial security





“THE LOSS OF A JOB,”
says the American Psychological Association, “can be devastating, putting unemployed workers at risk for physical illness, marital strain, anxiety, depression and even suicide. Loss of a job affects every part of life.”


STRESS IN EARLY CHILDHOOD
It is not uncommon for children to suffer from stress. Some are bullied at school or neglected at home. Others are abused physically, emotionally, or sexually. Many are anxious about exams and school grades. Still others see their family torn apart by divorce. Stressed children may have nightmares, learning difficulties, depression, or a tendency to be withdrawn. Some seem unable to control their emotions. A child suffering from stress needs urgent help.

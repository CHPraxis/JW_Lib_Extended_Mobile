<div class="openingContent"><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">The wisdom in the Bible can help us to avoid much needless stress. We ourselves cannot eliminate all that stresses us. But our Creator can. He has even appointed someone to come to our aid. That one is Jesus Christ. On a global scale, he will soon do even more wonderful things than he did when he was a man on earth. For example:</p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sc">“The world is more stressed, worried, sad and in pain today than we’ve ever seen it.”​—Mohamed S. Younis, Gallup managing editor.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sc">Why is stress so common? The Bible gives a most reasonable answer. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1</a>, it states: “In the last days will come . . . perilous times of great stress <em>and </em>trouble.” (<em>The Amplified Bible</em>) The reason, the Bible goes on to say, relates to the bad personality traits of people. These traits include greed, arrogance, religious hypocrisy, a violent disposition, a lack of family affection, and a lack of self-control. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:2-55:3:5" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:2-5</a>) The last days will end when Jesus Christ takes full control of the earth as King of God’s Kingdom, a heavenly government.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Daniel 2:44</a>.</p>

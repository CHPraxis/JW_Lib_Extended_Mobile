Jehovah’s Endearing Qualities




34:5-7
Appreciation for Jehovah’s qualities helped Moses to deal patiently with the Israelites. Similarly, if we deepen our understanding of Jehovah’s qualities, we can deal mercifully with fellow believers.
  “Merciful and compassionate”: Jehovah looks after his worshippers with tender love and deep concern, just as parents look after their children

  “Slow to anger”: Jehovah is patient with his servants, putting up with their shortcomings and giving them time to make changes

  “Abundant in loyal love”: Jehovah forges an unfailing bond of loyal love with his people







ASK YOURSELF, ‘How can I imitate Jehovah’s mercy and compassion?’

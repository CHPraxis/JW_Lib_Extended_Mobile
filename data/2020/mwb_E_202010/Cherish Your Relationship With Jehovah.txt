LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Cherish Your Relationship With Jehovah




Jehovah’s Witnesses have a special privilege. As dedicated, baptized Christians, we continue to cultivate a deep, personal relationship with the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. He has drawn us to himself through his Son. (Joh 6:44) He listens to our prayers.​—Ps 34:15.
How can we protect our precious relationship with God? For one thing, we must avoid the sinful course of the Israelites. Shortly after they entered into a covenant relationship with Jehovah, they made a golden calf and fell into idolatry. (Ex 32:7, 8; 1Co 10:7, 11, 14) We might ask ourselves: ‘How do I respond when confronted with temptation? Do my actions show that I cherish my relationship with Jehovah?’ Deep love for our heavenly Father will help us to flee from things that he hates.​—Ps 97:10.

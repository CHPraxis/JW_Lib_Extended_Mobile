TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | EXODUS 31-32
Flee From Idolatry




32:1, 4-6, 9, 10

Although we might not turn to outright idol worship, we could become idolaters by allowing selfish desires to distract us from worshipping Jehovah whole-souled.





What aspects of daily life could distract me from worshipping Jehovah, and how can I keep them from controlling me?

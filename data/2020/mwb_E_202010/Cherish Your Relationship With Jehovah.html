<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses have a special privilege. As dedicated, baptized Christians, we continue to cultivate a deep, personal relationship with the Sovereign Lord Jehovah. He has drawn us to himself through his Son. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:44-43:6:44" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Joh 6:44</a>) He listens to our prayers.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:15-19:34:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps 34:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">How can we protect our precious relationship with God? For one thing, we must avoid the sinful course of the Israelites. Shortly after they entered into a covenant relationship with Jehovah, they made a golden calf and fell into idolatry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:32:7-2:32:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ex 32:7, 8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:7-46:10:7" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1Co 10:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:11-46:10:11" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:14-46:10:14" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 14</a>) We might ask ourselves: ‘How do I respond when confronted with temptation? Do my actions show that I cherish my relationship with Jehovah?’ Deep love for our heavenly Father will help us to flee from things that he hates.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:97:10-19:97:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps 97:10</a>.</p>

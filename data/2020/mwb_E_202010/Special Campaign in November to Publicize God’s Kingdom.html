<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jesus declared “the good news of the Kingdom of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:43-42:4:43" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Lu 4:43</a>) He also taught people to pray for that Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mt 6:9, 10</a>) During November, we will make a special effort to publicize God’s Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mt 24:14</a>) Arrange your schedule to have a full share in this campaign. All those serving as auxiliary pioneers may choose a 30- or 50-hour requirement for this month.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Share a scripture regarding God’s Kingdom with as many people in your territory as possible. When selecting a scripture, take into account the religious background of your listeners. If someone expresses interest on the initial call, give him a copy of the public edition of <em>The Watchtower </em>No. 2 2020. Then follow up on the interest as soon as possible, and try to start a Bible study using a publication from our Teaching Toolbox. Limited time is left before God’s Kingdom crushes all authority in opposition to it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Da 2:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:24-46:15:25" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1Co 15:24, 25</a>) Therefore, may we take full advantage of this special opportunity to show our allegiance to Jehovah and his Kingdom!</p>

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Young Ones​—Is Jehovah Your Best Friend?




What qualities do you look for in a friend? You probably value loyalty, kindness, and generosity. Jehovah displays them all. (Ex 34:6; Ac 14:17) He listens when you pray to him. He gives you a helping hand whenever you need it. (Ps 18:19, 35) He forgives your mistakes. (1Jo 1:9) What a wonderful Friend Jehovah is!
How can you be a friend to Jehovah? Learn about him by reading his Word. Confide in him. (Ps 62:8; 142:2) Show that you value things that are important to Jehovah, such as his Son, his Kingdom, and his promises for the future. Tell others about him. (De 32:3) If you cultivate a close friendship with Jehovah, he will be your Friend forever.​—Ps 73:25, 26, 28.

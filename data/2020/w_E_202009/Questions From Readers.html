<div id="section1" class="section">
<h2 id="p2" data-pid="2"><strong>Is </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:5:8-21:5:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Ecclesiastes 5:8</strong></a> <strong>referring to human rulers, or is Jehovah involved?</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This thought-provoking verse reads: “If you see any oppression of the poor and a violation of justice and righteousness in your district, do not be surprised about the matter. For that high official is being watched by one who is higher than he is, and there are others who are still higher than they are.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:5:8-21:5:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eccl. 5:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">From a human standpoint, this statement well describes men with authority in government. Beyond that, though, it also conveys a truth about Jehovah, which should comfort and reassure us.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:5:8-21:5:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 5:8</a> refers to a ruler who oppresses the poor and denies them justice. The ruler ought to remember that he is likely being watched by someone who has a higher post or more authority in government than he has. In fact, there may be others who have even higher positions. Sadly, in human governments, all these rulers may be corrupt, and the common people must cope with misrule on many levels.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Yet, no matter how hopeless matters might seem, we can take comfort in knowing that Jehovah is ‘watching even high officials’ in human governments. We can appeal to God and throw our burdens on him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:55:22-19:55:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ps. 55:22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:6-50:4:7" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Phil. 4:6, 7</a>) We know that “the eyes of Jehovah are roving about through all the earth to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:16:9-14:16:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chron. 16:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Consequently, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:5:8-21:5:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 5:8</a> brings to mind the real situation of men in government; there is always someone with greater authority. More important, the verse can help us reflect on the fact that Jehovah is the highest, yes, the Supreme Authority. He is now ruling through his Son, Jesus Christ, King of the Kingdom. The Almighty, who is observing all, is completely just and fair, and so is his Son.</p>

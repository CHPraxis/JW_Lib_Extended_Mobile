How to Use the Sample Conversations




Since January 2018, sample conversations have appeared on the cover of Our Christian Life and Ministry​—Meeting Workbook. How can they be used?





When Giving Student Assignments: You should use the question, scripture, and link from the sample conversation. However, this does not mean that you must copy the wording used in the sample conversation video. You may use a different setting, introduction, line of reasoning, and so forth. You may also offer a publication from our Teaching Toolbox, even if it is not specified in the instructions for the part.





When in the Ministry: The sample conversations are designed to provide helpful ideas. If a person shows sincere interest and wants to know more, you may continue the conversation, perhaps using content from the sample return visit. You may modify the sample conversations or use something entirely different. Would a subject from a previous month or a different scripture have wider appeal in the local territory? Are people where you live more interested in a current event or a local news item? Regardless of how you choose to use the sample conversations, your goal should be to “do all things for the sake of the good news, in order to share it with others.”​—1Co 9:22, 23.

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
You Can Preach and Teach!




Moses initially doubted his ability to fulfill an assignment that Jehovah had given him. (Ex 4:10, 13) Have you ever felt that way? Are you studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses? Do you wonder whether you could ever preach from house to house? Or perhaps you are a young person who hesitates to witness at school. Or maybe you are afraid to participate in telephone witnessing or in some form of public witnessing. Beg Jehovah for the strength of his holy spirit. (1Pe 4:11) Be confident that he can equip you for any assignment he gives you.​—Ex 4:11, 12.

LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
What Can You Learn From Experienced Christians?




In our congregations we find those who have served Jehovah for many decades. We can learn from their firm reliance on Jehovah. We can ask them about the history of Jehovah’s organization and about the challenges they have faced and overcome with Jehovah’s help. We may even invite one of these dear ones to share experiences during a Family Worship evening.
If you are an experienced Christian, freely express your faith to younger Christians. Jacob and Joseph shared their experience with their offspring. (Ge 48:21, 22; 50:24, 25) Jehovah later expected family heads to teach their children about his mighty acts. (De 4:9, 10; Ps 78:4-7) In our day, parents and others in the congregation can pass on to the future generation the wonderful things that they have seen Jehovah accomplish through his organization.

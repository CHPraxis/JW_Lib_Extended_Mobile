TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | GENESIS 44-45
Joseph Forgives His Brothers




44:1, 2, 33, 34; 45:4, 5
It can be a challenge to forgive, especially when someone has harmed us deliberately. What helped Joseph to forgive his brothers when they wronged him?
  Joseph did not seek revenge but looked for a basis to forgive.​—Ps 86:5; Lu 17:3, 4

  He let go of resentment and reflected the disposition of Jehovah, who forgives generously.​—Mic 7:18, 19


How can I imitate Jehovah’s forgiveness?

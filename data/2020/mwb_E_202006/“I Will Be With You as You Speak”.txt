TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | EXODUS 4-5
“I Will Be With You as You Speak”




4:10-15
With Jehovah’s help, Moses overcame his fears. What can we learn from Jehovah’s interaction with Moses?
  We should avoid focusing on our own inadequacies

  We can be confident that Jehovah will give us whatever we need to fulfill our assignments

  Faith in God is the antidote to fear of man







How has Jehovah helped me to overcome hurdles in the ministry?

TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | EXODUS 23-24
Do Not Follow After the Crowd




23:1-3
Jehovah’s warning to witnesses and judges in legal cases not to be swayed by the crowd to give false testimony or render a perverted judgment also applies to other areas of life. Christians are under constant pressure to conform to this world’s ungodly thinking and conduct.​—Ro 12:2.
Why is it unwise to follow after the crowd when
  hearing unsubstantiated rumors or gossip?

  choosing clothing, hairstyles, or entertainment?

  thinking about and dealing with people of a different race, culture, or economic standing?

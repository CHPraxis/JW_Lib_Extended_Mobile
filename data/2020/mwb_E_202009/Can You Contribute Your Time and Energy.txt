LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Can You Contribute Your Time and Energy?









As foretold by Isaiah, we are seeing unprecedented growth in the earthly part of Jehovah’s organization. (Isa 54:2) This requires the construction of new Kingdom Halls, Assembly Halls, and branch facilities. After their construction, such buildings need maintenance, and some must eventually be renovated. What opportunities does this give us to contribute our time and energy to Jehovah?
  We can participate when our field service group is scheduled to clean the Kingdom Hall

  We can volunteer to receive training to maintain our Kingdom Hall

  We can fill out a Local Design/​Construction Volunteer Application (DC-50) to assist periodically with construction and maintenance projects close to home

  We can fill out an Application for Volunteer Program (A-19) and volunteer to assist for a week or more in our branch territory at Bethel or another branch facility

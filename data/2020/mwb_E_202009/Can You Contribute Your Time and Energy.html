<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">As foretold by Isaiah, we are seeing unprecedented growth in the earthly part of Jehovah’s organization. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:54:2-23:54:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa 54:2</a>) This requires the construction of new Kingdom Halls, Assembly Halls, and branch facilities. After their construction, such buildings need maintenance, and some must eventually be renovated. What opportunities does this give us to contribute our time and energy to Jehovah?</p>

TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | EXODUS 25-26
The Central Object of the Tabernacle




25:9, 21, 22
The Ark was the most important object of the tabernacle and of the camp of Israel. God’s presence was represented by a cloud between the two cherubs over the propitiatory cover of the Ark. On the annual Day of Atonement, the high priest entered the Most Holy and spattered the blood of a bull and a goat before the cover to atone for Israel’s sins. (Le 16:14, 15) This foreshadowed the entrance of Jesus, the greater High Priest, into the very presence of Jehovah in heaven to present the value of his ransom sacrifice.​—Heb 9:24-26.

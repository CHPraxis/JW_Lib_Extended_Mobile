TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | EXODUS 29-30
A Contribution to Jehovah




30:11-16
When the tabernacle was constructed, individuals had the privilege of contributing financially to support Jehovah’s worship, regardless of whether they were rich or poor. How can we make a contribution to Jehovah today? One way is by financially supporting Kingdom Halls, Assembly Halls, remote translation offices, and Bethel complexes, as well as other buildings that are dedicated to the worship of Jehovah.
What do we learn from the following scriptures about making financial contributions to support true worship?
  1Ch 29:5

  Mr 12:43, 44

  1Co 16:2

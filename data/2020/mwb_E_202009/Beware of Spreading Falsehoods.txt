LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Beware of Spreading Falsehoods









Today, information can be circulated to millions of people very quickly via print, radio, television, and the Internet. Those who worship “the God of truth” do not want to spread false information, even unwittingly. (Ps 31:5; Ex 23:1) Falsehoods that are passed on to others can cause great harm. When trying to determine whether something is true, ask yourself:
  ‘Is the source reliable?’ The one telling the story may not know the facts. Stories that pass from one person to another inevitably change, so be cautious when you cannot pinpoint the exact source. Because those who have privileges in the congregation are respected sources of information, they should be especially careful about passing on unverified information

  ‘Is the information slanderous?’ If it detracts from the good name of a person or group, it is best not to repeat it.​—Pr 18:8; Php 4:8

  ‘Is the story plausible?’ Be cautious when hearing sensational stories and experiences

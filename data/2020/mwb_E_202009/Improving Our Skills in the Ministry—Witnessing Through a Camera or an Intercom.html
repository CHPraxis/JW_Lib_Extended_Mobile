<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>WHY IMPORTANT: </strong>Advances in technology and the increase of crime have made home security cameras and intercoms more common. We may feel intimidated when trying to share the good news with someone that we cannot see but who can see us. The following reminders will help us to witness through a camera or an intercom with more confidence.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>HOW TO DO IT:</strong></p>
<ul><li><p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="su">  Be positive. Many householders who have a camera or an intercom are willing to converse with us</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">  Remember that some cameras begin recording before you ring the bell and that the householder may be watching and listening to you as soon as you enter the property</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">  When the householder answers, talk to the intercom or camera as if you were talking to him in person. Smile and gesture naturally. Say the same thing you had planned to say if he had come to the door. If there is a camera, do not put your face too close. If the householder does not answer, do not leave a message</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="su">  After the conversation concludes, remember that the householder may still be observing or listening to you</p>
</li>
</ul>

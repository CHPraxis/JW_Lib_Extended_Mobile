<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>DONATIONS </strong>At considerable cost, arrangements have been made to provide adequate seating, a sound system, video equipment, and many other services that make attending the convention enjoyable and assist us in drawing closer to Jehovah. Your voluntary contributions help to cover these expenses and also support the worldwide work. For your convenience, clearly marked contribution boxes are located throughout the facility. You may also donate online by visiting <a href="https://donate.jw.org/">donate.jw.org</a>. All donations are very much appreciated. The Governing Body wishes to thank you for your generous support of Kingdom interests.</p>

However, to avoid needless stress for all involved, please look after your children and keep them with you.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>SEATING </strong>Please be considerate of others. Remember, you may save seats only for your immediate family members and for those traveling with you in the same vehicle, living with you in the same home, or currently studying the Bible with you.

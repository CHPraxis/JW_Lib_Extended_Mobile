<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jesus told a parable about a man who had been attacked by robbers and left for dead. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:29-42:10:37" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 10:29-37</a>) A helpful stranger stopped and cared for the badly injured man. He did this despite being from a different ethnic background.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">This kind man not only gave the injured man first aid and material support but also comforted him and brought him relief from his distress.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">What do we learn from this parable? Jesus was showing that we should help those in need in whatever way we can. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:31-20:14:31" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:31</a>) The Holy Scriptures teach that God will soon put an end to poverty and suffering. We may wonder, though, how and when will God do that? The following article will discuss the blessings that your loving Creator has in store for you.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">God gave humans a unique gift​—the ability to communicate with him and to express their feelings to him by means of prayer. The prophet David prayed: “O Hearer of prayer, to you people of all sorts will come.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:65:2-19:65:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 65:2</a>) But how can we pray in order to be heard and blessed by God?</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Your personal prayers allow you to pour out your heart before God​—to convey your true feelings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:62:8-19:62:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 62:8</a>) The Almighty cherishes sincere prayers from the heart.</p>

<h2 id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>ADDRESS GOD BY HIS PERSONAL NAME</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Although God has many titles, he has only one personal name. “I am Jehovah. That is my name.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:8-23:42:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 42:8</a>) The name Jehovah appears some 7,000 times in the Holy Scriptures. Many prophets addressed God by his personal name. Abraham said: “Jehovah, please, . . . let me go on speaking [with you].” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:30-1:18:30" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 18:30</a>) We too should use God’s name, Jehovah, when we pray.</p>

<h2 id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>PRAY IN YOUR OWN LANGUAGE</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">God understands our thoughts and feelings no matter what language we speak. His Word assures us: “God is not partial, but in every nation the man who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:34-44:10:35" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 10:34, 35</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">However, to be blessed by God, we need to do more than pray. In the following articles, we will examine what we need to do.</p>

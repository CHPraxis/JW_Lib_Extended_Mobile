We can enjoy true happiness by observing God’s commandments





Blessings for Those Who Obey God




The prophet Moses said that if we obey God’s commandments, we will receive God’s blessing. (Deuteronomy 10:13; 11:27) We do not obey God because we fear his punishment. God’s beautiful qualities motivate us to obey him because we love him and want to avoid doing something that may sadden him. “This is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments.”​—1 John 5:3.
But how does obedience to God result in his blessing? Consider two ways.



1. OBEYING GOD WILL MAKE US WISE

“I, Jehovah, am your God, the One teaching you to benefit yourself, . . . guiding you in the way you should walk.”​—ISAIAH 48:17.

Jehovah God, our Creator, knows us and provides the guidance we need. If we want his teachings to help us make wise decisions, we must learn from the Holy Scriptures what God wants us to do and then put those teachings into practice.



2. OBEDIENCE WILL MAKE US HAPPY

“Happy are those hearing the word of God and keeping it!”​—LUKE 11:28.

Today, millions who heed the Word of God enjoy true happiness. For example, consider a man in Spain who had an explosive temper and treated others harshly​—including his wife. One day he read in the writings of the prophet Moses about the mild character of Joseph, the son of Jacob. Joseph was sold as a slave and unjustly imprisoned; yet, he remained mild, peaceable, and forgiving. (Genesis, chapters 37-45) The man in Spain admits: “Thinking about Joseph’s example motivated me to cultivate mildness, kindness, and self-control. As a result, I now enjoy a happy life.”
The Holy Scriptures provide more guidance on how we should treat others. Consider this in greater detail in the next article.

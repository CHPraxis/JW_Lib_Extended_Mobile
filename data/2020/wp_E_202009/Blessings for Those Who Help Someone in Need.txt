Blessings for Those Who Help Someone in Need




Many people around the world live in need of food and shelter. Some simply need a hope for the future. How will our efforts to help such ones lead to God’s approval and blessing?



WHAT THE HOLY SCRIPTURES SAY

“The one showing favor to the lowly is lending to Jehovah, and He will repay him for what he does.”​—PROVERBS 19:17.




WHAT IT MEANS TO HELP SOMEONE IN NEED

Jesus told a parable about a man who had been attacked by robbers and left for dead. (Luke 10:29-37) A helpful stranger stopped and cared for the badly injured man. He did this despite being from a different ethnic background.
This kind man not only gave the injured man first aid and material support but also comforted him and brought him relief from his distress.
What do we learn from this parable? Jesus was showing that we should help those in need in whatever way we can. (Proverbs 14:31) The Holy Scriptures teach that God will soon put an end to poverty and suffering. We may wonder, though, how and when will God do that? The following article will discuss the blessings that your loving Creator has in store for you.



“GOD HAS NEVER ABANDONED ME”!
Told by an immigrant from Gambia
“When I arrived in Europe, I had nothing​—no work, no money, and no home. The teachings from the Holy Scriptures have helped me to be resourceful, to work hard, and to help others instead of simply asking for help. God has never abandoned me, and I have experienced his blessing!”

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Many human fathers are anxious about getting enough food and clothing for their families. Note what the Scriptures say: “Observe intently the birds of heaven; they do not sow seed or reap or gather into storehouses, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they are?”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:25-40:6:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 6:25, 26</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“Take a lesson from the lilies of the field, how they grow . . . ; but I tell you that not even [King] Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these. Now if this is how God clothes the vegetation of the field . . . , will he not much rather clothe you?”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:28-40:6:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 6:28-30</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Since God can provide us with food and clothing, surely he can also help us find other necessities of life. If we seek to do God’s will, he can bless our efforts to grow food or he can help us find employment so that we can buy what we need.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:32-40:6:33" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 6:32, 33</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Truly, we have good reasons to love God when we consider the sun, rain, birds, and flowers. The following article will discuss how our Creator has communicated with mankind.</p>

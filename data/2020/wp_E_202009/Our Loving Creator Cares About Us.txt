Our Loving Creator Cares About Us



1. OUR CREATOR MAKES THE SUN RISE

Can you imagine life on earth without sunlight? The sun provides energy for trees to produce leaves, flowers, fruit, nuts, and seeds. It also makes trees draw water from the soil through the roots and up to the leaves and then into the air as water vapor.








2. OUR CREATOR MAKES IT RAIN

Rain is a precious gift from God that enables the earth to produce food for us to eat. God gives us rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying us with food and filling our hearts with gladness.








3. OUR CREATOR PROVIDES FOOD AND CLOTHING

Many human fathers are anxious about getting enough food and clothing for their families. Note what the Scriptures say: “Observe intently the birds of heaven; they do not sow seed or reap or gather into storehouses, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they are?”​—Matthew 6:25, 26.
“Take a lesson from the lilies of the field, how they grow . . . ; but I tell you that not even [King] Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as one of these. Now if this is how God clothes the vegetation of the field . . . , will he not much rather clothe you?”​—Matthew 6:28-30.
Since God can provide us with food and clothing, surely he can also help us find other necessities of life. If we seek to do God’s will, he can bless our efforts to grow food or he can help us find employment so that we can buy what we need.​—Matthew 6:32, 33.
Truly, we have good reasons to love God when we consider the sun, rain, birds, and flowers. The following article will discuss how our Creator has communicated with mankind.



Our Creator “makes his sun rise . . . and makes it rain.”​—MATTHEW 5:45
Our Creator deeply loves and cares for us. Like a loving father, he looks after his family. The Holy Scriptures describe God as a generous Provider who “knows what you need even before you ask him.”​—Matthew 6:8.

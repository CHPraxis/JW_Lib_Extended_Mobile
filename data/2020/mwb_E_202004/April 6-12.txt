April 6-12
Tuesday, April 7, 2020​—The Memorial of Christ’s Death




During the Memorial season each year, many Christians meditate on the two greatest expressions of love ever shown​—those of Jehovah God and of his Son, Jesus Christ. (Joh 3:16; 15:13) Using this chart, you can compare the Gospel accounts of Jesus’ final ministry in Jerusalem. These events are discussed in section 6 of the book Jesus​—The Way, the Truth, the Life. How will the love of God and of Christ motivate you?​—2Co 5:14, 15; 1Jo 4:16, 19.

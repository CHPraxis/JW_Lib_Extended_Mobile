TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | GENESIS 34-35
The Tragic Results of Bad Association




34:1, 2, 7, 25
Although we likely see some good qualities in our neighbors, workmates, or schoolmates, does that mean that they are good associates? What can help us determine if someone is good association or not?
  Will their companionship help me improve my relationship with Jehovah?

  What do their conversations reveal about what is important to them?​—Mt 12:34


ASK YOURSELF, ‘What effect are my associates having on my relationship with Jehovah?’

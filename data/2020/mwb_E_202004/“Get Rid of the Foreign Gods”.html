<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jacob knew that Jehovah deserves exclusive devotion, even though He had not yet provided a law against idolatry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:20:3-2:20:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex 20:3-5</a>) So after Jehovah told him to return to Bethel, Jacob instructed everyone with him to get rid of their idols. Jacob then disposed of the idols, including earrings, which were possibly worn as amulets. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:35:1-1:35:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ge 35:1-4</a>) No doubt Jehovah was pleased with Jacob’s actions.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In our day, how can we give Jehovah exclusive devotion? We start by avoiding anything connected to idolatry or spiritism. This would include getting rid of any objects related to the occult and examining our entertainment carefully. For instance, ask yourself: ‘Am I entertained by books or movies featuring such things as vampires, zombies, or the supernatural? Does any of my entertainment portray magic, spells, or curses as harmless fun?’ We should stay far away from anything that Jehovah hates.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:97:10-19:97:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps 97:10</a>.</p>

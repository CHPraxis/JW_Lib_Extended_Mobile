Jacob and Laban Make a Covenant of Peace




31:44-53
Why did Jacob and Laban make a pile of stones?
  It served as a witness to all passersby of the covenant of peace that they had made

  It reminded them that Jehovah was watching to see that they kept their covenant of peace







Today, Jehovah expects his people to enjoy peaceful relationships. How will these three actions help us to maintain peace or to restore it?
  Talking it out.​—Mt 5:23, 24

  Forgiving freely.​—Col 3:13

  Being patient.​—Ro 12:21

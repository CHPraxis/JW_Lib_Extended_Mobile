LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
What Is Most Important to Me?




Jacob wrestled with an angel for something very important​—Jehovah’s blessing. (Ge 32:24-31; Ho 12:3, 4) What about us? Are we willing to put forth earnest effort to obey Jehovah and obtain his blessing? For instance, if we must choose between attending a congregation meeting and working secularly for a few extra hours, what choice will we make? When we give Jehovah the best of our time, energy, and resources, he pours out on us “a blessing until there is nothing lacking.” (Mal 3:10) He will guide and protect us and care for our needs.​—Mt 6:33; Heb 13:5.

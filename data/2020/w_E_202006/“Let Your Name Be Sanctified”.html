<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb">VERY important issues are facing us today​—sovereignty and vindication. As Jehovah’s Witnesses, we love discussing those fascinating subjects. However, it is not as if we would have to contrast God’s sovereignty and the sanctification of his name​—as if they were separate matters.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>All of us have come to see that God’s name must be cleared of reproach. We have also learned that Jehovah’s sovereignty, or way of ruling, must be proved to be the best. Both issues merit our respect and attention.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>What does the name Jehovah include?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Actually, the name Jehovah involves everything about our God, <strong><em>including </em></strong>his way of ruling. So if we say that clearing Jehovah’s name of all reproach is the most important issue, we are also saying that Jehovah’s way of ruling must be proved to be the best way. Jehovah’s name is closely tied to the way he rules as the almighty Sovereign.​—See the box “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:2020443/59-60">Facets of a Great Issue</a>.”</p>

<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="sc">There is a very great issue facing everyone: The <strong><em>sanctification of the name Jehovah. </em></strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:36:23-26:36:23" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Ezek. 36:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Matt. 6:9</a>) Is the one who bears the name Jehovah truly beyond all reproach? In other words, is he really holy, good, righteous, and loving in all his ways? There are related facets. Because Satan led a rebellion against God’s rule, this question must be settled: Is Jehovah the <strong><em>rightful Sovereign, </em></strong>the one whose way of ruling is truly best? And because Adam, Eve, many of their descendants, and even some angels joined Satan in rebellion, another related issue must be settled: Who of Jehovah’s intelligent creatures will <strong><em>maintain integrity, </em></strong>that is, will loyally defend God’s holy name and serve Jehovah out of love for him? That last facet of the great issue came into sharp focus in the days of Job.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:2:3-18:2:4" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Job 2:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:27:5-18:27:5" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 27:5</a>.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>The name Jehovah is unique. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:135:13-19:135:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 135:13</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>What makes God’s name so important? How was it first slandered? How does God sanctify it? And how can we help to defend his name? Let us address those questions.</p>
</div>

<div id="section2" class="section">
<h2 id="p10" data-pid="10"><span id="page3" class="pageNum" data-no="3" data-before-text="3"></span><strong>THE IMPORTANCE OF A NAME</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>What might we wonder about when considering the sanctifying of God’s name?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>“Let your name be sanctified.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 6:9</a>) That is what Jesus stated as a priority in prayer. But what do Jesus’ words mean? To sanctify something means to make it holy, clean, or pure. Some might wonder, though, ‘Is not Jehovah’s name already holy, clean, and pure?’ To answer, we need to think about what a name involves.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>What makes a name valuable?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>A name is more than a collection of letters written on a page or spoken aloud. Notice what the Bible says: “A good name is to be chosen rather than great wealth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:1-20:22:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Prov. 22:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:1-21:7:1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Eccl. 7:1</a>) Why does a name have such value? Because it involves a reputation, what others think of the one bearing that name. So the way a name appears on a page​—or even the way it is pronounced—​is not what matters most; what truly matters is whom and what that name stands for in the minds and hearts of others.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>How have people attacked God’s name?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>When people tell lies about Jehovah, they are attacking his reputation. When they attack his reputation, they are trying to damage his name. The first attack on God’s name and reputation happened near the dawn of human history. Consider what we learn from this attack.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section3" class="section">
<h2 id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>HOW THE NAME WAS FIRST SLANDERED</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>What did Adam and Eve know, and what questions arise?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Adam and Eve knew Jehovah’s name, as well as vital truths about the One bearing that name. They knew him as the Creator, the One who gave them life, their lovely Paradise home, and a perfect mate. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:26-1:1:28" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gen. 1:26-28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:18-1:2:18" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 2:18</a>) However, would they continue to use their perfect minds to meditate on all that Jehovah had done for them? Would they keep building up their love and appreciation for the Person represented by that name? The answers became clear when God’s enemy tested them.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:16-1:2:17" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Genesis 2:16, 17 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:5" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 3:1-5</a>, what did Jehovah tell the first couple, and how did Satan twist the truth?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span><strong><sup>9 </sup>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:16-1:2:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 2:16, 17 and</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:5" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> <strong>3:1-5</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Using a serpent as his mouthpiece, Satan asked Eve a question: “Did God really say that you must not eat from every tree of the garden?” That question contained a subtle lie that was like hidden poison. What God had actually said was that they could eat from every tree, with one exception. The variety available to Adam and Eve must have been tremendous. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:2:9-1:2:9" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gen. 2:9</a>) Yes, Jehovah certainly is generous. However, God had forbidden Adam and Eve to eat the fruit of one tree that He had designated. So Satan’s question twisted the truth. Satan made it seem as if God were not generous. Eve may have wondered, ‘Is God withholding something good?’</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>How did Satan directly slander God’s name, and with what effect?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>At that point, Eve still saw Jehovah as her Ruler. She answered Satan by reciting God’s clear direction. She added that they should not even touch the tree. She knew of God’s warning that disobedience would lead to death. But Satan replied: “You certainly will not die.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:2-1:3:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 3:2-4</a>) Satan was no longer subtle. He was now directly slandering God’s name, in effect telling Eve that Jehovah is a liar. Satan thus became a devil, or slanderer. Eve was thoroughly deceived; she believed Satan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:14-54:2:14" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:14</a>) She put more trust in him than in Jehovah. That made it easier for Eve to make the worst possible decision. She decided to disobey Jehovah. She began eating of the fruit that Jehovah had forbidden her to eat. Afterward, she gave some to Adam.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:6-1:3:6" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Gen. 3:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>What could our first parents have done, but what did they fail to do?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Think for a moment about what Eve should have said to Satan. Imagine that she had said something like this: “I do not know who you are, but I know my Father, Jehovah, and I love and trust him. He has given Adam and me everything we have. How dare you say anything bad about him? Go away!” How delighted Jehovah would have been to hear such loyal words from a loving daughter! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Prov. 27:11</a>) But Eve did not have loyal love for Jehovah; neither was Adam guided by that quality. Lacking such love for their Father, Adam and Eve failed to defend his name against slander.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>How did Satan sow doubts in the mind of Eve, and what did Adam and Eve fail to do?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>As we have noted, Satan started by sowing doubts in the mind of Eve. He got her to question the kind of Person who <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>was represented by the name Jehovah. Then Adam and Eve failed to defend Jehovah’s name and reputation. They left themselves open to Satan’s suggestion to rebel against their Father. Satan uses similar tactics today. He attacks Jehovah’s name by slandering it. People who believe Satan’s lies are easily influenced to reject Jehovah’s righteous rule.</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"><strong>13. </strong>How does <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:36:23-26:36:23" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Ezekiel 36:23</a> highlight the core message of the Bible?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Does Jehovah accept such slander without defending himself? No, he does not! The entire Bible record focuses on how Jehovah has acted to clear his name of the reproach heaped on it in Eden. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Gen. 3:15</a>) In fact, we may summarize the core message of the Bible this way: Jehovah sanctifies his name by means of the Kingdom ruled by his Son and restores righteousness and peace to the earth. The Bible contains information that helps us to understand how Jehovah accomplishes the sanctifying of his name.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:36:23-26:36:23" data-bid="13-1" class="b"><strong>Ezekiel 36:23</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu"><strong>14. </strong>How has Jehovah’s response to the rebellion in Eden sanctified his name?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>Satan has done all he can to stop Jehovah from achieving His purpose. But Satan has failed again and again. The Bible record shows how Jehovah has acted, and it proves that there is no one like Jehovah God. True, the rebellion of Satan and all who take his side has caused Jehovah great pain. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:78:40-19:78:40" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 78:40</a>) He has, though, handled this challenge with wisdom, patience, and justice. He has also shown his almighty power in countless ways. Above all, his love shines through in all that he does. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:8-62:4:8" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 John 4:8</a>) Jehovah has worked unceasingly to sanctify his name.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>Satan is still slandering God’s name today. He fools people into doubting that God is powerful, just, wise, and loving. For example, Satan tries to convince <span id="page6" class="pageNum" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>people that Jehovah is not the Creator. And if people do accept that God exists, Satan attempts to make them believe that God and His standards are restrictive and unfair. He even teaches people that Jehovah is a heartless and cruel God who burns people in a fiery hell. When they believe such slander, they are more likely to take the next step​—rejecting Jehovah’s righteous rule. Until Satan is completely defeated, he will continue his campaign of slander, and he will target you as well. Will he succeed?</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:29:23-23:29:23" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isa. 29:23</a>) You can support his rule.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:26-43:17:26" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John 17:26</a>) Jesus made his Father’s name known not only by using that name but also by defending Jehovah’s reputation. For example, he contradicted the Pharisees, who in various ways painted Jehovah as harsh, demanding, distant, and merciless. Jesus helped people to see his Father as being reasonable, patient, loving, and forgiving. He also helped people to see Jehovah by the way he perfectly imitated his Father’s qualities in his daily life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:9-43:14:9" data-bid="19-1" class="b">John 14:9</a>.</p>

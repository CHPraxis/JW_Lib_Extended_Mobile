<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb">THERE was a time when Jehovah was alone. But he was not lonely. He was complete in every way. Nevertheless, God wanted others to enjoy life. Motivated by love, Jehovah began creating.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:36:9-19:36:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 36:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:19-62:4:19" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 John 4:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>2. </strong>How did Jesus and the angels feel about Jehovah’s creative works?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>First, Jehovah created a fellow worker. Then, by means of this first Son, “all other things were created,” including millions of intelligent spirit creatures. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:16-51:1:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Col. 1:16</a>) Jesus rejoiced at the opportunity to work with his Father. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:30-20:8:30" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Prov. 8:30</a>) And the angelic sons of God also had reason to rejoice. They had front-row seats, as it were, when Jehovah and his Master Worker, Jesus, made the heavens and the earth. How did the angels respond? They “began shouting in applause” when the earth was formed, and they no doubt continued to applaud each of Jehovah’s creative works, including his final masterpiece, humans. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:7-18:38:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Job 38:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:8:31-20:8:31" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Prov. 8:31</a>, ftn.) Each of these creations revealed Jehovah’s love and wisdom.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:104:24-19:104:24" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 104:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:20-45:1:20" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Rom. 1:20</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>As indicated at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:21-46:15:22" data-bid="41-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:21, 22</a>, what does Jesus’ ransom sacrifice make possible?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Jehovah intended for the human family to enjoy everlasting life on the beautiful planet that he had created. But when Adam and Eve rebelled against their loving Father, <span id="page15" class="pageNum" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>sin and death cast a shadow over the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12</a>) How did Jehovah respond? Immediately, he stated how he would rescue mankind. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Gen. 3:15</a>) Jehovah purposed to provide a ransom that would make it possible for Adam and Eve’s children to be freed from sin and death. He could then allow each person to choose to serve Him and to receive everlasting life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 3:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:23-45:6:23" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Rom. 6:23</a>; <strong>read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:21-46:15:22" data-bid="10-1" class="b"><strong>1 Corinthians 15:21, 22</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>God’s promise to resurrect the dead raises a number of questions. For example, how will the resurrection likely take place? Will we be able to recognize our loved ones when they are brought back to life? In what ways will the resurrection bring us joy? And how can meditating on the resurrection build our appreciation for Jehovah’s love, wisdom, and patience? Let us consider each of those questions.</p>

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>Why is it reasonable to believe that people will be resurrected in an orderly, gradual manner?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>When Jehovah through his Son resurrects countless millions, we may assume that not all of them will come back to life at the same time. Why not? Because an explosion in the earth’s population would likely cause chaos. And Jehovah never does anything in a disorganized, chaotic way. He knows that for peace to last, order must be maintained. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:33-46:14:33" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Cor. 14:33</a>) Jehovah God was wise and patient when he worked with Jesus to prepare the earth in a gradual manner before creating mankind. In turn, Jesus will <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>display those same qualities during the Thousand Year Reign when he works with Armageddon survivors as they prepare the earth to receive resurrected ones.</p>

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:15-44:24:15" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Acts 24:15</a>, who will be among those resurrected by Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Most important of all, those who survive Armageddon will need to teach resurrected ones about God’s Kingdom and about Jehovah’s requirements. Why? Because the majority of those who return to life will be among “the unrighteous.” <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:15-44:24:15" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>Acts 24:15</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>They will have to make many changes in order to benefit from Christ’s ransom. Just think of the work involved in teaching the truth about God to millions of people who have no knowledge of Jehovah. Will each person receive individual instruction, similar to the way we conduct Bible studies today? Will these new ones be assigned to congregations and be trained to teach those who are resurrected after them? We will have to wait and see. We do know, however, that by the end of Christ’s Thousand Year Reign, “the earth will certainly be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:9-23:11:9" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isa. 11:9</a>) What a busy but enjoyable thousand years that will be!</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>Why will God’s people have fellow feeling when teaching resurrected ones?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>During the Thousand Year Rule of Christ, all of Jehovah’s earthly children will have to make changes to please him. So all of them will have true fellow feeling as they help the resurrected ones to combat sinful tendencies and to live by Jehovah’s standards. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:8-60:3:8" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:8</a>) No doubt those who come back to life will be drawn to Jehovah’s humble people, who will also be “working out [their] own salvation.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:12-50:2:12" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Phil. 2:12</a>.</p>

<h2 id="p14" data-pid="14"><strong>WILL WE BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THOSE WHO ARE RESURRECTED?</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>Why is it reasonable to assume that those greeting resurrected individuals will be able to recognize their loved ones?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>For a number of reasons, we can assume that those greeting resurrected individuals will be able to recognize their loved ones. For instance, based on resurrections that have already occurred, it seems that Jehovah will re-create people so that they look, speak, and think in the same way as they did shortly before they died. Remember that Jesus likened death to sleep and the resurrection to being awakened from sleep. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:18-40:9:18" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 9:18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:24-40:9:24" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:11-43:11:13" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> John 11:11-13</a>) When people awaken from sleep, they look and sound the same as when they went to sleep, and they retain their memory. Consider the example of Lazarus. He had been dead for four days, so his body had begun to decay. Yet, when Jesus resurrected him, his sisters immediately recognized him, and Lazarus obviously remembered them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:38-43:11:44" data-bid="17-1" class="b">John 11:38-44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:12:1-43:12:2" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 12:1, 2</a>.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>Why will resurrected ones not come back with a perfect mind and body?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Jehovah promises that no one living under Christ’s rule will say: “I am sick.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:33:24-23:33:24" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Isa. 33:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:7-45:6:7" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Rom. 6:7</a>) Thus, those who are raised from the dead will be re-created with healthy bodies. However, they will not immediately be perfect. If they were, they might seem unfamiliar to their loved ones. It seems that all mankind will gradually grow to perfection during the Thousand Year Reign of Christ. It is only at the end of the <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>thousand years that Jesus will hand the Kingdom back to his Father. Then the Kingdom will have accomplished its work completely, including the raising of mankind to a perfect state.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:24-46:15:28" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:24-28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:1-66:20:3" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Rev. 20:1-3</a>.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>As we discussed earlier, when Jehovah resurrects people, he will restore their memories and the personality traits that made them who they were. Just think of what that implies. Jehovah loves you so much that he is keeping track of all that you think, feel, say, and do. So if he had to resurrect you, he would easily be able to restore your memories, attitude, and personality traits. King David was aware of just how interested Jehovah is in each one of us. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:139:1-19:139:4" data-bid="25-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 139:1-4</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>In what way can understanding how well Jehovah knows us affect us now?</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:28" data-bid="34-1" class="b">John 5:28</a>) We have good reasons to appreciate Jehovah’s patience.

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[56]" class="sb"><strong><sup>18 </sup></strong>Jehovah will patiently wait until the end of the thousand years before he expects us to be perfect. Until that time, Jehovah is willing to overlook our sins. Surely, then, we have reason to look for the good in others and to be patient with them. Consider the example of one sister whose husband began suffering from severe anxiety attacks and stopped attending meetings. “This was very painful for me,” she says. “Our plans for our future as a family were turned upside down.” Yet through it all, this loving wife was patient with her husband. She relied on Jehovah and never gave up. Like Jehovah, she looked past the problem and focused on the good things about her husband.

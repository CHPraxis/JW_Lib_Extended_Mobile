LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
The Value of “Two Small Coins”




The value of the widow’s contribution was hardly enough to buy a simple meal. (See “all the means of living she had” study note on Luke 21:4, nwtsty.) However, her donation demonstrated her deep love and appreciation for Jehovah’s arrangements. For this reason, it had great value in the eyes of her heavenly Father.​—Mr 12:43.

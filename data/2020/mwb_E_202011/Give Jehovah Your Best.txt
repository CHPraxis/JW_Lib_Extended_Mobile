TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | LEVITICUS 4-5
Give Jehovah Your Best




5:5-7, 11
Poverty denied no one in Israel the privilege of making peace with Jehovah. Even the poorest Israelites could give Jehovah an acceptable offering, as long as it was their best. They could offer flour, but Jehovah still expected it to be “fine,” the kind used for honored guests. (Ge 18:6) Today, Jehovah accepts our best “sacrifice of praise,” regardless of how much our personal circumstances may limit what we can give.​—Heb 13:15.
How can this encourage you if you cannot do all that you did before, perhaps because of declining health or stamina?

TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | LEVITICUS 6-7
An Expression of Thanksgiving




7:11-15, 20
Communion sacrifices in Israel remind us of the importance of expressing our appreciation to Jehovah in our prayers and by our conduct.​—Php 4:6, 7; Col 3:15.
  When we pray, what specific things can we thank Jehovah for?​—1Th 5:17, 18

  How does showing thankfulness benefit us?

  How might someone partake of “the table of demons,” and how would this show a lack of appreciation to Jehovah?​—1Co 10:20, 21

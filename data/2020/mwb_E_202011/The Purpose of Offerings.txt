TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | LEVITICUS 1-3
The Purpose of Offerings




1:3; 2:1, 12; 3:1
The offerings, or sacrifices, commanded under the Law covenant pleased Jehovah and pointed to Jesus and the ransom sacrifice or to the benefits from that sacrifice.​—Heb 8:3-5; 9:9; 10:5-10.
  Just as all animals to be sacrificed were to be sound and unblemished, Jesus sacrificed his perfect, unblemished body.​—1Pe 1:18, 19

  Just as burnt offerings were presented in their entirety to God, Jesus gave himself wholly to Jehovah

  Just as those who offered an acceptable communion sacrifice were at peace with God, the anointed who share in the Lord’s Evening Meal are at peace with God

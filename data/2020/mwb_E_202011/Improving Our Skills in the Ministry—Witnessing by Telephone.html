</div>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="su">  <strong>Prepare. </strong>Choose an appropriate topic. Then make an outline of what you wish to say. You might also prepare a short message that explains the purpose of your call in case you get an answering machine. It is helpful to sit at a table with the outline and other materials you will need, such as an electronic device open to <em>JW Library</em><sup>® </sup>or jw.org<sup>®</sup></p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="su">  <strong>Relax. </strong>Talk naturally. Smile and gesture as if the person could see you. Avoid unnecessary pauses. It is helpful to work along with others. If the householder asks a question, repeat it out loud so that your partner can help you find the answer</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">  <strong>Lay the groundwork for a return visit. </strong>If the person shows interest, you could leave a question to answer on the next phone call. You might also offer to e-mail, personally deliver, or send a specific piece of literature. Or you can offer to text or e-mail one of our videos or articles. When appropriate, tell the person about our <a href="https://www.jw.org/finder?docID=1011538&amp;prefer=content&amp;wtlocale=E">Online Bible Study Lessons</a> or another item on our website</p>

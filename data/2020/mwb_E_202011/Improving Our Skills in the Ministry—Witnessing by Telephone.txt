LIVING AS CHRISTIANS
Improving Our Skills in the Ministry​—Witnessing by Telephone




WHY IMPORTANT: Telephone witnessing is an important way to “bear thorough witness to the good news.” (Ac 20:24)a It enables us to witness to someone when circumstances do not allow us to visit him in person.
HOW TO DO IT:





  Prepare. Choose an appropriate topic. Then make an outline of what you wish to say. You might also prepare a short message that explains the purpose of your call in case you get an answering machine. It is helpful to sit at a table with the outline and other materials you will need, such as an electronic device open to JW Library® or jw.org®






  Relax. Talk naturally. Smile and gesture as if the person could see you. Avoid unnecessary pauses. It is helpful to work along with others. If the householder asks a question, repeat it out loud so that your partner can help you find the answer






  Lay the groundwork for a return visit. If the person shows interest, you could leave a question to answer on the next phone call. You might also offer to e-mail, personally deliver, or send a specific piece of literature. Or you can offer to text or e-mail one of our videos or articles. When appropriate, tell the person about our Online Bible Study Lessons or another item on our website





If telephone witnessing is acceptable in your area, it must be compliant with relevant laws on personal data.

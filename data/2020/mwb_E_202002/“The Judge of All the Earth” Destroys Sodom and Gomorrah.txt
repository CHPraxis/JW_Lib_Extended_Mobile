TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | GENESIS 18-19
“The Judge of All the Earth” Destroys Sodom and Gomorrah




18:23-25, 32; 19:24, 25
What do we learn from Jehovah’s actions regarding Sodom and Gomorrah?
  Jehovah will not indefinitely tolerate wickedness

  Those who survive the coming judgment will be those who pay attention to God’s will and do it.​—Lu 17:28-30







ASK YOURSELF: ‘Does the brazen conduct of this wicked world distress me?’ (2Pe 2:7) ‘Does my daily life show that doing Jehovah’s will is most important to me?’

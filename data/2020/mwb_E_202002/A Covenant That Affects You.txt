TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | GENESIS 12-14
A Covenant That Affects You




12:1-3; 13:14-17
  Jehovah made a covenant with Abraham, which formed the legal foundation of the Kingdom of the heavens

  The covenant apparently went into effect in 1943 B.C.E. when Abraham crossed the Euphrates River on his way to Canaan

  The covenant remains in effect until the Messianic Kingdom destroys God’s enemies and brings blessings to all the families of the earth


Jehovah blessed Abraham for his great faith. If we demonstrate faith in Jehovah’s promises, what blessings await us as a result of the Abrahamic covenant?

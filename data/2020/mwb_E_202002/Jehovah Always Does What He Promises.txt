TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | GENESIS 20-21
Jehovah Always Does What He Promises




21:1-3, 5-7, 10-12, 14
Jehovah rewarded Abraham and Sarah for their faith by giving them a son. Later, their obedience under trial showed their remarkable faith in Jehovah’s promises for the future.
How does my obedience during trials show that I trust in Jehovah’s promises for the future? How can I strengthen my faith?

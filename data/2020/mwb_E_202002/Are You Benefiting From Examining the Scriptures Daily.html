<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Does your spiritual routine include reading the Bible text and comments for the day from <em>Examining the Scriptures Daily? </em>If not, can you make it part of your routine? Many consider the text early in the day so that they can reflect on those thoughts as they go about their daily activities. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:1:8-6:1:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jos 1:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:97-19:119:97" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ps 119:97</a>) How might you benefit even more from the Scripture text? Read the context of the Bible verse to determine the background. Try to think of a Bible account that illustrates the principle highlighted in the text. Then apply the principle to your own life. When God’s Word affects your decisions, it will direct your life and truly benefit you.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:105-19:119:105" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps 119:105</a>.</p>

Perhaps some of the material is exactly what you need. For instance, how might the account of Lot influence your decisions?</p>

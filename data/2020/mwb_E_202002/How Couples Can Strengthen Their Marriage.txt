How Couples Can Strengthen Their Marriage




Abraham and Sarah are a good example of marriage mates who loved and respected each other. (Ge 12:11-13; 1Pe 3:6) Nevertheless, their marriage was not perfect, and they had to endure trials in life. What can married couples learn by considering the example of Abraham and Sarah?
Communicate with each other. Respond humbly to words spoken in frustration or irritation by your mate. (Ge 16:5, 6) Arrange to spend time together. By words and actions, assure your mate of your love. Above all things, keep Jehovah in your marriage by studying, praying, and worshipping together. (Ec 4:12) Strong marriages honor Jehovah, the Originator of this sacred arrangement.

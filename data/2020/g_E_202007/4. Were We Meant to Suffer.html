<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Does it make sense that the God who created such beauty in the world would consign us to a life of suffering?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Secular-minded people view suffering as a reason to question God’s motives​—or even his existence. They believe that suffering shows that either (1) God is powerless to stop it, (2) God does not care to stop it, or (3) God does not exist.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><strong>God gave the first two humans a perfect start.</strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">He did not mean for them​—or their descendants—​to suffer.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">We were no more created to rule ourselves than to live under water.</p>

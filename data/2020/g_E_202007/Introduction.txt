Introduction

At some point, everyone is affected by tragedy​—perhaps an illness, an accident, a natural disaster, or an act of violence.




People search for answers.
  Some attribute suffering to fate or in some other way feel that we have little control over what happens to us.

  Others believe in karma. They say that we suffer because of something bad that we did earlier in life or in a past life.


Tragedy often leaves people with more questions than answers.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Many people would like to eliminate suffering, but they are limited in their ability to do much about it. Note the following:</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Despite advances in medicine . . .</strong></p>
<ul><li><p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="su">  Heart disease remains the largest cause of death.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="su">  Cancer kills millions each year.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="su">  “The world continues to be confronted by longstanding, emerging, and reemerging infectious disease threats,” writes Dr. David Bloom in the journal <em>Frontiers in Immunology.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><strong>Despite material prosperity in some lands . . .</strong></p>
<ul><li><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="su">  Each year, millions of children die, and those living in impoverished areas are the most likely to be affected.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="su">  Billions of people live without access to adequate sanitation.</p>
</li>
<li><p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="su">  Hundreds of millions have no access to safe water.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><strong>Despite increased awareness of human rights . . .</strong></p>
<ul><li><p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="su">  Human trafficking continues in many lands, and countries that have not prosecuted any offenders are “blind to the problem, or they are ill-equipped to deal with it,” says a United Nations report.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><strong>God cares about us.</strong></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">He is not indifferent to our pain and sorrow.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="si">“[God] has not despised nor loathed the suffering of the oppressed one; he has not hidden his face from him. When he cried to him for help, he heard.”​<strong>—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:22:24-19:22:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>PSALM 22:24</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><strong>Suffering will not continue indefinitely.</strong></p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">The Bible promises that God’s purpose for us will be realized.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb"><strong>God will address the causes of human suffering.</strong></p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">He will do this by means of his Kingdom, which the Bible describes as a real government.</p>
<blockquote><p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="si">“The God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed. And this kingdom will not be passed on to any other people. . . . It alone will stand forever.”​<strong>—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>DANIEL 2:44</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<div class="boxContent"><p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sc">The Bible says: “Whatever a person is sowing, this he will also reap.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:7-48:6:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Galatians 6:7</a>) Some suffering is brought on by our own choices. That is why doctors encourage people to eat nutritious food, get exercise, and avoid harmful practices such as smoking. Still, it would be simplistic to say that <em>all </em>suffering is man-made. Many people are innocent victims of accidents, disasters, and other tragedies.</p>

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>1. </strong>How might discouragement affect us?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb">EACH day we face problems and deal with them as best we can. But would you not agree that we handle our problems much better when we are not discouraged? So we need to view discouragement as an unwelcome visitor that can rob us of confidence, courage, and joy. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:24:10-20:24:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 24:10</a> and footnote says: “If you become discouraged in times of trouble, your strength will be meager.” Yes, discouragement can drain us of the energy we need to cope with life’s problems successfully.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>2. </strong>What can cause us to feel discouraged, and what will we consider in this article?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>We can become discouraged by many things​—some internal, some external. The causes may include imperfections, weaknesses, and ill health. They may also include our not receiving a desired assignment in Jehovah’s service or our having to witness in a territory that seems unresponsive. In this article, we will consider some things we can do to deal with discouragement.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>It would be easy for us to develop an unbalanced view of our imperfections and weaknesses. As a result, we might believe that because of our failings, Jehovah would never welcome us into his new world. Such an attitude can be harmful. How should we look at our imperfections? The Bible reveals that, with the exception of Jesus Christ, all humans “have sinned.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:23-45:3:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rom. 3:23</a>) But the Bible’s Author is not a faultfinder or perfectionist. <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>Rather, he is a loving Father who wants to help us. He is also patient. He sees how we struggle to fight our weaknesses and overcome an unbalanced view of ourselves, and he is ready to help us.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:18-45:7:19" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 7:18, 19</a>.</p>

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>4-5. </strong>In line with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:19-62:3:20" data-bid="30-1" class="b">1 John 3:19, 20</a>, why did two sisters not give in to discouragement?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Consider the examples of Deborah and Maria.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> As a child, Deborah was often treated in ways that made her feel humiliated. She was rarely commended. She thus developed a negative view of herself. When she made small mistakes, she felt that she was a complete failure. Maria had a similar problem. Her relatives humiliated her. As a result, she struggled with feelings of worthlessness. After coming into the truth, she even felt unworthy to bear God’s name!</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Yet, these two sisters did not stop serving Jehovah. Why? For one thing, they threw their burden on Jehovah by means of fervent prayer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:55:22-19:55:22" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 55:22</a>) They came to accept that our loving heavenly Father knows how our past experiences and our negative thinking have affected us. But he also sees the good in our heart​—qualities that we may not see in ourselves.​—<strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:19-62:3:20" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>1 John 3:19, 20</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>How might someone react if he experiences a setback?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Someone who is struggling to overcome a deep-seated bad habit might have a setback and feel disappointed in himself. Of course, it is normal to feel a measure of guilt when we sin. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:7:10-47:7:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Cor. 7:10</a>) However, we should not go to extremes and condemn ourselves, thinking: ‘I’m a complete failure. How can Jehovah ever forgive me?’ Such negative thinking is not based on the truth and could cause us to stop serving Jehovah. Remember what we read at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:24:10-20:24:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 24:10</a>​—our strength will be meager when we are discouraged. Instead, “set matters straight” with Jehovah by going to him in prayer and seeking his mercy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:18-23:1:18" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isa. 1:18</a>) Considering your sincere repentance, he will forgive you. In addition, approach the elders. They will patiently help you to become spiritually well again.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:14-59:5:15" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Jas. 5:14, 15</a>.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>Why should we not feel discouraged if we are struggling to do what is right?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Jean-Luc, an elder in France, says to those struggling with a weakness: <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>“A righteous person in Jehovah’s eyes is, not someone who never errs, but someone who is sorry for his mistakes and always repents.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:21-45:7:25" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rom. 7:21-25</a>) So do not condemn yourself if you are struggling with a weakness. Remember that none of us can earn a righteous standing before God. We all need God’s undeserved kindness by means of the ransom.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:7-49:1:7" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Eph. 1:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:10-62:4:10" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 1 John 4:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>When we feel down, to whom can we turn for help?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup><em>We can turn to our brothers and sisters​—our spiritual family—​for encouragement! </em></strong>They may provide a listening ear when we need to talk and offer reassuring words that can cheer us up. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:12:25-20:12:25" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Prov. 12:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:14-52:5:14" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 1 Thess. 5:14</a>) Joy, a sister in Nigeria who has battled with discouragement, says: “Where would I be without the brotherhood? My brothers and sisters are proof that Jehovah answers my prayers. I have even learned from them how to encourage others who are downhearted.” We need to keep in mind, though, that our brothers and sisters may not always know when we need encouragement. So we may need to take the initiative to approach a mature fellow believer and open up about our need for help.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>Cindy, who lives in Mexico, was diagnosed with a life-threatening disease. How did she cope? When she was receiving treatment, she made it her goal to give a witness every day. She writes: “Doing so, I was able to focus on others instead of on the surgery, the pain, or how awful I felt. My approach was this: During a conversation with doctors or nurses, I would ask about their families. Then I would ask why they chose such a demanding occupation. After that, it was easy to see which topics might touch their heart. Several mentioned that it was rare for a patient to ask them, ‘How are you doing?’ And many thanked me <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>for caring. Some even gave me their contact information. So during this difficult time in my life, Jehovah gave me a deep inner joy that surprised even me!”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:15-20:15:15" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Prov. 15:15</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Sick or infirm ones may feel discouraged because they are limited in what they can do in the ministry. Still, many have been able to give a fine witness. In the United States, a sister named Laurel was confined to an iron lung for 37 years! She endured cancer, major surgeries, and chronic skin disorders. But even these extraordinary challenges did not silence her. She witnessed to nurses and attendants who came to her home. The result? She helped at least 17 people come to an accurate knowledge of the Bible!<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Richard, an elder in France, has a practical suggestion for those who are confined to their home or to a nursing facility. “I recommend that they have a small literature display. The display arouses curiosity and leads to conversations. This can encourage our dear brothers and sisters who can no longer go from house to house.” Those who are housebound can also share in the ministry by means of letter writing and telephone witnessing.</p>

During King Ahab’s reign, Jehovah invited the angels to suggest ways to fool the wicked king. A number of angels responded by offering ideas.

And he will help you to have a positive view of your ministry. Moreover, pour out your concerns to your heavenly Father. With his help, you can win the fight against discouragement.</p>

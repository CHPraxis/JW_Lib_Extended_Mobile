<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb">IMAGINE that a person decides to build a house. He knows what kind of house he wants to build. Should he immediately go out and buy some supplies and start building? No. Before he begins, there is something important that he ought to do​—calculate how much the house will cost. Why? Because he needs to know whether he has enough money to finish the house. If he carefully calculates the cost in advance, he is more likely to be successful in completing his new house.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>2. </strong>According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:14:27-42:14:30" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Luke 14:27-30</a>, what should you think carefully about before getting baptized?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Has your love and appreciation for Jehovah moved you to think about getting baptized? If so, you are facing a decision similar to that of the man who wants to build a house. Why can we say that? Consider Jesus’ words found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:14:27-42:14:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Luke 14:27-30</strong></a><strong>. (Read.) </strong>Jesus was discussing what it means to be his disciple. To be his follower, we must be willing to accept “the expense” involved​—the challenges and the sacrifices. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:9:23-42:9:26" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 9:23-26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:12:51-42:12:53" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 12:51-53</a>) So before you get baptized, you need to think carefully about all that is involved. Then you will be better prepared to keep serving God faithfully as a baptized Christian.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>What will we discuss in this article?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Is becoming a baptized disciple of Christ worth the expense? Of course it is! Baptism opens the door to countless blessings​—now and in the future. Let us discuss some important questions about baptism. Doing so will help you to answer the question, “Am I ready to get baptized?”</p>

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>(a) What is dedication? (b) What does it mean to “disown” oneself, as mentioned at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:24-40:16:24" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Matthew 16:24</a>?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup><em>What is dedication? </em></strong>Before you can get baptized, you must make a dedication. When you make a dedication, you approach Jehovah in earnest prayer and tell him that you will use your life to serve him forever. When you dedicate yourself to God, you “disown” yourself. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:24-40:16:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 16:24</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>You now belong to Jehovah, which is a great privilege. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:8-45:14:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rom. 14:8</a>) You are telling him that from now on, you will be focused on serving him and not on pleasing yourself. Your dedication is a vow​—a solemn promise made to God. Jehovah does not force us to make such a vow. But when we do, he expects us to fulfill it.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:116:12-19:116:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 116:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:116:14-19:116:14" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>How is dedication related to baptism?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup><em>How is dedication related to baptism? </em></strong>Your dedication is personal and private; it is between you and Jehovah. Baptism is public; it takes place in front of others, usually at an assembly or a convention. When you get baptized, you show others that you have already dedicated yourself to Jehovah.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> So your baptism lets others know that you love Jehovah your God with your whole heart, soul, mind, and strength and that you are determined to serve him forever.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:30-41:12:30" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mark 12:30</a>.</p>

</aside></div>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"><strong>6-7. </strong>According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:18-60:3:22" data-bid="39-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:18-22</a>, what are two reasons why baptism is necessary?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup><em>Is it really necessary to get baptized? </em></strong>Consider the words found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:18-60:3:22" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>1 Peter 3:18-22</strong></a><strong>. (Read.) </strong>Just as the ark was visible proof of Noah’s faith, your baptism is discernible evidence of your dedication to Jehovah. But is baptism really necessary? Yes it is. Peter commented on the reason why. First, it is “saving you.” Baptism can save us if we have taken the necessary steps to show that we have faith in Jesus and believe that he died for us, was raised to heaven, and is now “at God’s right hand.”</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>Second, baptism leads to “a good conscience.” When we dedicate ourselves to God and get baptized, we enter into a special relationship with him. Because of our sincere repentance and our faith in the ransom, God forgives our sins. We can thus have a good conscience before him.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>What should be the basis for your decision to get baptized?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup><em>What should be the basis for your decision to get baptized? </em></strong>As a result of your careful study of the Bible, you have learned much about Jehovah​—his personality and his ways. What you have learned about him has warmed your heart and moved you to love him very much. Your love for Jehovah must be the primary basis for your decision to get baptized.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>What does it mean to get baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, as stated at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Your decision to get baptized is also based on the Bible truths you have accepted. Consider what Jesus said when he gave the commission to make disciples. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 28:19, 20</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>According to Jesus, those who get baptized must do so “in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit.” <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>What did this mean? You must believe with all your heart the Bible truths about Jehovah; his Son, Jesus; and the holy spirit. These truths are very powerful and can deeply touch your heart. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>) Let us review some of them.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"><strong>10-11. </strong>What truths about the Father have you learned and accepted?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Think back to when you learned these truths about the Father: His “name is Jehovah,” he is “the Most High over all the earth,” and he alone is “the true God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:18-19:83:18" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Ps. 83:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:37:16-23:37:16" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Isa. 37:16</a>) He is our Creator, and “salvation belongs to Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:3:8-19:3:8" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 3:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:36:9-19:36:9" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 36:9</a>) He has made provision to save us from sin and death and has given us the prospect of everlasting life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="13-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) Your dedication and baptism will identify you as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:10-23:43:12" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Isa. 43:10-12</a>) You will be part of a worldwide family of worshippers who are proud to be called by God’s name and make it known to others.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:86:12-19:86:12" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 86:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>What a privilege it is to understand what the Bible teaches about the Father! When you accept these precious truths, your heart moves you to dedicate yourself to Jehovah and get baptized.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu"><strong>12-13. </strong>What truths about the Son have you learned and accepted?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>What was your reaction when you learned the following truths about the Son? Jesus is the second most important person in the universe. He is our Ransomer. He willingly gave his life for us. When we show by our actions that we have faith in the ransom, we can have our sins forgiven, develop a friendship with God, and gain everlasting life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="16-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>) Jesus is our High Priest. He wants to help us to benefit from the ransom and to have a close relationship with God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:15-58:4:15" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Heb. 4:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:24-58:7:25" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> 7:24, 25</a>) As King of God’s Kingdom, he is the one through whom Jehovah will sanctify His name, end wickedness, and bring eternal blessings in the coming Paradise. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matt. 6:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:15-66:11:15" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> Rev. 11:15</a>) Jesus is our model. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:21-60:2:21" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:21</a>) He set an example for us in devoting his life to doing God’s will.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:34-43:4:34" data-bid="20-1" class="b">John 4:34</a>.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>When you accept what the Bible teaches about Jesus, you come to love God’s dear Son. That love moves you to use your life to do God’s will, as Jesus did. As a result, you feel impelled to dedicate yourself to Jehovah and get baptized.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu"><strong>14-15. </strong>What truths about the holy spirit have you learned and accepted?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup></strong>What did you think when you learned the following truths about the holy spirit? It is, not a person, but God’s active force. Jehovah used the holy spirit to inspire the writing of the Bible, and the spirit helps us to understand and apply what we read in it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:26-43:14:26" data-bid="21-1" class="b">John 14:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:21-61:1:21" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 2 Pet. 1:21</a>) By means of his spirit, Jehovah gives us “power beyond what is normal.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:7-47:4:7" data-bid="22-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:7</a>) The spirit empowers us to preach the good news, fight temptation, deal with discouragement, and overcome trials. It helps us to display the beautiful qualities that make up “the fruitage of the spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:22-48:5:22" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Gal. 5:22</a>) God freely gives his spirit to those who trust in him and sincerely ask him for it.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:13-42:11:13" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Luke 11:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>How reassuring and comforting it is to know that Jehovah’s worshippers can rely on the holy spirit to help them in serving God! When you accept the truths you have learned about the holy spirit, you will feel moved to dedicate yourself to God and get baptized.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu"><strong>16. </strong>What have we learned so far in our discussion?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span><strong><sup>16 </sup></strong>You are taking an important step when you decide to dedicate yourself to God and get baptized. As we have learned, you must be willing to accept the expense involved​—the challenges and the sacrifices. But the blessings far outweigh the expense. Baptism can save you, and it leads to a good conscience before God. Your decision to get baptized must be based primarily on your love for Jehovah God. You must also believe with all your heart the truths you have learned about the Father, the Son, and the holy spirit. After considering what we have discussed so far, how would you answer the question, “Am I ready to get baptized?”</p>

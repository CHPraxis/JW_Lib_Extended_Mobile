<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb">DO YOU want to get baptized as a disciple of Christ? Love and appreciation have motivated many to make that choice. Consider the example of an official who served the queen of Ethiopia.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>The Ethiopian acted immediately on what he had learned from the Scriptures. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:27-44:8:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Acts 8:27</strong><strong>-31,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:35-44:8:38" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> <strong>35-38</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>What motivated him? He obviously appreciated God’s Word; he was reading a passage from the book of Isaiah as he rode in a chariot. And when Philip spoke with him, the man developed an appreciation for what Jesus had done for him. But why had the official traveled to Jerusalem? Because he had already developed a love for Jehovah. How do we know? He had just been worshipping Jehovah in Jerusalem. This man had apparently left the religion of his birth and had joined the only nation that was dedicated to the true God. It was this same <strong><em>love for Jehovah </em></strong>that motivated him to take yet another vital step, that of getting baptized and becoming a disciple of Christ.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> <strong>3. </strong>What might prevent a person from getting baptized? (See the box “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:2020320/53-59">What Is in Your Heart?</a>”)</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Love for Jehovah can motivate you to get baptized. But love might also <strong><em>prevent </em></strong>you from doing so. How? Note just some examples. You may love your unbelieving family and friends deeply, and you may worry that if you get baptized, they will hate you. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:37-40:10:37" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 10:37</a>) Or <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>you may love habits that you know God hates, and you may find it difficult to break free from their grip.

You may love the good memories associated with those celebrations. As a result, you may find it difficult to stop observing customs that displease Jehovah.

<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>What is the primary motivation that will lead you to baptism?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>You have many worthwhile things to love and appreciate. For instance, even before studying with Jehovah’s Witnesses, you may have formed a deep appreciation for the Bible. And you may have developed a love for Jesus. Now that you have come to know Jehovah’s Witnesses, you might love to associate with them. But loving those good things will not necessarily make you want to dedicate yourself to Jehovah and get baptized. The primary motivation that will lead you to baptism is love for Jehovah God himself. When you love Jehovah more than all else, you will not let anything or anyone prevent you from serving him. You could view love for Jehovah as both the gateway to baptism and the guardrail that helps you stay on the path of serving God.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>What questions will we consider?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Jesus said that we must love Jehovah with our whole heart, soul, mind, and strength. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:30-41:12:30" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mark 12:30</a>) How can you learn to love and respect Jehovah that deeply? Reflecting on Jehovah’s love for us moves us to love him in return. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:19-62:4:19" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 John 4:19</a>) What other feelings and actions will naturally follow once you develop that most important love?<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span></p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:20-45:1:20" data-bid="38-1" class="b">Romans 1:20</a>, what is one way that you can learn about Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup><em>Learn about Jehovah through his creation. </em>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:20-45:1:20" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Romans 1:20;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Rev. 4:11</a>) Meditate on the wisdom evident in the designs of plants and animals. Learn a little about the wonderful way your body is made. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:139:14-19:139:14" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 139:14</a>) And think about the power that Jehovah packed into our sun, realizing that it is just one of billions of stars.<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:26-23:40:26" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isa. 40:26</a>) As you do, your respect for Jehovah will deepen. However, knowing that Jehovah is wise and powerful is only part of the foundation of your relationship with him. To build a strong love for Jehovah, you need to know more about him.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>7. </strong>To love Jehovah deeply, of what do you need to be convinced?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>You need to be convinced that Jehovah cares for you personally. Do you find it difficult to believe that the Creator of heaven and earth knows that you exist and that he cares for you? If so, remember that Jehovah is “not far off from each one of us.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:26-44:17:28" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 17:26-28</a>) He “searches through all hearts,” and he promises you that, as David told Solomon, “if you search for him, he will let himself be found by you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:28:9-13:28:9" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Chron. 28:9</a>) In fact, the reason you are now <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>studying the Bible is that, as Jehovah says, “I have drawn you to me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:31:3-24:31:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Jer. 31:3</a>) The more you appreciate all that Jehovah has done for you, the deeper your love for him will be.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>How can you respond to Jehovah’s love?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>One way to respond to Jehovah’s love is by talking to him in prayer. Your love for God will grow as you tell him about your concerns and thank him for all that he does for you. And the bond between you and Jehovah will be strengthened as you see how he answers your prayers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:116:1-19:116:1" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Ps. 116:1</a>) You will become convinced that he understands you. But to grow close to Jehovah, you need to understand his way of thinking. And you need to know what he wants from you. The only way you will gain that knowledge is by studying his Word, the Bible.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>One of the unique features of the Bible is that it contains eyewitness accounts about Jesus.

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>How can you learn to love Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup><em>Learn to love Jesus, and your love for Jehovah will grow. </em></strong>Why? Because Jesus reflects his Father’s qualities perfectly.

Think of the compassion Jesus showed for those who were looked down on by others​—the poor, the sick, and the vulnerable. Think, too, of the practical advice he gives you and how your life improves when you listen to him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:1-40:5:11" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matt. 5:1-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:24-40:7:27" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 7:24-27</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>Your affection for Jesus is likely to become stronger as you think deeply about the sacrifice he made so that our sins can be forgiven. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matt. 20:28</a>) When you understand that Jesus was willing to die for you, you may feel moved to repent and seek Jehovah’s forgiveness.

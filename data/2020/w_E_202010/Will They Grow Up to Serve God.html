<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb">OFTEN, the choices that parents make affect their children for a long time. If parents make poor choices, they can cause problems for their children. But if they make wise choices, they give their children the best chance of having a happy, satisfying life. Of course, children must also make good decisions. The best decision anyone can make is to serve our loving heavenly Father, Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:28-19:73:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 73:28</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>2. </strong>What good choices did Jesus and his parents make?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Jesus’ parents were determined to help their children to serve Jehovah, and the choices the parents made proved that this was their main goal in life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:40-42:2:41" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 2:40, 41,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:52-42:2:52" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 52</a>) Jesus likewise made good choices that helped him to fulfill his role in Jehovah’s purpose. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:1-40:4:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 4:1-10</a>) Jesus grew up to be a kind, loyal, and courageous man​—the type of son who would bring pride and joy to the heart of any God-fearing parent.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:46-42:1:55" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 1:46-55</a>) And the way that Joseph reacted to Jehovah’s direction shows that he feared God and wanted to please him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:24-40:1:24" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 1:24</a>.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"><strong>5-6. </strong>What did Jehovah allow his Son to experience?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>Note that Jehovah did not choose wealthy parents for Jesus. The sacrifice Joseph and Mary offered after Jesus’ birth shows that they were poor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:24-42:2:24" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 2:24</a>) Joseph may have had a small shop next to his home in Nazareth where he worked as a carpenter. Their way of living must have been simple, especially as the family grew in size to include at least seven children.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:55-40:13:56" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 13:55, 56</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Jehovah protected Jesus from certain dangers, but He did not shield His Son from all challenges. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:2:13-40:2:15" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 2:13-15</a>) For example, Jesus had to deal with unbelieving relatives. Imagine how disappointing it must have been for Jesus to have members of his own family who did not initially accept him as the Messiah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:3:21-41:3:21" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Mark 3:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:5-43:7:5" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> John 7:5</a>) Likely, Jesus also had to cope with the death of his adoptive father, Joseph. Such a loss may have meant that Jesus, the oldest son, had to take over the family business. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:3-41:6:3" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Mark 6:3</a>) As he grew up, Jesus learned to be responsible for the welfare of his family. He likely had to work hard to support them. So he knew firsthand how it felt to be physically tired at the end of the day.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Jesus’ earthly parents helped Jesus to grow up to have God’s favor; they followed Jehovah’s directions to parents. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:6-5:6:7" data-bid="19-1" class="b"><strong>Deuteronomy 6:6, 7</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Joseph and Mary had a deep love for Jehovah, and their priority was to encourage their children to develop that same kind of love.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Joseph and Mary chose to maintain a good spiritual routine as a family.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>Early in his human life, Jesus chose to be submissive to his parents. He never rejected his parents’ direction, reasoning that he knew more than they did. Rather, “he continued subject to them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:51-42:2:51" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Luke 2:51</a>) Jesus no doubt took his responsibility as the oldest son seriously.

How do we know that Jesus was a good student of God’s Word? Because while he was still a boy, the teachers in Jerusalem were “in constant amazement at his understanding and his answers.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:46-42:2:47" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Luke 2:46, 47</a>) And at only 12 years of age, Jesus had already proved to himself that Jehovah was his Father.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:42-42:2:43" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Luke 2:42, 43,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:49-42:2:49" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 49</a>.</p>

Yet, he chose to submit himself to Jehovah. When Jesus got baptized in 29 C.E., his main focus in life was that of doing what Jehovah required of him.

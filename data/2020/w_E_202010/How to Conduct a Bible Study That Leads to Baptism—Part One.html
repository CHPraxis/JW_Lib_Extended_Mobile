And during those same years, on average, over 280,000 got baptized each year as Jehovah’s Witnesses and new disciples of Jesus Christ.

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>What should we realize about a doorstep Bible study?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>Many of our brothers and sisters are conducting Bible studies right on the householder’s doorstep. Although this is a good start for developing interest in the Bible, these discussions are usually quite brief and may not even be held every week. To cultivate the interest further, some will ask for the interested person’s contact information and then phone or text the person between visits to share a brief Scriptural thought. Such occasional discussions might continue for months without developing into a productive study of the Bible. Will a student really progress to dedication and baptism if that is all the time and effort that he<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span> devotes to studying God’s Word? Probably not.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:14:27-42:14:33" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Luke 14:27-33</a>, what did Jesus emphasize that can help us in our disciple-making work?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>On one occasion, Jesus illustrated the cost of becoming his disciple. He spoke about someone wanting to build a tower and about a king wanting to march into war. Jesus said that the builder must “first sit down and calculate the expense” to complete the tower and that the king must “first sit down and take counsel” to see whether his troops can accomplish what they intend to do. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:14:27-42:14:33" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>Luke 14:27-33</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Likewise, Jesus knew that a person who wants to become his disciple should analyze very carefully what it means to follow him. <span id="page8" class="pageNum" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>For that reason, we need to encourage prospective disciples to study with us every week. How can we do that?</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>What might we try to do to have progressive studies?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Start by lengthening those doorstep studies. Perhaps you can discuss an additional Scriptural point each time you visit. When the householder feels comfortable with a longer visit, ask him if there is some place where you can sit down together and continue the discussion. The householder’s reply will reveal how serious he is about studying the Bible. Eventually, to accelerate his progress, you might even ask the student if he would be willing to study twice a week. Yet, more is needed than to study once or twice every week.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>As <strong><em>the teacher, </em></strong>you need to prepare well for each Bible study session. You can begin by reading the material and looking up the scriptures. Get the main points clearly in mind. Think about the title of the lesson, the subheadings, the study questions, the “read” scriptures, the artwork, and any videos that may help explain the subject. Then with your student in mind, meditate in advance on how to present the information simply and clearly so that your student can easily understand and apply it.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:8-16:8:8" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Neh. 8:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:28-20:15:28" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Prov. 15:28a</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>As part of your preparation, pray to Jehovah about the student and his needs. Ask Jehovah to help you teach from the Bible in a way that will reach the person’s heart. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:9-51:1:10" data-bid="9-1" class="b"><strong>Colossians 1:9, 10</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Try to anticipate anything that the student may have difficulty understanding or accepting.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>It is our hope that through a regular Bible study, the student will appreciate what Jehovah and Jesus have done and will want to learn more.

To that end, impress on him how important it is that he prepare for each study session by reading the lesson beforehand and reflecting on how the material applies to him. How can the teacher help? Prepare a lesson together with the student to show him how this is done.<span data-fnid="5" class="fn">e<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="5"></span></span> Explain how to find the direct answers to the study questions, and show how highlighting only key words or phrases will help him recall the answer. Then ask him to give the answer in his own words. When he does so, you will be able to determine how well he has understood the material.

<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu"><strong>12. </strong>How can a teacher help a student to develop a relationship with Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>What a student learns on a Bible study should appeal not just to his mind but also to his heart. Why? Our heart​—which includes our desires, emotions, and feelings—​motivates us to action. Jesus used logical reasoning that appealed to the mind. But people followed him because he also stirred their heart. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:15-42:24:15" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Luke 24:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:27-42:24:27" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 27,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:32-42:24:32" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 32</a>) Your student needs to see Jehovah as a real Person, someone with whom he can develop a relationship, and to see Him as his Father, his God, and his Friend. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:25:4-19:25:5" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Ps. 25:4, 5</a>) During the Bible study, make our God’s personality come alive.

Help the student to appreciate Jehovah’s beautiful qualities​—his love, kindness, and compassion. Jesus said that “the greatest and first commandment” is to “love Jehovah your God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:37-40:22:38" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matt. 22:37, 38</a>) Try to instill deep love for God in your student’s heart.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup></strong>In your conversations with your student, express your deep feelings for Jehovah. This may help your student to realize that he needs to develop his own warm, personal relationship with God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:28-19:73:28" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 73:28</a>) For example, is there a phrase in the study publication or in a scripture that reveals something about Jehovah​—his love, wisdom, justice, or power—​that touches your heart? Mention it to your student, and let him know that this is one of the many reasons why you love our heavenly Father. There is something else that every Bible student needs to do in order to progress to baptism.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:111:1-19:111:1" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ps. 111:1</a>) Some teachers explain to their students that they will receive half of their Bible education from the study and the other half from the meetings. <strong>Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="21-1" class="b"><strong>Hebrews 10:24, 25</strong></a> with your student, and explain to him the benefits that he will receive if he comes to the meetings.

Enthusiastically share something you learned at a recent meeting. That is more motivating than just inviting the student to attend. Give him the <em>Watchtower </em>or the <em>Life and Ministry Meeting Workbook </em>that is currently being studied at the meeting. Show him what will be discussed at the next meeting, and ask him what part of it sounds most interesting to him. What your student experiences at his first meeting will far exceed anything he ever experienced at any other type of religious gathering. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:24-46:14:25" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Cor. 14:24, 25</a>) He will meet others whose good example he can imitate and who will help him progress to baptism.</p>

<div class="groupFootnote"><div><p id="p33" data-pid="33">To teach a person something means to help him “think, feel, or act in a new or different way.” Our 2020 yeartext, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:19" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19</a>, has reminded us of the importance of studying the Bible with people and teaching them how to become baptized disciples of Jesus Christ. In this article and in the one that follows, we will see how we can improve in this all-important work.</p></div>
<div><p id="p34" data-pid="34"><strong>EXPRESSION EXPLAINED: </strong>If you regularly and systematically have discussions using the Bible, you are conducting a <strong>Bible study. </strong>You may report the study if you have conducted it two times after the study arrangement was demonstrated and if you have reason to believe that the study will continue.</p></div>

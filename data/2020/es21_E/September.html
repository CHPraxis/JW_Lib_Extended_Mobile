<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Do the examples set by Jehovah and Jesus in working hard imply that it is not necessary for us to rest? Not at all. Jehovah never gets tired, so he does not need physical rest. The Bible does say that after Jehovah created the heavens and the earth, “he rested and refreshed himself.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:31:17-2:31:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ex. 31:17</a>) However, that evidently means that Jehovah paused and found satisfaction in what he had made. And although Jesus worked hard while he lived on earth, he still made time to rest and to enjoy meals with his friends. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:14:13-40:14:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 14:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:7:34-42:7:34" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Luke 7:34</a>) The Bible encourages God’s people to be workers. His servants are to be industrious rather than lazy. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:19-20:15:19" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Prov. 15:19</a>) Perhaps you work secularly to care for your family. And all disciples of Christ have the responsibility to share in the work of preaching the good news. Still, you also need to get sufficient rest. <a class="xt" data-xtid="302" href="jwpub://p/E:2019680/7-7"><em>w19.12 </em>2 ¶2;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="303" href="jwpub://p/E:2019680/9-10"> 3 ¶4-5</a></p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Avoid telling stories about the demons. In this regard, we want to imitate the example set by Jesus. Before he came to earth, Jesus lived in heaven, and he knew a lot about Satan and the demons. But he did not relate stories about what those wicked spirits had done. Jesus wanted to be a witness of Jehovah, not a publicity agent for Satan. We can imitate Jesus by not spreading stories about the demons. Instead, we show by our words that our “heart is stirred by something good,” that is, the truth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:45:1-19:45:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 45:1</a>) Do not be terrified of wicked spirits. In this imperfect world, bad things may happen to us. Accidents, sickness, or even death may come without warning. But we should not think that invisible spirits are responsible. The Bible explains that “time and unexpected events” can overtake anyone. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:11-21:9:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Eccl. 9:11</a>) As for the demons, Jehovah has shown that he is far more powerful than they are. <a class="xt" data-xtid="304" href="jwpub://p/E:2019364/20-21"><em>w19.04 </em>23-24 ¶13-14</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:28-44:5:29" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 5:28, 29</a>) So when they learn of an allegation, elders immediately seek direction on how they can comply with laws about reporting it. Elders assure victims and their parents and others with knowledge of the matter that they are free to report an allegation of abuse to the secular authorities. But what if the report is about someone who is a part of the congregation and the matter then becomes known in the community? Should the Christian who reported it feel that he has brought reproach on God’s name? No. The abuser is the one who brings reproach on God’s name. <a class="xt" data-xtid="305" href="jwpub://p/E:2019405/20-21"><em>w19.05 </em>10 ¶13-14</a></p>

<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="sb">Many who study the Bible progress to baptism. However, some who regularly study the Bible with us seem reluctant to become disciples. They enjoy their studies, but they are not progressing to baptism. If you are conducting a Bible study, we are sure that you want to help your student to apply what he learns and to become a disciple of Christ. Jehovah wants people to serve him because they love him. So our goal is to help our students to understand that Jehovah cares deeply about them as individuals and that he loves them very much. We want to help them to see Jehovah as “a father of the fatherless and a protector of widows.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:68:5-19:68:5" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Ps. 68:5</a>) As your students come to appreciate God’s love for them, their heart will likely be touched and their own love for him will grow. So help your students to understand that our loving God wants them to gain everlasting life, and he is ready to help them to achieve that goal. <a class="xt" data-xtid="330" href="jwpub://p/E:2020240/13-15"><em>w20.01 </em>3 ¶7-8</a></p>

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">The apostle Paul was humble, so he sought and received encouragement from his friends. He did not worry about being viewed as a weak person if he acknowledged that he had been comforted by others during times of distress. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:7-51:4:11" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Col. 4:7-11</a>) When we humbly acknowledge that we need encouragement, our brothers and sisters will gladly give us the support we need. Paul knew that the Scriptures would comfort him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Rom. 15:4</a>) They would also give him wisdom to face any trial. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:15-55:3:16" data-bid="99-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:15, 16</a>) When imprisoned in Rome for the second time, Paul felt that his death was near. He asked Timothy to come to him quickly and bring “the scrolls.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:6-55:4:7" data-bid="100-1" class="b">2 Tim. 4:6, 7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:9-55:4:9" data-bid="100-2" class="b"> 9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:13-55:4:13" data-bid="100-3" class="b"> 13</a>) Why? Because those scrolls were likely portions of the Hebrew Scriptures that Paul could use in his personal Bible study. When we imitate Paul by regularly studying God’s Word, Jehovah will use the Scriptures to soothe us​—no matter what trials we face. <a class="xt" data-xtid="331" href="jwpub://p/E:2020286/21-22"><em>w20.02 </em>23-24 ¶14-15</a></p>

Instead, they were thinking about how they could prove that Job had done something wrong. They made some accurate statements, but much of what they said about Job and about Jehovah was either unkind or untrue. They judged Job harshly. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:32:1-18:32:3" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Job 32:1-3</a>) How did Jehovah respond? His anger burned hot against those three men.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:42:7-18:42:9" data-bid="103-1" class="b">Job 42:7-9</a>) We learn a number of lessons from the bad examples set by Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. First, we should not judge our brothers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:2-40:7:5" data-bid="104-1" class="b">Matt. 7:2-5</a>) Instead, we should listen carefully to them before we speak.

<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sb">It is often when we are teaching others about Jehovah that we ourselves come to know him better. For example, we see direct evidence of Jehovah’s compassion when he guides us to those who have the right heart condition. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:44-43:6:44" data-bid="108-1" class="b">John 6:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:48-44:13:48" data-bid="108-2" class="b"> Acts 13:48</a>) We see the power of God’s Word at work as we watch those with whom we study break free from bad habits and begin to put on the new personality. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:9-51:3:10" data-bid="109-1" class="b">Col. 3:9, 10</a>) And we see proof of God’s patience as he gives many in our territory numerous opportunities to learn about him and be saved. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:13-45:10:15" data-bid="110-1" class="b">Rom. 10:13-15</a>) However, no matter how long we have been serving Jehovah, we should never take our relationship with him for granted. One of the most obvious ways we can prove that we value our friendship with God is by talking to him in prayer. Good communication is the lifeblood of a strong relationship. So draw close to God by praying often, never being afraid to express your innermost thoughts to him. <a class="xt" data-xtid="333" href="jwpub://p/E:2019686/17-17"><em>w19.12 </em>19 ¶11,</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="334" href="jwpub://p/E:2019686/19-20"> 13-14</a></p>

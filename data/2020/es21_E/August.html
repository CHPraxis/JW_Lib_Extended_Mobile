In addition, if the wrongdoer is a part of the congregation, elders are concerned with trying to restore him if that is possible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:14-59:5:15" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Jas. 5:14, 15</a>) A Christian who gives in to wrong desire and commits a serious sin is spiritually sick. This means that he no longer has a healthy relationship with Jehovah. In a sense, the elders are spiritual physicians. They endeavor to make “the sick one [in this instance, the wrongdoer] well.” Their Scriptural counsel can help him to restore his relationship with God, but this is only possible if he is genuinely repentant.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:19-44:3:19" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 3:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:2:5-47:2:10" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 2:5-10</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="264" href="jwpub://p/E:2019405/17-18"><em>w19.05 </em>10 ¶10-11</a></p>

One reference work says that during the 1970’s “self-help books proliferated.” Some books “urged readers to know and accept themselves and to celebrate who they were.” Consider, for example, the statement made in one such book: “Be in love with the most beautiful, exciting, worthy person ever​—you.” The book advocates a “religion of the self in which an individual determines his own behavior based upon his own conscience and the laws of his culture that work for him.” Does that idea sound familiar to you? Satan encouraged Eve to do something similar. He said that she could “be like God, knowing good and bad.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:5-1:3:5" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Gen. 3:5</a>) Today, many think so highly of themselves that in their opinion no one​—not even God—​can tell them what is right and what is wrong.

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">One reason why we might find it a challenge to submit to Jehovah is that we all inherited sin and are imperfect. So we have rebellious tendencies. After Adam and Eve rebelled against God and ate the forbidden fruit, they set their own standards. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:22-1:3:22" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Gen. 3:22</a>) Today, most of mankind still prefer to ignore Jehovah and decide for themselves what is right and what is wrong. Even those who know and love Jehovah may struggle to submit fully to him. The apostle Paul faced this challenge. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:7:21-45:7:23" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Rom. 7:21-23</a>) Like Paul, we want to do what is right in Jehovah’s eyes. But we must constantly fight the tendency to do wrong things. Another reason why it can be a challenge to submit to Jehovah is that we are influenced by the culture in which we were raised. Many human ideas are in conflict with Jehovah’s will, and it can be a constant struggle to free ourselves from common ways of thinking. <a class="xt" data-xtid="279" href="jwpub://p/E:2019564/10-12"><em>w19.09 </em>15 ¶4-6</a></p>

Note what Jesus said to a rich young man who asked him: “What must I do to inherit everlasting life?” He must have been a decent man because Mark’s Gospel account specifically states that Jesus “felt love for him.” Jesus presented the young ruler with the invitation above. The man was torn, but it appears that he could not let go of his “many possessions.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:17-41:10:22" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Mark 10:17-22</a>) As a result, he rejected the yoke that Jesus had offered him and continued to slave “for Riches.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:24-40:6:24" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Matt. 6:24</a>) What choice would you have made?

<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="sb">How should we treat anointed brothers and sisters? It would be wrong to admire a person too much, even if he is an anointed brother of Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:8-40:23:11" data-bid="90-1" class="b">Matt. 23:8-11</a>) When the Bible speaks of the elders, it encourages us to “imitate their faith,” but it does not tell us that we can make any human our leader. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:7-58:13:7" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Heb. 13:7</a>) It is true that the Bible says that some are “worthy of double honor.” But this is because they “preside in a fine way” and “work hard in speaking and teaching,” not because they are anointed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:17-54:5:17" data-bid="92-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:17</a>) If we give anointed ones too much praise and attention, we could embarrass them. Or even worse, we could cause them to become proud. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:3-45:12:3" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Rom. 12:3</a>) None of us would want to do anything that might cause one of Christ’s anointed brothers to make such a serious mistake!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:17:2-42:17:2" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Luke 17:2</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="294" href="jwpub://p/E:2020246/15-15"><em>w20.01 </em>29 ¶8</a></p>

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">The apostle Paul had many reasons for feeling anxious. The problems his brothers and sisters faced weighed heavily on his mind. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:2:4-47:2:4" data-bid="96-1" class="b">2 Cor. 2:4</a>) Opposers beat him and threw him in prison. He also had to endure hardships that caused anxiety, such as being “low on provisions.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:12-50:4:12" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Phil. 4:12</a>) And considering that he had been shipwrecked at least three times at that point in his life, we can only imagine the anxiety he experienced when traveling by boat. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:23-47:11:27" data-bid="98-1" class="b">2 Cor. 11:23-27</a>) How did Paul deal with the anxiety? Paul felt anxious for his brothers and sisters when they faced challenges, but he did not try to fix all their problems by himself. Paul was modest. He arranged for others to help in caring for the congregation, trustworthy men such as Timothy and Titus. The work those brothers did no doubt helped to reduce Paul’s anxiety.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:19-50:2:20" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Phil. 2:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:1-56:1:1" data-bid="99-2" class="b"> Titus 1:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:4-56:1:5" data-bid="99-3" class="b"> 4, 5</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="295" href="jwpub://p/E:2020286/18-19"><em>w20.02 </em>23 ¶11-12</a></p>

However, the primary reason why we obey Jehovah is that we love him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:3-62:5:3" data-bid="101-1" class="b">1 John 5:3</a>) Although there are many reasons why we should obey Jehovah, he does not force us to do so. Jehovah gave us the gift of free will, so he is happy when we choose to obey him out of love for him. Parents want their children to be safe. That is why they establish standards of behavior. When children obey those guidelines, they show that they put trust in their parents and respect them. How much more important it is, then, that we know our heavenly Father’s standards and live by them. When we do, we show Jehovah that we love and respect him and we also benefit ourselves.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Aristarchus, a Macedonian Christian from Thessalonica, proved to be a loyal friend to the apostle Paul. We first read about Aristarchus when Paul visited Ephesus on his third missionary tour. While accompanying Paul, Aristarchus was captured by a mob. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:29-44:19:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 19:29</a>) When he was finally set free, he did not seek his own safety but loyally stayed with Paul. Some months later, in Greece, Aristarchus was still at Paul’s side even though opposers continued to threaten Paul’s life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:2-44:20:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 20:2-4</a>) In about 58 C.E. when Paul was sent to Rome as a prisoner, Aristarchus accompanied him on the long journey, and together they endured shipwreck along the way. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:1-44:27:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 27:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:41-44:27:41" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 41</a>) Once in Rome, he apparently spent some time in prison with Paul. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:4:10-51:4:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Col. 4:10</a>) Little wonder that Paul felt encouraged and comforted by such a loyal companion! Like Aristarchus, we can be a loyal friend by sticking to our brothers and sisters not only in good times but also during “times of distress.” <a class="xt" data-xtid="113" href="jwpub://p/E:2020241/10-11"><em>w20.01 </em>9 ¶4-5</a></p>

Before Joseph revealed his real identity to his brothers, he tested them to find out if they had changed. He arranged a meal at which he gave the youngest brother, Benjamin, significantly more attention than he gave the others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:43:33-1:43:34" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Gen. 43:33, 34</a>) Yet, there is no indication that his brothers became envious of Benjamin.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:44:30-1:44:34" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Gen. 44:30-34</a>) Because Joseph’s brothers had let go of envy, they were able to help restore peace in their family.

Your love for God will grow as you tell him about your concerns and thank him for all that he does for you. And the bond between you and Jehovah will be strengthened as you see how he answers your prayers. You will become convinced that he understands you. But to grow close to Jehovah, you need to understand his way of thinking. And you need to know what he wants from you. The only way you will gain that knowledge is by studying his Word, the Bible. So learn to appreciate it. Only the Bible contains the truth about Jehovah and his purpose for you. You show that you appreciate the Bible by reading it each day, by preparing for your personal Bible study session, and by applying what you learn.

If a government bans our worship, we might wrongly conclude that we do not have God’s blessing. But remember, persecution does not mean that Jehovah is unhappy with us. Take, for example, the apostle Paul. He certainly had God’s approval. He had the privilege of writing 14 letters of the Christian Greek Scriptures, and he was an apostle to the nations.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:31-40:6:32" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Matt. 6:31, 32</a>) To ease that worry, we might focus on gaining material possessions. If we allow that to happen, our faith in Jehovah will become weak and we will suffer serious spiritual harm.

We may then fear being ridiculed or persecuted by men more than we fear displeasing Jehovah. To protect ourselves from that danger, we must beg Jehovah to give us the faith and courage we need to face the challenge.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:29:25-20:29:25" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Prov. 29:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:17:5-42:17:5" data-bid="99-2" class="b"> Luke 17:5</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="142" href="jwpub://p/E:2019645/13-14"><em>w19.11 </em>15 ¶6-7</a></p>

Why? Because circumstances change. What steps can help us to make the best decisions possible? Pray for wisdom. In some respects, we are all “lacking in wisdom.” So rely on Jehovah both when making a decision and when reviewing that decision. Jehovah will then help you to make wise choices. Do thorough research. Consult God’s Word, read the publications of Jehovah’s organization, and talk to people whom you can trust. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:20:18-20:20:18" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Prov. 20:18</a>) Such research is vital before making a decision to change jobs, to move, or to choose appropriate education to help you support your ministry. <a class="xt" data-xtid="143" href="jwpub://p/E:2019642/12-14"><em>w19.11 </em>27 ¶6-8</a></p>

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">Happily, God arranged a way for us to be rescued, or freed from sin. Jesus is the key to that liberation. In the eighth century before our Common Era, the prophet Isaiah foretold a future grand liberation. That grand liberation would accomplish far more than did the liberation during Israel’s Jubilee year. He wrote: “The spirit of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah is upon me, because Jehovah anointed me to declare good news to the meek. He sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:61:1-23:61:1" data-bid="104-1" class="b">Isa. 61:1</a>) To whom does that prophecy apply? That important prophecy about liberation began to be fulfilled after Jesus started his ministry. When he went to the synagogue in his hometown of Nazareth, Jesus read those very words of Isaiah to the Jews assembled there and applied them to himself.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:16-42:4:19" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Luke 4:16-19</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="144" href="jwpub://p/E:2019681/12-14"><em>w19.12 </em>9-10 ¶6-8</a></p>

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">To face persecution, you need courage. If you feel that you lack that quality, what can you do? Remember that true courage does not depend on your size, strength, or ability. Consider the example of young David when he faced Goliath. Compared with that giant, David was smaller, weaker, and poorly armed. David did not even have a sword. Yet, he was full of courage. David boldly ran to fight that arrogant giant. Why was David so courageous? He firmly believed that Jehovah was with him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:37-9:17:37" data-bid="107-1" class="b">1 Sam. 17:37,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:45-9:17:47" data-bid="107-2" class="b"> 45-47</a>) David did not concentrate on how big Goliath was compared with him. Instead, he focused on how tiny Goliath was compared to Jehovah. What do we learn from this account? We will feel courageous if we are confident that Jehovah is with us and if we are certain that our opposers are tiny in comparison to Almighty God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:20:15-14:20:15" data-bid="108-1" class="b">2 Chron. 20:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:16:8-19:16:8" data-bid="108-2" class="b"> Ps. 16:8</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="145" href="jwpub://p/E:2019485/18-20"><em>w19.07 </em>5 ¶11-13</a></p>

If so, think about these important questions: Do you have a burning desire to do Jehovah’s will? Do you feel that you are especially zealous in the preaching work? Are you a keen student of God’s Word who loves to learn about “the deep things of God”? Do you feel that Jehovah has given you wonderful results in the preaching work? Do you have a deep inner feeling of responsibility to help others spiritually? Have you seen proof that Jehovah has helped you in many specific ways in your life? If you answer these questions with a resounding yes, does this prove that you now have the heavenly calling? No, it does not. Why not? Because all of God’s servants can feel this way. In fact, if you are wondering whether you have been anointed by holy spirit, such doubt in itself would mean that you have not been. Those called by Jehovah do not wonder whether they have been anointed or not! They know! <a class="xt" data-xtid="147" href="jwpub://p/E:2020245/23-23"><em>w20.01 </em>23 ¶14</a></p>

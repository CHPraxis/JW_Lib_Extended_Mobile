For example, if you meet someone who lives in a land where our work is banned, are you tempted to ask him to give details about how our work is carried out in that country? No doubt your motives are good. We love our brothers and are interested in what is happening to them. We also want to be specific when praying for them. However, this is a time when we should hold back from speaking. If we put pressure on someone who has confidential information, we show a lack of love​—both to that person and to the brothers and sisters who are relying on him to keep quiet about their activity. Certainly, none of us would want to add to the difficulties of our brothers and sisters who live in countries where our work is under ban. Similarly, no brother or sister serving in such a land would want to reveal details about how Witnesses living there conduct their ministry or Christian activities. <a class="xt" data-xtid="410" href="jwpub://p/E:2020327/18-19"><em>w20.03 </em>21 ¶11-12</a></p>

So it is all too easy for devious abusers to deceive children. Abusers teach children dangerous lies, such as the idea that the child is to blame, that the abuse must be kept secret, that no one will listen or care if the child reports the abuse, or that sexual acts between an adult and a child are actually normal expressions of sincere love. Such lies can distort a child’s thinking ability and perception of truth for many years. Such a child may grow up thinking of herself or himself as damaged, defiled, and unworthy of love or comfort. It is not surprising, then, that sexual abuse can cause lasting harm. We are living in the last days, a time when many have “no natural affection” and when “wicked men and impostors will advance from bad to worse.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1-5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:13-55:3:13" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 13</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="412" href="jwpub://p/E:2019400/13-14"><em>w19.05 </em>15 ¶7-8</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:19-42:24:19" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 24:19</a>) Jesus also taught by example. By how he lived, he showed his followers how they should live.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:23-40:4:23" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 4:23</a>) He also taught his followers shortly after he was resurrected. For example, he appeared to a group of disciples​—perhaps numbering over 500—​and gave them the command to “make disciples.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:6-46:15:6" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 15:6</a>) As head of the congregation, Jesus continued to instruct his disciples after he returned to heaven.

Looking back, you feel that you were able to go on from day to day only because Jehovah’s holy spirit provided you with “power beyond what is normal.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:7-47:4:9" data-bid="43-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:7-9</a>) We also rely on holy spirit to deal with the influence of this wicked world.

Or a Christian wife might think, ‘My husband is much more qualified than so-and-so!’ However, if we are truly humble, we will avoid such a prideful spirit. We can learn from the way that Moses reacted when others received privileges. Moses appreciated his assignment of leading the nation of Israel. How did Moses react when Jehovah permitted others to serve alongside him? He was not jealous. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:11:24-4:11:29" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Num. 11:24-29</a>) As to judging the people, he humbly allowed others to share some of his workload.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:15-44:27:15" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Acts 27:15</a>) So when the apostle Peter wrote that Bible writers were “borne along,” he used “a fascinating maritime metaphor,” as one Bible scholar put it. Peter said, in effect, that just as a ship is carried along by the wind to accomplish its journey, so Bible prophets and writers were borne along by holy spirit to accomplish their task. The same scholar said: “The prophets raised their sails, so to speak.” Jehovah did his part. He provided “the wind,” or holy spirit. The Bible writers did their part. They worked in harmony with the direction of that spirit.

Others may find it hard to view Jehovah as their Father because their own human father showed them little or no love and affection. One Christian sister says: “My father was very abusive. When I first began to study the Bible, it was difficult for me to relate to a heavenly Father.” Do you have similar feelings? If so, be assured that you too can come to see Jehovah as the best possible Father. <a class="xt" data-xtid="443" href="jwpub://p/E:2020281/10-11"><em>w20.02 </em>3 ¶4-5</a></p>

You can, for example, speak about Jehovah, pray for your brothers, and encourage others to stay faithful. Jehovah considers you to be his fellow worker, not because of what you accomplish, but because of your willing obedience to him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:5-46:3:9" data-bid="89-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:5-9</a>) How grateful we are to worship Jehovah, a God who truly values those who serve him!

Humility will help us not to think too highly of ourselves. A humble person does not feel that he deserves more than everyone else. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:3-48:6:4" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Gal. 6:3, 4</a>) Someone who is content is satisfied with what he has and does not compare himself with others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:7-54:6:8" data-bid="95-1" class="b">1 Tim. 6:7, 8</a>) When a person who is humble and content sees someone receive something good, he is happy for him. We need the help of God’s holy spirit if we are to avoid the fleshly trait of envy and instead cultivate humility and contentment.

<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sb">Dedication is a vow that Jehovah expects you to keep. So stay close to your congregation. Your brothers and sisters in the congregation are your spiritual family. By regularly attending the meetings, you will strengthen your bond with them. Read God’s Word and meditate on it every day. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:1-19:1:2" data-bid="99-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1, 2</a>) Take some time to think deeply about what you have read.

By sharing regularly in the ministry, you will keep your faith strong. Any hardships you may face in this old world are “momentary and light.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:17-47:4:17" data-bid="102-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:17</a>) In contrast, your dedication and baptism will open the way to a more satisfying life now and “the real life” to come.

They will hear your words, but no one will act on them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:33:32-26:33:32" data-bid="106-1" class="b">Ezek. 33:32</a>) We may find it hard to tell a person that we will stop studying with him.

It was different, however, with the small group of Bible Students who were publishing the <em>Watch Tower </em>in the late 1800’s. They understood that God would restore Paradise on earth and that millions of obedient humans would live here on earth​—not in heaven. However, it took time for them to discern clearly who these obedient humans would be. Of course, the Bible Students also discerned from the Scriptures that some would be “bought from the earth” to rule with Jesus in heaven.

They may try to shame us, perhaps by saying that we did not love or respect the deceased. Or they might say that our behavior will cause the dead person to harm the living in some way. In a Caribbean nation, many believe that after a person dies, his “ghost” may stay around and punish those who mistreated him. The “ghost” may even “wreak havoc on a community,” says one reference. It is a custom in Africa to cover mirrors in the home of the deceased and turn pictures to face the wall. The reason? Some claim that the dead must not see themselves! As Jehovah’s servants, we certainly do not believe any myths or take part in any practices that promote Satan’s lies!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:21-46:10:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Cor. 10:21, 22</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="77" href="jwpub://p/E:2019363/19-20"><em>w19.04 </em>16 ¶11-12</a></p>

The angel provided very practical help. He gave Elijah a hot meal and encouraged him to eat. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:19:5-11:19:8" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Ki. 19:5-8</a>) That account illustrates a useful truth: Sometimes a simple act of practical kindness can do a great deal of good. Perhaps a meal, a modest gift, or a thoughtful card would assure a downhearted brother or sister of our love and concern. If we feel uncomfortable discussing very personal or painful subjects, perhaps we can still give such practical help. Jehovah miraculously gave Elijah the help he needed to go all the way to Mount Horeb, far out of the reach of those who sought to do him harm. What lesson may we draw? If we want to offer comfort to victims of abuse, we may need first to help them feel safe, whether at their home or at the Kingdom Hall. <a class="xt" data-xtid="80" href="jwpub://p/E:2019400/18-18"><em>w19.05 </em>16 ¶11;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="81" href="jwpub://p/E:2019400/21-22"> 17 ¶13-14</a></p>

We cannot expect the elders to read our minds and know what we need. Consider what a brother named Julian says: “I asked for help, and that shepherding visit turned out to be one of the best gifts I have ever received.” Loyal elders, such as the two who visited Julian, can help us to know “the mind of Christ,” that is, to understand and imitate his thinking and attitude.

Of course, a loving husband will do what he can to support his wife when their children need attention, both at meetings and at home. For example, he could help his wife with household chores.

The answer is clearly seen in the apostle Paul’s words to those in Rome who were “called to be holy ones.” In addition to the words of today’s text, he told them: “You did not receive a spirit of slavery causing fear again, but you received a spirit of adoption as sons, by which spirit we cry out: <em>‘Abba, </em>Father!’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:7-45:1:7" data-bid="87-1" class="b">Rom. 1:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:15-45:8:15" data-bid="87-2" class="b"> 8:15</a>) So by means of his holy spirit, God makes it clear to anointed ones that they have this heavenly calling. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:2:12-52:2:12" data-bid="88-1" class="b">1 Thess. 2:12</a>) Jehovah leaves no doubt whatsoever in the minds and hearts of those who receive his invitation to go to heaven.

Above all, he showed great love by surrendering his life in behalf of others. We can imitate Jesus by putting the needs of others ahead of our own.

As a result, they jumped to wrong conclusions and judged Job harshly. How can we avoid making a similar mistake? Realize that only Jehovah knows all the facts about a person’s situation. Listen carefully to what the suffering person says. Do more than hear his words; try also to feel his pain. Only then will you be able to show genuine fellow feeling for your brother or sister. Compassion will hold us back from spreading harmful gossip about the problems others are facing. A gossiper does not build up the congregation; he tears it down.

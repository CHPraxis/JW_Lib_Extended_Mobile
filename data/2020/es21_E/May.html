What you say is important; however, what you do will likely have a bigger impact on your child. We can be sure that Joseph and Mary set an excellent example for their children, including Jesus. Joseph worked hard to support his family. In addition, Joseph encouraged his household to appreciate spiritual things. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:4:9-5:4:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deut. 4:9, 10</a>) He took his family with him to Jerusalem “from year to year” to celebrate the Passover.

To make matters worse, you may believe that because you are overwhelmed by anxiety, you must lack faith​—you must be a bad person. Consider, though, a few Scriptural examples. Hannah, the prophet Samuel’s mother, was a woman of great faith. Yet, she was overcome by anxiety when a member of her household treated her badly.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:8:5-46:8:5" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Cor. 8:5</a>) They used the same term, “Lord,” for Jehovah and for Jesus, making it difficult to understand that Jehovah and his Son are different individuals with distinct positions.

Others may act as though they were speaking to those who have died. Some practice witchcraft or magic, and they may try to cast a spell on another person. A survey conducted in 18 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean found that about a third of the people surveyed believe in magic, witchcraft, or sorcery, and nearly as many believe that it is possible to communicate with spirits. Another survey was conducted in 18 countries in Africa. There, on average, more than half of the people surveyed say that they believe in witchcraft.

<p id="p76" data-pid="76" class="sb">When making decisions, analyze your motives. Jehovah wants us to be honest in all things. So when we make decisions, we too want to be honest with ourselves and with others about our motives. If we were not completely honest, we would likely have difficulty sticking to the decision. For example, a young brother may decide to become a regular pioneer. After some time, however, he struggles to fulfill the hour requirement and he finds little joy in his ministry. He may have thought that his main motive for pioneering was his desire to please Jehovah. Could it be, though, that he was primarily motivated by a desire to please his parents or some person he admired? Consider the situation of a Bible student who decides to give up smoking. At first, he struggles, doing well for a week or two, but then he gives in to the urge to smoke. Finally, though, he is successful! His love for Jehovah and his desire to please Him have helped him to conquer the habit.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:10-51:1:10" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Col. 1:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:23-51:3:23" data-bid="100-2" class="b"> 3:23</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="178" href="jwpub://p/E:2019642/15-15"><em>w19.11 </em>27 ¶9;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="179" href="jwpub://p/E:2019642/16-16"> 29 ¶10</a></p>

<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="sb">The apostle Paul was confident that he would finish the race and reach his goal. As an anointed Christian, he looked forward to gaining “the prize of the upward call of God.” However, to reach that goal, he realized that he had to keep “pressing on.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:14-50:3:14" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Phil. 3:14</a>) Paul shared with the Philippians an interesting comparison to help them keep focused on their goal. Paul reminded the Philippians of their heavenly citizenship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:20-50:3:20" data-bid="103-1" class="b">Phil. 3:20</a>) Why did such citizenship matter? In those days, Roman citizenship was highly prized. However, anointed Christians had a much better citizenship, one that would bring far greater advantages. Roman citizenship paled in comparison! Anointed Christians today set a fine example as they press on toward their goal of everlasting life in heaven. <a class="xt" data-xtid="180" href="jwpub://p/E:2019520/22-23"><em>w19.08 </em>6 ¶14-15</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:25:8-3:25:12" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Lev. 25:8-12</a>) For instance, a man set free during the Jubilee might again become a slave, and in any case, he would eventually die. On the day of Pentecost 33 C.E., Jehovah anointed with holy spirit the apostles and other faithful men and women. He adopted them as his sons so that in time they would be resurrected to heaven to reign with Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:2-45:8:2" data-bid="106-1" class="b">Rom. 8:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:15-45:8:17" data-bid="106-2" class="b"> 15-17</a>) These were the first to benefit from the liberty that Jesus announced in the synagogue of Nazareth.

That includes knowing whom their children are communicating with through social media and on their mobile phone. Those associates can impact how the children think and act. Many parents exert themselves to arrange opportunities for their children to associate with those who set a good example in serving God. For instance, N’Déni and Bomine, a couple in Côte d’Ivoire, often invited the circuit overseer to stay in their home. N’Déni relates: “This had a very good effect on our son. He began pioneering and now serves as a substitute circuit overseer.” The earlier parents begin training their children, the better. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:6-20:22:6" data-bid="109-1" class="b">Prov. 22:6</a>) Consider Timothy.

One sister explains why. She says, “You do not have the added stress of wondering whether the person who offered to help will be there on time to do what he promised.” Those coping with a trial or disappointment often find comfort by confiding in a trusted friend. But to be a trusted friend and confidant, we need to cultivate patience. When Zhanna’s husband left her, she found comfort in sharing her feelings with close friends. “They patiently listened to me,” she says, “although I probably said the same things over and over again.” You too can prove to be a good friend by being a good listener. <a class="xt" data-xtid="184" href="jwpub://p/E:2020241/16-18"><em>w20.01 </em>10-11 ¶9-11</a></p>

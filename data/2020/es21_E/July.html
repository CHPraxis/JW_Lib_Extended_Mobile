<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When others speak harshly or act unkindly, we may feel anxious. That is especially true if the one who hurt us is a close friend or relative. In dealing with anxiety, we can learn much from the Bible example of Hannah, who was severely taunted by her husband’s second wife. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:1:12-9:1:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Sam. 1:12</a>) Like Hannah, we can talk at length to Jehovah about our anxieties and fears. Our prayers do not have to be poetic or perfectly structured. We may even find ourselves expressing bitter words that are interrupted by sobs of grief. Even so, Jehovah will never get tired of listening to us. In addition to praying about our problems, we need to remember the advice recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:6-50:4:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Philippians 4:6, 7</a>. The apostle Paul specifically mentioned that we should offer prayers of thanksgiving, or gratitude. We have so many reasons to thank Jehovah​—including the gift of life, his creative works, his loyal love, and the wonderful hope that he has given us. <a class="xt" data-xtid="226" href="jwpub://p/E:2020286/9-9"><em>w20.02 </em>21 ¶3;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="227" href="jwpub://p/E:2020286/12-12"> 22 ¶6</a></p>

We should always be ready to speak about Jehovah and the Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:14-45:10:14" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Rom. 10:14</a>) In so doing, we imitate Jesus.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:37-43:18:37" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 18:37</a>) But we must remember that how we speak is also important. So when talking to others about Jehovah, we must do so with “a mild temper and deep respect,” and we should show consideration for the other person’s feelings and beliefs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:15-60:3:15" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:15</a>) Then we will do more than just talk; we will teach and possibly reach the person’s heart.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:6-60:5:7" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:6, 7</a>) Prayer helps us to maintain our inner peace no matter what trials we face. Consider the example of Robert, a faithful elder who is now in his 80’s. He says: “The counsel at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:6-50:4:7" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Philippians 4:6, 7</a> has helped me to cope with many trials in my life.

The Law said that a man who robbed or defrauded his neighbor was behaving “unfaithfully toward Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:6:2-3:6:4" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Lev. 6:2-4</a>) Certainly, then, when an individual who is a part of the congregation abuses a child​—robbing that child of his or her security—​he is behaving unfaithfully toward God. The abuser brings great reproach on Jehovah’s name. For that reason, abuse must be condemned for what it is​—a gross sin against God. Articles in <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>have discussed how those who have been sexually abused can deal with emotional scars, how others can help and encourage them, and how parents can protect their children. Elders have received detailed Scriptural training on how to handle the sin of child abuse. The organization continues to review the way congregations handle the sin of child abuse. <a class="xt" data-xtid="230" href="jwpub://p/E:2019405/14-15"><em>w19.05 </em>9 ¶8-9</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:4-19:146:4" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ps. 146:4</a>) It also reminds us that only Jehovah can reliably predict the future.

So refuse to do anything connected with spiritism. As true Christians, we never practice spiritism of any kind. For example, we do not visit spirit mediums or try to communicate with the dead in any other way. We avoid funeral customs that are based on the belief that the dead are still alive somewhere. And we do not use astrology or fortune-telling to try to learn about the future. We know that all such practices are very dangerous and that they could put us in direct contact with Satan and the demons. <a class="xt" data-xtid="231" href="jwpub://p/E:2019364/15-16"><em>w19.04 </em>21-22 ¶8-9</a></p>

The apostle Paul also said that we must “be flawless.” This does not mean that we must be perfect. Jehovah will view us as flawless if we do our very best to deepen our love and make sure of the more important things. One way in which we show our love is by doing our utmost to avoid stumbling others. The instruction to avoid stumbling others is really a warning. How might we stumble someone? We could do so by our choice of entertainment, our choice of clothing, or even our choice of employment. What we do may not be wrong in itself. But if the choices we make offend someone else’s conscience and he or she is stumbled, that matters.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:6-40:18:6" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Matt. 18:6</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="241" href="jwpub://p/E:2019524/16-18"><em>w19.08 </em>10 ¶9-11</a></p>

For instance, we may fear not knowing what to say or what to do for someone who is in a distressing situation. Yet we can be effective comforters if we show that we care. As we get closer to the end of this system of things, world conditions will deteriorate and life will become more challenging. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:13-55:3:13" data-bid="94-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:13</a>) And the problems that we bring on ourselves because of inherited sin and imperfection mean that we will continue to need comfort. The apostle Paul was able to endure faithfully to the end of his life, thanks, in part, to the comfort he received from fellow Christians. By following their example, we too can help our brothers and sisters to remain firm in the faith.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:3:2-52:3:3" data-bid="95-1" class="b">1 Thess. 3:2, 3</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="256" href="jwpub://p/E:2020241/26-28"><em>w20.01 </em>12-13 ¶17-19</a></p>

So an anointed person is not surprised if some do not believe right away that he has been anointed. He realizes that the Bible tells us not to be quick to believe someone who says that God has given him a special responsibility. Not wanting to draw attention to himself, an anointed Christian would not tell those whom he meets for the first time that he is anointed. And he would certainly not boast about it. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:4:7-46:4:8" data-bid="98-1" class="b">1 Cor. 4:7, 8</a>) Anointed Christians do not search out other anointed ones, hoping to discuss their anointing with them or to form private groups for Bible study.

We can only imagine the uproar that this might create, including on social media. The nations and their ruler, Satan, will hate us for having the only surviving religion. They will not have attained their goal to eliminate all religion from the face of the earth. So we will become the center of their attention. At this point, the nations will take on the role of Gog of Magog. They will band together to make a vicious, all-out attack on Jehovah’s people.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:2" data-bid="105-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1, 2</a>) May we never adopt that attitude! Jehovah wants all his children to get along well with one another.

And the Bible does not indicate that Peninnah’s attitude changed. So Hannah likely had to continue enduring her rival’s stabbing words. But Hannah was able to regain and maintain her inner peace. After leaving the matter in Jehovah’s hands, Hannah was no longer overwhelmed by worry. She allowed Jehovah to comfort and soothe her. Sometime later, Hannah was even blessed with children of her own!

Consider the case of Eli: High Priest Eli had two sons for whom he had deep affection. Those sons, however, had no respect for Jehovah. They held important positions as priests serving at the tabernacle. But they abused their authority, showed gross disrespect for the offerings given to Jehovah, and brazenly committed sexual immorality.

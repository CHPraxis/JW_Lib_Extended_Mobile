<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Today, many people who are considered wise would ridicule the Bible’s counsel about self-importance. They would say that considering others superior to you would make you vulnerable and that others would take advantage of you. But what fruitage has the self-centered attitude promoted by Satan’s world produced? Are selfish people happy? Do they have happy families and genuine friends? Do they have a close friendship with God? From what you have seen, which produces the best results​—following the wisdom of this world or the wisdom found in God’s Word? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:19-46:3:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:19</a>) People who follow the advice of those whom the world views as wise are like a tourist who asks a fellow tourist for directions when both of them are lost. Jesus said regarding the “wise” men of his day: “Blind guides is what they are. If, then, a blind man guides a blind man, both will fall into a pit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:14-40:15:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 15:14</a>) Truly, the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. <a class="xt" data-xtid="373" href="jwpub://p/E:2019406/23-25"><em>w19.05 </em>24-25 ¶14-16</a></p>

No. “Jehovah knows those who belong to him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:19-55:2:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Tim. 2:19</a>) Unlike Jehovah, the brothers who count the number of those partaking at the Memorial do not know who truly is anointed. So the number includes those who think that they are anointed but are not. For example, some who used to partake later stopped. Others may have mental or emotional problems that make them believe that they will rule with Christ in heaven. Clearly, we do not know exactly how many anointed ones are left on earth. There will be anointed ones in many parts of the earth when Jesus comes to take them to heaven. The Bible does say that during the last days, there will be a small number of anointed ones left on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:17-66:12:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rev. 12:17</a>) But it does not say how many of them will be left when the great tribulation begins. <a class="xt" data-xtid="374" href="jwpub://p/E:2020246/19-21"><em>w20.01 </em>29-30 ¶11-13</a></p>

When the son made his way home, the father eagerly welcomed him back. If we have strayed from Jehovah but are repentant, we can be sure that our loving Father is ready and willing to welcome us back. Our Father will repair all the damage caused by Adam. After Adam’s rebellion, Jehovah purposed to adopt 144,000 individuals from among mankind who will serve as kings and priests in heaven with his Son. Jesus and those associate rulers will help obedient humans to come to perfection in the new world. After they pass a final test of obedience, God will grant them everlasting life.

In his words recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:43-40:12:45" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 12:43-45</a>, Jesus indicated what needs to be done. The idea behind those words highlights this important truth: It is not enough to get rid of wrong thoughts; we need to fill the void with godly thinking. Is it possible to change our basic inclinations or who we really are inside? God’s Word answers: “Put on the new personality that was created according to God’s will in true righteousness and loyalty.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:24-49:4:24" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Eph. 4:24</a>) Yes, it is possible to change what we are inside, but it is not easy to do. We need to do more than just suppress wrong desires and actions. We need to change our “dominant mental attitude.” That involves changing our desires, our tendencies, and our motivations.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:5:5-42:5:5" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Luke 5:5</a>) In like manner, some disciple-makers spend many hours patiently “fishing” at different times and in various locations. Why? To improve their chances of meeting people. Those who put in the extra effort are often rewarded by meeting people who are interested in our message. Could you try preaching at a time of day when you are more likely to meet people or at a location where you are more likely to find them? Why does conducting Bible studies require patience? One reason is that we need to do more than help the student come to know and love the doctrines found in the Bible. We need to help the student come to know and love the Author of the Bible, Jehovah. <a class="xt" data-xtid="379" href="jwpub://p/E:2019480/23-24"><em>w19.07 </em>18-19 ¶14-15</a></p>

You would not even think of approaching the monarch without first receiving his permission. To do otherwise could very well cost you your life! How thankful we are that Jehovah is not like that Persian king! He welcomes us at any time. He wants us to feel free to approach him. For example, although Jehovah bears such lofty titles as Grand Creator, Almighty, and Sovereign Lord, we are invited to call on him using the familiar term “Father.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Matt. 6:9</a>) How touching that Jehovah wants us to view him in such a warm and intimate way! We can rightly call Jehovah “Father”​—he is the Source of our life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:36:9-19:36:9" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Ps. 36:9</a>) Because he is our Father, we have a responsibility to obey him.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:13-49:4:13" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Eph. 4:13</a>) When someone agrees to a study of the Bible, he may mainly be interested in how the study will benefit him personally. As his love for Jehovah grows, however, he will likely begin to think about how he can help others, including those who are already part of the congregation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:37-40:22:39" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Matt. 22:37-39</a>) When the time is right, do not hold back from mentioning the privilege of supporting the Kingdom work financially. Teach your Bible student what to do when problems arise. Suppose, for example, that your student, an unbaptized publisher, tells you that he has been offended by someone in the congregation. Rather than take sides, why not explain what his Scriptural options are? He can either forgive the brother or, if he cannot let the matter go, approach the person kindly and lovingly with the goal of ‘gaining the brother.’ (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:15-40:18:15" data-bid="98-1" class="b">Matthew 18:15</a>.)

When we take these steps, we will regain our inner peace. How encouraging it is to know that “Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted; he saves those who are crushed in spirit”!

When you have anxious thoughts, do not delay in seeking Jehovah’s help. Study the Bible diligently. Learn from the examples set by Hannah, the apostle Paul, and King David. Ask your heavenly Father to help you identify the cause of your anxiety.

<p id="p91" data-pid="91" class="sb">The Greek word translated “inspired of God” literally means “God-breathed.” God used his spirit to “breathe” his thoughts into the minds of Bible writers. When we read the Bible and meditate on what we read, God’s instructions enter our mind and heart. Those inspired thoughts move us to bring our life in line with God’s will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="104-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>) But to benefit fully from holy spirit, we must set aside time to study the Bible regularly and to think deeply about what we read. Then God’s Word will influence all that we say and do. Also, we must worship God together. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:22:22-19:22:22" data-bid="105-1" class="b">Ps. 22:22</a>) Jehovah’s spirit is present at meetings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:29-66:2:29" data-bid="106-1" class="b">Rev. 2:29</a>) When we meet for worship with fellow Christians, we pray for holy spirit, we sing Kingdom songs based on God’s Word, and we listen to Bible-based instruction presented by brothers who have been appointed by holy spirit. To benefit fully from holy spirit, however, we need to come prepared to participate in the meetings. <a class="xt" data-xtid="409" href="jwpub://p/E:2019641/21-22"><em>w19.11 </em>11 ¶13-14</a></p>

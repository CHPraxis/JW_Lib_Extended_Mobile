<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Justice,” as used in the Bible, basically means to do what God considers to be right and to do so without partiality. Consider how Jesus’ actions revealed his sense of justice. In his day, the Jewish religious leaders hated non-Jews, despised common Jews, and disrespected women. Jesus, however, was fair and impartial in dealing with all. He accepted non-Jews who approached him in faith. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:8:5-40:8:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 8:5-10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:8:13-40:8:13" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 13</a>) He preached without prejudice to all, rich and poor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:5-40:11:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 11:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:2-42:19:2" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Luke 19:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:9-42:19:9" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 9</a>) He was never harsh or abusive in his treatment of women. On the contrary, he was respectful and kind to women, including those whom others viewed with scorn. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:7:37-42:7:39" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 7:37-39,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:7:44-42:7:50" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 44-50</a>) We can imitate Jesus by dealing impartially with others and preaching to all who are willing to listen​—regardless of their social or religious background. Christian men follow his example by treating women with respect. <a class="xt" data-xtid="43" href="jwpub://p/E:2019404/6-6"><em>w19.05 </em>2 ¶1;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="44" href="jwpub://p/E:2019404/23-25"> 5 ¶15-17</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:66:13-23:66:13" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isa. 66:13</a>) The Bible includes examples of women who provided comfort to those in distress.

In some cases, an elder or two may discreetly ask a mature sister if she is in a position to help a suffering sister in that way.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Before the elders take judicial action, why are at least two witnesses required? This requirement is part of the Bible’s high standard of justice. When there is no confession of wrongdoing, two witnesses are required to establish the accusation and authorize the elders to take judicial action.

If at least two people​—the one making the accusation and someone else—​can confirm the charge, a judicial committee is formed. The absence of a second witness does not mean that the one making the accusation is untruthful. Even if a charge of wrongdoing cannot be established by two witnesses, the elders recognize that a serious sin may have been committed. The elders provide ongoing support to any individuals who may have been hurt and remain alert to protect the congregation from potential danger.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:28-44:20:28" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Acts 20:28</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="46" href="jwpub://p/E:2019405/22-23"><em>w19.05 </em>11 ¶15-16</a></p>

Of course, the length of each study period will depend on the age and temperament of the children. Our Bible students also need to learn how to study. When they are new, we are happy to see them simply underline the answers in preparation for their Bible study or for congregation meetings. But we do need to teach our Bible students how to do research and how to do meaningful study on their own. In that way, when problems arise, they will know how to get practical advice for themselves by doing research in our publications. <a class="xt" data-xtid="47" href="jwpub://p/E:2019401/7-7"><em>w19.05 </em>26 ¶2;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="48" href="jwpub://p/E:2019401/17-18"> 28 ¶10-11</a></p>

Does God really not want you to celebrate Christmas and birthdays? Does your God really expect you to refuse a blood transfusion? Does a loving God really expect you to avoid association with disfellowshipped loved ones?’ We need to be convinced of our beliefs. If we leave challenging questions unanswered in our minds, they can become serious doubts.

We must recognize that a person’s reaction to our message may depend on where he was raised. For example, people with a European background may not respond the same way as may those who come from Asia. Why? In Europe, many know something about the Bible and are familiar with the idea that God created all things. But in Asia, the majority of people know little or nothing about the Bible, and they may not believe in a Creator. So be positive. Every year, there are nonreligious people who become Jehovah’s Witnesses. Many already had high moral standards and felt disgusted by religious hypocrisy. Others had low moral standards and many had bad habits that they needed to abandon. With Jehovah’s help, we can be sure that we will find those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:48-44:13:48" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Acts 13:48;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:3-54:2:4" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 2:3, 4</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="53" href="jwpub://p/E:2019482/8-10"><em>w19.07 </em>20-21 ¶3-4</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Rev. 4:11</a>) Meditate on the wisdom evident in the designs of plants and animals. Learn a little about the wonderful way your body is made. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:139:14-19:139:14" data-bid="94-1" class="b">Ps. 139:14</a>) And think about the power that Jehovah packed into our sun, realizing that it is just one of billions of stars. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:26-23:40:26" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Isa. 40:26</a>) As you do, your respect for Jehovah will deepen. However, knowing that Jehovah is wise and powerful is only part of the foundation of your relationship with him. To build a strong love for Jehovah, you need to know more about him. You need to be convinced that Jehovah cares for you personally. Remember that “if you search for him, he will let himself be found by you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:28:9-13:28:9" data-bid="96-1" class="b">1 Chron. 28:9</a>) Jehovah says, “I have drawn you to me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:31:3-24:31:3" data-bid="97-1" class="b">Jer. 31:3</a>) The more you appreciate all that Jehovah has done for you, the deeper your love for him will be. <a class="xt" data-xtid="75" href="jwpub://p/E:2020320/12-13"><em>w20.03 </em>4 ¶6-7</a></p>

<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">The apostle Paul set a good example in making the ministry the most important activity in his life. When he was in Corinth during his second missionary journey, he was low on funds and had to spend some time making tents. He worked at this trade to support himself in the ministry so that he could declare the good news to the Corinthians “without cost” to them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:7-47:11:7" data-bid="99-1" class="b">2 Cor. 11:7</a>) Although Paul had to do some secular work, he continued to give priority to the ministry, and he preached on every Sabbath. After his circumstances improved, Paul was able to give more attention to preaching. He “began to be intensely occupied with the word, witnessing to the Jews to prove that Jesus is the Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:3-44:18:5" data-bid="100-1" class="b">Acts 18:3-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:9-47:11:9" data-bid="100-2" class="b"> 2 Cor. 11:9</a>) Later, when he was under house arrest in Rome for two years, Paul witnessed to visitors and wrote letters.

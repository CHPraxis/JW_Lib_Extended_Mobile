<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">Why is the disciple-making work so important? Because only disciples of Christ can be friends of God. In addition, those who follow Christ improve their lives now and have the hope of enjoying endless life in the future. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:6-43:14:6" data-bid="51-1" class="b">John 14:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="51-2" class="b"> 17:3</a>) Certainly, Jesus has entrusted us with an important responsibility, but we do not do this work by ourselves. The apostle Paul wrote about himself and certain close associates: “We are God’s fellow workers.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:9-46:3:9" data-bid="52-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:9</a>) What a privilege Jehovah and Christ have given to imperfect humans! Also, the disciple-making work can bring us much joy. We take the first step in making disciples when we “search out” those with the right heart condition. We prove that we truly are Jehovah’s Witnesses by witnessing to all whom we meet. We prove that we are genuine Christians by following Christ’s command to preach. <a class="xt" data-xtid="202" href="jwpub://p/E:2019480/9-12"><em>w19.07 </em>15 ¶3-5</a></p>

If I learn that they are new immigrants, I might ask: ‘How are you settling in? Have you found work? Are the local people treating you well?’” Sometimes this opens the way to introduce a Bible teaching. When appropriate, the sister may add: “What would you say is the key to getting along with people? May I show you a proverb from the Bible? It says: ‘Beginning a fight is like opening a floodgate; before the quarrel breaks out, take your leave.’ Do you think that this advice could help us to get along with others?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:14-20:17:14" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Prov. 17:14</a>) Such conversations can help us to identify people who would welcome further visits. <a class="xt" data-xtid="203" href="jwpub://p/E:2019482/21-21"><em>w19.07 </em>23 ¶13</a></p>

If you find yourself in a similar situation, it would be good to reflect on this fact: Jehovah sees our imperfections as well as those of our brother.

That life will not be a life of idleness. Rather, the Bible indicates that God’s people at that time will be doing useful, satisfying work. At the end of that period, we can be sure that “the creation itself will also be set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:21-45:8:21" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Rom. 8:21</a>) Just as Jehovah arranged for the Israelites to balance work and rest, so it will be for his people in the coming Thousand Year Rule of Christ. There will certainly be time for spiritual activities. Worship of God is essential to happiness today, and it will be so in the new world. Yes, we have good reason to rejoice over the good work and spiritual activity that we can expect when believing mankind enjoys life during Christ’s Millennial Reign. <a class="xt" data-xtid="219" href="jwpub://p/E:2019681/23-23"><em>w19.12 </em>12 ¶15;</a><a class="xt" data-xtid="220" href="jwpub://p/E:2019681/25-26"> 13 ¶17-18</a></p>

<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="sb">“To inculcate” means “to teach and impress by frequent repetitions.” To do so, parents need to spend time regularly with their young ones. It could at times seem frustrating to have to repeat instructions to the children. However, parents can strive to see this as a way to help their children understand God’s Word and apply it. So be discerning. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:127:0-19:127:5" data-bid="95-1" class="b">Psalm 127</a> compares children to arrows. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:127:4-19:127:4" data-bid="96-1" class="b">Ps. 127:4</a>) Just as arrows can be made from different materials and can vary in size, no two children are precisely alike. So parents need to determine how to train each of their children. A couple in modern-day Israel who successfully raised two children to serve Jehovah tell what they found to be helpful, “We conducted a Bible study with each child separately.” Of course, each family head will decide whether studying in that way is necessary or possible. <a class="xt" data-xtid="221" href="jwpub://p/E:2019687/25-27"><em>w19.12 </em>26-27 ¶18-20</a></p>

The first-century disciple Mark was a busy Christian. Yet, Mark made time to comfort the apostle Paul, and Paul felt free to ask for Mark’s assistance. Angela, who had to cope with the violent death of a family member, appreciated the willingness of those who comforted her. “When friends genuinely want to help, they are approachable,” she says. “They don’t seem reluctant or hesitant.” We can ask ourselves, ‘Am I known for being willing to comfort fellow worshippers in practical ways?’ <a class="xt" data-xtid="222" href="jwpub://p/E:2020241/22-24"><em>w20.01 </em>11-12 ¶14-16</a></p>

They know that Jehovah does not necessarily give anointed ones more holy spirit than he gives his other servants. They do not feel that they have a deeper understanding of Bible truths than anyone else. And they would never tell someone else that he too has been anointed and should start partaking at the Memorial. Instead, they humbly acknowledge that only Jehovah invites people to go to heaven. <a class="xt" data-xtid="223" href="jwpub://p/E:2020246/10-11"><em>w20.01 </em>27-28 ¶4-5</a></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:62:8-19:62:8" data-bid="104-1" class="b">Ps. 62:8</a>) We do well to ask ourselves this question: ‘Do my prayers tend to be like superficial, reprinted messages, or are they like heartfelt, handwritten letters?’ No doubt you love Jehovah deeply, and you want to keep your relationship with him strong. To do that, you must communicate with him regularly. Confide in him. Share your joys and your pains with him.

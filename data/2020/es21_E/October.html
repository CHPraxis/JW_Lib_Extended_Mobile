<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Your children are a sacred trust, “an inheritance from Jehovah.” It is your responsibility to safeguard that trust. What can you do to protect your children from abuse? First, educate yourself about abuse. Learn about the kind of individuals who abuse children and the tactics they use to deceive them. Be alert to potential dangers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:3-20:22:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Prov. 22:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:24:3-20:24:3" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 24:3</a>) Remember that in most cases, the abuser is someone the child already knows and trusts.

They may fear that they will not be believed, or they may have been threatened by the abuser to keep the abuse secret. If you sense that something is wrong, kindly draw them out with questions and then patiently listen to their answers. Third, educate your children. Teach them what to say and do if someone tries to touch them in an inappropriate way. <a class="xt" data-xtid="338" href="jwpub://p/E:2019405/27-30"><em>w19.05 </em>13 ¶19-22</a></p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Why does Jehovah detest proud people? One reason is that those who develop and promote an inflated love of self reflect Satan’s own arrogance. Imagine, Satan believed that Jesus​—the one whom God used to create all things—​should bow down and worship him! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:8-40:4:9" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 4:8, 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:15-51:1:16" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Col. 1:15, 16</a>) Those with such an inflated view of their own importance confirm that the wisdom of the world is foolishness with God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:19-46:3:19" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:19</a>) The Bible, though, helps us to have a balanced view of ourselves. It acknowledges that a degree of self-love is proper. Jesus said: “Love your neighbor as yourself,” which indicates that we should give a reasonable amount of attention to our needs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:19-40:19:19" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 19:19</a>) However, the Bible does not teach that we should elevate ourselves above others. Rather, it states: “Do nothing out of contentiousness or out of egotism, but with humility consider others superior to you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:3-50:2:3" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Phil. 2:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:3-45:12:3" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Rom. 12:3</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="339" href="jwpub://p/E:2019406/21-23"><em>w19.05 </em>24 ¶13-14</a></p>

However, we must never become complacent. Even though we stopped committing serious sins that we engaged in before baptism, we still need to be diligent about avoiding anything that would tempt us to return to those former deeds. A twofold action is required. First, we need to “stop being molded,” or shaped, by this world. Second, we need to “be transformed” by making our mind over. The transformation involves more than a superficial change in appearance. It touches every fiber of our being. We need to make over our mind​—our innermost attitudes, feelings, and inclinations. <a class="xt" data-xtid="340" href="jwpub://p/E:2019441/10-12"><em>w19.06 </em>9 ¶4-6</a></p>

I have found that the more involved I am in the ministry and my congregation, the better I am able to deal with stress and worry.” When we feel discouraged, let us remember that Jehovah not only promises permanent relief in the future but also offers to help us deal with stress now.

The work of Jehovah’s Witnesses was banned not only by the Nazi party in Germany but also by governments in Australia, Canada, and other lands. Yet, note what took place. In 1939 when the war began, there were 72,475 publishers worldwide. Reports showed that by the end of the war in 1945, with Jehovah’s blessing, there were 156,299 publishers.

How pleased Jehovah must be to see millions of willing worshippers serve him out of deep love for him and his ways! Jehovah sees and values not only our actions but also our motives. For example, if you are elderly and can no longer do as much as you would like, be assured that Jehovah sees beyond your limitations. You may feel that you have little to offer, but Jehovah sees the love deep within you that motivates you to do what you can do.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:1-21:3:8" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:1-8</a>) Clearly, two fundamental aspects of life are work and rest. Jesus had a balanced view of work and rest.

We are not under the Mosaic Law, yet we can benefit from considering what it said about the Sabbath. <a class="xt" data-xtid="359" href="jwpub://p/E:2019680/12-13"><em>w19.12 </em>3 ¶6-7</a></p>

<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="sb">The “ten men” represent those who have the hope of living forever on earth. They know that Jehovah has blessed the group of anointed ones represented by the “Jew” and feel that it is an honor to worship him along with them. Even though it is not possible to know the name of each individual member of the anointed on earth today, those who hope to live on earth can “go with” the anointed. How? Today’s text answers. Note that the Bible verse mentions one Jew. But “you” and “you people” refer to more than one person. This means that this Jew is not just one person but represents the whole group of anointed ones. Those who are not anointed serve Jehovah along with the anointed. However, they do not view the anointed as their leaders, realizing that Jesus fills the role of Leader.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:10-40:23:10" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Matt. 23:10</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="368" href="jwpub://p/E:2020246/6-7"><em>w20.01 </em>26 ¶1-2</a></p>

That statement was true in the first century, and it is true today. How important it is that we overcome any challenges and show love for one another! Ask yourself: ‘What can I learn from brothers and sisters who have continued to show love for one another despite challenges?’ Human imperfection makes it difficult for us to show intense love for one another. Even so, we must try to imitate Christ. Jesus taught us the importance of making peace with a brother who has something against us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:23-40:5:24" data-bid="93-1" class="b">Matt. 5:23, 24</a>) He emphasized that we need to maintain good relations with others if we are to please God. Jehovah is happy when we do our best to make peace with our brothers. He will not accept our worship if we hang on to resentment and refuse even to try to make peace.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:20-62:4:20" data-bid="94-1" class="b">1 John 4:20</a>. <a class="xt" data-xtid="369" href="jwpub://p/E:2020328/6-10"><em>w20.03 </em>24 ¶1-4</a></p>

Those teachings form the basis for many popular customs and superstitions. Why are so many humans deceived? Satan’s lies about death exploit the way we naturally feel about death.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:33:5-19:33:5" data-bid="101-1" class="b">Ps. 33:5</a>) So we can be sure of two things: (1) It pains Jehovah when his servants are treated unfairly. (2) He will make sure that justice is served. The Law that God gave Israel through Moses was built on love. It promoted justice​—justice for all, even vulnerable ones. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:18-5:10:18" data-bid="102-1" class="b">Deut. 10:18</a>) That Law reveals how deeply Jehovah cares about his worshippers. The Mosaic Law ended in 33 C.E. when the Christian congregation was established. Would Christians be without the benefits of a law that is built on love and promotes justice? By no means! Christians had a new law​—“the law of the Christ.” Jesus did not write down a law code for his followers, but he did give them instructions, commands, and principles to live by. “The law of the Christ” includes everything Jesus taught. <a class="xt" data-xtid="371" href="jwpub://p/E:2019404/6-9"><em>w19.05 </em>2 ¶1-3</a></p>

<p id="p94" data-pid="94" class="sb">Humans have a natural need for comfort and a remarkable ability to provide it. For instance, when a little child falls and skins his knee while playing, he may run to Mommy or Daddy, crying. The parents cannot heal the wound, but they can comfort the child. They may ask what happened, wipe away his tears, offer soothing words and affection, and perhaps apply some medicine or a bandage. Before long, the child stops crying and may even resume playing. In time, the wound will heal. Sometimes, though, children are hurt in far worse ways. Some are sexually abused. The abuse can be inflicted on a single occasion, or it may go on for years. In either case, the abuse can leave deep emotional scars. In some cases, the offender is caught and punished. In others, the abuser may seem to escape justice. But even if justice is swift, the harmful effects of the abuse may last well into adulthood. <a class="xt" data-xtid="372" href="jwpub://p/E:2019400/6-7"><em>w19.05 </em>14 ¶1-2</a></p>

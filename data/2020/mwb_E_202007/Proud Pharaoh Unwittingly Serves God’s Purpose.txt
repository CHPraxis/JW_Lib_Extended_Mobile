Proud Pharaoh Unwittingly Serves God’s Purpose




8:15, 18, 19; 9:15-17
Egyptian pharaohs viewed themselves as gods. This helps us understand why Pharaoh was too proud to listen to Moses and Aaron and even to his own magic-practicing priests.
Do you listen when others make suggestions? Do you appreciate it when someone counsels you? Or do you feel that you are always right? “Pride is before a crash.” (Pr 16:18) How important it is to guard against pride!

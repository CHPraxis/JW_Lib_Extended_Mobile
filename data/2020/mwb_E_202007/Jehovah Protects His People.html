<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The first Passover was a momentous event. On that night, after Pharaoh discovered that his firstborn was dead, he told Moses: “Get up, get out from among my people, both you and the other Israelites. Go and serve Jehovah, just as you have said.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:12:31-2:12:31" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ex 12:31</a>) Jehovah had demonstrated that he protects his people.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">As we look back on the modern-day history of Jehovah’s people, there is clear evidence that Jehovah continues to guide and protect them. This is highlighted in a museum at world headquarters entitled “A People for Jehovah’s Name.”</p>

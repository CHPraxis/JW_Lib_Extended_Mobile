Jehovah Protects His People









The first Passover was a momentous event. On that night, after Pharaoh discovered that his firstborn was dead, he told Moses: “Get up, get out from among my people, both you and the other Israelites. Go and serve Jehovah, just as you have said.” (Ex 12:31) Jehovah had demonstrated that he protects his people.
As we look back on the modern-day history of Jehovah’s people, there is clear evidence that Jehovah continues to guide and protect them. This is highlighted in a museum at world headquarters entitled “A People for Jehovah’s Name.”

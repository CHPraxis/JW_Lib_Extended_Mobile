TREASURES FROM GOD’S WORD | EXODUS 6-7
“Now You Will See What I Will Do to Pharaoh”




6:1, 6, 7; 7:4, 5
Before bringing the plagues on Egypt and delivering the Israelites from slavery, Jehovah told the Israelites what he was about to do. They would see Jehovah’s power demonstrated in ways that they had not previously witnessed, and the Egyptians would certainly know who Jehovah is. When God’s promises came true, the faith of the Israelites was strengthened, and this helped to counteract the false religious influences they had been exposed to in Egypt.
How does this Bible account strengthen your faith that God’s promises for the future will be fulfilled?

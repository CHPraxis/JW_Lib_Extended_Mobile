<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb">ALL of us are on a journey. Our destination, or goal, is to live in the new world under Jehovah’s loving rulership. Each day, we try to follow the path that leads to life. But as Jesus said, that road is cramped and at times difficult to follow. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:13-40:7:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Matthew 7:13, 14</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>We are imperfect, and it is easy for us to stray from this path.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:1-48:6:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gal. 6:1</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>If we are to stay on the cramped road to life, we must be willing to adjust our thinking, attitude, and actions. The apostle Paul encouraged Christians living in Corinth to continue “to be readjusted.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:13:11-47:13:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Cor. 13:11</a>) That counsel also applies to us. In this article, we will discuss how the Bible can help us to adjust our steps and how mature friends can help us to stay on the path to life. We will also consider when it might be a challenge to follow direction given by Jehovah’s organization. We will see how humility can help us to change our course without losing our joy in serving Jehovah.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>When we try to examine our own thoughts and feelings, we face a challenge. Our heart is treacherous, and that can make it difficult for us to know where it might be leading us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:17:9-24:17:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jer. 17:9</a>) It is easy to deceive ourselves with “false reasoning.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:22-59:1:22" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jas. 1:22</a>) So we must use God’s Word to examine ourselves. God’s Word reveals what we are on the inside, the innermost “thoughts and intentions” of our heart. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:12-58:4:13" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12, 13</a>) In a sense, God’s Word acts like <span id="page20" class="pageNum" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>an X-ray machine, enabling us to see what is inside. But we must be humble if we are to benefit from the counsel we receive from the Bible or from God’s representatives.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>What indicates that King Saul became a proud man?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup></strong>The example of King Saul shows what can happen when we lack humility. Saul became so proud that he would not admit, even to himself, that his thinking and actions needed to be adjusted. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:36:1-19:36:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 36:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:2:4-35:2:4" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Hab. 2:4</a>) This became evident when Jehovah gave Saul specific direction on what he should do after he defeated the Amalekites. Saul, however, did not obey Jehovah. And when the prophet Samuel confronted him about the matter, Saul did not acknowledge his mistake. Instead, he tried to justify his actions by minimizing the consequences of his disobedience and shifting the blame to others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:15:13-9:15:24" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Sam. 15:13-24</a>) Earlier, Saul had displayed a similar attitude. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:13:10-9:13:14" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Sam. 13:10-14</a>) Sadly, he allowed his heart to become haughty. He did not correct his thinking, so Jehovah reproved him and rejected him.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>5. </strong>What can we learn from Saul’s example?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>To learn from Saul’s example, we do well to ask ourselves these questions: ‘When I read counsel from God’s Word, do I tend to justify my thinking? Do I minimize the consequences of disobedience? Do I shift the blame for my actions to someone else?’ If our answer to any of those questions is yes, we must adjust our thinking and attitude. Otherwise, our heart can become so haughty that Jehovah will reject us as his friend.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:6-59:4:6" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jas. 4:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> <strong>6. </strong>Describe the contrast between King Saul and King David.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup></strong>Note the contrast between King Saul and his successor, King David, a man who loved “the law of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:1-19:1:3" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Ps. 1:1-3</a>) David knew that Jehovah saves those who are humble but opposes the haughty. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:22:28-10:22:28" data-bid="13-1" class="b">2 Sam. 22:28</a>) So David allowed God’s law to adjust his thinking. He wrote: “I will praise Jehovah, who has given me advice. Even during the night, my innermost thoughts correct me.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:16:7-19:16:7" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Ps. 16:7</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>7 </sup></strong>If we are humble, we will allow God’s Word to correct our wrong thinking before we act on those thoughts. God’s Word will be like a voice that tells us: “This is the way. Walk in it.” It will warn us when we are straying from the path​—to the left or to the right. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:30:21-23:30:21" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Isa. 30:21</a>) By listening to Jehovah, we will benefit ourselves in a number of ways. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:17" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isa. 48:17</a>) For instance, we will avoid the embarrassment of having to be corrected by someone else.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>God’s Word can act as a mirror for us. <strong>(Read </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:22-59:1:25" data-bid="18-1" class="b"><strong>James 1:22-25</strong></a><strong>.) </strong>Most of us look in a mirror each morning before we leave home. That way, we can see if we need to make an adjustment before others see us. Similarly, when we read the Bible each day, we will see ways that we can adjust our thinking and our attitude. Many find it helpful to read the daily text each morning before they leave home. They allow what they read to affect their thinking. <span id="page21" class="pageNum" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>Then throughout the day, they look for ways to apply the counsel from God’s Word. In addition, we must have a study routine that includes reading and thinking about God’s Word each day. This may sound simple, but it is one of the most important things we can do to help us stay on the cramped road to life.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Have you ever started to walk on a path that was leading you away from Jehovah? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:73:2-19:73:3" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Ps. 73:2, 3</a>) If a mature friend had the courage to correct you, did you listen to him and apply his advice? If so, you did the right thing, and you are no doubt grateful that your friend warned you.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:5-20:1:5" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Prov. 1:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>How should you react if a friend corrects you?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>God’s Word reminds us: “The wounds inflicted by a friend are faithful.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:6-20:27:6" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Prov. 27:6</a>) In what way is this statement true? Consider this illustration: Imagine that you are waiting to cross a busy street and you get distracted by your cell phone. You step onto the street without looking up. Just then, a friend grabs your arm and pulls you back onto the sidewalk. His grip is so firm that your arm is bruised, but his quick action saves you from being hit by a car. Even if the bruise he inflicted causes you pain for several days, would you be offended that your friend grabbed you? Certainly not! You would be grateful for his help. Similarly, if a friend warns you that your speech or actions are not in harmony with God’s righteous standards, you may feel hurt at first. But do not resent his counsel or become offended. That would be foolish. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:9-21:7:9" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Eccl. 7:9</a>) Instead, be grateful that your friend had the courage to speak up.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>What could cause someone to reject good counsel from a loving friend? Pride. Proud people like “to have their ears tickled.” They “turn away from listening to the truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:3-55:4:4" data-bid="23-1" class="b">2 Tim. 4:3, 4</a>) They have an inflated view of their own opinion and worth.

He wrote: “Better is a poor but wise child than an old but stupid king, who no longer has enough sense to heed a warning.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:4:13-21:4:13" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Eccl. 4:13</a>.</p>

If after examining yourself you still see the need to speak to your friend, clearly <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>identify the problem and use viewpoint questions to help your friend to recognize his mistake.

This material is solidly based on the Scriptures. When deciding how the preaching work can best be accomplished, the Governing Body relies on holy spirit. Still, the Governing Body regularly reviews its own decisions about how the work is organized. Why? Because “the scene of this world is changing,” and God’s organization must adapt to new circumstances.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:31-46:7:31" data-bid="32-1" class="b">1 Cor. 7:31</a>.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>15 </sup></strong>No doubt, we readily follow the Bible-based direction we receive regarding doctrinal or moral matters. But how do we react when God’s organization makes a change that affects other aspects of our life? For example, in recent years the cost of building and maintaining places of worship has increased dramatically. So the Governing Body has directed that Kingdom Halls be used to capacity. As a result of this adjustment, congregations have been merged and some Kingdom Halls have been sold. The funds are being used to help build halls in areas that need them the most. If you live in an area where halls are being sold and congregations are being merged, you may find it a challenge to adapt to the new circumstances. Some publishers now have to travel farther to attend meetings. Others who worked hard to build or maintain a Kingdom Hall <span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span>may wonder why that hall is now being sold.

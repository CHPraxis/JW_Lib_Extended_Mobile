<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb">HAVE you ever felt that you were all alone, that you had no one to help you deal with a challenge you faced? Many have felt that way, including faithful servants of Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:19:14-11:19:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Ki. 19:14</a>) If that ever happens to you, remember Jehovah’s promise: “I will never leave you, and I will never abandon you.” So we can say with confidence: “Jehovah is my helper; I will not be afraid.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:5-58:13:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 13:5, 6</a>) The apostle Paul wrote those words to fellow believers in Judea about 61 C.E. His words remind us of the sentiments expressed at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:118:5-19:118:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 118:5-7</strong></a><strong>.​—Read.</strong></p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> <strong>2. </strong>What will we consider in this article, and why?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>Like the psalmist, Paul knew from personal experience that Jehovah was his Helper. For instance, over two years before he wrote his letter to the Hebrews, Paul made a dangerous journey through a storm-tossed sea. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:4-44:27:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 27:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:15-44:27:15" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:20-44:27:20" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 20</a>) Throughout that journey and during the time leading up to it, Jehovah proved to be Paul’s Helper in various ways. We will consider three of them. Jehovah provided help by means of Jesus and the angels, individuals in authority, and fellow believers. Reviewing these events in Paul’s life will deepen our trust in God’s promise that He will also respond to our calls for help.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><strong><sup>3 </sup></strong>Paul needed help. About 56 C.E., a crowd dragged <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>him outside the temple in Jerusalem and tried to kill him. The next day, when Paul was brought before the Sanhedrin, he was almost torn apart by his enemies. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:21:30-44:21:32" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Acts 21:30-32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:22:30-44:22:30" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 22:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:23:6-44:23:10" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 23:6-10</a>) At that point, Paul may have wondered, ‘How much longer can I endure this treatment?’</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> <strong>4. </strong>How did Jehovah help Paul by means of Jesus?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><strong><sup>4 </sup><em>What help did Paul receive? </em></strong>The night after Paul was arrested, “the Lord,” Jesus, stood by him and said: “Take courage! For just as you have been giving a thorough witness about me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear witness in Rome.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:23:11-44:23:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Acts 23:11</a>) What timely encouragement! Jesus commended Paul for the witness he had given in Jerusalem. And he promised that Paul would safely reach Rome, where he would give a further witness. After receiving that assurance, Paul must have felt as secure as a child nestled in his father’s arms.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><strong><sup>5 </sup></strong>What other challenges did Paul face? About two years after those events in Jerusalem, Paul was on a ship heading for Italy when the vessel encountered such a heavy storm that the crew and passengers thought they would die. Yet, Paul was not afraid. Why? He told those aboard: “This night an angel of the God to whom I belong and to whom I render sacred service stood by me and said: ‘Have no fear, Paul. You must stand before Caesar, and look! God has granted to you all those sailing with you.’” Jehovah had used an angel to repeat the assurance that He had given Paul earlier by means of Jesus. And, indeed, Paul reached Rome.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:20-44:27:25" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 27:20-25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:28:16-44:28:16" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 28:16</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><strong><sup>6 </sup><em>What help do we receive? </em></strong>Jesus will support us, as he did Paul. For example, Jesus promises all those who follow him: “I am with you <strong><em>all </em></strong>the days until the conclusion of the system of things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:20-40:28:20" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 28:20</a>) Jesus’ words are a source of strength for us. Why? Because some days are difficult for us to endure. For instance, when a loved one dies, we must deal with that pain not just for a few days but likely for many years. Others must deal with the difficult days that come with old age. Still others face days on which they are overwhelmed by feelings of depression. Even so, we find the strength to <span id="page14" class="pageNum" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>go on because we know that Jesus is with us <em>“<strong>all </strong></em><strong></strong>the days,” including the darkest days, of our life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:28-40:11:30" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 11:28-30</a>.</p>

<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> <strong>8. </strong>How did Jehovah help Paul by means of a military commander?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><strong><sup>8 </sup><em>What help did Paul receive? </em></strong>Back in 56 C.E., Jesus assured Paul that he would reach Rome. However, some Jews in Jerusalem planned to ambush Paul and kill him. When the Roman military commander Claudius Lysias learned about the plan, he came to Paul’s rescue. Quickly, Claudius sent Paul​—protected by many soldiers—​to Caesarea, along a route that was about 65 miles (105 km) from Jerusalem. In Caesarea, Governor Felix ordered that Paul “be kept under guard in Herod’s palace.” Paul was out of the reach of the would-be murderers.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:23:12-44:23:35" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Acts 23:12-35</a>.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> <strong>9. </strong>How did Governor Festus help Paul?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><strong><sup>9 </sup></strong>Two years later, Paul was still in custody in Caesarea. Felix had been succeeded as governor by Festus. The Jews begged Festus to have Paul come to Jerusalem to stand trial, but Festus refused. Perhaps the governor was aware that the Jews had been “planning to ambush Paul and kill him along the road.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:24:27-44:25:5" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Acts 24:27–25:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"><strong>10. </strong>How did Governor Festus respond to Paul’s appeal to be judged by Caesar?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><strong><sup>10 </sup></strong>Later, Paul’s trial was held in Caesarea. Since Festus wanted “to gain favor with the Jews,” he asked Paul: “Do you wish to go up to Jerusalem and be judged before me there?” Paul knew that he would probably be killed in Jerusalem, and he also knew what he could do to save his life, reach Rome, and carry out his ministry. He said: “I appeal to Caesar!” After consulting his counselors, Festus told Paul: “To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you will go.” Festus’ favorable decision rescued Paul from his enemies. In time, Paul would be in Rome​—far out of the reach of the Jews who were seeking to kill him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:25:6-44:25:12" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Acts 25:6-12</a>.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu"><strong>11. </strong>Paul may have reflected on what reassuring words given by Isaiah?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><strong><sup>11 </sup></strong>While Paul was waiting to begin his voyage to Italy, he may well have reflected on a warning that the prophet Isaiah was inspired to give to those opposing Jehovah: “Devise a plan, but it will be thwarted! Say what you like, but it will not succeed, for God is with us!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:8:10-23:8:10" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isa. 8:10</a>) Paul knew that God would help him, and this must have strengthened him as he faced the trials that were to come.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><strong><sup>12 </sup></strong>In 58 C.E., Paul began his voyage to Italy. Being a prisoner, he was placed under the authority of a Roman army officer named Julius. From that moment on, Julius had the power to make Paul’s life miserable or to make it bearable. How would he use his authority? The next day when they landed ashore, <span id="page15" class="pageNum" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>“Julius treated Paul with kindness and permitted him to go to his friends.” Later on, Julius even saved Paul’s life. How? The soldiers wanted to kill all the prisoners who were on the ship, but Julius stopped them. Why? He “was determined to bring Paul safely through.” Likely, Paul discerned Jehovah’s guidance in the actions of that kindhearted officer.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:1-44:27:3" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Acts 27:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:42-44:27:44" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 42-44</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><strong><sup>13 </sup><em>What help do we receive? </em></strong>When it is in harmony with his purpose, Jehovah may use his powerful holy spirit to cause people in authority to do what he desires. King Solomon wrote: “A king’s heart is like streams of water in Jehovah’s hand. He directs it wherever He pleases.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:21:1-20:21:1" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Prov. 21:1</a>) What does this proverb mean? Humans can dig a canal to divert the water of a stream in a direction that fits their plans. Similarly, Jehovah can use his spirit to divert the thoughts of rulers in a direction that is in harmony with his purpose. When that occurs, people in authority feel motivated to make decisions that benefit God’s people.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:7:21-15:7:21" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Ezra 7:21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:7:25-15:7:26" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 25, 26</a>.</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><strong><sup>14 </sup><em>What can we do? </em></strong>We can pray “concerning kings and all those who are in positions of authority” when these individuals are called on to make decisions that affect our Christian life and ministry.

Only later, during the rough voyage, did they learn that their lives would be spared. Therefore, when Aristarchus and Luke boarded the ship in Caesarea, Paul must have offered a heartfelt prayer to Jehovah, thanking him for the help that he had provided by means of these two courageous fellow believers.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:1-44:27:2" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Acts 27:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:27:20-44:27:25" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> 20-25</a>.</p>

For instance, in the port city of Sidon, Julius permitted Paul “to go to his friends and enjoy their care.” And later, in the city of Puteoli, Paul and his companions “found brothers and were urged to remain with them for seven days.” While the Christians in those places cared for the needs of Paul and his companions, Paul no doubt brought great joy to his hosts by sharing upbuilding experiences. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:2-44:15:3" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Acts 15:2, 3</a>.)

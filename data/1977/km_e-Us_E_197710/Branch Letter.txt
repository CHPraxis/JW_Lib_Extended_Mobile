Branch Letter
Dear Kingdom Publishers:
“This is really a fine thing that you are doing! It’s going to help all of us in the medical community to understand your position better.” That was what a professor at a medical school enthusiastically said when a Witness sitting next to him on an airplane outlined the coming campaign using the Blood booklet.
Don’t you agree? What a unique witness will be given as we present the new booklet and brochure to all doctors, hospital administrators, judges, lawyers and nurses. In the United States there are some 370,000 doctors and hospital administrators, 320,000 judges and about 1 million nurses. What a work!
Now the work and excitement are yours. During October you will have a lot to do: Getting lists of the professional people to be visited, finding out which doctors have Witness patients and making arrangements so that no one is missed. Almost all of us can have a share, but one brother will be coordinating your congregation’s effort. So check with him on any questions you have.
By the time you read this, missionaries in foreign fields will have received the Governing Body’s letter giving them detailed information about the arrangements to help them attend an international convention in their home country next year. Your generous contributions each month for the purpose of making this possible are greatly appreciated. As additional contributions continue to be received, we feel confident that the 1978 Assembly Fund will be able to cover the travel expenses in behalf of those who are to be assisted in this loving way.
Your fellow servants,
BROOKLYN BRANCH OFFICE

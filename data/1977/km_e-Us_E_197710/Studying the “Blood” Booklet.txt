Studying the “Blood” Booklet
How fine it is that before our important November campaign with the Blood booklet we will cover it in the congregation book studies! The nature of the material will mean that all of us, and especially the conductors, will need to put extra effort into our preparation. But just how will we study the booklet since it has no questions at the bottom of the pages?
We will use the subheadings (as on p. 4) and bold-faced questions in italics (as on p. 5), which focus attention on the key thoughts that we want to fix in our minds. For example, after having read from the subheading on page four to the end of page six, the conductor could ask the italicized question on page five. Next, read from the top of page seven to the middle of page nine and then ask the question at the top of page seven.
Where there are no italicized questions between subheadings, the conductor can pose a question that will bring out the main point. For instance, after the reading from the subheading on page 40 to the next subheading, he might ask: ‘How could we show someone that each person’s blood is complex and unique to him?”
Both in our preparation at home and at the study itself we should try to isolate the main elements or facts. There is no need to mention every detail. But if we grasp the basic thrust of the arguments, we can later use these in the field service.
In view of the amount of pages to be read during the second and third studies, it may be necessary to extend the meeting by fifteen minutes or so. This is for these two weeks only.

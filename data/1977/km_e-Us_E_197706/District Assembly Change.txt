District Assembly Change
Due to loss of the facilities, the two Cherry Hill, N.J., district assemblies shown in the May 1 Watchtower have been canceled and are replaced by one convention at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on July 21-24, 1977. Therefore, the circuits that were to attend Cherry Hill as listed in the chart in the May Our Kingdom Service insert are shown below along with the necessary information so arrangements can be made to attend at Philadelphia instead.
July 21-24: N.J. 3, 4, 6, 7-B; Pa. 1, 4, 1⁄2 11, 13.
Place: Veterans Stadium, S. Broad & Pattison Ave., Philadelphia, Pa.
Rooming address: Watchtower Convention, c/o Jehovah’s Witnesses Assembly Hall, P. O. Box 338, Buckingham, Pa. 18912.

Question Box
● What is the proper view of commercial activities within the congregation?
When we have clearly in mind the purpose of our meetings and association with our brothers, this question is not difficult to answer. We attend meetings and associate with our brothers to be encouraged spiritually. (Heb. 10:23-25) Therefore, it would be inappropriate to introduce anything, including commercial activities, that would detract from the Scriptural reasons for coming together.
Some have expressed concern because, in some cases, advertising has been sent to them individually or to the Kingdom Hall by persons requesting that material advertising such things as group travel to other cities or countries be read to the congregation, circulated among the brothers or posted on the information board. In other instances brochures and letters are received concerning chain letters, employment opportunities, secular training programs, merchandise, and so forth, which have nothing to do with the advancement of Kingdom interests. We will avoid raising needless questions in the minds of others if we keep commercial endeavors separate from activity at our meetings for worship.—1 Cor. 10:23, 24, 31-33; Phil. 1:9, 10.
So it is best not to exploit theocratic associations by either initiating or advertising the sale of any goods or services for commercial advantage in the Kingdom Hall, at congregation book studies and at assemblies of Jehovah’s people. This will aid us to give spiritual interests the full attention they deserve and to keep commercial activity in its proper place.

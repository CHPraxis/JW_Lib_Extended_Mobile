<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">ON THE afternoon of July 15, 1976, Jehovah’s Witnesses were attending a special program for young people at their “Sacred Service” District Assembly in Oakland, California. At that very time a busload of twenty-six summer-school students and their driver were kidnapped in one of the most bizarre cases to come to public attention in years.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Two of the children attending the assembly would have been on that bus if they had not taken off from school to attend the assembly. The boys’ father said: “I’m sure grateful we were at the assembly. Being where you are supposed to be is the right thing.”</p>

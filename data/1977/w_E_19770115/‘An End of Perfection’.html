<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The psalmist declared: “To all perfection I have seen an end. Your commandment is very broad.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:96-19:119:96" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 119:96</a>) Whatever may be perfect from a human standpoint still has its limitations. The commandment of Jehovah, however, does not have such limits but provides sound guidance for all aspects of life. <em>The Jerusalem Bible </em>renders the words of the psalmist as follows: “I have noticed limitations to all perfection, but your commandment has no limits at all.”</p>

“Being Where You Are Supposed to Be”
ON THE afternoon of July 15, 1976, Jehovah’s Witnesses were attending a special program for young people at their “Sacred Service” District Assembly in Oakland, California. At that very time a busload of twenty-six summer-school students and their driver were kidnapped in one of the most bizarre cases to come to public attention in years.
Two of the children attending the assembly would have been on that bus if they had not taken off from school to attend the assembly. The boys’ father said: “I’m sure grateful we were at the assembly. Being where you are supposed to be is the right thing.”

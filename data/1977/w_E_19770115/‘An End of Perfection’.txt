‘An End of Perfection’
The psalmist declared: “To all perfection I have seen an end. Your commandment is very broad.” (Ps. 119:96) Whatever may be perfect from a human standpoint still has its limitations. The commandment of Jehovah, however, does not have such limits but provides sound guidance for all aspects of life. The Jerusalem Bible renders the words of the psalmist as follows: “I have noticed limitations to all perfection, but your commandment has no limits at all.”

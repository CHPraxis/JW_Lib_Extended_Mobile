A Long Way?
Eye cosmetics are not new. Queen Jezebel of ancient Israel “proceeded to paint her eyes with black paint” when about to encounter Jehu. (2 Ki. 9:30) At least some women of Israel used eye paint, as did those of other Middle Eastern lands. (Jer. 4:30; Ezek. 23:40) While Bible references do not mention eye painting in connection with faithful women of Israel in general, one of Job’s daughters was named Keren-happuch, meaning “horn of antimony” or “horn of eye paint.”​—Job 42:14.
Referring to the use of preservatives in eye cosmetics, Susan Seliger writes in The National Observer: “Even the ancient Egyptians recognized the value of preservatives. They are said to have used for eye make-up two blue-green copper materials that have an antibiotic effect.” She then quips: “Who says we’ve come a long way, baby?”

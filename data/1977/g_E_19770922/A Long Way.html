<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Eye cosmetics are not new. Queen Jezebel of ancient Israel “proceeded to paint her eyes with black paint” when about to encounter Jehu. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:9:30-12:9:30" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Ki. 9:30</a>) At least some women of Israel used eye paint, as did those of other Middle Eastern lands. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:4:30-24:4:30" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jer. 4:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:23:40-26:23:40" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Ezek. 23:40</a>) While Bible references do not mention eye painting in connection with faithful women of Israel in general, one of Job’s daughters was named Keren-happuch, meaning “horn of antimony” or “horn of eye paint.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:42:14-18:42:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 42:14</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Referring to the use of preservatives in eye cosmetics, Susan Seliger writes in <em>The National Observer: </em>“Even the ancient Egyptians recognized the value of preservatives. They are said to have used for eye make-up two blue-green copper materials that have an antibiotic effect.” She then quips: “Who says we’ve come a long way, baby?”</p>

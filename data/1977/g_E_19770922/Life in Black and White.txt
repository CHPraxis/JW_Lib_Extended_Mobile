Life in Black and White
‚óè When we look across the room at our pet dog or cat, it is only natural to think that they see the room as we do. But studies on the vision of mammals argue otherwise. Most mammals do not see colors at all. What they do often see very clearly is the difference in the intensity of the blacks, whites and grays. Because they can differentiate so well between these shades we assume they recognize the difference in color!

Appreciating Those Who Practice Their Faith
A MAGAZINE reporter in Korea met one of Jehovah’s Witnesses who told him of the paradise hope, and of people not getting sick or dying. He thought, “This man does not appear to be abnormal, but how can intelligent people believe such things?” He determined to write a magazine article to expose the way simple people are taken by religion. To this end, he started to attend meetings and to study with the Witnesses. He also looked into how the Witnesses practiced their beliefs and was amazed to learn that they really did! He quickly appreciated that they were zealous in living their faith and in showing love to one another. Now he began to study in earnest. He finished his study in the book The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life in twenty-three days. Then he wrote his last magazine article. It was about the Creator, Jehovah, and his wonderful purpose for mankind. Within one month he had stopped smoking and also resigned from the magazine staff. From the second month he began to proclaim God’s kingdom from door to door with the Witnesses, and from the third month he was devoting a hundred and more hours a month to this. Very soon he was baptized, and he continues to devote his full time to God’s service, conducting ten home Bible studies of his own with interested people. He himself now rejoices in having a living faith.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Imagine a crab that stands three feet (1 meter) high! Yes, such a creature exists, and its outstretched claws would extend over nine feet (3 meters). It is the Japanese spider crab, the largest known crab. This creature lives only around Japan at sea depths between 800 and 2,000 feet (240 to 600 meters). This was one of many live aquatic animals on display and seen by visitors to the International Ocean Exposition, Expo ’75, in Okinawa.</p>

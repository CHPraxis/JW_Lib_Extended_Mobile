Whom Can You Trust?
Butcher? lawyer? politician? clergyman? Dishonesty has penetrated every walk of life. Certainly we need a voice we can trust.
The Watchtower and Awake! are such voices. You can trust them. Why? Because these magazines are pledged to uphold the righteous standards of the Bible. They have no commercial advertisers to please. Read them regularly. Send only $3 (U.S.) and you will receive both magazines (four copies a month) for one year.
Please send a year’s subscription for The Watchtower and Awake!; I enclose $3 (U.S.). For mailing this coupon I am to receive the following six free booklets; A Secure Future​—How You Can Find It, There Is Much More to Life!, Is There a God Who Cares?, “This Good News of the Kingdom,” “Look! I am Making All Things New” and One World, One Government, Under God’s Sovereignty.

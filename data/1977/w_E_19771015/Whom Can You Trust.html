<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">Butcher? lawyer? politician? clergyman? Dishonesty has penetrated every walk of life. Certainly we need a voice we can trust.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><strong>The Watchtower </strong>and <strong>Awake! </strong>are such voices. You can trust them. Why? Because these magazines are pledged to uphold the righteous standards of the Bible. They have no commercial advertisers to please. Read them regularly. Send only $3 (U.S.) and you will receive both magazines (four copies a month) for one year.</p>

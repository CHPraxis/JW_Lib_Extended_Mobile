Why Does God Allow This?
There is a satisfying answer. Read the chapter “Why Has God Allowed Suffering on Earth?” in the book Life Does Have a Purpose. A copy, along with the helpful reference book “Make Sure of All Things; Hold Fast to What Is Fine,” will be sent, postpaid, for just $1 (U.S.).
Please send me the two hardbound books Life Does Have a Purpose and “Make Sure of All Things; Hold Fast to What Is Fine,” as well as the gift booklet Is There a God Who Cares? I enclose $1 (U.S.).

Blood Transfusions​—How Dangerous?
Is it medically unreasonable to refuse blood? Is refusing blood a form of suicide? What does the Bible say about blood transfusions?
Since blood transfusions are so common, we should all be informed about their use. The new 64-page booklet Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Question of Blood provides information that most people are unaware of. A copy will be sent, postpaid, for only 5 cents (U.S.).
Please send the booklet Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Question of Blood. I enclose 5c (U.S.).

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Is it medically unreasonable to refuse blood? Is refusing blood a form of suicide? What does the Bible say about blood transfusions?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Since blood transfusions are so common, we should all be informed about their use. The new 64-page booklet <strong>Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Question of Blood </strong>provides information that most people are unaware of. A copy will be sent, postpaid, for only 5 cents (U.S.).</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Please send the booklet <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Question of Blood. </em>I enclose 5c (U.S.).</p>

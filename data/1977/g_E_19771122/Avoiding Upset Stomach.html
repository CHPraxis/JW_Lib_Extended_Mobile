<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WE HAVE all experienced an upset stomach from time to time, and often we have a strong suspicion as to the cause​—that third helping that we took, that spicy dish of Aunt Sarah’s, or that “quick” lunch we gulped down. Doctors agree that these can all be causes of upset stomach, and they add others, such as with a high fat content, tension, some medications, smoking and even wearing garments that fit too tightly around the waist.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">While it is often a matter of what you eat, sometimes it is a matter of <em>how </em>you eat. When you gulp down food that is not thoroughly chewed, the stomach secretes more acid to aid in digesting it. This acid, along with excessive air that you “pump” into the stomach when hastily swallowing, can irritate the stomach lining. Obviously to avoid upset from this cause, you need to chew your food thoroughly.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Other ways to avoid stomach upset are to resist the temptation for “extra” helpings that will overload the stomach. Such seasonings as pepper, onion, garlic and chili are best used in moderation. Then, too, it is good to listen to your stomach​—learn from the “messages” it sends. If you note that each time you eat a certain dish your stomach is upset, either eliminate it altogether or make some changes in the way that it is prepared. Also, try to relax and put away the cares of the day when eating. Your stomach will appreciate it.</p>

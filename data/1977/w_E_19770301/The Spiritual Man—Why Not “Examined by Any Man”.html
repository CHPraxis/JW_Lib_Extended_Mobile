<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◇ The apostle Paul wrote to Christians at Corinth: “The spiritual man examines indeed all things, but he himself is not examined by any man.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:15-46:2:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 2:15</a>) How is this so? With the help of God’s spirit, the spiritual man can properly evaluate matters. He himself, however, cannot be examined or rightly appraised by those who have no spiritual insight. Proceeding on the wrong basis, unspiritual persons will come up with wrong conclusions about him. They did this in the case of Christ Jesus, as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:3-23:53:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 53:3, 4</a> foretold. Hence, the spiritual man simply cannot be “examined by any man,” that is, any unspiritual man.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">AFTER more than 60 years of faithful service, the apostle John could write: “The victory that defeats the world is our faith.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:4-62:5:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 John 5:4</a>, <em>New English Bible</em>) Today, we are more than 60 years into the “conclusion of the system of things,” and we rejoice that there are still with us some of the generation of 1914 who, like the apostle John, are living examples of faithful endurance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 24:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:34-40:24:34" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 34</a>) Also, throughout the earth, there are now more than two million other servants of God who are exhibiting ‘the tested quality of their faith’ as they eagerly wait for Jesus to reveal himself at the “great tribulation.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:7-60:1:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:1:6-53:1:8" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2 Thess. 1:6-8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Rev. 7:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:14-66:7:14" data-bid="3-4" class="b"> 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Starting in the late spring of 1978, the “Victorious Faith” International Conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses will provide a testimony to the entire world that there is one people that is displaying invincible faith in these turbulent “last days.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1</a>) Some may have asked, What purpose do these very large assemblies serve? Why are they needed? Is the self-sacrifice required on the part of many of the conventioners worth it? Well, let us look back on some of these assemblies.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Were you among the 253,922 in attendance at the Divine Will International Assembly in New York city, August 3, 1958? What a grand climax that was to eight days of spiritual feasting! And how thrilling it was to be a part of that throng, so united in doing the divine will! Though there were hardships in traveling there, and in attending, these paled into insignificance alongside the spiritual blessings received. It is these blessings that everyone remembers, along with the joy of being part of God’s assembled people.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:22-20:10:22" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Prov. 10:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Think, too, of the extensive witness given by large worldwide assemblies. The international conventions of 1963, 1969 and 1973 were testimony ‘around the world’ to the faith and zeal of Jehovah’s Witnesses. The love, cleanliness and zeal of God’s people were widely commented on and prejudices were broken down. Our brothers in many foreign lands still recall those conventions with joy​—for they were grand occasions for the black, the yellow and the white to mix happily in that marvelous unity that is to be found only among Jehovah’s true people. A foretaste indeed of the paradise earth!</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">By planning and preparing from now on to share in all five days of at least one of the “Victorious Faith” International Conventions, you will assure yourself of a rich blessing. No doubt Joseph and Mary in Bible times had to plan well ahead to take their family of seven or more children the long distance up to Jerusalem for the annual festivals. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:55-40:13:56" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 13:55, 56;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:2:41-42:2:43" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Luke 2:41-43</a>) They likely had to make it on foot. Tiring, but rewarding! And they provide a fine pattern for all families that appreciate spiritual things today. True, there may be obstacles, but did not Jesus say: “If you have faith the size of a mustard grain . . . nothing will be impossible for you”? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:17:20-40:17:20" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 17:20</a>) “May Jehovah reward the way you act” in preparing to share with his people earth wide in the “Victorious Faith” International Conventions.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:2:12-8:2:12" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ruth 2:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>1978 INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS UNITED STATES AND CANADA</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">To assist conventioners in making plans to attend one of the 25 international assemblies scheduled for the Continental United States and Canada, the following chart sets out the assembly cities and nearby circuits. To the extent possible, it is recommended that the brothers in America attend the convention shown for their circuit unless vacation plans or other circumstances make it necessary to attend elsewhere. In some cases the size of the crowd needs to be balanced with the seating facilities available and so some congregations in those circuits marked with an asterisk (*), although closer to another convention city, are requested, if possible, to attend the convention indicated so that there will be plenty of room. Where the chart indicates that <span id="page735" class="pageNum" data-no="735" data-before-text="735"></span>a portion of a circuit should attend a particular assembly, such as <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2 </sub>or <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>, and so forth, it simply means that those living in the part of the circuit closest to that convention would attend where indicated, but the rest of the circuit would attend another assembly close to them, as shown elsewhere on the list. In Los Angeles and New Orleans, where two conventions are scheduled on different weeks for each city, we are recommending that the brothers in the circuits listed in the chart attend during the particular week indicated, to the extent possible, to assure adequate seating for everyone. Additional details regarding rooming headquarters addresses, and so forth, will be provided later.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Most of the listed dates and places for conventions in the United States and Canada are tentative, but these are the locations we are endeavoring to secure. Please note also that since the list of international conventions printed in the September 1, 1977, <em>Watchtower </em>the assemblies in San Diego, Calif., and E. Rutherford, N.J., have been canceled. Both Milwaukee, Wis., conventions have been combined into one on June 14-18. Also, the following convention dates have been changed: Cincinnati, Ohio, to July 19-23; New York Metropolitan Area [Elmont, N.Y.] (Spanish only) to August 9-13.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Note to the Body of Elders in each congregation: Please determine immediately from the chart below which assembly it is suggested that your congregation attend and announce to the congregation several times the city and dates so that all will know what the Society has recommended.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A SCHOOLTEACHER in Ecuador has conducted a regular Bible study with over 200 students in her school. Before the school term, she explained to all the parents what she had in mind and asked if there were any objections. There were none​—in fact, some said that they were happy to see their children being taught good morals and habits. The school covers grades two through six, so children from the second to the fourth grade were given the textbook “Listening to the Great Teacher,” while grades five and six received the more advanced “Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It.” The studies are held in groups, as in regular class sessions, but the sessions are opened and closed with prayer, as in a home Bible study.</p>

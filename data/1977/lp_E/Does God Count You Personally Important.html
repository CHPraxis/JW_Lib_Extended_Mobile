<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb">HOW does God view humankind? As just a mass of persons, or as individuals? Or does he bestow his favor upon a selected and certain group and ignore the rest?</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Because of Jesus’ ransom sacrifice, he is mankind’s “repurchaser.” Jehovah God, by reason of his Creatorship, owns the human race.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>God’s dealings, particularly his use of Jesus Christ, reveal that he wants all people to come into a position that will enable them to receive his blessing. This includes wrongdoers as individuals. The apostle Paul wrote to those who were practicing wrong things: “Do you despise the riches of his kindness and forbearance and long-suffering, because you do not know that the kindly quality of God is trying to lead you to <span id="page111" class="pageNum" data-no="111" data-before-text="111"></span>repentance? . . . And he will render to <em>each one </em>according to his works.” Also, the apostle Peter called attention to the individualness of God’s dealings when he referred to Him as “the Father who judges impartially according to <em>each one’s work.”​</em>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:2:4-45:2:6" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Romans 2:4-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:17-60:1:17" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 1:17</a>.</p>

There’s no hope for me.’ It is a serious mistake to think that way. Of course, no one is worthy, on his own merit, of any consideration from God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:6-45:5:10" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Romans 5:6-10</a>) If perfection were required, everyone would be eliminated. But through his kindness, God has recorded examples to show that he will not reject any repentant person, regardless of his past bad works. He requires only that the person be willing to learn what to do and make sincere effort to come into harmony with Him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:1:18-23:1:18" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Isaiah 1:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:17-66:22:17" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Revelation 22:17</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>The apostle Paul was such an example. He was formerly involved in the actual <em>murder </em>of Christians. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:58-44:7:59" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Acts 7:58, 59;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:1-44:9:2" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 9:1, 2</a>) Paul himself says: “Faithful and deserving of full acceptance is the saying that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. <em>Of these I am foremost. </em>Nevertheless, the reason why I was shown mercy was that by means of me as the foremost case <span id="page112" class="pageNum" data-no="112" data-before-text="112"></span>Christ Jesus might demonstrate all his long-suffering for a sample of those who are going to rest their faith on him for everlasting life.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:15-54:1:16" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 Timothy 1:15, 16</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>King Manasseh of Judah was another example of a very bad man.

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>What a person is doing <em>now </em>and in the future, not what he or she has done in the past, is what counts with God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:33:14-26:33:16" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Ezekiel 33:14-16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:5-51:3:8" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> Colossians 3:5-8</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:10-45:3:10" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Romans 3:10</a>) He would thereby be denying the fact that he is a sinner. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:1:8-62:1:10" data-bid="24-1" class="b">1 John 1:8-10</a>) Such a misled individual is rejecting Christ’s sacrifice as unnecessary.

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Nor does God favor only a certain class of people.

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Jehovah is always willing to grant his help and his love to anyone who will receive it. And the intensity and constancy of his love are far greater than we are able to express toward others. Note God’s love for Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, who were imperfect men but who served him wholeheartedly. <em>Centuries later </em>Moses told the nation of Israel: “To your forefathers did Jehovah get <em>attached </em>so as to love them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:15-5:10:15" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 10:15</a>) He put up with the nation’s stubbornness for centuries because of this love.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:7:7-5:7:8" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 7:7, 8</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Jehovah’s love is just as great and lasting for those who serve him today. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:38-45:8:39" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Romans 8:38, 39</a>) He is, so to speak, watching for an opportunity to “get attached” to anyone who calls on him in sincerity and truth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:8-59:4:8" data-bid="31-1" class="b">James 4:8</a>) “As regards Jehovah,” says the Bible, “his eyes are roving about through all the earth to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:16:9-14:16:9" data-bid="32-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>) “His ears are toward their supplication.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:12-60:3:12" data-bid="33-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>As Jehovah views the earth and sees the many distresses that men undergo, he has a deep feeling for humankind. His desire is to help them. <span id="page114" class="pageNum" data-no="114" data-before-text="114"></span>Though he does not ‘turn a blind eye’ to wrongdoing, he is not looking for people’s faults, but for their good points. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:130:3-19:130:3" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Psalm 130:3</a>) He ‘remembers that they are dust.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:103:14-19:103:14" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Psalm 103:14</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup>When on earth, God’s Son was anxious to use his power to help people. When a leper said to him: “If you just want to, you can make me clean,” Jesus “was moved with pity, and he stretched out his hand and touched him, and said to him: <em>‘I want to. </em>Be made clean,’” and so he cured him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:40-41:1:41" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Mark 1:40, 41</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>Jesus’ healing of people who came to him for help was accompanied by deep feeling. In the same way God and his Son are at this time showing concern and love to anyone who has paused in the affairs of everyday life to give consideration to the good news about God’s purpose.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>18 </sup>This statement is true because God sees some goodness of heart in anyone sincerely inquiring into his Word.

That quality is <em>appreciation. </em>You no doubt have and express appreciation for good things that others do for you. But the appreciation that humans feel is far less deep and heartfelt than God’s appreciation of those who show faith in him and who have respect for his Word. He <em>rejoices </em>in them. Jesus even spoke about joy in heaven over one sinner that repents or forsakes wrong things in order to please God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:15:10-42:15:10" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Luke 15:10</a>) Why, Jesus said that a person giving just a cup of cold water to one whom he recognized to be a servant of God would by no means fail to be rewarded. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:42-40:10:42" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Matthew 10:42</a>) God observes and appreciates each one who respects his name and treats his people kindly.

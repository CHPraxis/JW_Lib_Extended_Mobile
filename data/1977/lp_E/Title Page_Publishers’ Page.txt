Life Does Have a Purpose
‘God is not far off from each one of us,’ said one of his ancient servants. The aim of this book is to show that God can be readily approached, and that he desires all men to come to a knowledge of his simple requirements for a life of purpose now and to endless time. From the Scriptures and his dealings with humankind his marvelous personality and good purpose toward us are revealed.

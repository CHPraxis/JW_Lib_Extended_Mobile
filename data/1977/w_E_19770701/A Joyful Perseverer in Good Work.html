<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">ON April 24, 1977, a ‘joyful perseverer in good work,’ Charles J. Fekel, completed his earthly course at the age of eighty years. He was born on March 7, 1897, in Bohemia, a part of Austria-Hungary. With other members of his family he emigrated to the United States in 1905. His religious training included both Roman Catholic and Lutheran teachings. However, when he heard Charles Taze Russell speak on the subject of “To Hell and Back” he knew that he had found the truth of the Bible. In 1916 he was baptized and the following year he entered the colporteur (pioneer) work, which was cut short due to his being arrested as a result of the war hysteria. After the war he had just begun full-time witnessing again when he was invited to serve at the Brooklyn Bethel, the Watch Tower Society’s headquarters printing plant, February 14, 1921.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">For more than fifty years he joyfully persevered in the good work of overseer of the factory composition department and was known for his kind, even-tempered disposition. He became a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses in November 1974. He also served on the Personnel Committee and kept active until just a few days before his death. A memorial service for him was held May 2, 1977. We have every confidence that to him, as a faithful member of the anointed “remnant,” also apply the words, ‘sown in dishonor and weakness but raised in glory and power,’ and that ‘the things he did go right with him.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:43-46:15:43" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:43;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:13-66:14:13" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Rev. 14:13</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Are the service meetings in your congregation interesting and instructive? If your answer is something less than a vigorous, Yes, there are definite things that all can do to improve them. None of us want to be like the youth who complained that life at home was boring and yet did nothing about it himself. (<a class="xt" data-xtid="8" href="jwpub://p/E:1101976079/1-16:190"><em>Youth </em>book, pp. 67-70</a>) But what can we individually do?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Much depends on what is done before we arrive at the meeting, whether we are to speak from the platform or not. If we read over in advance the outline of the week’s meeting in <em>Our Kingdom Service </em>and the articles to be considered, we will get much more from the instruction given. If there is a part calling for audience participation, then we should view this as a personal assignment to share in the meeting. By looking up the cited scriptures and thinking about their meaning, we will be ready to apply them in making “public declaration” of our hope.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:23-58:10:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 10:23, 24</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>What can you do if you are asked to share in a part on the platform? (And this really applies to almost everyone—sisters, young folks, families—doesn’t it?) First, have in mind that there is nothing comparable to effective preparation and rehearsal. Be thinking about the part well in advance. What is the purpose of this part on the meeting? Analyze how the instruction can best be presented, following the guidelines given in <em>Our Kingdom Service.</em></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>If a part calls for “questions and answers,” be a good teacher as chairman and prepare well-thought-out questions. If you do all the talking, then you may find that you minimize your teaching. Have a very brief introduction and conclusion for these parts. Do not get bogged down so that some of the key points have to be skimmed over or skipped because you are running out of time. Where there is ample material in the article, make these points clear rather than bringing in much outside material. If you keep the discussion moving, this helps to keep it alive.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Instruction should be practical. Adapt the material to your congregation’s territory. How can the presentations be effectively adapted to responses and objections actually encountered at the doors? It may be good to ask experienced publishers how they would present the offer. Discuss different approaches, explaining why some work, while others are less effective. Obviously, demonstrations must be realistic to be effective. (Have you seen some and said, “But it just doesn’t happen that way in the field”?) Demonstrations should instruct, not entertain. They should be rehearsed well, proper instructions also being given on the use of microphones. And don’t forget the importance of staying within your allotted time.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>To arouse anticipation, a brief preview of the upcoming service meeting and the publications that will be used can be given at the close of the book study. Comments on how to prepare for service meetings may also be worked into shepherding calls by the elders.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>During the service meeting keep in mind that its purpose is to build us up spiritually and equip us for the field service. As each part is presented, ask yourself: “How does the material help me to prove to myself ‘the good and acceptable and perfect will of God’?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:2-45:12:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rom. 12:2</a>) “How can I use the suggestions to increase my effectiveness in the preaching work?” Field points such as attention-getting introductions and transitions may be jotted down in our service Bibles.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>As all of us ‘brace up our minds for activity,’ may we do our part to make service meetings interesting, while we also benefit from them fully.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:13-60:1:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:13</a>.</p>

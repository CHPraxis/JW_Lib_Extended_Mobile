<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● Congregation accounts should be audited on September 1, or as soon thereafter as possible, by the presiding overseer or someone appointed by him.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● As announced at the district assemblies this summer, the <em>Blood </em>booklets and brochures <em>should not be ordered </em>from the Society. A consignment of each will be sent to each congregation. However, a supply of the new book, <em>Life Does Have a Purpose, </em>should be ordered as soon as possible after August 15. This will permit the Society, wherever possible, to make a combined shipment. The <em>Blood </em>booklets and brochures should be set aside and not used until November when there will be a special campaign with them. A letter will be sent giving full instructions, and it should be discussed at an elders’ meeting soon in order to prepare well for the November campaign.</p>

Announcements
● Offer for September: Distribution of tract, and Truth book on 25c contribution. As magazines become current during month, they will be placed in connection with tract distribution. Most of the September issues feature articles related to problems of family life. For October: Awake! subscription, with three booklets, for $1.50. For November: Life Does Have a Purpose for 25c.
● Congregation accounts should be audited on September 1, or as soon thereafter as possible, by the presiding overseer or someone appointed by him.
● As announced at the district assemblies this summer, the Blood booklets and brochures should not be ordered from the Society. A consignment of each will be sent to each congregation. However, a supply of the new book, Life Does Have a Purpose, should be ordered as soon as possible after August 15. This will permit the Society, wherever possible, to make a combined shipment. The Blood booklets and brochures should be set aside and not used until November when there will be a special campaign with them. A letter will be sent giving full instructions, and it should be discussed at an elders’ meeting soon in order to prepare well for the November campaign.

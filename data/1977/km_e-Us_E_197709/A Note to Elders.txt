A Note to Elders
✔ At the elders’ meeting early in September arrange to rotate the assignments of oversight. The elders will decide who will serve temporarily as Watchtower study conductor and as school overseer. (The designation of brothers to fill these positions on a permanent basis will be made during the next circuit overseer’s visit.) After new assignments have been made, the elder who served previously in a position should arrange to spend time with the newly assigned brother to train him and to acquaint him with his new responsibilities. Additionally, each one should study the details of his assignment as they are set out in the Organization book.
✔ The present mailing address on file with the Society should be used until the congregation’s secretary is selected during the next visit of your circuit overseer. He has forms to be used in advising the Society of the new mailing address, where there is a change.
✔ The tract work should be well organized before September 1 by the one who has been field overseer during the service year now ending. He should work closely with the new field overseer (after he is designated) in following through on the tract work. Many congregations have found it effective to assign sections of territory to the book study groups, with the study conductors organizing their groups for covering their respective sections with tracts in cooperation with the field overseer. The study conductors can keep him up to date on how the tract work is progressing. Adjustments can then be made during the month to cover the congregation’s territory as thoroughly as possible.

Blessings from Not Retaliating
● Of Jesus the Bible tells us: ‘When he was being reviled, he did not go reviling in return. When he was suffering, he did not go threatening.” (1 Pet. 2:23) Those who imitate Jesus in not retaliating in kind have experienced rich blessings.
This is what happened to a young woman in Nigeria who for the first time shared with Jehovah’s Witnesses in public preaching. Informed that the occupant of one particular house was bitterly opposed, she still wanted to speak to him. What happened?
The householder grabbed a container of palm oil and threw the oil on her. It spattered on her face, clothes and bag. Without saying a word, she began to wipe the oil off her face. A few minutes passed. Observing the young woman’s peaceful attitude, the man felt a little ashamed. He asked her to tell him just why she called at his home. This time he listened.
Not long thereafter a Bible study was started with him. Today he, too, shares in public preaching activity as a baptized witness of Jehovah.
In the same country, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses was offering Bible literature to persons when one who claimed to be a “Christian prophet” approached him. This man grabbed literature from him, tearing it to pieces. The Witness said nothing but bent down and picked up the pieces and then dropped these into his bag. A man who had observed all of this then approached the Witness, saying: “I was in the street watching what our prophet did to you, but without even a single word of abuse from you.” After commending the Witness, he continued: “I am ready to become one of you from today on.” He proved true to his word and is today sharing Bible truth with his neighbors.
Truly, imitating Jesus’ example in not retaliating has a good effect on honest-hearted persons.

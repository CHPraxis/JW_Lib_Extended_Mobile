To Hell and Back​—Has Anyone Ever Made It?
The churches have long taught that the wicked are tormented in a hot hell. But the Bible does not teach that!
The fact is, getting out of the Bible hell is possible. Read about it in the absorbing chapter “Where Are the Dead?” in The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life. This book, along with True Peace and Security​—From What Source?, will be sent postpaid for only 50 cents (U.S.)
Please send the 192-page books The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life and True Peace and Security​—From What Source? as well as the gift booklet Is There a God Who Cares? I enclose 50c (U.S.).

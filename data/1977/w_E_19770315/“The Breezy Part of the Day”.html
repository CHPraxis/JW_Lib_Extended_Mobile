<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◇ It was in “the breezy part [literally, the spirit or wind] of the day” that Jehovah pronounced judgment upon the disobedient Adam and Eve in Eden. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:8-1:3:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 3:8-19</a>) This may well have been during the time before sunset when refreshing cool breezes spring up in the region where the Garden of Eden is thought to have been located. The traditional site is in eastern Turkey, about 140 miles (225 kilometers) southwest of Mount Ararat and a few miles south of Lake Van.</p>

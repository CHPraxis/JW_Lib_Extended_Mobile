<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◇ The Bible reports: “To Eber there were two sons born. The name of the one was Peleg, because in his days the earth was divided.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:10:25-1:10:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 10:25</a>) This division, as far as we can Scripturally determine, referred to Jehovah God’s confusing the language of Babel’s builders and scattering them. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:1-1:11:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 11:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:7-1:11:7" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 7</a>) The name Peleg means “division.” It should be noted, however, that the division occurred, not at his birth, but <em>“in his days.” </em>So if he was named Peleg at birth, his name was prophetic of the great division that took place during his lifetime.</p>

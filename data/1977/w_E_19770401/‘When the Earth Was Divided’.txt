‘When the Earth Was Divided’
◇ The Bible reports: “To Eber there were two sons born. The name of the one was Peleg, because in his days the earth was divided.” (Gen. 10:25) This division, as far as we can Scripturally determine, referred to Jehovah God’s confusing the language of Babel’s builders and scattering them. (Gen. 11:1, 7) The name Peleg means “division.” It should be noted, however, that the division occurred, not at his birth, but “in his days.” So if he was named Peleg at birth, his name was prophetic of the great division that took place during his lifetime.

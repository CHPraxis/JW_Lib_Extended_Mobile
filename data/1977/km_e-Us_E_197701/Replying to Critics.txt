Replying to Critics
Newspaper articles, TV programs and radio programs sometimes have information that is critical of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Before deciding to answer in behalf of Jehovah’s Witnesses, it is wise to remember that usually the best policy is to ignore the critics, following the example of Jesus, who did not go searching out those critical of him and his message in order to debate or argue with them. Moreover, harm can be done if one is not thoroughly prepared to answer or is not experienced in handling controversial questions.
If a situation is such that the elders believe that the position of Jehovah’s Witnesses should be defended in a community, they might first take it up with the Society, giving all the facts and showing why and how they feel the defense should be made. The Society will then offer some counsel as guidance. But experience has shown that it is usually best to do as Jesus counseled regarding the critical Pharisees: “Let them be.” (Matt. 15:14) Like Jesus, let us keep busy preaching the good news of the Kingdom and gathering the sheeplike ones, not letting the carping of the critics disturb us.

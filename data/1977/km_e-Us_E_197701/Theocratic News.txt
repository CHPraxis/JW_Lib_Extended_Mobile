â—† Our records show that, as of the start of 1977, approximately 44,000 elders have attended the Kingdom Ministry School in the United States. They are currently receiving the benefit of practical training from 12 experienced instructors whose varying backgrounds include circuit, district, missionary and Bethel service. On the average, these have been baptized for 35 years and have 28 years of full-time service. The same course is being provided in many other lands under direction of the branches. The elders, as well as the congregations, have surely been strengthened by this fine training.

Branch Letter
Dear Kingdom Publishers:
“Exciting!” was the word we kept hearing from members of the Brooklyn Bethel family. And truly it is hard to describe the thrill and pleasure we all had over what occurred at headquarters during the three weeks of October 18 through November 6.
The Governing Body had arranged for special meetings with the branch coordinators and other representatives of the branches around the earth. In all, 128 brothers attended, and 107 wives accompanied them to work at Bethel during the period.
The meetings were not a school, but more of a gathering of elders to consider Kingdom interests and the worldwide preaching work. It was an excellent opportunity for an interchange of information and encouragement. (Rom. 1:12) In addition to sharing information with these visiting elders, the Governing Body obtained much valuable information from them, such as on the spiritual condition and needs of the brothers in their lands and comments about assemblies, meetings, field service, and so forth.
And how the Bethel family benefited! Many of the visitors had attended Gilead School or spent time at Brooklyn Bethel in years past. So there were many old friends to meet. You can imagine how you would enjoy seeing acquaintances from distant lands each day, being able to converse with them and share experiences at mealtimes and in free evenings.
At each breakfast and lunch-time we were delighted to hear their reports, which were carried to all the six dining rooms and to Watchtower Farms. And following the family Watchtower study each Monday we heard more experiences and firsthand reports from our visitors. Yes, it was thoroughly upbuilding and stimulating.
All too soon the meetings were over. But we are sure that all of God’s people will be benefiting from the results of the meetings.
Your brothers,
BROOKLYN BRANCH OFFICE

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Song 39 Local announcements. Short talk reviewing the importance of handling subscriptions accurately and promptly. January marks the beginning of another <em>Watchtower </em>campaign. To ensure proper handling of subscriptions, all are asked: (1) Submit subscription slips <em>in duplicate, </em>doing so at the first meeting after they are obtained. (2) Congregation should send in all subscriptions <em>each week. </em>Always send the remittance form with the subscription slips. (3) When doing so, mark the envelope MAGAZINES. Addresses must be accurate and complete. For every magazine mailed out that is undeliverable, the Post Office charges the Society 25 cents. At the rate such magazines have been returned in the past, this expense could exceed $45,000 a year. Your cooperation will be much appreciated. Also discuss article “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:201977004/">Replying to Critics</a>.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Discuss article “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:201977001/">Endure in Work That Is Good</a>.” Highlight yeartext. Build up enthusiasm for subscription campaign, including one or two brief demonstrations of presentations.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Using Booklets to Start Studies. The three booklets <em>Is There a God Who Cares?, A Secure Future—How You Can Find It </em>and <em>There Is Much More to Life! </em>will be used again in conjunction with the <em>Watchtower </em>subscription offer, with emphasis on starting studies. We have received suggestions from experienced brothers that you may find helpful: Success in starting studies begins with building up your own desire to help other people. Preparing what you are going to say is also an important factor. An informal approach designed to initiate a friendly conversation usually gets good results. Familiarize yourself with the contents of the booklets, selecting interesting points in the one you want to feature. Here are some ways that have been used to start studies using <em>Is There a God Who Cares?: </em>A sister built her presentation around this introduction: “I have been a Bible reader for many years and have been delighted with the way this booklet has dealt with a question that many people have asked about: ‘Why has God permitted wickedness?’” (Refer to page 18, paragraph 23.) Another asks the question posed in the title, then refers to the Scriptural answer in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:6-60:5:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:6, 7</a> at the end of page 31. Another used just the illustration on pages 6 and 7, showing that man, not God, is responsible for human suffering. All favored use of the Bible with texts marked for handy reference. As time permits, include one or two brief presentations. If local response favors using a different booklet, discuss that instead, offering suggestions for presentation.</p>

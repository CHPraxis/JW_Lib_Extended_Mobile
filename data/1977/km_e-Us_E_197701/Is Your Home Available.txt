Is Your Home Available?
1 Most congregations have found it advantageous to have several book studies conveniently located in different parts of the territory. It has enabled more people to attend regularly, provided a convenient location to meet for service and given us opportunity to get to know and assist one another personally.
2 The elders may feel that it would be advisable to add additional studies or to adjust book study locations. This could be needed if some of the groups have become large or if circumstances change in some homes where studies are being conducted. So, the elders may be interested in knowing about additional homes that are available.
3 It could be that you have never thought about volunteering your home, assuming that there was no particular need. If your home is suitable in every way for accommodating a book study group and your family is agreeable, why not make that known to the elders? There may be an existing need right now or the elders could be planning something for the future. So, your offer might be a real help toward taking definite steps in that direction.
4 All of us should show appreciation for the thoughtfulness of families who volunteer their homes. Christian principles, not to mention good manners, prompt those attending to be lovingly considerate by not going uninvited into other rooms, soiling the carpet or furniture or allowing children to run about unattended inside or outside the home.—Matt. 7:12.
5 Your family may be rewarded in many ways by having a study in your home. Hospitality is a Christian virtue. (Rom. 12:13) Lydia’s strong desire to be hospitable brought her a blessing. (Acts 16:15) Philemon was commended for his kindness, which included having a congregation meet in his home. (Philem. 2, 21) We can make a fine contribution toward the expansion of Jehovah’s organization by showing that we are “ready to share” with others what we have.—1 Tim. 6:17-19.

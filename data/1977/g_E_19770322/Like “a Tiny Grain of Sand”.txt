Like “a Tiny Grain of Sand”
● Although the atom is infinitesimally small, it consists mostly of empty space. Dr. Heinz Haber wrote: “All things around us​—the solid chair you are sitting in, your house, the entire earth—​everything is virtually empty space, with its widely scattered, forlorn nuclei and electrons. If all the empty space could be removed from a human body​—if all its nuclei and electrons could be crowded together into a solid mass—​the body would shrink to the size of a tiny grain of sand that can barely be felt between the tips of our fingers.”​—The Walt Disney Story of Our Friend the Atom.
While such a shrinkage is not within human power, it impresses a person with his littleness in comparison with the Creator. And a Bible reader may be reminded of the fact that to Jehovah God “the nations are as a drop from a bucket; and as the film of dust on the scales they have been accounted.” (Isa. 40:15) Indeed, the nations are of relative insignificance from God’s standpoint. Yet, “as a father shows mercy to his sons, Jehovah has shown mercy to those fearing him. For he himself well knows the formation of us, remembering that we are dust.”​—Ps. 103:13, 14; Gen. 2:7.

Millions Are Going​—Are You?
Going where? To the annual observance of the death of Jesus Christ. In 1976 a worldwide total of 4,972,571 were present for it.
Why do people go? Because of what it means for humankind. It will soon mean relief from sickness, suffering and death. Even dead loved ones will be resurrected to life on an earth restored to paradise.
How could the death of Jesus bring such blessings to humankind?
You are invited to find out. Jehovah’s Witnesses welcome you to join with them in this memorial observance. This year the date is Sunday, April 3, after sunset.

Do You Wish You Could Remember?
Which issue of The Watchtower discussed whether the “last days” that Paul described at 2 Timothy 3:1-7 had a fulfillment in the first century? Where was the article about Hezekiah’s Tunnel?
Do you wish you could remember where to find things that you have read? The Watch Tower Publications Indexes can help. The 1976 Index now is available. It costs 10 cents (U.S.). The 1930-1960, 1966-1970 and 1971-1975 Indexes cost $1 (U.S.) each; the 1961-1965 Index is 50 cents (U.S.).
Please send the following that I have checked and for which I enclose $(U.S.)‐‐‐‐‐‐: 1976 Index (10c) □; 1930-1960 Index ($1) □; 1966-1970 Index ($1) □; 1971-1975 Index ($1) □; 1961-1965 Index (50¢) □.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">MY MATE and I felt that there was something missing in our lives. She wanted to learn more about the Bible and said that we needed to go to church. But my experience with churches was that they just wanted money. Nevertheless, my mate picked out a Pentecostal church and went. When she came home she was frightened; people were running around screaming. All I could say was, “I told you so.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Then she learned of another religious organization’s offer of a Bible study, but for a fee. Later, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses offered her a free home Bible study, which she accepted. Eventually she went to the Kingdom Hall, and when she came back she was really excited about what she had learned. I couldn’t believe it. People just don’t come back from church happy. “And you know,” she exclaimed, “they didn’t even take up a collection!”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">I said all churches pass the plate; you just missed it. So I decided to go the following Sunday just to prove that they did take up a collection. The title of the talk was “The Authenticity of the Bible.” It was so good that I forgot to check for the collection plate. So I had to go back the next week to see. The second week the talk was more interesting than the first, and again I forgot to look for the collection plate. By the end of the meeting the third week I knew that we had found what had been missing in our lives. I, too, accepted a regular home Bible study, and now we rejoice to have learned the truth of God’s Word.​—<em>Contributed.</em></p>

“Like a Winter Torrent”
Because his brothers failed him in his time of need, Job compared their dealings to a “winter torrent.” (Job 6:15) Such a torrent may be of considerable size when swollen by melting ice and snow. But in the summer when there is a real need for water it may dry up, providing no refreshment for man and beast.

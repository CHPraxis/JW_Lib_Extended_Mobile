<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Because his brothers failed him in his time of need, Job compared their dealings to a “winter torrent.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:6:15-18:6:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 6:15</a>) Such a torrent may be of considerable size when swollen by melting ice and snow. But in the summer when there is a real need for water it may dry up, providing no refreshment for man and beast.</p>

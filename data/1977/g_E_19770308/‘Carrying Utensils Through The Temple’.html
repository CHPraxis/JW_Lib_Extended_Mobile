<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● While Jesus Christ was on earth, it apparently was customary for people to make use of the temple area as a shortcut. In connection with his cleaning the temple shortly before Passover of 33 C.E., we read: “He would not let anyone carry a utensil through the temple.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:11:16-41:11:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Mark 11:16</a>) What was the reason for this? Jesus Christ evidently did not want the Israelites to detract from the sanctity of the temple by using the sacred area as a public thoroughfare when carrying items from one part of Jerusalem to another part.</p>

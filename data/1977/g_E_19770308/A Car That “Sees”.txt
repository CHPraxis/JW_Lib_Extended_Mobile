A Car That “Sees”
✔ Visitors to the International Ocean Exposition, Expo ’75, in Okinawa, saw many things of interest. Among them was a Computer-controlled Vehicle System, called simply CVS. Its cars, capable of carrying six passengers, were designed to operate either on a fixed track or on a public highway. Among their technological innovations was the “ability” to “see” another vehicle. The futuristic car would slow down or even stop if something suddenly pulled in front of it. It could also follow another vehicle and govern the distance between cars so as to prevent accidents. The cars on hand for the exposition were completely computer controlled, having no operators.

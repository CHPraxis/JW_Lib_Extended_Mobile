<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sh">Dear Kingdom Publishers:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">During the past few months, in addition to our normal activity, we have been very busy here arranging for all the elders in this country to go through the new Kingdom Ministry School Course.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">During the week of October 4-8, there were 372 circuit and district overseers who attended the first classes of the new Kingdom Ministry School Course and enjoyed it immensely. The course is geared to help elders render better service in shepherding their brothers, in teaching, in providing a helpful lead in the field service, in counseling and judging and in working together well as a body.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">One commented: “The course was far beyond anything I had hoped for.” Another: “How often we were reminded to ‘preach the Word’ in offering counsel and when answering questions.” And another said: “We have been filled with ideas as to what we can do in a positive way to aid our brothers.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">These same brothers also got a brief review of the new Pioneer Service School Course. They were thrilled with the course. Some of their comments were: “It is practical!” “It is a real Bible study.” “It is obvious Jehovah is deeply concerned about the pioneers.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Then, during the week of October 11-15, 662 more brothers, who will have a part in teaching the Kingdom Ministry School Course in their own circuits, went to school to help them get ready to teach. Over 900 brothers will have a share in teaching the course.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Now, during November and the early part of December all the elders in this country have been scheduled to attend the new school course in their own circuits.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">It is apparent that ‘Jehovah the Shepherd and Overseer of our souls’ is continuing to care for his people in a marvelous way.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:25-60:2:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:25</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sj">Your brothers,</p>

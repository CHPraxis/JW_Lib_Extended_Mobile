<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>WEEK STARTING DECEMBER 4</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>10 min: </strong>Song 95. Announcements. Branch Letter.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>“Are You Prepared to Talk on the Bible?” Talk and audience participation on <em>Watchtower </em>article, in issue of November 1, 1977.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>“<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:201977441/">Are You Instructing Your Family?</a>” Cover the material with questions and answers. To be handled by a brother who sets a fine example in assisting his family. Include brief demonstration or two, using topic for conversation or as outlined in paragraph six. Encourage parents to share in the field service with their teenage children as well as younger ones.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Why Do They Auxiliary-Pioneer? Interview brothers and sisters who have served as auxiliary pioneers. Ask: What motivated you? How were you able to be of help to others or how were you helped by others?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Some, asked why they auxiliary-pioneered, answered: ‘Out of love for Jehovah.’ ‘The fact that others were doing it was encouraging; I found it enjoyable to work with others doing the same thing.’ ‘I was encouraged when the elders enrolled as auxiliary pioneers. They were not just talking about it from the platform but were setting an example. If they could do it with their busy schedule, so could I.’ ‘I knew that the more who did it the easier it would be, so I did it, hoping it would encourage someone else.’ ‘I enjoy field service and this meant more service and more joy for me.’</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">One elder said: ‘I could not regular-pioneer but I enjoy field service and so arranged to auxiliary-pioneer. I found it best to do this when school children in the congregation were on vacation. When they learned that an elder was going in the service each day, a number of them arranged to auxiliary-pioneer too. It was stimulating, resulting in starting new studies, and others expressed appreciation for my working with them in this special activity.’</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Encourage all who can do so to auxiliary-pioneer during the holiday period. Encourage parents to share in the work with their children.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:1:1-32:1:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jonah 1:1-3</a>. What assignment of service was Jonah given? (verse 2) (Much like our’s today) Who sent him? (verse 1)</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Ask audience to turn to the map on the front endsheet of the bi12 Bible and locate the city of Joppa. Where was Nineveh? Where was Tarshish? How many times farther would it be to Tarshish than to Nineveh? Do you think it was foolish for Jonah to leave Jehovah’s people and to try to go so far away, without Jehovah’s blessing, to get away from his assignment? Why?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Why would it show a wrong motive to schedule other activities for ourselves in a deliberate effort to avoid having a full share in the work of preaching and disciple-making that Jehovah has given us?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">What happened to Jonah because he tried to get away from the assignment that Jehovah gave him? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:1:4-32:1:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jonah 1:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:1:10-32:1:10" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:1:12-32:1:12" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:1:17-32:1:17" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 17</a>)</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:2:1-32:2:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jonah 2:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:2:9-32:2:10" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 9, 10</a>. What did Jonah do to get help? (verse 1) Did Jehovah hear his prayer? (verse 2) What did Jonah promise Jehovah? (verse 9) According to verse 10, what happened to Jonah? What can we learn from those verses?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:3:1-32:3:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jonah 3:1-4</a>. How big a territory was Nineveh? (verse 3) What was the message that Jonah proclaimed? (verse 4) Do you think it was easy for Jonah to preach that message?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:3:5-32:3:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jonah 3:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:3:8-32:3:8" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:3:10-32:3:10" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 10</a>. Why did Jehovah show mercy to the people of Nineveh? Do you believe that Jehovah will show mercy to people now if they put faith in him and change from their bad ways? How does this emphasize the urgency of the disciple-making work today?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:4:1-32:4:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jonah 4:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:4:3-32:4:4" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 3, 4</a>. What was Jonah’s attitude when Jehovah did not destroy Nineveh at the time that Jonah expected it? Was that the right attitude?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/32:4:11-32:4:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jonah 4:11</a>. How does verse 11 indicate that Jehovah desires people to repent and live? How did Jonah describe Jehovah in verse 2? What should be our attitude over the fact that Jehovah is having the preaching work continue and people are still learning the truth? Invite expressions from one or two publishers who have learned the truth in the past two years and who appreciate Jehovah’s patience in having the preaching continued.</p>

Consider also common holiday greetings and how to handle these.</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sn"><strong>25 min: </strong>A Closer Look at the Jubilee and Its Provisions.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">(2 min.) Chairman: What was the liberty that Jehovah’s people inhabiting the land of Israel were to enjoy on the 50th year, the Jubilee? It was deliverance from indebtedness and from servitude. It was a time for handing back property lost because of economic problems. Also, if an Israelite had fallen into debt and, if in order to pay his debt, he had sold himself or members of his family into servitude, then on the Jubilee (even if the customary six years of servitude had not been completed) he and the members of his family were to be set free, his debt was to be canceled and he was to be given enough provisions to start a free life again. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:25:13-3:25:33" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Lev. 25:13-33,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:25:39-3:25:43" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 39-43,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:25:53-3:25:54" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 53, 54</a>) The Jubilee was a restoration of the condition that Jehovah established for his people when they entered the promised land. Of what value is this information to us today?</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">(23 min.) Discuss with audience:</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">1. What is the symbolic Jubilee? (<em>w </em>8/1/76, page 454)</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">2. What evidences do we see to indicate that our deliverance is near? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:26-42:21:26" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 21:26,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:28-42:21:28" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 28</a>)</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">3. How do the Jubilee and God’s incoming new system of things show that Jehovah is a compassionate God?</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">4. How do they prove that Jehovah recognizes man’s need for land and income? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:21-23:65:21" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isa. 65:21</a>)</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">5. Just as Jehovah promised Israel, what can his people confidently look forward to in the coming new order? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:25:6-23:25:8" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isa. 25:6-8</a>)</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">6. Since debts were canceled during the Jubilee, does this mean that we can go into debt and wait for the “great tribulation” to cancel our debts? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:8-45:13:8" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rom. 13:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:4:7-12:4:7" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 2 Kings 4:7</a>)</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">7. What do the Scriptures encourage us to do for our brothers when they have a need and when we are able to help? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:15-59:2:17" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jas. 2:15-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:25:35-3:25:35" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Lev. 25:35</a>)</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">8. What view should be taken of those who persist in not putting forth the effort to help themselves? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:3:10-53:3:10" data-bid="14-1" class="b">2 Thess. 3:10</a>)</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">9. What does all of this help us to appreciate about our loving heavenly Father? Our responsibilities? And our hope for the future?</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">The entire arrangement of the Jubilee should draw us closer to our heavenly Father and give us confidence in his interest in us. He is proving that he is our God just as he proved to be to the nation of Israel.</p>

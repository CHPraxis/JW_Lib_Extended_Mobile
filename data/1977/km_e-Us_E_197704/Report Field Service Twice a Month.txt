Report Field Service Twice a Month
Congregation publishers sometimes overlook turning in a field service report at the end of the month. It will be practical for them to turn in a report by about the 15th of the month and then another at the end of the month. The regular report slip will be used. Congregation elders should plan to remind all congregation publishers of the need to turn in field service reports at the meeting nearest to the 15th and to the end of the month. Some, by overlooking the turning in of their reports, are now counted as irregular publishers, when in fact they have published the good news each month. If some congregations wish to ask the congregation book study conductors to collect the reports twice a month and turn them over to the field overseer, there is no objection to that arrangement. Do what will be of greatest help to the publishers and the congregation.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">When we are given an expired subscription slip it should be our desire to call on the former subscriber with the aim of furthering his interest in the good news as well as encouraging him to resubscribe. The person may have been the recipient of a gift subscription rather than having subscribed directly. To aid us in adapting our approach in making the return visit on such persons, the letters “GIFT” will now appear along with the address on expiration slips on former gift subscriptions in connection with English subscriptions in the continental United States.</p>

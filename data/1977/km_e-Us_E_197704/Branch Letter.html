<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sh">Dear Kingdom Publishers:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In this “time of the end” it is to be expected that opposition to the Kingdom message and its proclaimers will increase. This is in line with Jesus’ prophecy that “people will lay their hands upon you and persecute you,” and that “you will be objects of hatred by all people because of my name.” All of this, Jesus said, “will turn out to you for a witness.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:12-42:21:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 21:12-19</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In view of Jesus’ words, it is not surprising that the Christian work of Jehovah’s Witnesses is now restricted in more than forty countries. The list continues to grow. In April 1976 it was Benin. Then, in August, Argentina and the Central African Republic followed this course. On December 23 the Southeast Asian country of Indonesia placed a ban on Jehovah’s Witnesses. The Protestant section of the Office of Religion, supported by the clergy in local areas, have long agitated for this. In January 1977 the Congo announced a ban.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Our brothers in all these countries, like those elsewhere, are very courageous in the face of these actions and continue to do everything possible to witness about the Kingdom. It is good to pray for them. Seeing the enemy forces closing in throughout the earth, all of us can take courage from Jesus’ promise: “As these things start to occur, raise yourselves erect and lift your heads up, because your deliverance is getting near.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:28-42:21:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 21:28</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">As recorded in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:1-40:10:42" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew chapter ten</a>, Jesus also gave encouraging counsel to those facing opposition. Whether it comes from family or friends, people in the territory or from official sources, we want to show loyalty to Jehovah and his kingdom and continue faithfully in our privilege of representing Him.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sj">Your brothers,</p>

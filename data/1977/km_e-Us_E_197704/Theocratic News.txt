â—† The first assembly hall in Japan was completed at the end of November and was in use the first weekend of December. On the average about 200 persons shared each day in remodeling this former bowling alley. The willingness and hard work of all the brothers and sisters who helped during the three-month construction period gave a very fine witness. The hall, which has seating for 1,500 and is located on the outskirts of Tokyo, is ideal in size and location.

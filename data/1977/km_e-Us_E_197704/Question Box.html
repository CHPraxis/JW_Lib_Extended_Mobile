<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● Why should parents be concerned with controlling their children’s conduct at the Kingdom Hall and at assemblies, and what should the elders do if parents habitually fail to exercise such control?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The conduct of children directly reflects on the training given by their parents and on how deeply the children’s hearts have been impressed with respect for the laws of Jehovah and man. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:29:15-20:29:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Prov. 29:15</a>) “For everything there is an appointed time,” including running and playing; but that time is not when one is at Christian meetings, whether at the Kingdom Hall or at assemblies.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:1-21:3:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Some youngsters are naturally more energetic and mischievous than others. Understanding the hearts of their children, parents may find that they will have to keep a closer watch on some than on others. If some are not closely watched by their parents and are found to be running around bumping into people, even defacing the Kingdom Hall property, and so forth, then elders or others would do well to speak to the child or to bring the child to one of his parents so that corrective measures may be taken. Parents should welcome this loving assistance so that shame is not brought on them because of the conduct of their children.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In those rare cases where parents habitually fail to exercise control despite the kind counsel of individual elders, then several elders may get together with the family at an appropriate time and place and talk with them about the Scriptural principles involved and the necessity of maintaining proper conduct at home and at the Kingdom Hall.</p>

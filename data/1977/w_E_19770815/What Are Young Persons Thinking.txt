What Are Young Persons Thinking?
OVER half of the earth’s population is under twenty years of age. What generally are the views that young persons hold?
You yourself may be a young person and so feel that you have a good idea regarding the thinking of others who are twenty or younger. Or, you may be older but believe that from your own experience and contacts you know the thinking of the young. But what do you imagine you would find if, in a survey of persons aged eighteen to twenty-four, you asked questions such as: Do you agree or disagree with premarital sex? Is the person on whom you basically must rely, you yourself? Do you think that in thirty years the world will be a better place in which to live?
Just such a survey in various lands was undertaken by the Adolescence Policy Headquarters of the Office of the Prime Minister of Japan. The accompanying five graphs present some of the results. Why not look them over, comparing the results from the different lands, and checking one chart against another.
Some of the results of the survey are of particular interest in view of Bible prophecy. For many years Jehovah’s Witnesses have been calling attention to the fact that the fulfillment of Bible prophecy proves that we are living in the “last days” of this system of things. The Scriptures show that soon Jehovah God will replace the imperfect human system we suffer under with a new order directed by the Creator himself. One Bible passage that outlines some of the evidence of our living in the “last days” is 2 Timothy 3:1-5. But what does that Bible passage have to do with the accompanying charts?
Well, consider the results of this survey in the light of what the Bible foretold would prevail in the “last days.”
Chart 1, for example, may simply confirm your impression that “free sex” is well entrenched in the thinking of this generation. However, there is this conflicting point to consider: In discussing the results of the Japanese survey, Professor Sanshiro Shirakashi says that it was found that “in general, young people throughout the world believe in some type of religion.” (Journal of Church and State, Autumn 1976, p. 523) Interestingly, the largest percentage of those surveyed claimed to believe in the “Christian” religion of the churches of Christendom. Yet the Bible plainly condemns fornication and adultery. So we must conclude that these churches are not leading the young people to uphold Biblical morality.
This leads us back to the prophecy that we mentioned. It foretold that in the “last days” people would be “lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God, having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power.” Is that not what the survey confirms?
There can be little doubt that the current laxness about sex does not reflect any overwhelming concern about others. Note Chart 2. Would you have imagined that so many young persons would reach the conclusion that the person you basically can rely on in life is just yourself? Does that not suggest a widespread lack of trust?
But how do the young view the future? The survey demonstrated that today’s young are searching for something. For example, observe from Chart 3 how many indicated that what they desire out of life is sincerity and love. That might at first suggest that the young are idealistic and optimistic. However, after considering all the information gained in the survey Professor Shirakashi concluded that “the world’s youth have a pessimistic attitude” about the future. Charts 4 and 5 reflect that.
A college student in California named Linda H. was of that frame of mind, and we can learn something from her experience. She relates: “From my studies in college, I could see that the life-style I was raised with was vanishing. Conditions all over the world were worsening, and I had no answers and no idea where to turn for the answers.”
Whether you are a young person yourself, or know of young individuals who also are seeking sensible answers, take note of what occurred in Linda’s case.
While she was home on vacation two of Jehovah’s Witnesses called at her door. She says that the Witnesses “told me that the answers were to be found in the Bible. We discussed the paradise earth that God will establish under his new order, God’s Kingdom government and his promised destruction of the wicked. I had never been taught that such wonderful truths were to be found in the Bible.”
After Linda returned to college in Arizona she contacted the local congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses and happily accepted the offer of a free weekly Bible study. Today her life and outlook are quite different from that of the majority of young persons. She knows what her purpose in life is. She is guiding her life in accord with the counsel that our Creator provides in his Word. And she is finding joy in sharing with others the marvelous hope of living on a paradise earth in the near future.
Jehovah’s Witnesses find that this experience is not unusual. In recent years hundreds of thousands of young persons have taken similar steps and are now themselves enthusiastically urging others to do the same. If you personally are distressed about what you find around you​—the confused actions and attitudes that are so common—​why not contact Jehovah’s Witnesses. They will be pleased to share with you the meaningful message that the Bible actually contains.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The annual meeting of the members of Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania on October 1, 1977, will be held at Jehovah’s Witnesses Assembly Hall, Grantville, Pennsylvania, located approximately ten miles east of Harrisburg, on U.S. Route 22, one quarter mile west of the intersection of State Route 743 and U.S. Route 22. Through the Assembly Hall Committee, the brothers in the Grantville area invited the Society to hold its annual meeting at the Assembly Hall and the invitation has been gladly accepted. The meeting will be at 10:00 o’clock in the forenoon of Saturday, October 1, 1977.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It will be appreciated if the members of the corporation will now see to it that the Secretary’s Office has their present mailing addresses so that the regular letters of notice and proxies can reach them shortly after September 1.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The proxies, which will be sent to the members along with the notice of the annual meeting, are to be returned so as to reach the Office of the Secretary of the Society not later than September 15. As each member knows, he should complete and return his proxy promptly whether he is going to be at the meeting personally or not. The information given on each proxy should be definite on this point as it will be relied on in determining in advance those who will actually be personally present.</p>

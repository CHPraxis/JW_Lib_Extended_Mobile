<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">From ancient times caper berries have been used to stimulate appetite. The Biblical reference at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:5-21:12:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a> to the ‘caper berry’s bursting’ is part of a description of man in old age. This illustration suggests that, when a person’s appetite diminishes with advancing years, even the caper berry fails to awaken his desire for food.</p>

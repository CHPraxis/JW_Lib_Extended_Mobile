“The Caper Berry Bursts”
From ancient times caper berries have been used to stimulate appetite. The Biblical reference at Ecclesiastes 12:5 to the ‘caper berry’s bursting’ is part of a description of man in old age. This illustration suggests that, when a person’s appetite diminishes with advancing years, even the caper berry fails to awaken his desire for food.

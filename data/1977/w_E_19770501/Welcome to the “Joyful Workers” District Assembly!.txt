Welcome to the “Joyful Workers” District Assembly!
“ALWAYS rejoice in the Lord. Once more I will say, Rejoice!” (Phil. 4:4) The apostle Paul had good reason to tell the loving brothers of the congregation at Philippi to rejoice: because of the freedom that the truth brought them, because of the Kingdom hope, and because of the privileges of association and service that went with it. We today have even more reason to rejoice when we consider that we are now living in the spiritual paradise that the apostle Paul got a glimpse of nineteen centuries ago. (2 Cor. 12:2, 4) What a contrast between the lot of Jehovah’s people and those in Babylon the Great!​—Isa. 65:13, 14.
As Christian witnesses of Jehovah, we also rejoice in our privileges of service. We all appreciate that faith without works is dead. Throughout God’s Word, good, honest labor is encouraged, recommended, required and approved. And this applies outstandingly with regard to our spiritual works. Yes, all of us always want to be “having plenty to do in the work of the Lord.” (1 Cor. 15:58) How fitting, therefore, that our 1977 district assemblies should be called the “Joyful Workers” District Assemblies! They will each be four days in length and, Jehovah willing, literally hundreds of them will be held throughout the world​—117 in the United States alone.
As was the case last year, each day will have a theme of its own. The first day’s theme will be “Working What Is Good at Home.” It will present counsel and admonition as to the rearing of children from infancy, and the obligations of youths, of parents and of marriage mates toward each other. In addition to the keynote talk, there will be the Bible drama entitled “God Is Not Far Off from Each One of Us.”
The theme for the second day is “Inciting to Love and Fine Works.” Among other things to be stressed are matters of upright, loving conduct, and elders’ obligations and privileges. The baptism will take place on this day, the talk preceding it being entitled “Our Choice to Work with Jehovah.” Also, a sound drama will be presented, entitled “Jehovah’s Name to Be Declared in All the Earth.”
The theme for Saturday will be “Exerting Ourselves in the Field.” Various aspects and features of our witnessing will be stressed in the talks, as well as in the drama “Are You Whole-souled in Service to God?”
Sunday’s theme is “Loyal Workers Inherit the Promises.” The public talk, “How God’s Kingdom Can Benefit You,” will be one of special interest to the public and newly interested ones. Then the talk “Forward with the ‘Greater Works’!” will bring the assembly to a close.
The feature “Things We Learned Yesterday” was so well received last year that it will begin each day’s program after the first day and more time will be allowed for it. All will get far more benefit from the Bible dramas if they read ahead of time Scriptural records on which they are based. For the first drama, read 2 Kings 18:1 to 20:11 and Isaiah chapters 36 to 38. For the second, read Exodus chapters 5 through 15. And for the third, read the book of Malachi.
King David said: “I rejoiced when they were saying to me: ‘To the house of Jehovah let us go.’” (Ps. 122:1) Surely all of us feel that way in a very special sense about our going to one, if not more than one, of our “Joyful Workers” District Assemblies.

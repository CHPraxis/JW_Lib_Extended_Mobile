“In the Valley of Deep Shadow”
The psalmist David declared: “Even though I walk in the valley of deep shadow, I fear nothing bad.” (Ps. 23:4) As a shepherd boy David had become well familiar with the perils that face sheep. Wild beasts might be lurking in a dark valley or ravine. Or there might be bandits lying in wait. There might also be a number of deep pits. Without the attention and care of a shepherd, a sheep would, therefore, be in grave danger. Similarly, David came into dangerous situations. But because of his trust in Jehovah, the Great Shepherd, David felt secure.

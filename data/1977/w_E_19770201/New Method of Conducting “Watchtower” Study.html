<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Elders who preside at the weekly <em>Watchtower </em>study, as well as those who conduct the congregation book studies, are anxious to teach in the most effective and helpful way. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:8-45:12:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 12:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:2-55:4:2" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 2 Tim. 4:2</a>) Moreover, all in the congregation desire to make the most of opportunities for taking in spiritual nourishment so that they may attain to “accurate knowledge and full discernment” of the truth.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:9-50:1:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Phil. 1:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">With this in mind, we recommend to all congregations the following order of study: (1) Read the paragraph in <em>The Watchtower </em>(or other publication); (2) Read the question thereon; (3) Call on those raising their hands for answers, discussing fully the paragraph and supporting scriptures.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">There should be a number of advantages in reading the paragraphs before they are discussed. This will quickly refresh the minds of all who have studied over the lesson in advance, and in the event some have not been able to do this previous to the meeting, the reading will at least familiarize them with the material before it is discussed. Everyone will be encouraged to concentrate on the reading, rather than look ahead for the answer in the next paragraph. Those who are shy, or who are slow in organizing their thoughts, will be able to prepare better to put their words together and so gain confidence to raise their hands. There should be freer participation and fuller discussion of the finer details of the study, with emphasis on the application of key scriptures before passing on to the reading of the next paragraph.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">This new arrangement should be a blessing to all of God’s people, as they seek to “be filled with the accurate knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual comprehension, in order to walk worthily of Jehovah.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:9-51:1:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Col. 1:9, 10</a>.</p>

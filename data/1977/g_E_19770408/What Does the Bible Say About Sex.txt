What Does the Bible Say About Sex?
There is a way to find out. The answer can benefit you.
The new book Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It frankly considers modern sexual attitudes in its chapter “Does Sexual Morality Make Sense?” It raises the question, ‘Does sex prior to marriage help make life worth living?’ You will find the discussion helpful and thought-provoking.
Also read the chapter “Can You Succeed in Marriage?” Here you will learn the key to a successful marriage, including a satisfying sexual relationship.

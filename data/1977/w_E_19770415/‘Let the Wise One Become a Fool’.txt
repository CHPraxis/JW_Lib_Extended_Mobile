‘Let the Wise One Become a Fool’
■ How would you react to anyone’s encouraging a wise person to become foolish? Likely you would consider this to be very poor advice. There is a time, however, when it is the best of advice. The apostle Paul wrote to the Christians at Corinth: “If anyone among you thinks he is wise in this system of things, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.” (1 Cor. 3:18) A person might be wise from a human standpoint, having certain skills, shrewdness or philosophic learning. But to be an approved servant of Jehovah God, he must center his life around true worship. His faith, backed by Christian works, makes him appear as a fool in the eyes of the world. However, his becoming a fool in this sense makes him wise, for this leads to rich spiritual rewards now and holds promise of everlasting life in God’s new order.

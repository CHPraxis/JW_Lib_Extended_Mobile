Church Downgrades Bible
● The Roman Catholic Church in Italy has published a new version of the Bible, with the imprimatur of the Cardinal Archbishop of Milan. In the introduction, the Church expresses its attitude toward the Bible, stating: “The Bible . . . cannot be called either true or false. For example, is it true when it explains the origins of the world?” The Church answers: “The truth of the first chapters of the Bible is not on the level of scientific research,” but these chapters are “early traditions and early corrected myths.”
The introduction also says: “As to the historical narratives, they often relate facts as they really happened; sometimes they are embellished to the point of becoming epic poems.” As examples it mentions that the book of Jonah and passages in the book of Daniel are “not a series of historical facts.” It says that such Bible writing is like a “fiction novel.”
Yet the Bible says: “All Scripture is inspired by God and can profitably be used for teaching, for refuting error, for guiding people’s lives and teaching them to be holy.” (2 Tim. 3:16, Catholic “Jerusalem Bible”) Is it reasonable to think that the God of truth would inspire falsehoods to be taught to people? Would Jesus teach falsehoods and then tell his followers, “You will learn the truth and the truth will make you free”?​—John 8:32, Catholic “Jerusalem Bible.”

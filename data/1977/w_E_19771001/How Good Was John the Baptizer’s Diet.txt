How Good Was John the Baptizer’s Diet?
John the Baptizer ate “insect locusts and wild honey.” (Matt. 3:4) According to an analysis made at Jerusalem, desert locusts are 75 percent protein. Regarding honey as a food, The Encyclopedia Americana says: “Honey is highly nutritive, especially as a fuel for the energies of the body, as four fifths of its components are carbohydrates.”

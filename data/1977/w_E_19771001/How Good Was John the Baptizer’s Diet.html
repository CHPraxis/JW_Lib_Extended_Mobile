<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">John the Baptizer ate “insect locusts and wild honey.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:3:4-40:3:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 3:4</a>) According to an analysis made at Jerusalem, desert locusts are 75 percent protein. Regarding honey as a food, <em>The Encyclopedia Americana </em>says: “Honey is highly nutritive, especially as a fuel for the energies of the body, as four fifths of its components are carbohydrates.”</p>

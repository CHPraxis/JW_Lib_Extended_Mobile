<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">ARE you completing your plans to attend one of the 109 “Joyful Workers” District Assemblies arranged for us in the continental United States this summer? Truly it warms the hearts of all of us as we contemplate coming together once again in Christian assembly to receive Scriptural instruction and to see how we can improve our relationship with Jehovah. A marvelous program is being arranged and the assembly will be a highlight of our theocratic education this year.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">From the opening words of the assembly chairman, throughout each of the four assembly days, the program will be beneficial for each of us. As the theme for the opening day, we will consider “Working What Is Good at Home.” Who is there that cannot think of some aspects of his homelife that he would like to see improved? This program, with much Scriptural guidance for every member of the family, including those in religiously divided households, will offer practical help. To enjoy this day fully it would be beneficial to read in advance the Bible account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:18:1-12:20:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Kings 18:1–20:11 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:36:1-23:38:22" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Isaiah chapters 36 to 38</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The theme of the second day will be “Inciting to Love and Fine Works.” Attention will be focused on Christian love in action. We suggest that you read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:1-46:13:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:1-10</a> ahead of time. Timely material is to be presented on the active share that elders will have in the days ahead in inciting others to love and fine works by their shepherding in the congregation. This day will also highlight material from the Bible account at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:5:1-2:15:27" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Exodus chapters 5 through 15</a>. Don’t miss it!</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Exerting Ourselves in the Field” is the theme of the third day’s program. How effective is your field service? Would you like to improve? Helpful information about conversing on the Bible from house to house will be included, along with material featuring the joy we can find in conducting Bible studies. These activities deserve the best that we can give. To share more fully, some are in the regular or auxiliary pioneer service. Are you? Would you like to be? The program will be especially practical for all of you with the pioneer spirit. In preparation for this day we recommend that you read the entire book of Malachi.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The theme of the fourth day is “Loyal Workers Inherit the Promises.” By reading ahead of time the material in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:1-58:6:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hebrews 6:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:9-58:6:20" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 9-20</a> your enjoyment of the morning program will be greatly enhanced. And what is the subject for the public talk? “How God’s Kingdom Can Benefit You.” It is a good subject for all of us, but we will especially endeavor to invite the public and newly interested ones. The assembly will close with comments on what the future holds for God’s people. We urge you to stay to hear it all.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Our hope is that you personally will be able to benefit from all the fine spiritual provisions at the “Joyful Workers” District Assemblies. The following information is being provided to assist you.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>CONDUCT THAT HONORS JEHOVAH</strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Not only does good conduct make things pleasant for others, but it often serves as a fine witness to outsiders. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:12-60:2:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:12</a>) When we as Jehovah’s people congregate together, what a fine impression of our God others will have if we conduct ourselves at all times in an unselfish, loving manner and take the lead “in showing honor to one another.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:10-45:12:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rom. 12:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:25-46:14:25" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 14:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:23-51:3:23" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> Col. 3:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> John 13:35</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">One such situation that requires consideration for others is that of saving seats. Even though reminders have been given in the past, many have found magazines or other items placed on every available seat in the building, although there were far more seats than the number of persons in attendance. This may be due to some using seats for storage purposes, but would it not be much more loving to keep our things under our own seat, on our lap or in the checkroom? In this way brothers will be able to find seats without having to disturb those already seated.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">In many places it has been observed that large numbers of seats have been saved and were never occupied during entire sessions, <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>forcing people to stand. How would we feel if this happened to us? Jesus stated: “All things, therefore, that you want men to do to you, you also must likewise do to them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:12-40:7:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 7:12</a>) In harmony with this principle, our Christian conscience should move us to consider others. If you need to meet with certain ones for various reasons, why not arrange ahead of time to meet them at a certain time and place before or after the sessions, and then you will not have to save seats for one another. Of course, there may be instances in which you need to save a seat or two for good reason. Families may need seats together; volunteer workers may be coming to sit with their families; individuals may leave for a short time to go to the washroom; also, interested persons may be coming to sit with Witnesses who are encouraging them. So, we need to be loving and balanced in our viewpoint of such matters.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:1-50:2:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Phil. 2:1-4</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">At times it has been noted that numbers of brothers have arranged to rush into convention facilities early in the morning when the doors or gates were opened so they could save whole sections of seats, often the choicest ones, by laying magazines and books on them. Such actions certainly do not reflect well upon our Christian personality, do they? How refreshing it is, instead, to see others freely offering their seats to elderly or infirm persons who need them. This loving concern for others truly honors Jehovah, whose loving example we are trying to follow.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:8-62:4:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 John 4:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:1-46:13:5" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 13:1-5</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">It is a fine thing for all in attendance to arrange their affairs to be in their seats for the beginning of each session and to remain for the conclusion of the program. Such consideration shows respect for Jehovah’s table of spiritual food. If we are invited to visit someone for a meal, everyone is usually seated and ready when the prayer is given at the start, and no one leaves before the conclusion of the meal with dessert. This should be true at an assembly of Jehovah’s people so that no one inconsiderately roams around the grounds or corridors talking to others during the program, nor should there be a mass exodus before the conclusion of the spiritual program with prayer just to leave ahead of everyone else. Parents can shoulder their weighty responsibility in this by arranging to have their children sit with them and be with them before and after the sessions. This will prevent children from thoughtlessly or deliberately committing acts of vandalism, as has happened at assemblies where children have been allowed to roam freely about the assembly grounds. Many blessings are realized by parents who keep their children with them as loving companions to them at assemblies. The resulting good conduct of our children can bring much praise to Jehovah.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:7-5:6:7" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Deut. 6:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:31:12-5:31:12" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 31:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">It is also important to remember that not only what we do at the assembly grounds but also our actions elsewhere in the assembly city, where we may stay or engage in recreation, reflect upon our God, Jehovah. Think of the impression we would leave with other guests and workers in motels or hotels if we left food and trash all over our rooms, used the swimming pool after it closes, engaged in loud talking or making of noise in hallways late at night, or even allowed our children to ride elevators for fun, resulting in poor service for others or costly damage. Some have allowed friends who are not staying at the motel to use the pool and other facilities, which the management reserves for only those residing at the motel. These are things that have actually taken place; we need to be mindful of them. Perhaps elders or parents staying at these places who observe such abuses could offer appropriate Scriptural counsel and aid to those concerned, since Jehovah’s name is involved.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">By far the majority of Jehovah’s Witnesses, both young and old, at such large assemblies have proved themselves to be fine Christians. Their good conduct is definitely observed by outsiders, as noted from this comment by the director of the convention bureau in an assembly city: “Those in attendance this year, as well as last year, were indeed the finest people who have ever convened in our city.” Much good can be accomplished by all of us reflecting the fruitage of God’s spirit in everything we do. Good manners motivated by love go a long way in enhancing the enjoyment of the assembly for everyone.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:18:27-1:18:27" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Gen. 18:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:19:2-1:19:2" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 19:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Now is the time to bring your plans to completion and make the necessary arrangements to attend. We know you will find it a delightful experience to be there all four days and we look forward to attending the “Joyful Workers” District Assembly along with you.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:24-58:10:25" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Heb. 10:24, 25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:11-45:1:12" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Rom. 1:11, 12</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><span id="page6" class="pageNum" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>To assist you in completing your plans to attend one of the 109 United States district assemblies, the following chart sets out the assembly cities and the circuits nearest to each. To the extent possible, we recommend that you attend the convention shown for your circuit unless vacation plans or other circumstances make it necessary for you to attend elsewhere. In some cases the size of the crowd needs to be balanced with the seating facilities available and so some congregations in those circuits marked with an asterisk (*) may be slightly closer to another convention city, but it would be best, if possible, to attend the assembly indicated so that there will be plenty of room. Where the chart indicates that a portion of a circuit attend a particular assembly, such as <sup>1⁄2 </sup>or <sup>1⁄4</sup>, and so forth, it simply means that those living in the part of the circuit closest to that assembly would attend where indicated, but the rest of the circuit would attend another assembly closest to them, as shown elsewhere on the list. In a number of cities where two or three assemblies are being held in succession, we are recommending that the brothers in the circuits listed in the chart attend during the particular week indicated, to the extent possible, to assure adequate seating for everyone.</p>

<p id="p139" data-pid="139" class="sc"><strong>District Assembly Reminders</strong></p>
<p id="p140" data-pid="140" class="sc"><strong>ROOMING: </strong>The Society has sent a supply of Room Request forms to each congregation, on which are printed the addresses of the rooming headquarters for each assembly. If you wish assistance in obtaining a room, please fill out a Room Request form neatly and carefully and mail it directly to the rooming headquarters address for the assembly city where you will be attending (NOT to the Society), doing so <em>no earlier </em>than six weeks ahead of the date of the assembly you have selected. If you receive a rooming assignment and later have to change your plans and cannot accept it, please immediately advise (1) the landlord and (2) the convention rooming department so the room may be reassigned. Some choose to contact hotels and motels themselves and make arrangements, but often more economical hotel and motel arrangements can be made through the convention rooming department. There will be no trailer camps at the conventions, but the rooming department for each assembly will gladly furnish available information on any commercial or other trailer parking facilities in the area.</p>
<p id="p141" data-pid="141" class="se"><strong>VOLUNTEER SERVICE: </strong>You may obtain Application for Volunteer Service forms from your congregation. Please fill them out completely and have them signed by your presiding overseer and then send them to the rooming address for the convention city you will attend (NOT to the Society). If you later find that you are unable to serve in your assignment, please notify immediately the volunteer service department at the assembly city.</p>
<p id="p142" data-pid="142" class="sc">  There is much pleasure in lovingly serving your Christian brothers as you volunteer individually or as family groups, with even younger ones working along with their parents or older members of the family. It is truly a joy to see so many at Christian assemblies willingly offer themselves to work along with their Christian brothers and sisters of various races and nationalities to care for the assembly departments and the needs of their Christian brothers.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 20:35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:3-19:110:3" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Ps. 110:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p143" data-pid="143" class="se"><strong>TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS: </strong>Besides your family, do you have room in your automobile for someone that needs a ride, a pioneer, an elderly brother or sister, or an interested person who wants to attend? It will bring great joy to you as well as to them as you show such loving concern and Christian hospitality to them.</p>
<p id="p144" data-pid="144" class="se"><strong>LAPEL CARDS: </strong>No doubt all will enjoy wearing the cards as a means to advertise the assembly and to get acquainted with other brothers and sisters in attendance. Field overseers, please have the district assembly lapel cards and holders ordered on the Literature Order Blank right away if you have not already done so. These are cash items. The lapel cards are 1c each and the celluloid holders are 5c each.</p>
<p id="p145" data-pid="145" class="se"><strong>BAPTISM: </strong>At most locations, the immersion will be on Friday. Those who have made a dedication and wish to symbolize this by water baptism at an assembly should cover the eighty questions and also chapter six in the <em>Organization </em>book with the elders prior to the assembly. Bathing suits and towels should be brought from home by each one who plans to be baptized.</p>
<p id="p146" data-pid="146" class="se"><strong>PROGRAM TIMES: </strong>Plan to enjoy the entire program, which, in most cases, will begin every morning by 9:25 and will conclude at approximately 5:30 p.m. each day except Sunday. We encourage you to arrange your schedule so you do not have to leave the convention prior to 4:15 p.m. on Sunday, when the convention closes.</p>
<p id="p147" data-pid="147" class="se"><strong>FIELD SERVICE: </strong>Why not plan to spend some time while in the assembly city engaging in informal witnessing, perhaps on your way to the sessions or when returning to your accommodations? Take advantage of every opportunity to speak about the good news and to invite everyone possible to attend the assembly, especially those where you are staying. If any handbills remain, these may be obtained at the bookroom and used to aid in such informal witnessing.</p>
<p id="p148" data-pid="148" class="se"><strong>CLOTHING: </strong>As you select appropriate dress for the occasion, keep in mind that the many new ones in attendance have been told that Jehovah’s Witnesses dress modestly, in good taste and avoid the extreme appearance of many worldly people. If they now attend the assembly and find many dressed otherwise, they could be stumbled. If you are doubtful whether some kind of dress would be appropriate, then it is best not to wear it. By following good standards of modesty you can help to adorn the assembly in a spiritual way.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:9-54:2:10" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:9, 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p149" data-pid="149" class="se"><strong>CONVENTION PIONEER IDENTIFICATION: </strong>Regular pioneers who were appointed on or before February 1, 1977, have been sent a 1977 Convention Pioneer Identification for use at a district assembly during the service year. These were sent by the Society to the presiding overseer of each congregation along with the monthly statement for April. Pioneers, be sure to bring your Convention Pioneer Identification to the assembly; treat it as cash, as no replacements will be available. It can be used to obtain the regular food tickets at the assembly and will also be needed to obtain literature from the bookroom at pioneer rates.</p>
<p id="p150" data-pid="150" class="se"><strong>HELPFUL ITEMS: </strong>To enjoy the benefits of the program to the full, plan to take along a Bible, a songbook and a notebook, as well as your copy of this convention insert from <em>Our Kingdom Service.</em></p>
<p id="p151" data-pid="151" class="se"><strong>A WORD OF CAUTION: </strong>Regardless of the assembly you attend, you should lock your car at ALL times and NEVER leave anything showing in a parked car. Keep your belongings locked inside the trunk of your car. Also, beware of pickpockets. They often mingle in large crowds. And, for the same reason, do not leave anything of value unattended on seats at the convention.</p>

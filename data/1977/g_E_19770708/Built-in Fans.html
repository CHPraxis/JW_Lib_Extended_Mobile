<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The large ears of an elephant serve a purpose in addition to collecting sound. The fanlike ears are used for cooling, too. When observing elephants in Sri Lanka (Ceylon), scientists took special note of how often the elephants flapped their ears under varying weather conditions. As the heat intensified, so did the flapping, causing cooling air to flow over blood vessels that are close to the surface of the ears.</p>

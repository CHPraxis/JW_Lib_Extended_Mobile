Theocratic School Schedule for 1978
INSTRUCTIONS
During 1978 the following will be the arrangement when conducting the Theocratic School.
TEXTBOOKS: The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, The Watchtower [w], Awake! [g], Bible Topics for Discussion [td], and the books Aid to Bible Understanding [ad] and Life Does Have a Purpose [lp] will be the basis for assignments.
The school will begin with song and prayer and remarks of welcome, and then will proceed as follows:
HIGHLIGHTS FROM BIBLE READING: 5 minutes. The school overseer will present highlights and questions based on the week’s Bible reading assignment.
INSTRUCTION TALK: No. 1: 15 minutes. This should not be just a summary of the assigned material. It should be a well-developed talk on a chosen theme, assigned to an elder if possible, or, when necessary, to a qualified ministerial servant. The coverage should not be superficial but should provide a presentation that is truly informative and helpful to the congregation. There will be no oral review, so after the instruction talk the students will be dismissed to their various classrooms.
TALK NO. 2: 6 minutes. This is a Bible reading of the assigned material by a brother. The reading assignments are short enough to permit the student to present brief explanatory information in his opening and concluding remarks, and even at intermediate points. Historical background, prophetic or doctrinal significance, application of principles and expressions of appreciation for the wisdom reflected in the text may be included. The talk should be planned in a way that allows for all the assigned verses actually to be read. The allotted time should be fully utilized. The material may be presented as a talk to the congregation, or a boy may read it to his father or to another qualified older brother seated on the platform. The father or other older brother may then use questions to draw from the boy comments on the value of the material.
TALK NO. 3: 6 minutes. Rather than a talk, this will be a Bible study, conducted by a sister. The one conducting the study should strive to make it as helpful and realistic as possible, so as to benefit from this practical training in conducting a Bible study. It is not necessary to read the paragraphs, though certain ones might be read. Nor is it necessary to cover all the assigned material; at times certain choice paragraphs could be selected, questions raised and scriptures looked up and considered. If an answer is incomplete, the student should ask auxiliary questions to draw out the answer. Where the student fails to do this, the school overseer will draw attention to this after the presentation. One assistant will be scheduled by the school overseer, but additional assistants may be used.
TALK NO. 4: 6 minutes. This talk also will be assigned to sisters whenever possible. When delivering the talk, the student may be either seated or standing. One assistant will be scheduled by the school overseer, but additional assistants may be used. Settings could include situations arising at home, in the field service, in the congregation or elsewhere. The sister giving the talk may either initiate the conversation to establish the setting or have her assistant(s) do so. Not the setting, but the material should be given prime consideration.
TALK NO. 5: 6 minutes. Assigned preferably to a brother with some experience, it should be a talk to the entire audience. While giving his talk from notes, the speaker, when he thinks it fitting, may read quotations or pointed excerpts from the assigned material. It will usually be best for the speaker to prepare his talk with the Kingdom Hall audience in mind, so that it will be truly informative and beneficial to those who actually hear it. However, if the material especially lends itself to another practical and suitable setting, the speaker may choose to develop his talk accordingly.
REMARKS: After Talks Nos. 2 through 5, the school overseer will have two minutes respectively to highlight truths and principles that the students may not have included in their presentations. These remarks should be meaningful, emphasizing points that will be helpful to the brothers in their homelife, at school, on the job, within the congregation or while out in field service. Occasionally, questions can be put to the audience on points in the assigned material that can be applied.
COUNSEL: This will always be given privately after the meeting. More than two minutes may be used as advisable. The private counsel for Talk No. 3 may include overall impressions as to how the study was conducted. On the Speech Counsel slip use only those aspects that would suitably apply to one conducting a Bible study.
PREPARING TALKS: Where the material makes it possible, talks should follow a well-developed theme. Choose a theme that will allow for the best coverage of the material in the allotted time. Prepare all talks with the points in mind to be considered next on the Speech Counsel slip.
TIMING: No talk should go overtime. Neither should the remarks. Talks Nos. 2 through 5 should tactfully be stopped when the time is up. If the school overseer assigns someone to give the “stop signal,” that one should be advised as to the importance of doing this whenever a talk goes overtime. An instruction talk speaker who goes overtime should be given private counsel. All should watch their timing carefully so that the Theocratic School as a whole does not run overtime.
WRITTEN REVIEWS: Periodically a written review will be given. In preparation, review principally the material in ad and lp and complete the assignment of personal Bible reading. Only the Bible may be used during this thirty-minute review. The balance of the hour will be devoted to a discussion of the questions and answers. Each student will check his own paper and, in reading off the answers, the school overseer will concentrate on the more difficult questions, stressing the matter of accurate knowledge and letting the audience turn to the textbooks where the answers may be checked. If, for some reason, local circumstances make it necessary, the written review may be used a week later than what is shown on the schedule.
LARGE AND SMALL CONGREGATIONS: Congregations with a school enrollment of fifty or more students may wish to arrange for additional groups of students to deliver the scheduled talks before other counselors. Rotate the students to the various halls. Where it seems advisable, sisters may take any student talk, presenting it to someone else, as outlined for Talk No. 4.
ABSENTEES: The brothers and sisters will show appreciation for this school by being present, when possible, at every weekly session, by preparing their assignments well, and by participating in question sessions. If a student is not present when scheduled, a volunteer may take the assignment, making whatever application he feels qualified to make on such short notice. Or the school overseer may cover the material with appropriate audience participation.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Many are the letters the Society receives expressing appreciation for the “food at the proper time” and the services rendered by members of the Bethel families around the earth. We want you to know that, even though our busy schedule does not permit us to answer all your letters, we nevertheless appreciate your interest and prayers in our behalf. We join you in expressing appreciation to Jehovah for the way he is feeding and leading his people in these momentous last days. We wanted you to know why we have not replied to each letter.</p>

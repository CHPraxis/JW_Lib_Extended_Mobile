New Arrangement for Tract Distribution
1 This year the entire month of September will be the month for putting out a new tract. This campaign will be different. The tract is designed to be the basis for many good conversations. So, in many cases we will not simply be leaving tracts for people to read later. The theme of the tract will be the family, and this should be of interest to the majority of people we meet. There are points set out in clear and logical arrangement so you will be able to use the tract readily in conversations.
2 The conversations can lead to Bible studies, and this will be our objective in September. Once a conversation has been entered into, you may be able to go from the Scriptural consideration based on the tract to Chapter 20 of the Truth book on “Building a Happy Family Life.” In most cases you might find it best to start at the beginning of the chapter. Familiarize yourself with the tract and the chapter in the book. Then you can adapt to whatever the conversation reveals to be the aspect of family life that is of special interest to the householder.
3 Where will this work be done? Elders and study conductors should lay plans during August for each study group’s work program. Select the territory and arrange definite places to meet. Have someone there to take the lead. The weather should be favorable for getting to different towns and population centers. Again, this year, the Society will consign a supply of tracts to each congregation. Tracts will be left where people are busy or not at home, but starting conversations will be one of our main goals in the tract work this September. All tracts should be distributed by the last day of September.
4 September will be a month of special activity. How many in your congregation will be able to share in auxiliary pioneer service? Those who are pioneering will be able to work with groups and help newer ones to go out in the service. Enjoy this new use of tracts as a pioneer.

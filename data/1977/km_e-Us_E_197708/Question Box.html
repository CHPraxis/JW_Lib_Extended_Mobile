<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● <em>Our Kingdom Service </em>of February 1977 says “that at least two books should be studied with all persons who come into the truth,” and it points out that a study should be continued with a student who gets baptized until he has finished studying two publications. Would this point apply to someone baptized a year or so who may not have finished studying two publications?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It is certainly good for newly baptized persons to become firmly rooted in the faith and in Christian principles through a personal study of the Scriptures. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:7-51:2:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Col. 2:7</a>) Obviously, much of the learning process for a new disciple must <em>follow </em>baptism. (See <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>.) So if it is felt that a baptized publisher definitely needs personal help in order to complete a thorough study of at least two of the Society’s publications in the home Bible study arrangement, then certainly someone should study with him. In such a case the study should be reported and the field service time and return visits should be reported by the one conducting the study <em>until </em>such time as two publications have been completed.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">If you are a regular attender at the congregation book study, you may find you are getting the spiritual upbuilding you need. However, if you have not completed two books and feel that you or your family need additional help, why not approach the Bible study overseer and ask if someone can conduct a study with you?</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In discussing the effects of television on the very young, Dr. Thomas Harris gives parents much to think about. After describing how the young mind works like a tape recorder, he states: “A three-year-old who sits before a television set many hours a day is recording what he sees. The programs he watches are a ‘taught’ concept of life. If he watches programs of violence, I believe he records violence. . . . This conclusion is certain if his parents do not express opposition by switching the channel. If they enjoy violent programs the youngster gets a double sanction​—the set and the folks—​and he assumes permission to be violent provided he collects the required amount of injustices.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Yes, it is not enough that we personally avoid demonstrations of violence in our home. The question that remains is: Do we by our entertainment habits “sanction” it in the eyes of our children?</p>

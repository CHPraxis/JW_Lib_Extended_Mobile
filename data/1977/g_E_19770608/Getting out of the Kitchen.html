<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">As the kitchen is the ‘work area’ of most homes, many women feel that they spend their lives trying to work their way out of it. While family cooperation is vital, here are a few timesaving tips homemakers may want to try:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">✔ You can set and clear the table more quickly by keeping a small tray for such items as salt and pepper, sugar and napkins. In this way you handle one item​—the tray—​instead of juggling many separate ones. Similarly, a “breakfast tray” containing jams, jellies, butter and milk can save time.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">✔ Hang everything that you possibly can (within reason, of course) on the kitchen wall. You will save the time and frustration of hunting through a drawer or cabinet for needed utensils.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">✔ When your oven needs cleaning, put a dish with a half a cup of ammonia in the oven one morning. (Keep the oven door closed.) By late afternoon, the grime will have loosened and it will be easier to clean the oven.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">✔ Avoid needless refrigerator cleaning (and odors) by keeping an open box of baking soda inside. Stir the soda every so often and replace it every two or three months.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">✔ A handy time-saver in kitchen cleanups is an old toothbrush. This tiny brush will get into places that your larger ones cannot.</p>

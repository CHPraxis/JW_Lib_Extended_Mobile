A Form of Housing with a Long History
■ During the last fifteen years or so condominium dwelling has become very common in the United States. To the individual who chooses this type of housing it basically means ownership of one or more single units in a multi-unit structure, with common ownership of halls, stairs, elevators, lobbies, driveways and the like.
The concept of condominium dwelling is much older in Latin America and Europe than in the United States. But it appears that the idea originated with the early Babylonians. Records of their condominiums date back to 2,000 B.C.E. These documents speak of the sale of the first floor in a home, with the owner retaining title to the second floor. Papyrus No. 4721891 in the Brooklyn Museum is thought to be the oldest condominium deed in existence today. It is considered to be of the date 434 B.C.E.

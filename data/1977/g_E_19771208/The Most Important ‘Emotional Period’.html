<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHEN is the most important period of an infant’s emotional life? “The first few hours of life itself” answers one doctor referring to immediately after birth. Discussing the trend in some hospitals of whisking the baby away from the mother at birth, he adds: “The emotional effects of such separation on both mother and infant may be greater than the risks of harm in a hospital bed [from unwanted germs].” His observation is backed by many research studies of humans and animals that strongly suggest close physical contact is needed by mother and child immediately after birth.</p>

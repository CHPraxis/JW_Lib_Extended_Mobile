<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IN SOUTHEASTERN SURINAM, an 18-meter (59-foot) “korjaal,” or boat, travels the Tapanahony River. The homemade craft rouses shouts of “Noa e psa!” (“Noah goes by!”) from village children as it passes by. Why? Well, it was built by a very active congregation of 27 Jehovah’s Witnesses, who use it to carry their preaching work to the villages along the river. They also use it to transport the entire congregation, along with their baggage, to Christian assemblies in the capital. Hence, the name “Noah” arose spontaneously among the villagers, who know that the vessel belongs to the Witnesses.</p>

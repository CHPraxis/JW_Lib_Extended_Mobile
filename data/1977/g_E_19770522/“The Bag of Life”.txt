“The Bag of Life”
■ The discreet woman Abigail said to David: “When man rises up to pursue you and look for your soul, the soul of my lord will certainly prove to be wrapped up in the bag of life with Jehovah.” (1 Sam. 25:29) Anciently, valuables were wrapped up in bags for safekeeping. Like a precious possession, David would be under Jehovah’s protective care when threatened by his enemies. As if in a bag, David’s life as a person would be in God’s hands.

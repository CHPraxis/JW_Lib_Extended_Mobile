Should Christians Accept Blood?
Each year millions of blood transfusions are given. But some Christians say that the Bible forbids accepting blood. What does the Bible say? And what are the facts about blood transfusions?
Satisfying answers are found in the new 64-page booklet Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Question of Blood. Only 5 cents (U.S.), postpaid.
Please send the booklet Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Question of Blood. I enclose 5c (U.S.).

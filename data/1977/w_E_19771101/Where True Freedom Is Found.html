<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● To many, true freedom is being able to do things just as one pleases. This is what one youth in New Zealand thought. In time, however, he came to appreciate that he was not really free. He relates:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I wanted to be free to do things for myself. When I left home at fifteen years of age, I went to live with relatives in Auckland. There I felt I was <em>really </em>living, going to parties and drinking in hotels. In time my attitude hardened to such a degree that I viewed the police as my enemies. Later I was introduced to drugs by my so-called friends. Most of the time thereafter I was either drugged or drunk. One night at a party I met a girl who had just started to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses. Her comments revived my interest in the Bible and helped me come back to my senses.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I arranged to sit in on her Bible study the very next day, and continued to progress from that time on. Looking back, I see that I wanted friends but was searching in the wrong place. I did not enjoy my so-called ‘freedom’ nor the companions that I found in the world. True friends and companions, as well as real freedom, are found among Jehovah’s people.”</p>

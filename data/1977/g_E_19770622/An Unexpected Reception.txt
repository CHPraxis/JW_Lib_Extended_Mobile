An Unexpected Reception
WHILE calling on people at their homes in a town of Western Africa, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses had a most unexpected reception. A smiling woman came rushing out and threw her arms around him. He just managed to move back sufficiently to avoid being kissed. The Witness kindly explained that such a reception was appropriate for married people but not for persons seeing each other for the first time. Then he stated the reason for his visit. The woman, a prostitute, became angry and insisted that the Witness leave, saying that she wanted men who accepted her welcome.
One week later, the Witness was back in the same area and decided to call again at this home. Surprisingly, the woman listened and even agreed to a Bible study. She started attending the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses and soon realized that her life was out of harmony with the Holy Scriptures. She sincerely wanted to change her ways and spoke to her parents about the wonderful truths that she had learned. But the family did not appreciate her desire to give up her former course of life, as it had financed the construction of their homes. This woman, however, did not let the family discourage her. She cleaned up her life and now rejoices in being able to declare the “good news” to others as a baptized Witness of Jehovah.

“The Path of the Righteous Ones”
■ Contrasting the “path of the righteous ones” with the “way of the wicked ones,” Proverbs 4:18, 19 says: “The path of the righteous ones is like the bright light that is getting lighter and lighter until the day is firmly established. The way of the wicked ones is like the gloom; they have not known at what they keep stumbling.”
The light of the sun gets brighter and brighter from dawn until the “day is firmly established.” So it is with righteous persons. The course they follow is light itself, as it is illuminated by godly wisdom. Because of striving to conform ever closer to such wisdom, their path becomes lighter and lighter. How different it is with wicked persons! Disregarding godly wisdom, they have no light. As if stumbling around in the darkness, they continue to bring trouble upon themselves.

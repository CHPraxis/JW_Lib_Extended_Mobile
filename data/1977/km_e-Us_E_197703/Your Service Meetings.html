<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">“Have Tender Affection for One Another.” February 1, 1977, <em>Watchtower. </em>Suggest having cross section of congregation represented on stage, to express what they appreciate about article and how practical application of such can be made.

For example, appropriate to involve audience in discussion of paragraphs one through four of column one, page 676. Highlight fact Christians should not want their kindness and generosity to be less than that shown by persons who do not claim to serve God. Consider example of people on island of Malta where Paul was shipwrecked and what they did, in contrast with people claiming to be chosen of God in cities of Israel who showed Jesus greatest unkindness and indignity. Show need for Jehovah’s servants to exhibit kindness and consideration for all. Give consideration to how kindness can appropriately be shown in dealing with any who prove to be rebellious, unrepentant or stubborn. Highlight <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:10:1-47:10:1" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 10:1</a> as criterion for all our dealings. Song 37.</p>

<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="so">On page three suggestions are given as to how we can improve our field service together. If you have heartfelt desire to start home Bible study, the following suggestions may prove helpful:</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="so">Start home Bible study on initial call. Some have had success by stating reason for calling is to find honest-hearted ones looking for God’s solution to problems that plague man today.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="so">Then having a specific Bible thought in mind, such as <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:8-19:37:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 37:8-11</a>, which deals with complete elimination of crime and violence, you could proceed to offer the Bible study. May tie in with booklet, <em>Is There a God Who Cares?, </em>pages 21-24.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="so">More often, studies are started through return visits. Sometimes several visits are required before the actual study is started. May need to develop friendly basis first, perhaps by making a number of brief visits, featuring a helpful Bible thought. (Discuss information page 122, <em>or.</em>) Or by regularly placing magazines with individuals. Some have Bible questions they will want answered.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="so">At appropriate time, demonstrate how <em>regular </em>study will answer many questions. Likely will stimulate desire to have regular Bible study.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="so">What should we study?</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="so">  No set rule; consider individual student’s needs, interests. Topics the student first mentions may help you to determine what to study. Consider with audience some of local interests of people. Try to use what will help the student most and hold his attention. Show sincere interest in him.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="so">Right from start of study, good to include other members of family. Fewer problems when husbands and wives whole families, study the truth together. Good to explain why there may be opposition to their study.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:36-40:10:37" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 10:36, 37</a> (<a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:1101968002/13:346-15"><em>tr, </em>p. 16</a>)</p>

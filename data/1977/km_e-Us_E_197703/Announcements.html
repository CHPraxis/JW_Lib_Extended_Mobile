<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">● Literature offer for March: Any of the 384-page books with two booklets, for 50c. If all of these are distributed, any pocket-size book may be used. April: The <em>Watchtower </em>subscription, with three booklets to new subscribers, for $1.50, or subscriptions to both magazines, with six booklets, for $3.00.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">● The special report card listing attendance and partakers at the Lord’s Evening Meal and total regular pioneers should be sent to the Society by the presiding overseer immediately after that meeting.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn">● Since Memorial will be on Sunday this year, it is suggested that no other meetings be held on that day. Some may wish to have <em>Watchtower </em>study on Saturday or another day. Use April 3 as a service day.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn">● Recorded programs for the radio series “All Scripture Is Beneficial” now number over three hundred and fifty. Therefore, it seems inadvisable to continue producing new programs when many of those on hand have never been run by many stations. Continued use of the program will be left to the initiative of the brothers locally. Any congregations with time available to use them on a radio station may request tapes as needed. Please address your envelope: Attention: Radio Tapes.</p>

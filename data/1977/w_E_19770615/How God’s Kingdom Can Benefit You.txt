Come, Hear the Free Public Talk:
How God’s Kingdom Can Benefit You
What exactly is God’s Kingdom? Is it operating today? What must one do to enjoy its benefits?
These questions will be answered in the principal talk at this summer’s district assemblies of Jehovah’s Witnesses. The assembly program also features helpful Bible discussions on practical matters of life as well as full-costume Bible dramas. In just the British Isles, Canada and the United States, some one hundred cities will host the four-day assemblies.
Contact the local Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses to find out where the nearest assembly will be held, or write the publishers of this magazine.

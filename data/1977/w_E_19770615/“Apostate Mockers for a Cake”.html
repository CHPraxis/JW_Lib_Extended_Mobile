<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In one of his psalms, David tells of the abuses that he had to endure. “Among the apostate mockers for a cake,” said David, “there was a grinding of their teeth even against me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:35:16-19:35:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 35:16</a>) These ridiculers were apostates in the sense that they could not be numbered among God’s faithful people. They were outcasts, the very dregs of society. Just to get a cake from the one (likely King Saul) who would be pleased with their words, these base men would make fun of David. They would grind their teeth at him, that is, express anger, derision and scorn.</p>

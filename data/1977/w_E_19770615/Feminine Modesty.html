<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Is “modesty” a quality in many of the modern styles of women’s dress in your area? Throughout the earth men and women would answer with a resounding “No!” Even when longer skirts are in fashion, frequently the garments that are worn are very revealing or immodest. You likely have been made aware of that.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Should Christian women, then, make the effort to purchase or to sew clothes that accord with the quality of modesty? Thousands of female Christian witnesses of Jehovah in various nations realize that this is the advisable course. While taking an interest in being neat and attractive in their grooming, they guide their thinking by the inspired advice that Christian women should “adorn themselves in well-arranged dress, with modesty and soundness of mind.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:9-54:2:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Puerto Rico branch office of the Watch Tower Society received an interesting note regarding this from a young Witness. It read:</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“We had an experience that really brought us joy the other day, and I wish to tell you about it. Two other young sisters and I were walking down the street on our way to share in the house-to-house preaching work when a man called for us to stop. At first we did not want to stop because we were not sure of his motives, but, since he insisted, we did stop to find out what he wanted. He said: ‘I want to congratulate you on your manner of dress.’ We explained that we were Jehovah’s Christian witnesses and that the Bible says that we should dress modestly, so that is what we do. ‘It is for this reason that I want to congratulate you,’ said the man, ‘because I belong to the Evangelist religion, but I can see that you people are the only ones that dress properly according to the Bible.’ So we want to say how happy and grateful we are for the fine Bible counsel on how we should dress.”</p>

Joseph Was Discharging His Duties
Joseph knew that Potiphar’s wife was infatuated with him. But there was little he could do to avoid contact with her. Archaeological evidence indicates that the arrangement of Egyptian houses was such that a person had to pass through the main part of the home to reach the storerooms. So it was that while Joseph was caring for his duties, the wife of Potiphar tried to allure him into committing immorality with her.​—Gen. 39:7-15.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Although we have all come to enjoy using the pocket-size books in our field service, we still have a considerable stock of the larger books on hand. Who could benefit from them?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The fact is that, by studying these larger publications, many of us learned the truth. Others, too, can benefit from what they contain. So, instead of leaving them on our shelves, during March we are planning a concerted effort with a view to getting as many of them as possible into the hands of interested persons. Our literature offer during March will be any 50c book, with two free booklets. When you make placements, have in mind trying to start a home Bible study, possibly using one of the booklets that you place.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>In addition to offering them in the field, it would be good to make a display of the books at the Kingdom Hall so that publishers and other interested persons who want copies for their library can obtain them before the stock is exhausted.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>The Society has supplies of the following books: <em>Man’s Salvation out of World Distress at Hand!, “The Nations Shall Know that I Am Jehovah”—How?, God’s Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached, “Then Is Finished the Mystery of God,” </em>and <em>“Things in Which It Is Impossible for God to Lie.” </em>If additional 50c books can be used, please order only what you feel you can place in the month of March. If it makes no difference which books are sent, please show that on your order. If your congregation has more stock on hand than it can place, contact nearby congregations to see if they might assist in getting these books into the hands of the public during March. These books could also be displayed at circuit assemblies in order to make them available to other individuals or congregations desiring them. If, before the end of March, your stock of 50c books is exhausted, publishers may use the pocket-size 25c books.</p>

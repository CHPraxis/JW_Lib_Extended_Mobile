<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">On September 7, 1977, the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses came to the decision to invite three anointed brothers to join with them in service at Brooklyn. The new members of the Governing Body are Carey W. Barber of the United States, John E. Barr of London, England, and Martin Poetzinger of the Federal Republic of Germany. Brother Barber has been in full-time service since 1923 and has served at Brooklyn Bethel and in the traveling service. Brother Barr has served for more than thirty-seven years in the full-time service in the British Isles; he has been in the London Bethel in various services and lately has been secretary-treasurer of the International Bible Students Association. Martin Poetzinger entered the Kingdom service in 1926 and entered pioneer service in 1930. He is a graduate of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead. His full-time service was interrupted temporarily when he was imprisoned in a concentration camp during the Nazi years of persecution. We look forward to having these three brothers join in the work of the Governing Body as the Kingdom service continues to grow. There are now eighteen members of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>

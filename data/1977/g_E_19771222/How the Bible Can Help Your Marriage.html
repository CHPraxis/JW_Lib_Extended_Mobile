<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Did you realize that the Bible gives the best advice on solving marital problems? The book <strong>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life </strong>points to that advice. Read its chapter “Building a Happy Family Life.” Also, see “Marriage” in <strong>“Make Sure of All Things; Hold Fast to What Is Fine,” </strong>where there are more than 40 scripture quotations on the subject. Send $1 (U.S.) and receive both books, postpaid.</p>

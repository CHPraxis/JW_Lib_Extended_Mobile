Fly Your Kite with Caution
KITEFLYING can be a real pleasure, but it can also be dangerous. For instance, the kite may become entangled in an electrical power line. If that happens, what should you do?
In a special column appearing in the Easton, Pennsylvania, Express, the Metropolitan-Edison Company recommends calling your utility company. You should not pull on the string, or climb the utility pole. Giving other kiteflying safety hints, the column states: “Use dry string, wood and paper​—no metal, wire, or metalic string, or cloth. Don’t fly a kite in the rain. Stay away from streets, highways, TV and radio antennas and, most of all, power lines.”

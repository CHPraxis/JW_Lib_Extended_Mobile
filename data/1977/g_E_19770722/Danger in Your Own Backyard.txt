Danger in Your Own Backyard
MOWING your lawn may seem like a safe operation, but safety officials estimate that more than 50,000 people are seriously injured by rotary power mowers each year. Did you know that on many lawn mowers the cutting blade spins at about 180Â miles per hour? Most accidents occur when hands or toes come in contact with the blade or when objects are hurled out of the machine at high speed. Safety tips include: Check the mowing area before you start; remove stones and other debris. And never mow in bare feet, sandals or cloth shoes. Know your machine well and how to stop it quickly. Do not try to repair or unclog the machine while it is running.

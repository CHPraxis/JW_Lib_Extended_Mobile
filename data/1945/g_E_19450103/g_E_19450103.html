<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Mexican Convent Hidden for 77 Years</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ The St. Louis Roman Catholic </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Register</span><span class="font10"> contains a story with a triple-column heading reading “Sisters Were Buried Alive for 77 Years; Mexican Convent That Disappeared Used Today for Subtle Attacks on Religion”. It is illustrated by a cut also three columns wide showing the long narrow room in which, unknown to the civil authorities, the religious business of the Convent of Santa Monica was carried on. There is no hint in the Scriptures that Mary, the mother of Jesus, and of his brothers and sisters, ever lived in a .convent; nor are such institutions even hinted at in God’s Word, though they are common enough in paganism and heathenism. What is it that the monks and nuns are ashamed of, and are trying to hide? Probably the best answer is in the word of the Lord ' himself that “every bne that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved”. (John 3:20) It would be impossible to imagine a private home so steeped in rottenness as the Franciscan monasteries Of Germany were shown to fye about the time that Hitler was getting his “New Order” under way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> No. 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ I was witnessing with the magazines at a corner on Fulton street, downtown Brooklyn, when a woman approached and contributed for subscriptions for both </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation, </span><span class="font10">and requested someone to give her further information about God’s kingdom.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Volume XXVI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brooklyn, N.Y,, Wednesday, January 3, 1945 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numbar 660</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">“As It Was in the Days of Noah”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;As it was in the days of No'e, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that No'e entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.” —Luke 17:26, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font10">HE earth is in chains. Not the chains , of enslavement forged by dictators or any other human agency are they, but chains invisible to man. Man cannot even touch them, much less break them; yet they bind millions of humankind in a grip so deadly that comparatively few will escape the cataclysm of destruction to which they inexorably lead, a catastrophe that will dwarf the deluge, of Noah’s day. Total war will never shatter those bonds. On the contrary, the postwar world of man’s building will find itself more tightly bound than ever, more hopelessly enmeshed in coils stronger than steel. Strangely, the war of liberation now raging is forging those chains into mightier links, and will result in a monstrous creation that will strike at the only source of possible release. How so? you ask in amazement, or, perhaps, demand in resentment. Soberly consider the facts before reaching a conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">, The discussion hinges upon this: Who are the “chains”? The key unlocking that mystery in this time of Christ’s second presence and the “last days” is the Scripture text above quoted, “As it was in the days of Noah”—and how was that? The above words of Christ Jesus foretell for these “last days” a materialistic human society devoted to self-service, and totally unconcerned about the divine</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">reckoning impending at Armageddon. But the record of Noah’s day found in the sixth chapter of Genesis sheds further light on the prophetic conditions existing then. “God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.” Why such depravity? The context discloses that wicked spirit creatures of Satan’s realm had materialized as giants or Nephilim and were running rampant in the earth. They had, either directly or indirectly, induced other spirit creatures, the “sons of God”, to materialize and cohabit with the daughters of men. Race contamination ensued. The resultant offspring were hybrid monstrosities. With the masses of the people under control of evil spirits and freakish giants, humanity was swept along in a boiling tide of wild revelry and violence. The demon hordes of Satan were on the loose! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;A World Possessed’*</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And so it is today. The same evil forces grip humanity in a vise-like clutch that will call for more than an earthwide flood of waters to break it. Thinking people sense the presence of sinister forces at work, and wonder. Note the typical comments of Pierre van Paassen:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We are living in a crazy world, a world possessed. Our Puritan ancestor's might well have called it a world possessed of the Devil, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">For </span><span class="font8">evil and violence -and heart-rending anxiety seem to have gained the upper hand for the time being, so that even the most ''’Christian and the most peace-loving nations &lt;on earth are caught in a seething whirlpool.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The pillars of society have begun to shake. The foundations of truth and humanity, of reason and justice, which we thought of enduring character and of lasting value, sometimes seem to be disintegrating. At times we feel as if the very ground under our feet were trembling, and we no longer know on what to build or where to take our stand. The future weighs upon us as a terrible, in-■ comprehensible burden under which nobody dares to plan and scarcely anyone dares to look ahead. Thoughts of the future darken the high hopes of the young, and they fill with gloomy forebodings the eventide of our elders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What is going to happen? How is this crisis in human affairs going to end? Will it pass, as other great crises have gone by? Or are present events merely harbingers of still more cataclysmic happenings? What can we do to prevent the further growth of the' evil? Who is responsible for these disasters? and what can yet be done to stay the spread of the blight that has come to darken the skies of this entire generation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These are the thoughts and questions that harrow and torment us. Nor do they any longer torment us solely in the empty hours of the night, when the flame of life burns low and the surrounding gloom becomes peopled with all kinds of fantastic images and nightmares. Today the facts stare us in the face, and our feelings of disaster rest on sober judgment and observation. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">[Woman's Day,</span><span class="font8"> August, 1942]</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mr. van Paassen remarked, “Our Puritan ancestors might well have called it a world possessed of the Devil.” But this, he infers, is too old-fashioned a view for this practical, realistic, scientific modern world to hold; so he turns his back on the underlying answer to his perplexed questionings, and gropes on in blindness. This, also, is typical of modern thinkers. <sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The fact stands true: the only explanation of startling and shocking events occurring daily is, it is the operation of invisible wicked spirits. It is not based on ignorant superstition, but the infallible testimony of the Bible is its foundation. A little girl in New Jersey goes next door, grabs a baby’s bottle, hits him over the head with it, and kills him. In Ohio a youth of 16 years admits killing a 6-month-old baby girl. In Pennsylvania a boy 16 years old murders two women, each over 80. The accounts could continue indefinitely; papers every day add to the mounting toll. The killers have no motives, just an unexplainable and overwhelming urge of the moment to kill. Horrible sex crimes, so ghastly and inhuman that one shudders to read of them, are reported daily. Juveniles swell the flood of moral delinquents of all ages. Whole nations go mad and oppress and torture and kill with lightning-like rapidity. From the least to the greatest, humans are acting inhumanly, yes, demoniacally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Subtlety of Demon Snares</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Becoming more specific, What are some of the channels through which the invisible demons work? They are many and varied. They are fashioned to entrap different classes, all classes, of human society. Religion plays the major role. In Africa it is the' tribal witch doctor, with his ceremonies, his magic potions, his easting of spells, his calling forth of curses, his conjuring up of the spirits; all of which “smart, civilized” peoples brush aside with the airy comment, “Poor savages.” Nonetheless, the savages are thereby held in chains of bondage by the demons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But turn attention to self-satisfied “Christendom”. How do her millions fare? Just as badly; they are bound just as securely as the hapless ones they dismiss as “poor savages”. The only difference is that the fetters take on </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">different outward appearance; but, for all their innocent appearance, they are just as strong as those enslaving the credulous savage. The sly devils invisible to man use more subtle things as ,they reach out to bind those that are more educated; but no class, because of worldly wisdom, is free from the clutches of the far wiser demons of Satan. A source of protection stronger than these invisible evil forces must be drawn upon for a way of escape. Yet in their smug wisdom and vain self-satisfaction “Christendom’s” millions feel superior and secure. Their vain conceit makes them easy victims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Wherein lies hope of release and freedom from demon snares! A knowledge of the truth concerning demonism. Christ Jesus said, “The truth shall make you free.” (John 8:32) Striking at the very core of the difficulty, the apostle Paul, warned Christians to be on guard against the evil spirits, saying, &quot;Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.” (2 Corinthians 2; 11) But the masses of humanity are ignorant of Satan’s devices, and he does get an advantage over them; and that advantage is the deadly one of “secret weapons”. Learn about them. Your life hangs in the balance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Religion's Mask for the Demon Invaders</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">'Foremost in the ranks of demonism tramps religion. Look at the religious frenzy of the Holy Rollers and Pentecostals when they “get the [evil] spirit”. Certainly they have not sprung very far from the savage African witch doctor and his flock. Indeed, as one reads the following account of a meeting of the Holiness Church of God, staged in the mountainous area where the three states of Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee join, he may well believe he has been transported to a tribal ceremony in the Dark Continent. Both claim to be and are religious. Read the report given in the Washington (D.C.) </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times^Herald, </span><span class="font10">June 12, 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Holiness faith-healers, their fervor fanned to fever heat by a rhythmic hypnotic chanting of old hymns, proved their faith in their religion by their indifferent handling of the snake from whose fangs, easily visible at 20 feet, spurted at intervals a creamy liquid of potential death. While grey-headed women, pregnant women, and young girls screamed their ecstasy in &quot;unknown tongues”, jerking convulsively and jumping about a rope-enclosed outdoor square, the faith-healers passed the diamondback and an ugly two-foot copperhead from hand to hand. They took off shoes and socks and tramped on the reptiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They appeared insensitive to the flames of a kerosene torch in which they held their hands, their arms and their hair. Their skin blistered; but they went on singing and shouting [if this had been from the Lord, not even a hair would have been singed (Daniel 3:27) ]. While some 200 persons watched in mingled horror and amusement, the faith-healers (coal miners all and their wives and children) acknowledged the core of their dangerous and spectacular conviction to be a quotation from the 16th chapter of Mark: “And they shall take up serpents.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Bible text above quoted is Mark 16:18. Verses 9 to 20 of that chapter are spurious, not being found in the most ancient manuscripts of the Greek Scriptures. Such pathetically deluded persons have fallen into the snare Jesus avoided when the Devil tried Him. Satan challenged Him to show His faith in God by casting himself down from a pinnacle of the temple, but Jesus brushed aside such a foolish demonstration with the words, “Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.” (Matthew’ 4:5-7) Paul was not tempting God when a deadly viper sank its fangs into his hand, because the mishap was entirely accidental. (Acts 28:2-6) Any protection the God-tempting faith-healers may have from the writhing reptiles they fondle comes from the great Serpent, Satan,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But this religion is too horrifying and terrifying for the majority; so the prolific schemer Satan advances hundreds of_sects and cults, each with its own peculiar appeal, and each draws its share of victims into the demon snare. <sup>;</sup>fhe very ones that look on in amusement find morbid curiosity as the snake charmews exhibit themselves are likewise entrapped by religious doctrines sounded from the pulpit of some more conserva-&quot;tive church organization. Some of the most educated persons are reduced to a state of awe and superstition and credulity by the dimly-lit interior of an imposing, besteepled cathedral, with its stained-glass windows, and images, and altars, and its mystery-shrouded cere-• monies solemnly performed by costumed priests chanting monotonous liturgies in a tongue unknown to the worshipers. They are as deluded as the handlers of serpents, and, oftentimes, not half as sincere! They have no grounds for feeling superior to the snake-handlers. Are not all religionists united in the claim that though there are multifarious brands of religion, they are all roads leading to the same place? This contention is true, too; but the destination is not heaven. All religion, be it obviously ridiculous or morbid or “high-brow”, leads to demon ensnarement and death. Though the people be “smart”, the wily demon hordes are smarter than the smartest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">From the frenzied emotionalists to the most refined cults, they all have their visions. These are interpreted to suit the fancy of the cultists, and strengthen the links of demonology. A striking example of the demons’-tricks in this line was the hoax they worked recently on an entire town, and which gained widespread publicity. On April 27, 1944, hundreds of the residents of Ipswich, Tungland, saw a vision in the sky. It first took the form of a large, white cross, and then thereon appeared the figure of Jesus, so they claim. The head was bowed, the feet crossed, and even the nails were claimed to have been visible by some of the excited townsfolk. The local “reverend” thus catapulted into the public eye made the most of the opportunity, and interpreted the sign as a promise and a warning, and in doing so managed to put in a “plug” for “more religion”. He declared: “It is a call to people to see that the mistakes of the pre-war years are not repeated. During the years between the wars all kinds of well-meaning people made plans for world peace. They fell through because too much attention was paid to things material and not nearly enough to things spiritual.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Christ Jesus foretold the deceitfulness of lying “signs and wonders” in the “last days”. (Matthew 24:24) He also said: &quot;Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more.”. (John 14:19) Furthermore, the fact that the vision took the form of the heathen cross and not a tree or stake, as the original Grdek word </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">stauros</span><span class="font10"> and also the Hebrew Scriptures show the death instrument to be, proves the vision’s demon origin. It sprang from the same source as the cross the murderous Constantine saw in a vision, which converted him to the so-called “Christian” religion. Such demon-originated visions are for the purpose of distorting and nullifying God’s Word and strengthening the religious grip of the wicked spirits on the people. They even appear as 'angels of light’.—2 Corinthians 11:13-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Demonism via Spiritism</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Of the unnumbered brands of religion the Devil supplies to herd humanity into demon control, spiritism is one of-the most obvious. Total war with its millions of fatalities has ushered in a boom in the field of spiritualism. A reporter for the London </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">News Chronicle</span><span class="font10"> writes on this point:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are now more than a million Spiritualists in Britain, according to Mr. Frank Hawken, secretary of the Marylebone Spiritualist Association, which claims to be the largest society of its kind in this country. He gave me the figure last night as an indication of how Spiritualism has spread since the beginning of the war. He estimates that a number of the new Spiritualists are people suffering from war bereavements. He says: “When a person comes up against a bereavement what can the church offer? Only hope. Whereas, we Spiritualists can offer communication with the lost ones on the other side.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But can they? “The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go down into </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">silence.&quot;</span><span class="font10"> (Psalm 115:17) No voice has yet sounded out of the silence of the tomb. Jehovah God’s Word of truth is very' emphatic that the soul dies and loses all thought and knowledge and wisdom. (Sec Psalm 146: 4; Ecclesiastes 3:18-20; 9:5,10; Ezekiel 18:4,20.) Still, it is not denied that spiritualistic seances do make contact with invisible forces, and that voices are heard. Jehovah condemns the practice, saying: “And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, arid that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God?” (Isaiah 8:19) The wicked spirits impersonate the dead and delude the living into believing Satan’s lie 'in Eden as to an undying soul within man.—Genesis 2:17; 3:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Though condemned by God, such contacts with the wicked spirits are condoned and dignified by worldly courts. The New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">World-Telegram, </span><span class="font10">June 19, 1944, reported:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Although “challenged” by science and regarded with skepticism by the “community generally”, spiritualism (the belief in the power of communicating with the spirits of the dead) today “has been elevated to the dignity of a religion” in an interpretation of an executive act of New York state. This was re-emphasized in a decision handed down by Magistrate Francis M. Giaecone, former deputy fire commissioner, who dismissed a fortune-telling charge brought by the police department's legal bureau against Mrs. Marion Miller, a spiritualist medium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The magistrate, in citing precedents for his opinion, referred to the witch of Endor. The earth is now being overrun by modern “witches of Endor”, and the mounting list of war dead is responsible. The distraught people, ignorant of the Bible truth on the state of the dead and their resurrection hope, and ignorant of Satan’s device of his unseen demons impersonating the deceased, turn in ever-increasing numbers to spirit mediums. The inevitable result is a farther drifting from God and a closer bondage in demon chains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Non- religions” Mediums</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Many people are not “'religious”, within the commonly accepted meaning of that term. To ensnare them the sly adversary has a host of spirit mediums operating without any connection whatsoever with “religion”. All are familiar with the stories of seances where tables tip, objects fly about the room, ghostly hands or other visions appear, and the medium wizard mutters messages from the beyond. Accompanying these stories of weird happenings is a chorus of cries of “Trickery! Fake! Faker!” Recently the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Header’s Digest</span><span class="font10"> condensed a copyright article from </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The American Mercury</span><span class="font10"> entitled “Calling All Spirits”. The opening paragraph read :</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hark to the gabble of ghostly voices! Give ear to the mumbo jumbo of vapid prophecy! The spirit mediums are in town again, yopr town and’my town, trading on the gullibility of bereaved and lonely souls. Forlorn widows, restless wives, and mothers with boys overseas are the special victims of these catchpenny charlatans who profess to pierce the veil between today and tomorrow and to bring back messages from beyond the grave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The article continues on to show the humbuggery of unscrupulous fakers, and infers that the whole business of mediums is just that. Undoubtedly the vast majority of seance meetings are pre-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">dominantly faked and based on trickery. But the inclination to class all as the product of clever tricks by magicians is dangerous. The very cry of “Fake” is turned to the Devil’s use. It causes the curious to attend seances “for fun”, being lulled to sleep by the belief that , lit is only trickery. What started as . supposed entertainment may culminate in the thrill-seeker’s becoming possessed by the demons. Thus Satan’s net catches - more victims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">„Pope Blesses Spiritist</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Perhaps the outstanding spirit medium, so far as the records disclose, was Daniel Home, of the nineteenth century. His amazing feats took all Europe and ; England by storm. Nor was it the uneducated that were ensnared. Famous writers, scientists, nobility, all were captivated by Home’s weird feats. During his trances his body would lengthen by many inches, float out a window of one room and enter another room through a window, his hands would dip up glowing embers from a fireplace and his head would be buried in them, and the spirits possessing him would perform the uncanny rappings and other demonstrations characteristic of seances. Among his admirers ■were Napoleon III and Empress Eugenie. Skeptics came to see wherein he faked: they left convinced of his prowess. Scientists conducted strict tests to trap him: they were rendered profoundly thoughtful and mystified. No one ever detected any trickery. So do not dismiss all spirit mediums as fakes. To deny the existence of witchcraft is to deny the truth of God’s Word, -which condemns its practice. But Pope Pius IX did not condemn; he condoned. More than that, he even went so far as to bless. An excerpt from an article on Home in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reader's Digest, J</span><span class="font10">uly, 1944, reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Pope Pius IX (Home, during his career, became a Roman Catholic) gave him an audience, asked many questions, dismissed him with his blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Closely allied to the fortune-telling spirit mediums are the pseudo scientists of astrology. These demon-controlled ones claim that the stars influence human affairs and that their positions foretell terrestrial events. Astrology flourished in the ancient pagan lands of Babylon and Egypt. Its practice is forbidden by the One who bedecked the heavens with these astral bodies: “Babylon, . . . thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee. Behold, they be as stubble; the fire shall burn them.” (Isaiah 47:1,13,1.4; 2 Kings 21:3) These monthly prognosticators with their twelve signs of the zodiac and horoscope-eastings will render no more good than did the astrologers and stargazers of doomed Babylon. Yet in these war years educated persons flock to them. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Christian Century,</span><span class="font10"> January 12, 1944, describes the trend:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In a time like this the future is full of foreboding. There is a restless desire to know what is around the corner; to what one may look forward. This roots back in fear and anxiety. Here belong, in addition to the religious cults which minister to this desire, the whole list of fortune tellers, diviners, crystal gazers, tea-leaf readers, numerologists and astrologers. There has perhaps never been a time in modern history when this class of seers flourished more than at present. Even supposedly conservative newspapers are printing astrological columns, for astrology has recently become, literally, big business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Even the field of entertainment is invaded by the demons in their all-out blitz to enslave all peoples of all classes. Take games, for instance. There is the ouija board. Its inventor was a toy manufacturer in Baltimore. Department stores assure the customers that it is only a game. Its name comes from the French “oui” and the German “ja”, both words meaning “yes”. The New York</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font10"> magazine recently correctly stated what the ouija craze is. It said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In spite of airmail, V-mail and soldier franks, America has returned to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">spiritualism </span><span class="font8">as a speedy and exciting means of war-time communication. Between February and June, 1944, one New York department store alone has sold more than 50,000 ouija boards to credulous and incredulous customers. This is strictly a 1944 development, since last year there were few calls. ... It is reported that murders have been committed on its say-so. On those rare and gory occasions the board, it seems, could see no other way out of the predicament for its questioner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Reporting on a similar wave of popularity in Chicago, the Chicago </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Sun</span><span class="font10"> concluded its write-up, saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You might almost say that ouija boards have gone to war, by remote control of course. Right now they’re presiding over the various battlefronts, directing the destinies of armies and nations, curing soldiers with the efficiency of plasma.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">From games, turn to music. It is an admitted fact that the music produced during this war is far less valuable than that of the last world war. It lacks the qualities that make music last. But it is not just this. Ultramodern music, with its predominance of nerve-shattering brass, turns the dancers of this jazz age into demonized “hep cats”, as they are called. Their music is as maddening as the weird African jungle chants, and the antics of these modern maniacs rival the bodily contortions of the dusky dancers led by a bounding witch doctor. It is claimed that when the “jitterbugs” are under the spell of their “music” and in full frenzy they do feats otherwise physically impossible. They are temporarily obsessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Snares for the Intelligentsia</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But still there are many people too intelligent to countenance African voodooism, too refined to cavort as do the Holy Rollers and Pentecostals, too skeptical to submit themselves to spirit-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY 3, IMS </span><span class="font10">ualism, too well informed to be drawn into the snares of mediums, too busy to dabble with ouija boards, and too sensible to “jitterbug”. If these foregoing demon traps are too crude for the elite, then subtle Satan knows how to lure them under the control of the same demons that foster these practices. He merely gives his mediums such euphemistic names as “master mentalists”. And this, also, is in the field of entertainment Keeping some of his activities in this classification surrounds them with an air of harmless and innocent fun. The unwary are taken captive at Satan’s will.—2 Timothy 2: 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Foremost in the public eye at present is Joseph Dunninger, who is creating a mild sensation in radio circles with his feats of mind reading. So far investigators have been baffled in their endeavors to trap him. Mr. Dunninger disclaims any aid from the spirits; he takes full credit to himself. He has even challenged the spiritualistic phen&amp;mena of the mediums. Thus many who would not stoop to spiritism are nevertheless attracted to him. Whether he knows it or not, he is a tool in the hands of the demons, and those who are his fans leave themselves open to demon assaults.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mind reading is not one of the inherent powers of man. Spirit creatures, however, can perceive man’s imvard thoughts. The Great Spirit, Jehovah God, speaking to His typical nation, said: “I know the things that come into your mind, every one of them.” Again, “The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man.” (Ezekiel 11:5; Psalms 94:11; 49:11; 139:2; 1 Chronicles 28:9) The evidence also indicates that the wicked spirits can, with limitations, read man’s mind. But can one man read the mind of another man, w’ithout the aid of the supernatural? Let those who will heed the affirmative answer of Mr. Dunninger, yet God’s infallible Word sounds the reliable truth: “For who among men knows a man’s thoughts, except the man’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">9</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">own spirit within him I&quot; (1 Corinthians 2:11, Weymouth’s translation) Mr. Dunninger and others like him not only rejid minds; they also project thoughts into the minds of others. Both feats are . impossible without demon aid, and those 'dabbling therein are submitting to spiritism, whether they realize it or not. •, The audiences of such “master mental-ists” number into the' millions. The demons’ victim toll mounts that much . &nbsp;&nbsp;” higher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Education and Science</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Enlarging their activities by spreading out from the field of entertainment, the demqns invade the more serious field of education with telepathy. The follow' ing appeared' in the Washington </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Star,</span><span class="font10"> March 14, 1941:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Dr. John Edward Bentley, head of American University’s psychology department, set educators agog four months ago by instituting a course in telepathy and clairvoyance for girls and lads of the campus, he insisted he was a complete skeptic about his own project. Today he is “thrilled” by some of the results shown. He asserts that he spends hours each week successfully sending out brain waves to a group of 15 students gathered in 'a dingy room at Hurst Hall. . . . Dr. Bentley, one-time Boston Methodist preacher who turned to writing books on problem children and philosophy, is conducting his present series of mind-reading experiments in collaboration with Dr. Whatley Carington of Cambridge University, England, he said. Results will soon be shipped across the Atlantic for study and Dr. Bentley only hopes they won’t be torpedoed. He was born in Yorkshire, England, himself and declares that the British are investigating telepathy as never before, despite the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">More evidence of demon inroads on education, this time in the form of an Associated Press dispatch from Philadelphia, dated October 6, 1944:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All eyes in the suburban Springfield township high school auditorium focused on D. K. Ernst, hypnotist, as he began a demon. stration of the power of the subconscious mind. Thirty-five students, acting as subjects, stared at a spot on the ceiling as Ernst waved his hands. Suddenly there was hysterical laughter, sobbing, and more than thirty students in the audience collapsed. The demonstration ended abruptly and for nearly two hours a school physician, nurse and hypnotist worked to snap them out of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Climb still higher up the “social ladder” of civilization to the respected and highly educated doctors and scientists of the ultramodern world. Far below this pinnacle is the “poor savages’” witch doctor, you say? Read the following amazing confession, published in the March 19,1944, issue of the Baltimore </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Sun:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Psychiatry Traveling Way </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">ov </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Primitive Witch Doctor</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Methods of primitive medicine men in curing or alleviating mental ills of their fellow-tribesmen have been closely studied in recent years by medical historians and anthropologists, who have uncovered striking comparisons with the work of today’s psychiatrists. One fact firmly established by the studies is that medicine men—“witch doctors” —have exerted more powerful curative or destructive influences upon the minds of their patients or victims than are ordinarily, if ever, available to psychiatrists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Two authorities of the Johns Hopkins Medical School have collected a vast amount of data on this subject, much of it now included in a voluminous work titled “Bulletin of the History of Medicine”. The findings of Dr. Henry E. Sigerist, professor of the history of medicine, and of Dr. Erwin H. Ackerknecht, an anthropologist, together with those of other scientists, are extending the views of those interested in the treatment of mental ills, and go far toward clearing the medicine man of suspicion of charlatanism [or convicting modern medics of it]. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The songs [of the medicine man] were in rhythmic, soothing sing-song. Very often they sent the patient into semi-hypnotic sleep; when he awakened he was refreshed and in good spirits. This is an example of primitive man’s use of hypnosis in treating mental ills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The medicine man knew that this practice might benefit the patient but not why, unlike the modern psychiatrist, who uses it scientifically. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Scientists agree, of course, on the vast cleavage between psychiatry of the aborigines and that of this more enlightened world. The belief of primitive man in the powers of the supernatural as represented by the medicine man or witch doctor was unquestioning; and that is why he was prey to curses and open to cures. He could be killed or cured by simply believing. The sincerity of the primitive medicine man or witch doctor is another phase of the study. Dr. Aekerkneeht concludes that the majority of medicine men were sincere and believed in their supernatural powers. Their rituals are popularly considered hocus-pocus. But Dr. Aekerkneeht believes that their ceremonies were symbolic; that the rituals carried the same implications for tribesmen religious ceremonies carry’ for those who believe in them today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Also an article by Dr. Irving Sr Cutter appeared in the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News,</span><span class="font10"> December 7, 1943, stating that interest in hypnotism is high, that many doctors find it useful, and that many cures have been effected by it. A report on Joseph Dunninger, previously mentioned, in the January issue of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Reader’s Digest,</span><span class="font10"> discloses that he has been used by physicians in at least three hospitals to hypnotize patients. So the antics bf witch doctors, long recognized as demoniacal, are lifted into the realm of modern science and garnished with impressive, technical phraseology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To round out the picture of the demons’ encroachments in the lofty field of science, two more evidences are cited. Australia’s No. 1 radio scientific executive is convinced of the possibility of communication with the dead, via radio. (Iteported in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Radio News,</span><span class="font10"> June, 1944.) All this learned gentleman, Sir Ernest Fisk, need do to get widespread support from scientists is to prove the Devil’s lie that the dead are not dead, but alive. (Genesis 3:4) The second evidence is seen in the paragraph quoted below, taken from the article “Limbo Calling”, printed in the February, 1944, issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Coronet:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">V nobstructed Vniverse</span><span class="font8"> is a carefully-authenticated record of some 40 conversations that Stewart Edward White had with Betty White after her burial, The book, published on October 14, 1940, went into its ninth printing April 14, 1943, and is still selling briskly around a war-rocked planet. Broadly speaking, it is about spiritualism, but it is so utterly divorced from the trumpet-in-the-dark school of the supernatural [so designed to appeal to and catch‘so-called “intellectuals”] that Booth Tarkington, for instance, calls it “one of the most important books ever written on what is to all people the most important of all subjects”. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The book is regarded by some scientists as the key io a new and higher form of physics.</span><span class="font8"> [Italics ours]</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Whither, World Rulers?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For final consideration have been reserved world rulers. That class occupies a vital place in human affairs. They are extolled by fawning religionists as “the higher powers”, and as rulers by divine right. It is all-important that the people know the path their leaders are treading, and especially on the eve of man’s <sub>x</sub> most ambitious governmental experiment, the postwar “new' order”. Invisible forces back them. Jesus said, “He that is not with me is against me.” (Matthew 12: 30) None of them are “on the fence”: they are either on God’s side or in Satan’s camp. Where do world rulers stand </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font10"> Do they try to stem the rising tide of demonism? or are they swept along with the maddening flood? Finally, is there a power capable of breaking the chains forged by the invisible demons? and, if so, what is it, and will it so exercise itself in man’s behalf? An article entitled “Spirits of Devils to the Kings of the Earth” in the next issue of this magazine .will present evidence answering in full the foregoing questions.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>The Undesired Medal</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font10">HE Mercer £Pa.) post of the Amer-_ ican Legion has made it an annual practice to award a medal each year to the boy and girl of the eighth grade who 'daest meet the qualities of scholarship, ponesty, courage, leadership and Americanisin’. The students to be so honored, are to be selected by the teachers and fellow students. The awards are to be ’ presented by the Legion and Legion Auxiliary as part of the eighth grade ’graduation program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The girl to receive the award in 1944 was found to be Nina Smith. She is one of Jehovah’s witnesses, as are also her sister, brother and parents. The Legion decided this must be changed, as it would be a crime to give Nina the medal of a noble organization like the Mercer post of the Legion. When Nina’s name was presented by the school officials to the Legion the un-American members of the Legion got together and held a secret powwow. They mapped out a course of action that was anything but American. It had none of the qualities of scholarship, honesty, courage, leadership and Americanism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">They approached Nina’s teachers with a brilliant plan. The teachers were told that Nina could not have been first choice, since she was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. They must take back her name and give the Legion the name of the second choice. If anyone should ask any questions, then it could simply be explained away by saying that a recount of the ballots had been made and that Marianne Boyd was now first and Nina was second. The good name of the Legion must never be mentioned as having suggested such a thing. S-s-sh!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But the teachers, headed by Mrs. Howard Glenn, w’ere honest, and the Legion’s demands were refused. The boys had not thought of that, so it was here that the feet of the wicked began to slide. June 1, graduation day, came. Legion members with some sense, but no courage, were conspicuous by their absence. An honest Auxiliary member was then faced with the task of either presenting the award to Nina or not presenting it to anyone. She thought Nina should have it, and appeared on the stage, making the presentation. No sooner w<sup>T</sup>as the program over than great pressure was placed upon her to get that award back from Nina and to give it to Marianne. It was gladly returned. Marianne refused it, even though she did possess all the qualities it called for. The Legion now has the medal, but they are looking for someone to whom they may give it, because the public have been suggesting that </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">they</span><span class="font10"> are not qualified to hold it, since they do not possess even one of the qualities that the medal calls for. Newspapers are not embarrassing the Legion any, as they dare not print the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">' Legion meetings are controversial these days. Honest members are asking: Why did you not tell us of this secret meeting? What did we fight for in World War I? What are the boys now fighting for? Is this the Legion’s idea of a new and better order? It is altogether possible that membership may. take a drop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is here suggested that the Legion don school clothes and attend the eighth grade classes next year. Perhaps they might be able to learn a few things about honesty, courage, leadership, scholarship and Americanism from the teachers and children at the Mercer schools. —Elmer L. Smith, Pennsylvania.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Ephraem Syrus and the Codex Ephraemi</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">E</span><span class="font10">PHRAEM (e'fra-em) (Ephram or Ephrem or Ephraim) the Syrian is of interest to students of God’s Word because, about eight centuries ago, someone copied a portion of his works over one of the oldest and best-made manuscripts of the Bible that have come down from ancient times. By this means scholars have access to 209 elegantly written leaves which embrace all of the “New Testament”, with some of the “Old”. Now for something about Ephraem himself, who lived A.D, 306-373.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This man of prodigious industry was born at the city of Nisibis, a city of some 55,000 people, once on a main route from Persia to Greece and now a railway station on the line which runs from the Persian gulf to the Mediterranean sea. It is 120 miles west of the ruins of Nineveh, on the Tigris, and about the same distance east of Haran, whence Abraham left Mesopotamia for the Promised Land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Nisibis, now called Nusaybin, or Nisi-bin, is one of those places where scores of battles have been fought between the east and the west, and between the north and the south, and the people have been ruled by a great variety of governments. Just at present, the place is in Turkey, on the border of Syria. In the year 363 (A.D.) there was a war on between the Roman and Persian governments, and, as usual, Nisibis was in the midst of the fracas, and when the Roman government was beaten and the city was ceded by the emperor Jovinian to the Persians the Syrians or Armenians concluded to leave en masse for safer quarters to the west, and did so, and Ephraem went with Diem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Within a year or so Ephraem settled in Edessa, some thirty miles or so from Haran, and went on with the work to which he was devoted, that of proclaiming the gospel of Jehovah’s kingdom and helping to circulate and explain the Scriptures which bear the Kingdom message. Though most of his time after coming to Edessa was spent in writing, yet it is said of him, “When Edessa was suffering from famine, he gave assistance everywhere;' he called upon the rich to help the poor and he himself undertook the care of seeing that the poor received what was intended for them.” Those who know something about how wealthy Cardinal O’Connell was when he died, and the great success that he made of his fight </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font10"> child labor and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">against</span><span class="font10"> child labor </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">legislation,</span><span class="font10"> ought to be able to appreciate that remark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ephraem</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> IFns </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Humble</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Humility is not a matter of hanging one’s head. Anybody can do that, though some folks would get a stiff neck if they were ever to try it. Here is a Scriptural definition:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.—Philip-pians 2:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Ephraem knew about that, and a lot of other texts that carry the same lesson, and he tried to put them in operation, with this unusual effect, from the article on his life and work in McClintock and Strong’s </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Cyclopedia,</span><span class="font10"> volume III, page 255:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">His repute for piety and learning became so great that he was elected bishop; but when he heard of it he rushed forth into the marketplace, and acted in such a manner that the people thought he was out of his senses. “He then absconded until another had been appointed to the office of bishop in his place.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In these days one could almost imagine a man pulling every kind of wire to get himself elected a “bishop”, but the number that would take to the woods after they got the job, and hide out till the excitement was over, and see some other man get it, is so small that if the story got into the daily papers few would believe it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">' The chroniclers say that Ephraem had a “naturally irascible temper”, which, of course, is a bad actor; but Peter seems tq_have had one when he clipped the ear off the servant of the high priest, and Jonah must have had something of the %e.ort when he got angry because Nineveh jdidn’t go up in smoke- at the end of the <sub>v</sub> rorty days. Having a bad temper is like having a big nose. If one has it, one has it The owner has to mentally mark it , / &quot;&nbsp;“Handle with care”.' Anyway, Ephraem <sup>4</sup> is said to have had it, but tried to keep •it out of sight. On one occasion he had been fasting; a servant brought him food. and, being nervous, dropped the dish and the food. The servant was overcome with shame and terror, but Ephfaem arose to the occasion, saying: “Take courage; as the food has not come to ps, we will go to it.” Whereupon, saith the record, “Ephraem sat down on the floor, and ate the fragments left in the broken dish.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Almighty God hates pride worse than He hates anything else. Ephraem knew about that and so he ordered in his will that “no one should praise him, according to the common practice, in a funeral oration, that his body should not be wrapped up in costly robes, and that no monument should be erected on his tomb”. It may, perhaps, be added that these things show he had good common sense, and this is substantially the practice regarding deaths and burials at the headquarters of Jehovah’s organization in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ephraem</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Bets </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Obedient</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Sufficient has been adduced to show that Ephraem had a good sense of justice; he thought that in times of famine those of God’s people who have means should make it their business to aid those that need assistance and who, after they have done the best they can, are hardly able to get to the top of the hill without a little wisely-applied aid. He knew about the good Samaritan. He was also humble, as just set forth. And, in addition, and a very necessary addition, he was also obedient, i.e., he was eager to do Jehovah’s will; he was not a slacker, not a bluffer, not a barnacle, not a dreamer; he was a worker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Ephraem knew how to write; and did he write! There is no information that he knew any other language than Syriac, but he knew that and wanted every Syrian to become familiar with God’s Word. So, one of the jobs that he set for himself was to explain the whole Bible in Syriac. So he wrote a complete Bible commentary, from Genesis to Revelation, and (and this is important) he omitted the apocryphal books, such as Esdras, Judith, Wisdom, Baruch, Susanna, Bel, Manasses, Maccabees, etc. His commentary on Genesis and most of Exodus is still extant in Syriac; and condensations of all the books are also preserved in the same tongue. Another account says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“His commentaries extended over the whole Bible, ‘from the book of creation to the last book of grace/ as Gregory of Nyssa says. We have his commentaries on the historical and prophetical books of the Old Testament and the book of Job in,Syriac, and his commentaries on the epistles of Paul in an Armenian translation. They have been but little used thus far by commentators. Ho does not. interpret the text from the original Hebrew, but from the old Syriac translation, the Peshito, though he refers occasionally to the original. His sermons and homilies, of which, according to Photius, he composed more than a thousand, are partly expository, partly polemical, against Jews, heathen, and heretics. They evince a considerable degree of popular eloquence; they are full of pathos, exclamations, apostrophes, antitheses, illustrations, severe rebuke, and sweet comfort, according to the subject; but also full of exaggerations, bombast, prolixity, and the superstitions of his age, such as' the overestimate of ascetic virtue, and excessive veneration of the Virgin Mary, the saints, and relics. Some of his sermons were publicly read after the Bible lesson in many Oriental, and even Occidental churches.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ephraem Rendered Real Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The foregoing comment on Ephraem’s work could hardly be described as flattering, and he has been handed other like compliments about other work that he did. For instance, the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia</span><span class="font10"> says that “Sozomen pretends that Ephraem wrote 3,000,000 verses”. It was not foolish enough to accept such a wild estimate, for it is known that most of Ephraem’s writing was done at Edessa in the last ten years (3,652 days) of his life, which, at eight hours a day, would have been an output of 100 verses an hour; and nobody could do it. The McClintock and Strong </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Cyclbp&amp;dia</span><span class="font10"> says: “It is reported that he wrote no less than three hundred thousand verses. But, with the exception of his commentaries, all his Syriac works are written in verse.” That would cut the output down to 10 verses an hour, and it is still too much. Somebody has been' padding the record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Nevertheless, Ephraem’s work, much of it, volumes and volumes' of Bible comments and sermons and hymns, still exist, and that he was industridus to the last degree and tried to honor God’s name, even though he was much mixed up, cannot be questioned. What peculiar service to the truth did he then render? The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Britannica</span><span class="font10"> puts it all in a nutshell when it says, in volume VIII, page 645:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">His commentary on the gospels is of great importance in connection with New Testament textual history,' for the text on which it was based was that of the Diatessaron.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It only remains to draw the reader’s attention to the fact that this subject is treated at considerable length in the article entitled “Tatian and the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Diatessaron<sup>1</sup>',</span><span class="font10"> published in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font10"> No. 643, issue of May 10, 1944. Jehovah used the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Diatessaron</span><span class="font10"> as a sort of bridge for the safe conduct of the gospel of the Kingdom to the Syrian common people until such time as the Syriac Peshitta version was brought into general use. And He used Tatian and Ephraem to fulfill His </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY 3,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">purposes in that regard, and it is clear that their labor was not in vain in the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The special value of the Ephraem Manuscript oi; Codex Ephraemi is not in that it is a manuscript of the writings of Ephraem Syrus. It is basically and originally a handwritten copy of the original Greek Scriptures and which was produced about the fifth century after Christ, But later, about the twelfth century, someone who thought more of Ephraem’s writings than of the inspired Scriptures themselves, and who was short of parchment material, scraped or rubbed out the original G reek Scriptures from the parchment and wrote over them a Greek translation of some works of Ephraem the Syrian. For this reason it is called Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus, and because of the erasure of the original text it is called a “palimpsest”, meaning “scraped again”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The manuscript was recovered from the East early in the sixteenth century, and in the following century was noticed to be a rewritten codex. By means of a chemical preparation applied to it in 1834 the original, writing of the Greek Scriptures was brought out with fair legibility, and thereby an ancient Greek manuscript of about the fifth century was recovered for use by Bible scholars in textual criticism. This was written in uncial (or all-capital) Greek letters, and is referred to by Bible text critics under the capital letter “C”. In </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Emphatic Diaglott-,</span><span class="font10"> in the footnotes thereof on the text and translation of The Apocalypse, or Revelation, the readings of the Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus are given under the letter “C”. (See page 813, footnotes, thereof.) The codex sets out portions of the Greek Septuagint on 64 leaves, and portions of every part of the so-called “New Testament” on 145 leaves. In general characteristics it compares with the Alexandrine Manuscript of the fifth century.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>' Eeclesiaslicism Tempted</span></h5>
<p><span class="font10">WTHCCLESIASTICISM” as a term , J—i applies to all religious denomina-.tions, Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish, which have teamed up with the financial and political 'elements of the earth to form the governing or controlling factors to rule humankind. To these ecclesiastics ■ the <sup>c</sup>^god of this world”, Satan the Devil, ' has presented the three great temptations, which like temptations he also presented to Eve. She yielded and fell. The same three temptations were presented to Jesus by the Devil, but He resisted them all and gained the victory. They have been presented to the ecclesiastical systems, and the facts show these have all fallen to the wiles of the Devil and have become a part of his worldly organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">James 1:13-15 sets forth that God does not tempt anyone to worldliness. “Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death,” The desire of those ecclesiastical leaders for honor and power was what led them into temptation and fall into worldliness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jesus Christ is the great Shepherd of the flock of God. (Hebrews 13:20) In the organization of the church of God, Jehovah provided for undershepherds, designating them as overseers and teachers. Upon these are enjoined the duty and obligation of feeding the flock of God, to unselfishly look well to the interest of the sheep, and not to lord it over the Lord’s people. (1 Pet. 5:2-4) Contrary to God’s Word or Bible, the religious elders and shepherds of the denominational systems and cults have organized councils, synods, presbyteries, and like bodies politic, and have elected their own members to the high offices of pope, cardinal, bishop, doctor of divinity, reverend, etc., and thus formed and created what are termed the “ecclesiastics” of “Christendom”, the high personages in the cults and sects, Catholic and Protestant. God did not tempt these men to do that. Of their own desire they were led to these steps. They thereby laid themselves open to the great tempter, who promptly presented to them temptations similar to those presented to Eve and Adam apd later to Jesus Christ; namely, “the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life,” which are not of the Father Jehovah, but are of this world.—1 John 2:15,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As to the &quot;lust of the flesh [or body]”, the power gained by the ecclesiastics by reason of their position in their religious organizations they have used for their own selfish purposes. They have fed themselves and let the flock of God go without attention. (Ezekiel 34:8) Selfishly they have advanced their own private interests, permitted the people to go without spiritual food, and thereby prevented them from entering into the kingdom of God. So, yielding to the temptation to use their powers for selfish purposes to feed themselves, they fell to the temptation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As to the “lust of the eyes [or mind] ”: Desiring to possess the seductive things of this world, and to be admired by men rather than to be approved by God, the clergy have yielded to the lust of the eyes; they have clothed themselves in scarlet and long, flowing robes, decked themselves with jewels, and have arrogantly assumed a form of godliness while denying the power thereof. They fell ready victims to this temptation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As to the “pride of life”: Jesus instructed His representatives to preach the Kingdom gospel and to await patiently His second coming, when He would enter upon His kingdom. He admonished them to keep themselves separate from the world. The ecclesiastics, or clergy, have boldly assumed to represent the Lord God on the earth. Satan held before them the temptation that, as such, they could establish the kingdom of God on earth withput waiting for the second coming of Christ; the condition required being that they should join hands with the commercial and political powers of earth, that were already under Satan’s control. This appealed to the clergy’s pride of life. To them it was a wonderful thing to bring the capitalists and the politicians into their religious systems. They yielded to the seductive temptation; they set about immediately to obtain control and rulership of the wuirld, without the aid of the Lord God and contrary to His Word, the Holy Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The clergy came up against the conditions and they have failed. They have worshiped the Devil, sanctified wars of aggression, such as Mussolini’s assaults on Ethiopia and Albania, have acted as military recruiting officers for totalitarian dictators, and have resorted to other devilish methods to gain their selfish and ambitious ends. They have ignored God and the Lord Jesus, and have waxed rich and powerful, and have done all this while associated with their allies and under the direction of the super-mind of Satan, “the god of this world.” They have,fallen to the temptation, and have carried out their part of his arrangement to blind the people to God’s purposes. They stand selfconf essediy guilty before God and man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The ecclesiastics, namely, popes, cardinals, bishops, reverends, doctors of divinity, and theological professors, have claimed the exclusive right and authority to interpret the Scriptures, and presumptuously deny the right of any so-called “layman” to preach the gospel except such one be ordained by them. They have set aside the pure doctrines of God’s Word, and have constituted themselves (through their various organizations, of course) the fountains of doctrines. These doctrines they have sent forth as a river, claiming such to be a life-giving stream for the benefit of the people, whereas in truth and in fact theirs has been a message of fraud and deceit and a stream of spiritual sickness and death. By these false and deceptive doctrines the people have been blinded to God’s purpose, and His provision for salvation has been hid from their eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Claiming for themselves the exclusive authority to interpret the Scriptures, for a long time the ecclesiastics have kept and strive to keep the people in ignorance of the text of the Bible by discouraging them in studying it directly. But now in this day of greater education, when the people can read and might read and understand the [Scriptures, these ecclesiastical leaders boldly and flippantly deny the inspiration of the Word of God or make it of none effect by their traditions and philosophies. Foreknowing that this would be the fatal course they would take, Jehovah God caused His prophet Jeremiah to write concerning them: “They have forsaken me the fountain of living waters [the source of life and truth], and hewed them out cisterns [man-made systems of doctrine], broken cisterns, that can hold no water [really hold no life-giving truth].” (Jeremiah 2:13) Striking out on such an unscriptural course, they have had no other way to go than to fall right into the trap of the Devil and to succumb to his temptations. It therefore behooves the common people, the so-called </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">laity, </span><span class="font10">to compare their teachings and practices with the written Word of God and to see how they have departed from it and yielded to Satan’s temptations ; and then the common people will discern the reason for abandoning such fallen ecclesiastics and turning to the Lord God and His Word and Kingdom.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Reconstruction Follows in Religion’s Wake</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">Assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses for the Year 1944 Climaxed by Canadian Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font10">ORLD-BUILDERS are now busying themselves in earth’s affairs. <sub>s</sub>, That a reconstruction work relative to I'the present world “order” is a vital need * all wjjl agree. But beyond this initial </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font10"> step disagreement takes over. Questions demanding decision press forward in - rapid succession: Who shall be the recon* structor^? Whose backing must they * have if their efforts are to be crowned with success ? What must be the foundation principles upon which they build? What progress toward reconstruction has been made? Do the fruits of the ' builders’ labors make them known as freedom-lovers or as total-state-idol-izers? The present is the time for wideawake realists to search out the answers. Men posing as world-builders are much in the news. Their schemes for a world organization to hold the international family of nations together are much discussed. One politician calls 'out for a world superstructure to control and hold in line members of the family. Another moves to set up spheres of im fluence and balance of power, thus dividing the house against itself by pitting one family member against another. A chorus of small voices cry for a revived league of nations wherein all members, large and small, can make themselves heard with effect. Stronger voices lean toward what amounts to a three-power, world-dominating rule. High-sounding charters of freedoms are heralded with much fanfare, all the while personal liberty shrinking with every expanding of the power of the state. And out of the already confusing picture comes the insistent cry of religion that she must be the foundation upon which to build and cement together the “new world order”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The only true world-builder is left out of the schemes of self-centered men. That One is Jehovah God, Creator of worlds. With himself He has associated a Master Workman, Christ Jesus. They are the all-important Ones; only their backing will spell success for Godly reconstructors. And do not be deceived: the addition of “more religion” to the recipe will not constitute a draft upon God and make Him a party to the confusing muddle. (1 Corinthians 14:33) Then let us turn attention from the vanities of men and focus it upon the Source of lasting reconstruction, Jehovah, the King of eternity. In the limited time and space at our disposal we limit our vision to some assemblies of earthly servants of The Theocrat. There answers to the previously raised questions will be found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reconstructors Theocratic Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Particularly is this true with respect to a recent assembly in the Dominion of Canada. Even the name of the gathering was significant, it being “Reconstructors Theocratic Convention”. The theme pervading the two-day assembly was one of reconstruction. It was doubly appropriate in that northern Dominion. How so? For more than three years freedom to worship God had been snuffed out in that land. Religion, with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in the lead, had been extremely active in trying to reconstruct the reigns of the Dark Ages and Middle Ages. Religious politicians bowed to her selfish will and banned the Christian worship of Jehovah’s witnesses. The crop she hoped to reap was no new and better order of things, but a revival of the “Holy Roman Empire” was her devilish aim. She failed, and the true reconstruction work surged ahead irresistibly, by leaps and bounds. And just what is that work? The convention Jehovah’s witnesses held in Toronto, Ont., on. November 11 and 12, 1944, disclosed it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The announcement of a Canadian convention for Jehovah’s witnesses was received with much joy. It was to be their first large assembly since pre-ban days; also, for the first time in more than ten years a president of the international Bible Students Association, a legal corporation of Jehovah’s witnesses, was to be present. His announced subject for discussion at the public meeting on Sunday, November 12, was “One World, ' One Government”. Preparations for the event went on apace. Massey Hali was engaged for Saturday all day and for Sunday morning. Sunday afternoon the Convention was to move into the spacious Maple Leaf Gardens. Inasmuch as this modei*n arena accommodates some 15,000 persons, its rental opened the way for thousands of the public to attend. Hence advertising was the order of the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">lieconstructors Advertise!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah’s ministers plunged into it with the zeal peculiar to them. Early and late they worked on signs, prepared by hand, by silk screen, by printing press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Leaflets by the thousands were printed. At a given signal the Theocratic advertisers went into action publicly. Within a forty-mile radius of Toronto leaflet distribution began. Six thousand paper signs and three thousand window cards were provided for use in store windows and elsewhere. Nearly 27,000 placards were used by the advertisers in information-walking on the city streets, distributing some 450,000 handbills in this manner and by going from house to house. Advertising leaflets on coat lapels could be seen in every part of the city. About 150 porch signs 84 feet long were put up by persons of good-will. Fifty 15-foot signs were erected in prominent places along main thoroughfares. Massey Hall, in the heart of the downtown section of Toronto, displayed two large posters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Vehicles were called into service. Sixty overhead car signs, fifty trunk signs, 200 stenciled signs and 250 bumper signs flashed out ,the announcement “One World, One Government” to unnumbered throngs as the cars mounting them moved through the city. Four large floats were systematically toured throughout Toronto and its environs by motorcycles, while forty bicycles carrying four signs each likewise joined in the big advertising push.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The Theocratic reconstructors m Canada advertise with (1J motorcycle trailer, (2) floats behind cara, bicycles, (3) road signs, and (4) signs mounted on cars.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">Sound equipment was brought forth <sup>s</sup>.-and used for spot announcements. One J of the local radio stations beamed out the ctrll to hear discussed “One World, One Government”, its broadcasting covering southern Ontario and the northern part of the United States. Nineteen thousand persons who had signed- a petition previously for the lifting of the ban on Jehovah’s witnesses, when that totalitarian-like decree oppressed Christians in Canada, were invited by special letter to the public lecture. Six thousand two hundred other letters of invitation were sent to people who had shown good-will toward the work of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Many full-time ministers of Jehovah came to Toronto early to assist local servants in preliminary advertising work, as did also hundreds of part-time workers. As the days passed, and the numbers of arriving delegates increased, the tempo of advertising mounted. It reached its grand climax on Saturday morning, November 11. At nine o’clock the morning assembly for field service convened in Massey Hall, with wire connections to the Odd Fellows Temple and Yonge Street Kingdom Hall for overflow attendance. From this session the advertisers streamed forth by the hundreds and blanketed the Toronto vicinity with the announcement of “One World, One Government”. The people were indeed courteous and kind to the Lord’s people in every part of the city as the invitation to hear was extended to them-One visiting witness actually had the people line up in a queue in the downtown section to obtain handbills from him. If religious truth-haters had thought to suppress God’s reconstruction work through His witnesses by engineering a ban of illegality against it,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">what a rude awakening they must have suffered on this Saturday morning as in whatever direction they looked they saw the -witnesses of Jehovah proclaiming His kingdom of unity and inviting people of good-will to hear it discussed in a public lecture! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;।</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Convention's Official Opening</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">. From this survey of the advertising campaign shift attention now to Massey Hall, where, at 2:15 p.m., the conven-tioners have settled themselves for the opening session of the Reconstructors Theocratic Convention. They lifted their voices in unison in joyous song, accompanied by a well-trained 17-piece orchestra. At 2:30 p.m. the local servant of International Bible Students A ssociation in Canada, who served as convention chairman, formally opened the assembly. The four addresses that followed were a symposium focusing the light of Scripture upon the “stranger”, a term applied in olden time to non-Israelites who associated and worshiped with Jehovah’s typical nation of Israel, and who typified good-will persons of today who companion with Jehovah’s anointed remnant of witnesses and worship and serve 'with them. The existence of “strangers” was traced from Noah’s day, and their relationship to God’s organization forcefully shown. The three talks, “The Stranger and His Right,” “The Increase of Strangers,” and “The Stranger’s Right Maintained”, gradually built up to the climactic fourth of the symposium, “His Right and Obligations —Past and Present,” delivered by N. II. Knorr, president of the International Bible Students Association of London, England. Truly the “stranger” has come into his own, and in proper relationship together the “stranger” class and the anointed remnant forge ahead in the work of reconstruction. (These revealing truths are fully set forth in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font10">leading articles, issues of November 15 and December 1.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The convention ers in Canada exiting from Massey Hall after the Saturday afternoon session</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">After an intermission the Convention once again assembled in Massey Hall, this time for the evening session. Massey Hall could not accommodate the increasing throngs, however, and overflow’ audiences listened in the two other halls provided for the occasion. Following two short talks on “Organization for Postwar Work” and “Faithfulness Under Persecution”, a surprise raised to high enthusiasm the 3,500 persons assembled. The chairman stated that he had a copy of a new </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News,</span><span class="font10"> No. 14, entitled “Overcoming Fear of What Is Coming on the Earth”. He proceeded to read it to the delighted convent!oners. This snappy, twenty-minute surprise feature injected into the program drew much applause and frequent laughter as it was orally delivered. Next the audience listened in rapt attention as the president delivered the powerful lecture, “Go, Disciple All the Nations.” It stirred all consecrated servants of Jehovah to push the reconstruction work in all parts of the habitable earth, regardless of national boundaries. (The text of this discourse appears in the December 15 issue of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.)</span><span class="font10"> Immediately upon its conclusion the president announced 1.00,000 copies of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font10"> No. 14 were on hand and were released for use in the field. On this enthusing and climactic note the first day of the Reconstructors Theocratic Convention ended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">’Sunday, November 12, dawned with a flood of sunlight, a beautiful day greeting the reconstructors as they convened for the morning activities. A baptismal service made clear the import of water immersion as a symbol of consecration to do G-od’s will, and 60 candidates filed out at its conclusion to undergo such dipping. Encouraging applause from the many onlookers follow’ed them. A discourse ou “Laying Up Treasure in Heaven”, followed by the usual morning assembly for field service, and the con-yentioners once again scattered throughout the city of Toronto to preach the gospel and put the'finishing touches on . the advertising of the public meeting | scheduled for that afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Long before the zero hour, 3 p.m., throngs of people poured into Maple -Leaf Gardens, whither the Convention had now been transferred. Eleven thousand persons assembled to hear the discussion on “One World, One Government”, fully 5,000 of this number being persons of good-will from Toronto and vicinity. They had come in response to the intensive advertising campaign, and to “hear a vital message. It was a day of triumph for Jehovah’s witnesses, ■ emerging, as they were, from more than three years’ oppression under government ban. At the outset of the lecture the vast audience gave undivided attention, It was likened by one unto a vast wilderness drinking in precious rivers of water, in this case being waters of truth from God’s throne and which will bring forth fruitage to His praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The president was at his speaking best, every word being clearly understood, and the full import of every sentence being driven home by the spirit of God, the active force of Jehovah being manifest on this occasion. Ushers reported that tears of joy welled up in the eyes of many as transition from the miserable failures of this divided, fighting, dying old world was made to the glorious condition of unending peace and unity to be realized in Jehovah’s new world, a “one world” united under one government, a Theocratic government. Joy and enthusiasm reached a grand peak, when, at the conclusion, the speaker announced the lecture was on hand in booklet form, and that all present were to be favored with free copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reconstruction. Work Identified</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After a brief intermission the concluding session got under way. It was at this time that the significance of the name, /'Reconstructors Theocratic Convention,” was fully disclosed. A four-part symposium developed the argument. The addresses were “Commission of the Anointed”, “Carrying Out the Anointing,” “Raising Up the Reconstructors,” and “Reconstruction Work in Progress”. It was this series of speeches, the final one of which was presented by N. H. . Knorr, that showed clearly who the reconstructors are, who authorize^ and backs up their work, and the glorious progress made therein to date. The symposium centered around the 61st chapter of Isaiah, and the entire matter may be studied in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font10"> issues of January 1 and 15, 1945.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Religion’s teachings tear down and destroy faith in God. Her religious traditions tend to make void God’s Word and law. Religious destructors cannot share in tfie work of true reconstruetors, for the latter ones build upon the rock-like foundations of solid Bible truth, of Christ Jesus, and of Jehovah God. (Deuteronomy 32:4; 1 Corinthians 10:4; Matthew 7:24-27) Religion’s agents not only shun these enduring foundations but backslide farther by putting obstacles in the path of- those who would build securely upon them. (Matthew’ 23:13) Their stumbling stones of religious traditions and false doctrines must be gathered out and cleared away that reconstruction work upon enduring foundations may begin. The process followed is described at Jeremiah 1:10: “I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.” (See also Isaiah 62:10.) Jehovah’s witnesses, the true reconstructors, fulfill this by exposing religion’s falsities and then building up those having hearing ears by declaring the Bible truth, un-</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19450103_files/g_E_19450103-5.png" alt="" style="width:415pt;height:169pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">adulterated. And furthermore, if self-eentered men posing as world-huilders think to set up an enduring “new world order” having as its basis “more religion”', they will be building upon an unstable and sandy foundation, and will fall with their world-structure when the inevitable disastrous crash comes. Only Jehovah’s Theocracy will stand unshakable on rock foundations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">These things were thoroughly appreciated by those attending the Reconstructors Convention. Had not the witnesses survived religion’s destructive efforts to stamp them out, the truthhaters even stooping to totalitarian methods of banning free worship? Even during the blight of government ban reconstruction work forged ahead. Jehovah’s witnesses greatly increased m numbers and in activity. Tn some localities the congregations increased fivefold. Never will religious destructors prevail over Theocratic reconstructors 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In this exultant frame of mind the conventioners listened appreciatively to closing remarks by the president. Then expression was made by Canadian witnesses that the president return sometime during the year 1945 and that a much longer convention be held. The 6,000 present at this closing session rose </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">en mas.se.</span><span class="font10"> to show their desire for this. In the meantime reconstruction work moves majestically forward in Canada, unstoppable by Satanic opposers. Prayer to Jehovah God closed the glorious Convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The work of -reconstruction is earth-wide, not just limited to Canada. Before closing this article brief mention wtill be made of two other assemblies. One was at South Lansing, N. Y., one week later; the other took place in September, in Australia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bible College Forwards Reconstruction</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Located at South Lansing is Kingdom Farm, and situated on these rolling acres is the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead. There it was that N. H. Knorr, who is the president of the college, delivered by special request his stirring lecture “One World, One Government”, on November 19, 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For three weeks before the public assembly arrangements were made to greatly advertise the meeting. In that brief time all persons of good-will in the Ithaca Company territory were visited and personally extended an invitation by letter to come to the meeting. Additionally, witnesses in the near-by companies of Cortland and Auburn aided in contacting their good-will interest. Eight hundred letters were delivered.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Accommodating the Visitors</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It soon became apparent, a few days before the lecture, that there were going to be more than five hundred in attendance, which is the normal capacity of the college auditorium. So arrangements were made to obtain additional chairs for the occasion. The largest department store in Ithaca displayed their goad-will by loaning a hundred chairs. Then a call was made at Cornell University to see whether it would be possible to obtain a number of chairs from them on loan. Yes, they could rent out 400 chairs. Now the seating capacity was raised to the thousand mark. But, really would there be that many persons attending this meeting, in view of considerable prejudice in the community? All manner of stories have circulated among the people as to supposed goings on at Gilead. Curiosity might arouse many to come to see for themselves that Jehovah’s witnesses are not Nazis, etc., but that they are real Americans standing jealously for their freedom of worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">By noon several cars began to arrive. Witnesses from near-by companies came early to look over the campus and to see the farm. At one o’clock a few hundred had already arrived. Previously arrangements were made to taxi many interested persons from Ithaca the eight miles to Gilead, as there are no buses running past Gilead. By two o’clock the whole auditorium of the college was' filled. Not a seat left. The adjoining classrooms were then shortly filled, followed by the dining-room and the basement, all of which places were tied together by loud-speakers. Finally an overflow hall was arranged in Classroom C building, which is located about five hundred yards from Gilead. Here 125 packed the place to hear the afternoon’s proceedings. Loud-speakers were also placed on the roof of Gilead, to serve those standing outside, and another loudspeaker served some in the machine shop across from the C building.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">The Bible College students aiding the above three companies enabled the united group of publishers to distribute 40,000 folders. Hundreds of placards were used by information walkers in the , three small cities. (Ithaca, 21,000; Cortfland, 15,000; and Auburn, 37,000) The ‘ Cornell University radio station WHCU, at Itliaca, and station WMBO, of Auburn, made frequent free spot radio . announcements Friday, Saturday and</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Sunday before the meeting. Twelve „ newspapers in the general area of Gilead carried free articles announcing the : lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Saturday afternoon and evening (November 18) climaxed the advertising Campaign. All the Bible College* students, Kingdom Farm workers, and company publishers of the three near-by companies filled the three towns with information walkers wearing the placards and passing out handbills, in addition to motorears bedecked with advertising signs. The four-block-long main street of Ithaca was a sight to behold. Saturday afternoon was the homecoming football game of near-by Cornell University, which won a hotly contested game over Dartmouth. Late afternoon and evening the town was full of thousands of university students of both Cornell and Dartmouth, as well as football fans. But there were also students of a third college, namely Gilead, that were most picturesquely in evidence every twenty feet along both sides of the four blocks with their red and brown painted signs. A friendly atmosphere prevailed and many of the secular college students stopped to find out what this one world with one government was all about. They were told to come to the lecture to find out. One Cornell student told an advertiser that he would ‘be going to classes at Gilead on Sunday’, thus implying his intention of attending the lecture. ,</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">Promptly at 3 p.m, the meeting was opened with the joyous song “Take Sides with Jehovah”. After a brief introduction N. H. Knorr began his talk “One World, One Government”, Students, , farmers, neighbors, visiting Jehovah’s ’^witnesses and people of good-will all listened intently. The final count revealed an audience of 1,200. About 30 percent of the audience are judged to have been new interest and visiting neighboring farmers. At the close of the .lecture the new booklet containing the lecture and entitled </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">One World, One Government</span><span class="font10"> was released for the first time to an American audience,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The assembly was a real effort made ■ to extend the hand of fellowship to righteously disposed American neighbors, persons who are “strangers” seeking true worship. Gilead wishes to do its part in the reconstruction work. Many of the students mixed with the crowd after the meeting and, in discussing the Kingdom truths, placed sixty books and 113 booklets other than </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">One World, One Government.</span><span class="font10"> Many expressions of appreciation were forthcoming from Kingdom Farm’s neighbors, and it was a pleasure and privilege to Gilead College to have them as guests on the occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reconstruction Work in Australia</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The other assembly mentioned was Australia’s share in the United Announcers’ Theocratic Assembly, held world-wide in August. However, Australia did not hold theirs until September 7-10. Eight cities were tied in as participants: Sydney, Cairns, Townsville, Brisbane, Melbourne, Launceston, Adelaide, and Perth. Like Canada, the “land down under” had clamped a governmental ban on Jehovah’s witnesses, at the behest of Papal Rome’s minions; but, as in Canada, that encroachment on freedom has been removed and the witnesses were able to worship freely. Full advantage was taken of this liberty, and widespread publicity was given to the public lecture, “The Kingdom of God Is Nigh.” Their convention program followed that used internationally in August. Excerpts from the report of the Society’s representative in Australia will supply some local color:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Each morning the conventioners assembled for morning devotions. The consideration of the text, the field experiences and the opening prayer provided just the stimulus needed to make each day’s field-service campaign an outstanding success. In all, 2,481 publishers devoted 8,947 hours to the service, placing 15,953 books, booklets and magazines. In Perth alone 53 new publishers started out in the field work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The convention street-witnessing campaign was greatly blessed by the Lord. Thousands of booklets were placed on the Saturday</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">morning, and the workers returned to the halls rejoicing in their many experiences. At Launceston and Adelaide the police showed a kindly interest in the publishers and gladly accepted literature. A Launceston constable was seen later at a busy intersection directing traffic, with two Watchtower booklets in his hand. It is not so long since the possession of this literature would have branded him a criminal! In Perth a publisher hesitated to have part in the street work because she could speak only broken English. However, she went along With another publisher. It so happened that the first person they approached was also unable to speak English. Imagine the new witness’s joy when she found this person was a fellow national and she was able to give the witnessdn her own tongue!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Greeks, Italians, Spaniards and other foreign nationals were much in evidence. Some of these were among the 82 immersion candidates. But most spectacular of all convention attendees were the native Australian aborigines. A group of 16 aborigines, who accompanied a West Australian special publisher, sold their horse and rabbit traps to pay their way to Perth, and reckoned it was well worth it. One of them commented that the last day of the Assembly seemed to pass “like an hour”. On returning home they started witnessing'to the local policeman, blacksmith, and others of the community, placing much literature. The entire aborigine settlement is showing intense interest, and many are attending the weekly study in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Truth Shall Make You Free”.</span><span class="font8"> The pioneer is teaching some of them to read and write, and they appreciate that this is something their “reverend” superintendent had never essayed to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The widely advertised public lecture, “The Kingdom of God Is Nigh,” was everything to be desired as a convention climax. The thou-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">sands of people of good-will who packed the halls to overflowing also testified to their delight at the message they had heard. At the Sydney Town Hall an evangelist remarked to a publisher; “For thirty years I have preached on street corners, but at last I have 'found the truth. My colleagues will be expect-fcg me at Pitt Street tonight, but I won’t be v there, arid I’ll never be there again. What can I do to learn more?” In Melbourne a seaman told a publisher of his search for the truth , in the churches and synagogues of many lands. Never in all his life had he heard anything so powerful as “The Kingdom of God Is Nigh&quot;. Attendance at the public lecture was 7,965.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">. Forward, Reconstructors!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">' So the work of reconstruction goes on earth-wide. Religion has held sway over earth’s deluded millions for centuries. But now in her “last days” Jehovah sends in her wake His reconstructors. The message they proclaim restores and builds up faith in God on the part of people of good-will, faith that had been weakened by religion’s traditions and false doctrines and her un-Christlike course of meddling in world politics. While self-exalted and self-proclaimed world-builders among men croak out their grandiose schemes for a more religionized “new world order”, Jehovah’s faithful witnesses will continue fulfilling their commission as stated in the sixty-first chapter of Isaiah. They will continue their service as reconstructors, pointing ever to Jehovah God as the only successful wo rid-builder, and to His promised unending New World. Let the grand work go forward.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Studying </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">EHOVAH ig the great Provider of all things needful. We are all interested in food and ask Jehovah to give us our necessary food day by day. Is physical nourishment all that is implied in that? Those who seek His approval and life need something far more important to sustain them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah made the necessary provisions for Adam in the garden of Eden to sustain life in perfection. But to have lasting life man had to heed God’s word. Also, Jehovah provided food for His covenant people Israel even in the wilderness, but He made them know that ‘man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the • mouth of Jehovah doth man live’. On the same point Jesus was tested when He was tempted by the Devil in the wilderness. He refused to use His power for self-service and to make His belly His god. His eternal life wps nourished by a knowledge of God’s will and an uncompromising obedience to that will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jesus as the great Educator and Example taught His disciples the importance of this spiritual food when He said: “Aly meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.” And: “Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things 'shall be added unto you.” The physical food energizes and activates our bodies, but the body action is controlled by the mind. The spiritual food must be assimilated by the mind and change its disposition to induce a course of action in harmony with God’s purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This food cannot be seized and wasted by the Devil’s agents. They have no control over it. While they are famine-stricken, Jehovah makes a “feast of fat things” for all people in His organization. This food in due season is the material published in the Watchtower publications, and especially in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> (a companion magazine to the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font10"> and devoted exclusively to Bible study), because it comes through the “faithful and wise servant”, who looks only to Jehovah and Christ Jesus as the Teachers. Therefore it behooves everyone to give diligent study to those things which the Lord has set on His table for sustenance and upbuilding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">How should one proceed in studying </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower?</span><span class="font10"> First read the heading text, the caption text. This announces the theme treated in the article. It immediately brings to mind what one knows about the subject, the conception that he has of it, and it creates an attitude of curiosity. One is eager to find out what information this article contains that sheds light on the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If the article deals with some prophetic drama, it is well to read the whole record in the Bible first, so as to familiarize oneself with the original setting. The characters and their relationships, the time and place of the events, and the meanings of all the names, are of great significance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As one now proceeds with the reading of the article he will be alert and watch for every point bearing on the theme suggested by the caption text, how that theme is introduced in the opening paragraphs, developed in the body under the different subheadings, and brought to a climax and concluded. Much valuable information is contained in the scriptures that are just cited in support. By way of illustration, paragraph one of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> article “The Theocratic Alignment Today” (appearing in the issue of November 1, 1944) draws attention to the disappearance of proper Theocratic order within the ranks of professing Christians following the death of the apostles and their close colaborers, such as Timothy and Titus. Then it states: “This very apostasy Jesus and his apostles foretold.” Following this, in parentheses, these texts were cited but not quoted: Matthew 13: 24-30, 36-43; Acts 20:28-31,; 2 Thessalonians 2:1-3. They support and give authoritative backing to the point being made. Such supporting texts should always be -looked up and read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After finishing a paragraph one should review it by trying to answer in his own words the corresponding question at the bottom of the page. If unable to do so, he should reread, and he may want to underscore a few main points that bring out the gist of the paragraph. This will make an impression on his mind and later will serve to refresh his memory. When opportunity permits it is well to read aloud. Then a double impression is received: through both the eye and the ear. It will also give practice in emphasis. Another point: there may be a word used with which one is not so well acquainted. One should not guess at it, but turn to the dictionary and find its exact shade of meaning and pronunciation, Not only will this add to one’s own understanding, but will also increase his vocabulary, and thus enlarge his ability to present the truth to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But is such private study and meditation sufficient to digest all this instruction? Since the gaining and right application of this knowledge is of such vital importance, one should consider any supplementary means toward that end. One of such additional means to advance one’s studies is conversation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Further, the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> studies in assembly are a provision of the Lord to discuss these truths among familiar friends, those of like precious faith. They are held at all Kingdom Halls of Jehovah’s witnesses. One should not just sit in as a listener, and with that be content. Everyone who thoughtfully puts forth an effort can take part in the discussion, even though such part be very small sometimes. When answering a question one should not read a portion of the paragraph, but express in his own words the thought he has on the question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is the first chance to apply in practice some helpful point found and fixed in the mind during private study. When introducing the present study method </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> said: “It is hoped that this arrangement will aid all persons to give diligent study to those things brought forth in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font10">and that it will help them, too, to make these truths their own so that they will be able to express them to others as opportunity affords.” By giving a comment not only do we benefit ourselves, but we aid others; and to be able to do this well we must first study in private. Thus one can see how the two ways of study, private and in gatherings, complement each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Making these truths one’s own does not end there, however. Paul, at Hebrews 2:1, according to </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Emphatic Dia-glott,</span><span class="font10"> says: “It behooves us to attend' more earnestly to the things heard, lest we should ever let them glide away.” How can one attend to these things? Continual giving forth of the truth fixes it more deeply mud inerasibly in one’s heart and mind. The Lord has made provision for one to continually remind himself of these things which he has first learned through the columns of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font10"> He has commanded that the gospel truth be widely proclaimed; and as faithful servants and ministers do this in house-to-house preaching, in back-calling on interested persons, in conducting home studies with them, these Theocratic witnesses rehearse the truths previously learned, and thus firmly fix them in mind. The gospel-proclaimer and hearer mutually benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All these proyisiohs are part of the great feast Jehovah has made for all people. Constant partaking of that feast is more essential to health and life than any big meal of material food. Now the “prodigal son” class is partaking of that feast, and no one need go lean and in hungry dolefulness. To be consistent with our daily prayer, we cannot afford to show contempt for the Lord’s table,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">lest we come to an end like that of Adam and of the unfaithful, murmuring Israelites. Let us consider Job, who pictures all who maintain integrity, and who said: “I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than .my necessary food.” By continual study and application of God’s words, we too can have a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name and in His new world without end.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Result of a Book Study in Washington, D. C.</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font10"> TRUTH-SEEKING Catholic lady opened her home for a book stddy in Washington, D.C., and made excellent progress in learning of her privileges and responsibilities respecting Jehovah’s name and kingdom. Word got to her cousin in De La Salle college and he wrote her in part as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For you, my very dear cousin, who have been born and brought up in the Catholic Chureh, there is no salvation outside of it. Are you willing to spend an eternity of excruciating pain in the midst of devouring flames of hell in the company of the damned reprobates and the devils? Are you able to keep just the end of one of your fingers over a candle flame for just one half of a minute? Can you plunge your hand in boiling water for just five seconds? Of course not'; Well, dear, not to speak of the terrible agony and mental anguish caused by the loss of heaven and its infinite happiness, you are preparing yourself to fall into the terrible bottomless pit of hell where you will be subjected to indescribable and unimaginable tortures and that for ever and ever. I don’t say a billion billion years; that is quite too short. But for ever and ever. How would you like to be buried alive in the same coffin with a stinking, rotting corpse? That would be a very sweet and most delightful condition with which any one of the damned souls in hell would gladly make the exchange.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">My very dear cousin, I’m not trying to frighten you, but I myself am trembling for fear at the terrible punishment which God in His infinite justice is bound to inflict upon you if you continue in your blind obstinacy in evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The lady wrote him a kind letter of appreciation of his good intentions and explained the terms Sheol, Hades, Ge-</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY </span><span class="font10">3, 1346</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">henna, and Tartarus, all of which confirm the, oft-repeated Bible statements that the penalty for disobedience is death, and not torture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Church That Founded Itself</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">She explained to the young man that she was glad he was not trying' to frighten her, and helped him with the information that there is no evidence in the Bible that the Catholic church was founded by our Lord, but that this view is supported only in books issued by the Catholic church itself, which in reality means nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">She marveled that Catholics cannot see the humble manner in which Jesus lived, and that they cannot see the selfexaltation of popes and their retinues. She considers it an insult for the pope to be called “The Holy Father”, a term properly applicable only to God himself, and a further insult for the popes to grant plenary indulgences, and thus again trespass on what belongs to God alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">She concluded with this moving statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Right now, dear cousin, I face the loss of my husband’s love, also my only child’s love, and possibly the love of my two darling grandchildren, because I have given up the Catholic faith. But I love God more than earthly creatures, and I am leaving it to His holy will to lead me aright, and to lead them aright, if they will have it so, that we may all be together in eternity. May God direct us all. Our parents were sincere in the only way they knew. They had faith in God and He will not forget them in the day of judgment. Those of us today who have the ehanee to know God’s Word, and refuse that chance, are really the blind ones.</span></p>

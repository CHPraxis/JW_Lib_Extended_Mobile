<p><span class="font6">1945 YEARBOOK of Jehovah’s witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH GOD never fails to accomplish His purpose. When one looks back through the centuries of time, it appears that all things accomplished have taken a natural course; but little do people realize that the things thus accomplished were brought about by the Almighty God through his active force. The creation of the heavens and the earth, the bringing forth of vegetation, the making of live animals, and the producing of man are all accomplishments of God, because he purposed them to be so. The heavens with their countless celestial bodies, the earth and all that therein is, are God’s handiwork. “For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and retumeth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater: so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.” (Isa. 55:10,11) Puny men should appreciate this truth by now and recognize their dependence upon the great Creator, but they continue to think more highly of themselves than they ought to. That which Jehovah purposes comes to pass in an orderly manner and nothing can or will stop it. Furthermore, Jehovah is never hurried; but in his due time he accomplishes his pleasure and blesses those whom he will bless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Noah was one of the comparatively few men in ages past who enjoyed the favor of God’s blessing. He loved righteousness, and Jehovah counted him as a “friend”. Noah and his household had faith in Jehovah’s purposes, believed His word, and showed willingness to follow His orderly arrangement of things. By God’s grace, Noah had the marvelous privilege of building the ark, which he faithfully did under Jehovah’s direction. Not only were proper plans made for the p.reaching that had to be done by Noah prior to the flood, but it also took organization to lay out the ark, construct it, fill it with the animals, and feed them for a year (as well as his own household) while passing from the “world that was” into this “present evil world”. The work done by Noah was possible of accomplishment only because Jehovah caused it to be, and because he organized it and brought all things to pass exactly on time, his due time, to his honor. He gave full proof that he is truly a God of purpose and accomplishment, and he gave due notice in advance of his actions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Not then was it God’s due time to establish the “new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness”, but his purposes were being accomplished concerning Noah and the destroying of that old world, which was filled with violence. All events were leading to things of greater importance, one of which was that, at the appointed time, his beloved Son, Christ Jesus, should make his appearance. This his only begotten Son did a little more than four thousand years after the creation of man. The Son of God was made a “little lower than the angels” and appeared in the flesh among the common men, and he did this to accomplish the purpose of God. The Son of God came forth from the great heavenly organization of Jehovah, leaving his glorious estate and taking on the form of man. His primary reason for so doing was the vindication of Jehovah’s name; for that mighty name had been defamed for centuries by Satan the Devil, who claims that men serve God with selfish motives and that the integrity of all men can be broken in time, causing them to turn away from God and curse Him. Satan has tried to prove this for centuries, but has been proved a liar many times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Messiah of the Jews had been promised for many hundreds of years, and all Israelites seeking a better world were looking for the Messiah. The religionists, the politicians and the commercial men of the Jewish nation were satisfied with their own construction of the national order; but not so the. people of good-will with faith in their God’s promise of a Redeemer. In God’s due time, and hence right on time, the Messiah made his appearance. He came, primarily, to announce that “the kingdom of heaven is at hand”. This was a real challenge to the ruler of this world, Satan, “the prince of this world” (John 12:31), because it was an announcement of a new government for world affairs and, it being a heavenly government, it meant the ousting of Satan himself. The announcement of the kingdom of heaven meant that Satan’s rule of the heavens must end, as well as his earthly puppets be removed. It meant that Satan’s “present evil world”, heavens and earth, was in for a battle for supremacy. It was a proclamation of the New World, which meant one world under one government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was not Jesus’ idea to take over the old world governments and rule them, with their corrupt politicians, hypocritical clergy and wealthy businessmen. No; it meant the cleaning out of all this, in God’s appointed time and after due notice of the coming change. Jesus knew that the people must be informed of the Righteous Government, and he made official announcement of the One Government that would rule the one world. At the time this Government should take over its power under Christ a final witness must be given concerning this government, in the last days of the “present evil world”, and at the treading down of it, even as Noah had the privilege of announcing the collapse of the “world that then was”. In Noah’s day a warning was given under Jehovah’s direction and, at the same time, a way of escape was provided.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>THE START OF IT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">While Jesus was on earth as a full-grown man, having consecrated himself to Jehovah God at Jordan and being there baptized by the holy spirit, he began a work that no man or power on earth or in heaven could overthrow. He began the preaching of the “kingdom of heaven” and he also began to organize for further advertising of this kingdom, the new government. For this he was charged with sedition, was brought before the courts, and was killed eventually; but before that he organized his representatives so well that the faithful followers of Christ Jesus would choose nothing but the work of preaching that “the kingdom is at hand”. Even though organized, they could not have accomplished this work, any more than Christ Jesus could have accomplished it, without the holy spirit of God operating upon them. They needed Jehovah’s backing, his active force, his power to support them and direct them in their organization. They received it at Pentecost, and Jehovah has never failed to support his faithful servants in every time of need and has directed them when there appeared to be no need. Jehovah, through His Son, formed an organization that has been used through these many centuries to preach good news and to keep the spark of true worship of God alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus while on earth assembled to himself twelve apostles, one of whom turned traitor; but the other eleven stood shoulder to shoulder and carried the torch of the Kingdom message into all the lands round about Jerusalem. What they told the people was not only the promises set forth in God’s Word about the blessings to come, but also concerning the destruction of the old world and the need to escape into God’s safe place of refuge. They had full faith in their God in heaven, their Father, that the Government, or the “kingdom of heaven”, would be fully established and that he would accomplish all this. They appreciated their responsibility, now that they had entered into a covenant with God, to see that this message was preached. Having walked with Jesus and having received the light concerning the truth of God’s kingdom, they, of necessity, would have to preach it. No longer did the old world of pride, shame and haughtiness hold attractions for them. It never did; that is why they left it so readily and thereafter were ‘in the world, but not a part of it’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When on earth the Master was not seeking the prominent men of this world, the chief priests, the scribes, the Pharisees, the businessmen, or the politicians; but he was seeking people who wanted to work in the interest of peace, righteousness and true worship of God, such as the fishermen Peter, John and Andrew, and Matthew the tax collector. All of them were humble men, all of them from the ordinary walks of life, but all were seeking the Messiah and looking for better things than this old world had to offer. They were looking for the “kingdom of heaven”. They found it; and they recognized Christ Jesus as the Messiah, the One that would be King in the government to rule the earth in peace and righteousness. They chose to follow him, giving up all they had, whether much or little. It was their love of truth, righteousness and pure worship of God that made these men of faith walk with the Lord Jesus. It did not take them long to recognize that Christ Jesus was the Son of God, and they were anxious to learn at his feet. They did, for they had found the King, Savior and Redeemer.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>•LET YOUR LIGHT SHINE*</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">After these ordinary, humble men had been walking with Jesus for some time he told them: “Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.” (Matt. 5:14-16) The purpose of his gathering together these men of good-will, lovers of truth, was not just to make them wise in the counsel of the Lord, but that they might let shine the light they received. Wisdom is not shown by the gaudy dress of priests and by the clergy holing up in some synagogue or cathedral; but “Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: she crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words.”—Prov. 1: 20, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While Jesus was with his disciples he sent them out in two’s to various parts of the country to let the light shine. After his death and resurrection, and after his sending unto them the holy spirit or active force, all the apostles let their light shine by putting on the most intensive preaching campaign ever inaugurated on this earth up to that time. That work, started there in many tongues, never ceased. They ‘let their light shine before men’. They did not ‘hide the light under a bushel’ or keep it within the walls of a monastery or nunnery, but they held their light high, so that all could see and hear the truth. They believed in education for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font3"> men! The apostles of the Lord and those who associated with them kept their eye on the Kingdom and preached it, and they never turned aside to follow anything else. This was their lifework. The boundaries of cities and countries, even though these boundaries were lakes, mountains and seas, they crossed to preach the Kingdom, the only hope for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The early true Christian did not mix up in the affairs of this old world, for he knew he was an ambassador of the New World and represented a new government. The apostles and their companions believed the wise man’s counsel when he said: “Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.” They desired always to be in the light and to be guided toward the new government, the Kingdom, and to understand the truth and follow it. They fully appreciated that to keep their eye on the right thing would mean their going in the right direction; that if they turned their attention to the things of the old world they would go into darkness. They appreciated the Master’s counsel: “The lamp of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness.” (Matt. 6:22,23, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font3"> The apostles had only one vision, an eye single to the glory of God; and, because they fully appreciated Jehovah’s purposes and diligently studied his Word, their whole body was full of light and they reflected that light wherever they went.—2 Cor. 4: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The disciples and followers of Jesus having been begotten of the holy spirit at Penteeost, the organization that Jesus developed when on earth went into action. The apostles were the center of that organization and the brethren everywhere looked to them for direction and counsel. They willingly took the lead in preaching, and they counseled their brethren in spreading the gospel to all parts of the earth. They hearkened to the words of Jesus, who said: &quot;Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit.” (Matt. 28:19, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font3"> Regular visits were made by them to all the church, and to the church were added many daily. The adding to the church was not accomplished through miracles, or by forcing people to join up with this new group that made its appearance at the time of Jesus’ preaching. It was not a proselyting scheme or the starting of a “new religion”. Their assigned duty was to see to it that the Kingdom gospel was preached, and from the central headquarters at Jerusalem they sent forth servants and their assistants to carry this message of life into all of Israel. Those seeking after God found him through the preaching. “For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? and how shall they preach, except they be sent?” (Rom. 10:12-15) This took organization and planning, and because the whole organization worked in unity, having the same motive, true worship, great strides were made in the preaching of the gospel, not only among the Jews, but among the Greeks also, and eventually among all nations. When the call went forth to all Gentiles, unusual progress was made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The message was carried across the seas into Greece, Italy, all parts of Europe, up into the northern part of Asia Minor, and to Babylon in the east. It found its way down into Egypt to the south, and it filtered into all parts of the Roman Empire. That the all-embracing command to preach the gospel of the Kingdom in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">all the world</span><span class="font3"> would eventually be accomplished and then would the end come, was Jesus’ clear-cut statement. It required organization to preach the gospel of the Kingdom in all the world, but it must be done; for God’s Word does not return unto him void. It requires time to preach the gospel of the Kingdom; it doesn’t happen as a matter of chance. It must be performed under the direction of Christ Jesus, the King, through the active force or spirit of Jehovah God. It is a work that Jehovah purposed should be done. That work is accomplished in his own due time and by the means he ordains for its accomplishment. We see this preaching work carried on today by Jehovah’s witnesses in all the world, in all nations, and it is carried on in basically the same manner as the early church did it.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>INTERFERENCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Those of the early church fully appreciated that the “light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart”. (Ps. 97:11) Even though there were many evildoers and mischief-makers, persons who were trying to stop this work and interfere with the progress of the preaching, they did not for one moment dampen the zeal of Jehovah’s witnesses back there; nor do they now. God’s servants in the earth were and are not fearful of the actions of men; for they know it ‘is better to obey God rather than men’. They heed the counsel of the psalmist, who said: “Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity. And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.”—Ps. 37:1, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While worldly authorities may have power to interfere with the work and stop it for a while, Jehovah’s witnesses fret not because of these evildoers, nor are they envious of the power of these workers of iniquity; for they know that in God’s due time this gospel that was ordained to be “preached in all the world for a witness” will be so proclaimed, because nothing can stand in the way of Jehovah’s purpose. Therefore the light is going to shine as never before, and it will shine forth as the noonday sun. This is God’s work, accomplished through his Son, and his message is going to shine forth as a bright light; for he says “thy righteousness [will be] as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday”. There will be nothing to becloud the clear, true, sharp message of the Lord; for it will be bright, clear and understandable to those who have an ear to hear. No government or league of governments can buck up successfully against that which Jehovah causes to be. “Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. Be wise now therefore, 0 ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.”—Ps. 2:1-3,10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The message preached by Jehovah’s witnesses is not preached for the purpose of pacifying the rulers of this world, as the clergy do. It is not preached for the purpose of becoming friends of this world; because the Master said when he was upon the earth: ‘If ye are friends of the world, ye are at enmity with God.’ (Jas. 4:4) Christ Jesus came as the King of the New World of righteousness, and that means something must give way. That which must give way is the Devil’s world, with all its kings and rulers. The apostles and their followers believed this, and so do the present-day Jehovah’s witnesses, namely: that the old world is certain to give way to the New World of righteousness. The King of righteousness did not come to establish peace with the old world, but rather war. He said: “Think not that I came to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.”—Matt. 10: 34, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Why should Christ Jesus preach “the kingdom of heaven is at hand”, a new government to direct the affairs of earth, not the old world, but a New World of righteousness, if he was satisfied with the old situation that existed? The nations of the earth are trying to establish a new “world order”. This they have been trying for thousands of years, establishing new “world orders”. Every one of them has failed, and every one that man brings about will fail. Now the time has come for the complete overthrow of the “god of this world” and his puppet governments, because Jehovah God has accomplished certain things since the time of Christ till now. For nineteen hundred years Jehovah has been calling out of the Gentile nations a people for his name. The last of these are being called, and that work is now about accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The next step taken concerning the action of the “kingdom of heaven” was in 1914, when Jehovah, by Christ Jesus the King, took unto himself his great power and began to reign. The King cleaned out the old “heavens” and cast the Devil down to the earth, as is recorded in Revelation 12:10-12: “And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is east down, which accused them before our God day and night. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” Satan’s time to rule has run out, and all those who prefer that rule to the New World of righteousness will be run out at Armageddon, after which the one Government, the “kingdom of heaven”, will rule the one world in righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Christ then came to his temple in 1918 for judgment. There judgment began at the house of God; and those who were looking for easy positions within the Lord’s organization, who did not wish to work according to the direction of the King Christ Jesus, were cast out. The “faithful and wise servant”, the anointed remnant of the Lord, were chosen to do and accomplish God’s will of preaching </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">this</span><span class="font3"> gospel until the end should come. Willing publishers were on hand, anxious to follow the lead of the King Christ Jesus in the onward march of proclaiming “the kingdom of heaven is at hand”. Now that the King is taking action against the old world, he sees to it that Jehovah’s witnesses give the final announcement concerning the end of the old world and the beginning of the New. The last call is being made and will be made during the postwar period to all those who love righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now that the time is at hand for the overthrow of the Devil’s organization, a big preaching work must be done, bigger than the work done in the days of Noah. In Noah’s time the population of the earth lived in one particular section of the earth, and very likely Noah could have preached to all the inhabitants round about before the flood eame. There is a bigger work to be done now in the preaching of “this gospel of the kingdom”, announcing the final destruction of this old world and the incoming new government of righteousness to rule this earth; and therefore “this gospel of the kingdom” must be preached in all the world for a witness until the end comes. Peter and all the apos-ties announced the Kingdom in their day, 1900 years ago. One would think that the nations would take heed; but they go headlong into the support of the 'old world order’ and want to patch it up. It won’t last!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The people chosen to do this preaching work, Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions, are willing to do it and are glad to take upon themselves this responsibility of giving the warning and, at the same time, announcing the good news. It must be done the same as Christ Jesus did it. When he was upon the earth he went from house to house, village to village, city to city, and went to all parts of the Holy Land to preach “this gospel”. He taught his followers to do the same thing. Later the command went forth to his apostles to go into other parts of the earth to preach, and they did go. Now the command is to preach “this gospel” of Jehovah’s kingdom and his Son’s kingdom in all the world “for a witness”, for he prophesied that this should be done and then the final end of the world would come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These glad tidings set forth in God’s Word have great drawing power. To study God’s Word takes time, but it pays well; for 'to know Jehovah and his Son Christ Jesus is eternal life’. To gain life requires more than merely saying “I believe”. It requires showing faith by works. To do that means taking a stand against the whole world of wickedness and coming out foursquare for the Kingdom and its King, Christ Jesus, in vindication of Jehovah’s name. Reading the truth and accepting it makes one do that. It is not the joining of a religious institution and then going through some daily or weekly rituals; but it is the forsaking of this world and what it offers and the taking up of the preaching work of Christ and the apostles, and not for personal gain. Those who have taken up this course will find that many in their own household object to the action they are taking. Daughter will turn against mother, son against father, and individuals will leave their brothers and sisters for the sole purpose of preaching “this gospel of the kingdom” in all the world for a witness. Jesus said this would occur; for he stated: “Think not that I came to send peace on the earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. For I came to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law: and a man’s foes shall be they of his own household. He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And he that doth not take his cross </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[stauros,</span><span class="font3"> stake] and follow after me, is not worthy of me. He that findeth his life shall lose it; and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.” —Matt. 10: 34-39, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every individual must make his own decision as to whom he will serve: either Jehovah God and his Son, Christ Jesus, two great Kings who have now gone forth to wage war against this old world; or the old world and its god, Satan. It is not a matter any longer of following your father’s religion or your mother’s religion; it is a matter of making your own decision and following the truth, for “the truth shall make you free”.—John 8: 32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions know that there is only one way to attain life, and that is to serve Jehovah God and “worship him in spirit and in truth”. (John 4:24) This being true, they want others to have the same privilege; so they speak the truth on the matter to those they meet. Those that heed the message set forth in God’s Word will be protected and taken through the battle of Armageddon, even as Noah and his family were protected and taken through the flood. Those who have an ear to hear will hear gladly, for “blessed are your eyes, because they see; and ears, because they hear. For indeed I say to you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see what you behold, but have not seen; and to hear what you hear, but have not heard”.—Matt. 13:16,17, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Today men and women are living in marvelous times. Those who have consecrated themselves to serve God appreciate these times. Men of old spoke of these times and wrote concerning the day in which we live, and they desired to see this day and hear the things that are spoken in this day. Because many scriptures were due to have miniature fulfillments in the earthly day of Christ Jesus, men of faith looked forward to the first coming of the Messiah. But with greater anticipation and with more glowing prospects have men of faith since then looked forward to the new day when the King would reign in full power. We are now living in that day, just prior to the final conflict. The King Jehovah reigns and his Son Christ reigns, and those who hear and see these things rejoice and make them known to others. It is a most joyful time, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> day when the final witness of the incoming New World is given and the judgment is sent forth concerning the destruction of this old world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The message that Jehovah’s witnesses preach runs absolutely contrary to the ideas and plans of men. Jehovah’s witnesses teach the Bible, God’s Word, to the people of good-will; and this Word of God shows that the “present evil world” is on its way out, and that the “kingdom of heaven is at hand”. The “new heavens” are already established, the Government is functioning, and the earth is about to be cleaned up and made ready to complete the New World. The old-world rulers, with their religious paramours, preach that this old world is going to keep right on running as it has for a long time. The religionists want to patch it up and give the people more religion; and the rul-era believe them. Some day not too far distant the rulers of this world will appreciate that the clergy have been lying to them and, as Revelation the 17 th chapter records, they will “burn her with fire”, throw her off the “beast”, out of world government, and destroy her. They will at last learn of her deceptive machinations and will have nothing more to do with organized religion. This, however, will not save the governments of this world; for they too must go down in the battle of Armageddon, because they refuse to acknowledge the new King of the New World of righteousness. Then there will be one government and one world. Christ will be King, and those on earth who worship God with all their heart will be of the one world, under the one Government, the ‘‘kingdom of heaven”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>organization</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">For individuals to take a definite stand for the New World of righteousness under the one Government means that they will meet up with persecution and opposition, and will experience many distressing times. It means hardship in the old world as they ‘go to disciple all nations’; for this is the work they must do. Jehovah’s witnesses are not engaged in this work for any commercial gain or for what they might get out of it for themselves. They are in it because they love Jehovah God and his kingdom of righteousness above all else, and desire to worship God as he would be worshiped and should be worshiped. Jehovah’s witnesses know that “godliness with contentment is great gain: for we brought nothing into the world, for neither can we carry anything out; but having food and covering we shall be therewith content”. (1 Tim. 6:6-8, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font3"> Jehovah’s witnesses, having consecrated themselves to the Lord and being guided by his spirit and Word, can see themselves clearly, as in a mirror. They know that when they came into the world they brought nothing into it, and neither can they take anything out when they leave the world in death. But, having food and clothing and shelter, they are content to preach the gospel of the Kingdom</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">; for </span><span class="font3">“godliness with contentment is great gain”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions are Godfearing people; and they are content to do one thing, namely, preach “this gospel of the kingdom” in all the world. In so doing, they have contentment, peace, joy, and real happiness in the service of their Maker. They rejoice to be able to carry on their work in an orderly manner and according to good organization. In the apostles’ day they had a central governing body of “apostles and elders”, or mature brethren, at Jerusalem, who looked well to the affairs of the church and the preaching of the gospel of the Kingdom. Under the Lord’s direction, as revealed in His Word, Jehovah’s witnesses follow the lead set by the apostles in organizing the work. In the early days of the church Jehovah’s witnesses met in homes and there they studied God’s Word. Why should it be different today? Jehovah’s witnesses do not build churches or institutions and then appoint bishops, priests, deacons, or elders to reside there the rest of their days, or until they receive a better appointment; but they follow the Scriptural admonition on organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The apostles had a central governing body in Jerusalem, and from there they sent out representatives who served the brethren or the church in various parts of the country. These authorized representatives in turn made appointments, from among the elders or mature ones, of supervisors or overseers, gave them assistants and appointed these assistants to help carry on the work. They did not go about the country appointing bishops, elders and deacons, as might be indicated in the reading of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">King James Version </span><span class="font3">translation. When this translation was made the words ‘‘bishop” and “deacon” were substituted for the Greek words meaning “overseer” or “superintendent” and “assistant” or “servant”, which are proper translations for the Greek words </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">episkopos</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">diakonos</span><span class="font3"> respectively. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Goodspeed</span><span class="font3"> translation gives us the proper understanding of organization within a company of the Lord’s people who are assembled together to worship God: “Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the devoted adherents of Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the superintendents and assistants ; God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace.” (Phil. 1:1, 2) Paul and Timothy appreciated that they were servants of Christ Jesus, and in praying God’s blessing on the members of the company at Philippi they made special mention of those who were superintendents or company servants and their assistants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those appointed by the apostles to look after the interests of the church in the various cities must be men without reproach, of good standing, wholly devoted to the Lord, and able to teach. When so appointing them the apostles might have said, “You will be the overseers [eptsfcopos]”; and, as stated at 1.Timothy 3:2 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">{Goodspeed}</span><span class="font3">, “A superintendent </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[episkopos]</span><span class="font3"> must be a man above reproach, only once married, temperate, sensible, a man of good behavior, hospitable, able to teach.” Again, speaking of these overseers or superintendents, Paul says to Titus that they must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or given to drink or pugnacious or addicted to dishonest gain. (Titus 1:7) Those appointed by the apostles were to act as “guardian of your souls”.—1 Pet. 2:25, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Goodspeed;</span><span class="font3"> Heb. 13:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In large congregations it was impossible for the overseers or superintendents to take care of all the work; so assistants were appointed. In the Greek, the word appears to be </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">diakonos,</span><span class="font3"> and the proper translation of this word is “assistant” or “servant”, and, in harmony with this, 1 Timothy 3: 8,12,13 says: “Assistants </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[didkonos],</span><span class="font3"> in turn, must be serious, straightforward men, not addicted to wine or dishonest gain, . . . The assistants must be only once married, and manage their children and their households well. For those who do good service as assistants gain a good standing for themselves and great confidence in their faith in Christ Jesus.”—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Goodspeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those whom the apostles appointed as superintendents and as assistants in the church organization back there were already elders or mature brethren in good standing. Having a full appreciation of the responsibilities placed upon them because of their knowledge of God’s Word, they were willing to assume the responsibilities of superintendents or assistants in directing the work of preaching the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Following this lead of the apostles in organizing the early Christians, the governing body of Jehovah’s witnesses today holds to the same arrangement. Men devoted to doing the Lord’s will and mature in spiritual things are appointed in the different congregations to serve as superintendents or as their assistants. Among the terms that Jehovah’s witnesses use today are “company servant” and “assistant company servant” in the company. The company servant has general charge of and looks to all the interests of a congregation, and therefore he might be called the “superintendent” or “overseer”. Working with him, and charged with certain responsibilities, are the elder ones in the company whom the Society appoints as assistants. These assistants care for some particular work in the company and are therefore called “territory servants”, “accounts servants,” “advertising servants,” etc., as the case may be. But in every instance the elders in the companies appointed to positions of responsibility act as servants of the Lord, and for their brethren. In a large city, instead of one large group in general assembly, there are units of not more than 200 each. Over a unit is a unit servant, who acts as general overseer over the unit; and he has his unit assistant-servants, just as a company servant. Thus in one large city there are many “overseers”, with many more “assistants”. All together, the several units in such city are one congregation, and thus the one congregation has several “overseers” and many “assistants”, all of them being “servants” as well as elders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In order to properly preach the gospel of the Kingdom in the whole world, Jehovah’s witnesses undertake a momentous task and therefore must have an orderly arrangement. The work to be done, in its final analysis, is not a hard task but is a big one. The work may well be termed a “simple work”, for it is done without show; but, at the same time, the preaching of the gospel, done in the manner that Jesus did it, is a most telling and far-reaching work. Jehovah’s witnesses are trying to do just one thing, namely, hold out the only hope for mankind, which is God’s kingdom. People have so often prayed for it, “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven,” but in parrot-like fashion. Therefore the properly presenting the importance of it and its magnitude to the peoples of all nations becomes the charge of true Christians. Being commanded to “publish the glad tidings”, all servants of God naturally become publishers of the Kingdom, or Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The “seventy” that Christ Jesus sent out to the various parts of the land of Palestine were publishers or announcers of the King and his Kingdom. They went from door to door, village to village, and preached that “the kingdom of heaven is at hand”. Publishers of the Kingdom do that very thing today. Some call at farmhouses, others at apartments, and still others from house to house. In some lands it means visiting people in their adobe huts and their lean-to’s; but wherever people live, that is where Jehovah’s witnesses are directed to go: “Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations.” Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions, coming from all nations, kindreds and tongues, have the responsibility of preaching this message to their fellow men in all languages; and this is to be done before the final end. All are publishers, organized for work under one central governing body, and they do this work because they love it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Where there are several of Jehovah’s witnesses in one village or town, all come together for worship and service as a group. They are organized into what is known as a “company of Jehovah’s witnesses”. These companies of Jehovah’s witnesses may consist of anywhere from two persons upward. In large cities there are many company units, sometimes fifteen or twenty. But all companies, units and publishers do the same work; all have the same keen desire to worship God, which is expressed mainly by announcing Jehovah’s purposes to the people who will listen to their message. It is passing strange that such great opposition should be brought to bear against these earnest people, who speak only to those who want to hear. They do not try to force anything on anyone. If a person cares not to listen, the publisher goes on to someone else. There is no coercion. Simply stated, they say: “I have something good I want to tell you. Do you have a moment to listen?” If the person does, they preach. If not, they will come back later, because sometime all must be told, if they can be reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses are not the moneyed men of the earth, not the commercial men, nor politicians, and certainly not the religionists; but they come mainly from the common walks of life. You will find in their midst doctors, lawyers, manufacturers, carpenters, laborers, housewives—the middle class and the poor— for not many have been called from among the rich to enter the kingdom of God. There is one thing that holds them together as a solid unit, and that is their worship of the Almighty God and their desire to preach “this gospel of the kingdom”. They believe in the one God and in His Son, Christ Jesus, who made it possible for them to come unto Him. They believe this one God so implicitly that, no matter what he says, they do it. They realize that Jehovah has spoken through his Word, the Bible, and that is their Textbook. This Textbook makes it so clear that the one work to be done today is to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">preach.</span><span class="font3"> They are positively filled with this idea, because it is right and in harmony with the Lord’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To the world in general Jehovah’s witnesses appear very peculiar, and quite frequently they appear foolish in the eyes of the world; but it is this “foolishness of preaching”, as the world looks at it, that is accomplishing the greatest work ever done in this earth. Noah looked foolish and sounded foolish, when one looked at conditions from man’s viewpoint. He talked about a flood of waters coming upon the earth, when it had never so much as rained since Adam’s day. “What foolishness!” men thought. But nevertheless a flood of waters did come and it destroyed the world. (2 Pet. 2:4,5; 3:5-13) Noah had God’s word backing him up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses today are simply preaching. They are not doing harm to anyone; they are just telling the people what is about to happen in the battle of Armageddon. They are scoffed at, they are persecuted, they are thrown into prison, and they are haled before magistrates and judges; but all this still doesn’t change the Word of Almighty God. The warning is still given, and Jehovah’s witnesses, no matter where they are, will continue to proclaim it.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>YOU CAN’T CHANGE THEM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The course these ministers of Jehovah God take is not an easy one, looking at it from the persecution angle. If it were a matter of religion with Jehovah’s witnesses, they might as well join up with some religious sect, such as the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and practice their religion on a string of beads or light a few candles and set them before images. That is an </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">easy</span><span class="font3"> way to worship a god. That kind of worship is not pleasing to The God, Jehovah. Religion has taught the people today that they can get a paid-up policy on everlasting life by attending church regularly. But the Bible gives no such guarantee. The Bible points out that the only way to attain to eternal life is to know Jehovah God and his Son and to do the will of the Most High. Even the Son of God ‘learned obedience by the things that he suffered’ and, because of his faithfulness and obedience, was given eternal life and the highest position in the universe next to his Father. The same requirement is laid down for every true, faithful follower of Christ Jesus today. Eternal life does not come the easy way. It comes by doing His will, and this his disciples do with gladness of heart despite the scoffings of this world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If they tried to please man they could not please God; so they know it is better to “obey God rather than men”. It is not that Jehovah’s witnesses want to be obstinate or defiant and run contrary to the laws of the land. They do not. All laws of all lands that are in full accord with truth and proper conduct, and are in alignment with God’s Word, they will obey. But when laws interfere with the true worship of God, then they must prefer to obey God rather than man. They cannot turn away from true worship. Their trouble with the world comes only because they preach as did Jesus. The apostles were severely chastised, buffeted about and thrown into prison because they would not line up with the Jews’ religion, but preferred to preach Christ and his Kingdom. Stephen, one of the early servants of the Lord, was stoned to death. That is not a very pleasant way to die; but he chose to die rather than change his mode of worship. He learned the right way to worship God, through His Son, Christ Jesus. The right way to worship is to be a minister, a preacher of the gospel; and this all of Jehovah’s witnesses are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Why is it that Jehovah’s witnesses are so different from everybody else? It is not because of the way they walk or talk, or how they dress, or how they act in general. The only thing that makes them different is the way they worship. They do it the way their Master did it: in the streets, in the homes of the rich and poor, in the villages, and in the cities. They do not conform to modern practices of religion, confining their preaching to the synagogue, the cathedral or the church building; having social functions (bingo games, dances, cakewalks, parties, etc.) and forming all kinds of entertaining societies within their organization. They are just a one-track-mind people, just as one-tracked as Paul was, who said: “This one thing I do”; that is, serve God and the interests of his kingdom, and his servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">So what else can Jehovah’s witnesses do today but carry on the work just as the apostles did 1900 years ago? They have the same kind of organization: very simple, not pretentious, not for show. They esteem it a privilege to share in the fulfillment of Jesus’ prophecy: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness . . . and then shall the end come.” (Matt. 24:14) That is their one track. By the Lord’s grace, and under the almighty hand of God, they will keep on doing that one work no matter in what land they live and no matter how small a group they be. Even though they be isolated and alone, or be in large congregations, they will continue to preach “this gospel of the kingdom”. The nations of the present world will never be able to change them or to assimilate them. The governments and rulers of the past six thousand years were never able to assimilate Jehovah’s witnesses, and they never will. It would be far better for the nations of the earth to take the advice of Gamaliel, who said: “I tell you, keep away from these men and let them alone, for if this idea or movement is of human origin, it will come to naught, but if it is from God, you will not be able to stop it. You may actually find yourselves fighting God!” The Sanhedrin “were convinced by him, and they called the apostles in and had them flogged, and warned them not to speak about the name of Jesus, and then let them go”.—Acts 5: 38-40, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Goodspeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The report which follows in this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font3"> sets out the accomplishments of Jehovah’s servants during the past twelve months, or during their service year of 1944. You will find Jehovah’s witnesses in many lands, living under different customs, different laws, and different climates. But you see them doing just one thing, namely, preaching the gospel. In order to tie all these groups of Jehovah’s witnesses together into one unified organization, and in order that this general work of preaching might be carried on systematically, Jehovah’s witnesses use several legal organizations.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>CORPORATIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">In 1884 a small group of Christian people banded together and, using the laws of Pennsylvania, organized the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. They received from that state a charter to carry on their Christian activity. The chartered purposes of that Society are in full accord with the Lord’s command to 'go, disciple all nations’. The words of its present charter show that the purposes of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To act as the servant of and the legal world-wide governing agency for that body of Christian persons known as Jehovah’s witnesses; to preach the gospel of God’s kingdom under Christ Jesus unto all nations as a witness to the name, word and supremacy of Almighty God JEHOVAH; to print and distribute Bibles and to disseminate Bible truths in various languages by means of making and publishing literature containing information and comment explaining Bible truths and prophecy concerning establishment of Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ Jesus; to authorize and appoint agents, servants, employees, teachers, Instructors, evangelists, missionaries and ministers to go forth to all the world publicly and from house to house to preach and teach Bible truths to persons willing to listen by leaving with such persons said literature and by conducting Bible studies thereon ; to Improve men, women and children mentally and morally by Christian missionary work and by charitable and benevolent instruction of the people on the Bible and incidental scientific, historical and literary subjects; to establish and maintain private Bible schools and classes for gratuitous instruction of men and women in the Bible, Bible literature and Bible history; to teach, train, prepare and equip men and women as ministers, missionaries, evangelists, preachers, teachers and lecturers; to provide and maintain homes, places and buildings for gratuitous housing of such students, lecturers, teachers and ministers; to furnish gratuitously to such students, lecturers, teachers, educators and ministers suitable meals and lodging, and to prepare, support, maintain and send out to various parts of the world Christian missionaries, teachers and instructors in the Bible and Bible literature, and for public Christian worship of Almighty God and Christ Jesus; to arrange for and hold local and world-wide assemblies for such worship; to use or operate radio broadcasting stations for preaching this gospel of the Kingdom; and to do any and all other lawful things that its Board of Directors shall deem expedient for the purposes stated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, a Pennsylvania corporation, is fulfilling its chartered purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another organization with like purposes and principles is the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc., a New York corporation, organized in the State of New York in 1909. This corporation’s chartered purposes are practically the same as those of the Pennsylvania corporation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In 1914, to aid in the spreading of the gospel of the Kingdom, the International Bible Students Association, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain, was created in London, England. The purposes of this organization are the same as of the two previously mentioned. All three corporations work in full accord with one another to carry out their Christian duties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For convenience, Jehovah’s witnesses in other countries have organized other corporations for holding property, such as La Torre del Vigia, of Cuba. All these corporations created by Jehovah’s witnesses under state or national laws are non-profit, benevolent, educational, Christian, and philanthropic organizations. None of the officers receives any pecuniary gain, but all serve because they are consecrated to Jehovafi God and their lives are wholly devoted to the work of preaching the gospel. The corporations mentioned have the same president; thus the policies set for one organization are instituted in all. These corporations are used by Jehovah’s witnesses in whatever locality they are legally recognized to advance the activities of preaching and teaching God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Pennsylvania corporation, whose name is Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, is used by Jehovah’s witnesses to carry on its chartered work in the state of Pennsylvania and throughout the United States, as well as to operate all the branches of the Society throughout the world. The printed matter that this corporation uses is obtained from the New York cor-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">poration for use in other countries. Some of the branch offices of the Pennsylvania corporation have their own printing plants to further the chartered purposes of the Society. Contributions made by people of goodwill throughout the entire world are usually made to the Pennsylvania corporation, which Society directs the world-wide work. This corporation, according to its charter, has the “right, power, and authority to take, receive and hold donations and contributions of money and property, bequests and legacies to be used to further the chartered purposes”. Money sent in to the “Good Hopes” fund is expended by the Society in a manner that will further spread the message of God’s kingdom in all parts of the world, and in the best interests of all people of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The New York corporation, which was organized in 1909 in the state of New York, looks after the work of Jehovah’s witnesses generally throughout the entire United States. In the state of New York it owns and operates the Bethel home, the factory, the Watchtower Bible College, radio station, and several farms, all of which will be described later. All the work in connection with these institutions has a direct bearing on the preaching of the gospel and the preparation of the message to be sent out to Jehovah’s witnesses for their use in the field-service work. None of them are profit-making institutions, and none of those working in these places mentioned receive any pecuniary gain because of things produced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The International Bible Students Association, of the United Kingdom, owns and holds property in England, all of which is used for its chartered purposes. These corporations, no matter in what country they are organized, have been formed for the convenience of Jehovah’s witnesses, so that their work will have greater scope and can be carried on with less hindrance.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>BETHEL HOME</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The institution known as the “Bethel home”, owned and operated by the New York corporation, is located at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 2, N. Y. This headquarters building of the New York corporation houses the offices of the president and the secretary-treasurer; also the studios of WBBR radio station. This also is the home of the “Bethel family”, which, during the past year, comprised 228 Christian men and women who have consecrated their lives to serve Jehovah. They come from all walks of life and have given up their former vocations to devote their entire time to the service of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition to their regular Bible studies and the advanced Theocratic ministry course carried on at scheduled times in the home, they perform other duties of caring for the home or working in the Society’s factory, located at 117 Adams street, where magazines, Bibles and books are produced and shipped out to the companies of Jehovah’s witnesses. No one living at this home receives a salary, but each one does receive an allowance of $10 per month, good food, and a comfortable room in which to live. In addition to his duties in the home or factory and his regular study of Bible literature and Bible subjects, everyone has ample opportunity to carry on his ministerial duties of preaching the gospel from door to door and conducting studies in the homes of the people of goodwill in the city of New York.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>ORDAINED MINISTERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">One’s going through a theological seminary or some other school does not necessarily mean that he is ordained of God to preach the gospel. He may have gone to that school merely for an education or to “get a job” as a minister. The only ones whom God ordains are those who wholly and unreservedly devote their lives to him. He is not interested in persons that take up the preaching of the gospel as a profession for gain, such as a doctor does medicine or an attorney does law. Peter told the servants of the congregation to “feed the flock of God . . . willingly; not for filthy lucre”. (1 Pet. 5:2) The sincere follower of Christ Jesus takes up the preaching of the gospel because he loves it, knows it is the most important work in the world, and desires to show his belief by his works. Because he demonstrates his zeal, devotion and love for God and His kingdom, Jehovah gives him His spirit, which is His active force, to proclaim this message with boldness, and he has a “ready mind” for this work. Without God’s spirit operating upon his people to give the testimony, nothing could be accomplished. Thus the consecrated one is ordained a preacher, because God’s spirit directs the creature to do this work.—1 Tim. 2:7; Isa. 61:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those residing at the Bethel home and all Society institutions, as well as traveling representatives and branch servants, are ordained ministers because of Jehovah’s action toward them, and they show their ordination by full-time service and devotion to Christian work. As a matter of record there are listed below a few of the ordained ministers that devote their full time to the work carried on by Jehovah’s witnesses and who serve under the direction of the corporations. In addition to these servants listed, there are thousands of other ordained ministers that serve congregations under the direction of the Society; and there are many thousands of others, male and female, who are evangelists and missionaries or pioneers, traveling from place to place in territories where there are no company organizations. The list following by no means represents all the ordained ministers of Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the world.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>OTHER SOCIETY INSTITUTIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">In order to operate the Bethel home as economically as possible, the Society obtained a tract of land on Staten Island, which is known as “Watchtower”. Part of this tract of land was cleared and prepared for garden purposes, and each year thousands of bushels of green vegetables are raised there and served on the Bethel home table, fresh in the summer and, in the winter, that which has been canned. A large cannery has been established near the gardens, and as fast as the vegetables ripen and are picked they are canned and held for the winter season. Vegetables and fruits to the total of 30,554 quarts were canned this past summer at Watchtower and Bethel for future use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This same property contains the broadcasting antenna and equipment of station WBBR. The studios are located at the Bethel home, but the programs are transmitted from Staten Island to WBBR’s radio audience. A splendid witness is given throughout the New York area, as the many expressions of appreciation on the part of the radio audience testify. The programs are unique and different. They are not filled with the commercial advertising that one hears jingled on all other stations; but the station’s audience is provided with the truth as expressed in the Society’s publications, interspersed with good music. No commercial advertisement is put on WBBR at any time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society operates a nice farm in New Jersey where some vegetables and crops are raised that do not grow well on the Staten Island property.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At Kingdom Farm, South Lansing, New York, where the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead is located, the Society has another farm. This provides the bulk of the food supply for the college, the farm family and also the Bethel family. The larger crops, such as corn, wheat, barley, potatoes, as well as the very large vegetable gardens, are cared for here. It is at Kingdom Farm that we also raise our own beef and other meats, as well as operate an extensive dairy that produces the milk supply for the farm and college family, as well as butter and cheese for all the Society’s institutions in New York state. A large orchard is cared for in connection with this farm, and in this manner many fruits are supplied. All these farms help to cut down the current food costs of the Bethel family, as well as the college, thus saving more of the contributions sent in by the brethren for the direct work of preaching the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WATCHTOWER BIBLE COLLEGE OF GILEAD</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font3">The Watchtower Bible College of Gilead, dedicated to the Theocratic ministry, is now in its second year. It was founded in February, 1943, and since then has graduated three college classes, each class having had an intensive, five-month training course in Bible subjects. Scores of consecrated men and women have passed through its portals, coming there as ordained ministers and leaving as better-trained representatives. They have gone forth in the field service, domestic and foreign. Some have had the privilege of going to Cuba, Mexico, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, Canada, Alaska, and all parts of the United States. Since the opening of the college 295 persons have been entered, both white and colored. Of this number, 267 have completed the course and 253 have received diplomas. Each college class is limited to 100 persons, because the facilities of the college are designed to take care of this number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The second class of 100 ministers enrolled on September 6, 1943, being comprised of 51 males and 49 females. Improved methods and equipment were introduced during this school term for the betterment of the college training being offered. After a full five months of ministerial study, graduation day for college Class II was set for January 31, 1944. In the midst of a snow-white New York state winter 83 of the 84 students who completed the prescribed course received diplomas. As was the case with the first class, each of these graduating ministers had received from the Society his missionary appointment, and very shortly thereafter all left for various parts of the United States. Reports from these students show that they are receiving many blessings at the hand of the Lord in their present activity and are accomplishing excellent results. The graduates of the second class who received diplomas are listed below.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">After the second graduation the college was closed for a period of five weeks for the purpose of resupplying, repairing and installing new equipment; also for further faculty research and study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The doors of Gilead College were opened to the third class on March 6, 1944. This class began with 95 students, 46 men and 49 women, all having spent two or more years in the full-time ministerial service. All these ordained ministers very readily adapted themselves to the student life and routine, as well as to the domestic activity in which they engaged each afternoon after their study periods had ended. Through the bleak months of late winter and early spring the students increased in knowledge and spiritual maturity, and all soon became accustomed to the general routine of student life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Spring, with all its glory, returned to the campus, now enlarged and more beautiful, and with which the third class had much to do as to its improvement. It was not long until the third class reached the culmination of their school days. Graduation day was set for July 31, 1944. Eighty-nine of the original student body of 95 completed the course; and of this number 86 were awarded diplomas of merit. Very shortly after graduation this college group was blessed by being able to attend the United Announcers’ Theocratic Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses, at Buffalo, not far distant from the college, at South Lansing. From there they went to their respective assignments throughout the country, and seven of the graduates were soon on their way to Alaska. A list of those who finished the course with merit is set out below.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">At the close of the service year of the Society, ending with August, 1944, the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead enrolled its fourth class of 100 students, 38 men and 62 women, all ordained ministers who had come from the field and who looked ahead to five months of intensive study on the chief textbook, the Bible. Each year the course is enriched, and always improved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The college began with a library of 700 volumes and now has catalogued 2,900 authoritative works. Improved methods of teaching and deepened research mark the trend of this youngest institution of the Society. Jehovah’s rich blessing has been with all those associated with the college. The family that serves the interests of the home and works on the farm, the instructors, and the association of new students every six months make glad the hearts of all these servants. They are grateful for the privilege of assisting where-ever they can, making more able ministers of the students that enter Gilead.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark69"></a>PRINTING PLANT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The chartered purposes of the Society make provision for the printing and distributing of Bibles and the dissemination of “Bible truths in various languages by means of making and publishing literature containing information and comment explaining Bible truths and prophecy concerning establishment of Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ Jesus”. In these days of peril and distress on every hand, and of great sorrow among the people, there is great demand for Bibles and Bible literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This year the Society was limited in its production because of paper control agencies; but the supplies it was able to obtain were put to good use. During the service year the printing plant was able to complete more than 218,000 Bibles. These Bibles were the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">King James (Authorized) Version,</span><span class="font3"> the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">American Standard Version,</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Emphatic Diaglott.</span><span class="font3"> In addition to these Bibles, millions of Bible helps were published in the form of clothbound books, especially the book entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Eree&quot;</span><span class="font3"> and another new publication released during the year entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”.</span><span class="font3"> Additionally, 32- and 64-page booklets were printed in large quantities and distributed throughout the United States and other countries. The grand total of Bibles, bound books and booklets reached 24,183,264.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another thing that keeps the factory and the 178 persons working there exceptionally busy is the preparing, printing and mailing out of the two magazines, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font3"> The number of copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> printed exceeded 10,000,000; and of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> 7,000,000. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> is published in eight languages, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> in four. The grand total of magazines printed reached 17,897,998.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Not only magazines, Bibles and books are printed in large quantities, but also tracts. The printing of these tracts amounted to more than 18,000,000. For the details on production see the table below.</span></p>

</table>
<p><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font3">The demand in the field for Bibles and bound books is greater than the Society can meet with the supplies obtainable at the present time. The book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”,</span><span class="font3"> which was released approximately a year ago, went out of stock several times even though we printed 2| million copies. In the booklet line more than 6,800,000 copies of the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom in the New World</span><span class="font3"> were shipped out, and over 5,000,000 copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming World Regeneration,</span><span class="font3"> and over 2,300,000 copies of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion Reaps the Whirlwind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On the average, eleven more persons worked in the factory this year than in 1943, and it required many evenings of extra work in order to get out the supplies that were prepared. The Bethel family was glad that it could put in extra time so as to aid the publishers in the field, for the brethren know that in no better way can they express their love to their brethren than to Tay down their life for their friend’. The brethren who fully appreciate the privileges of service at Bethel rejoice to remain true and steadfast in the privileges granted them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the service year the production of the literature required 2,964 tons of paper, as well as hundreds of tons of other material, such as chipboard, cloth, ink, glue, etc.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>SHIPPING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">This department shows 21,301,009 books, Bibles and booklets shipped out. Due to the global war it is practically impossible to ship literature to other countries, and therefore the bulk of the literature shipped out was shipped to companies and pioneer publishers in the United States. Fewer than 2,000,000 copies of books, Bibles and booklets were shipped to foreign countries; and the greater portion of these were shipped to Latin-American countries, in the Spanish and Portuguese languages. It will be impossible to make shipments to European countries until the war ends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While the shipping department had a huge amount of work to handle, the mailing department also had a real task to perform in the mailing of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> magazines. Due to the splendid W</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">atchtower</span><span class="font3"> campaign carried on in the field throughout this country, the subscription list for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> had been greatly increased. Each month, on the average, there were 434,000 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> magazines mailed. This is an increase over last year of 16,000 on each issue. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> shows a slight increase, of about 1,000, over that of last year, and this meant the mailing of about 282,000 of each issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The cost of shipping these various publications to all parts of the country and world, which would include express, mail and freight charges and the cost of supplies, totaled $150,554.12. One of the big problems in the shipping department this year was the obtaining of shipping materials, such as cartons, wrapping paper, and twine. Never since the factory started operating have our supplies been so low; but this is to be expected after many years of war, causing shortages of these materials. By the Lord’s grace, however, we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies to keep going even though it required much extra work on the part of the purchasing department to get materials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The office, too, has had a tremendous volume of mail to handle. During the past year 325,600 letters were received, and 405,725 were sent out. This kept the office force very busy. Many persons do not appreciate how much work is involved when they send in a letter. If they did they would try to write it just as clearly and briefly as possible. For example: If a company sends in an order for literature and a number of subscriptions, with remittance, the order must first be checked with the company account. Then the invoices and credit memorandums are written out, and the invoices go to the shipping department to be filled. The subscriptions, after being checked, go on to the circulation department, where zone numbers have to be inserted in cities, if the assistant company servants have not already done this. Stencils must be written, proofread and filed in their proper places among hundreds of thousands of others; and every two weeks these stencils must be run through machines so as to make wrappers or print addresses to be put on the magazines themselves, which will be sent out from the mailing department.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When letters are clearly written and just such things are said as are necessary, then the correspondence clerks in the office can handle the letters much more rapidly. If pioneers, company servants and all other persons who write the Society would read their letters over before they send them in, seeing to it that all the enclosures are there and in proper order (using the forms of the Society properly), it would facilitate matters in the office tremendously. The brethren expedite matters as quickly and efficiently as they can and are pleased to put many hours of extra work in the office to get caught up when necessary. It makes the heart of everyone glad to see the constant flow of orders and the heavy demand for literature, because this means the spreading far and wide of the Kingdom truths. The family appreciates the glorious privilege of printing and furnishing to the brethren in the field their needs. They rejoice with all the publishers as they engage in the field service themselves during week-ends, all to the honor and glory of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark74"></a>THE FIELD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The Master, when on earth, said: “The field is the world.” So that “this gospel of the kingdom” may be preached in all the world for a witness, it is required that the world be divided up into sections or branches that can be handled properly from one location. The language problem enters into the matter. In countries where Spanish is spoken it is best to have a central branch, so that the brethren from all parts of that locality can write to that office in their own tongue and receive proper reply. Boundaries of nations cause inconveniences when it comes to the matter of shipping and transportation, and again it is necessary to establish branches or depots from which literature can be shipped to the publishers of the Kingdom. Thus it can readily be seen why branches are established. Persons making inquiry concerning the Kingdom message can get a quick reply to their inquiry. If it is a publication they desire, it can be sent immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">So that the “field” may be properly covered, ministers or missionaries are sent to all parts of the world to preaeh the gospel of the Kingdom. At this time it is very difficult to reach some nations, because of the raging war. But even in countries where the war continues the message is preached, and that with good effect and great comfort to the people. Every nation under the sun is affected by the war, but God’s message concerning the end of this “present evil world” and the establishment of the New World cannot wait until men get done fighting. Dictators and totalitarian rulers have always tried to usurp power over the peaceful nations and to rule and dominate the weaker ones for selfish gain. This sort of thing has been carried on for generations and ages, and so there have been “wars and rumours of wars”. But through it all Jehovah God had witnesses to his name, and it is even so today. Jehovah’s witnesses hail loud and long the presence of the King. He is here and his work of final judgment is on. People from all nations, kindreds and tongues are seeking the kingdom of God, which they realize is the only hope for the world. Millions of others who have not heard of the good news must be told. Thus the field in which the message of the Kingdom is to be preached is very broad and takes in every nation, kindred and tongue. Throughout the remainder of this publication reports will be set out concerning the work accomplished by Jehovah’s witnesses in the various lands.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses in the United States have a tremendous task to perform. To reach upward of 130 million people and talk to them about the truth and aid them in the study of the same is a great undertaking. When one considers that there are only 61,172 publishers of the Kingdom engaging in the work every month, it means they have many people to talk to, not just once but again and again. The number engaging in the field service in the United States is not a new peak, but it is a very consistent average, especially when considering the circumstances under which the work is now carried on. This group of publishers devoted 18,518,985 hours in witnessing for the Kingdom. This is one of the best years as far as hours are concerned that have ever been recorded. The real work that has been accomplished cannot be determined by the placements of literature, especially when this is hampered by restrictions on paper. It can best be judged by the follow-up work done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the service year of 1943 upward of 21| million pieces of literature were distributed, to compare with over 15 million books and booklets placed in 1944. Even with the placing of over 6 million fewer pieces of literature, a greater number of back-calls were made by the publishers and a considerably larger number of book studies were conducted in the homes of the interested people. The comparison of these figures is very interesting. A little better than half a million more back-calls were made on interested persons ■ and when following through on these back-calls and conducting book studies in the homes the real work is accomplished. The figures show that, in 1944, 52,948 back-call book studies were conducted each week, on the average. This compares well with 40,668 for the service year 1943. That means that each week there are 12,000 more book studies being conducted now than there were a year ago. The attendance supports this figure, because 115,000 persons of good-will attended these book studies conducted by the publishers throughout the land, to compare with 96,000 a year ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is firmly believed that, when the great press of occupational work lightens and the overtime and Saturday afternoon and Sunday work are done away with, the people in general will give more time to study and their minds will be relaxed from the turmoils of the day. Men and women are working feverishly now for a better world, which they believe will be the outcome of this second world war. Their hopes rest pretty high in the things proposed for the new “world order”. But when the people see that religion is taking the saddle and that regimentation and domination of the peoples will continue, without any real freedom that they had expected, they will turn to the Bible and they will forsake religion and the hopes set forth by the “world order”. There is no time now for slacking the hand, nor will there be in the postwar period; but the importance of the work will appear to be even more urgent then than now. Jehovah’s witnesses appreciate the urgency of the preaching of the message, and this is shown by that which was accomplished this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses are prepared to aid all those that mourn and that seek after truth and righteousness. To this end they have organized more than 3,000 companies of Jehovah’s witnesses, most of these being in the larger cities. The company publishers, of which there are, on the average, 56,126 engaging in the field service regularly each month, are diligently looking after their territories. According to the reports available it appears that they are covering their territory approximately two times a year. That means the people are called on only once in six months, often for periods of only one, two or, at the most, ten minutes at a time. So little can be said in that period! This shows the importance of making back-calls on those that show interest in one’s first or second call, and the importance of following through and giving the people an education in God’s Word. It is observed that many persons say Jehovah’s witnesses come to their homes every week, but this really is not the case. Jehovah’s witnesses wish they could call every week, because of the urgency of their message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While the publishers in these large cities may reach the homes of the people only two or three times a year, they make themselves known weekly on the busy cornera of the streets in their magazine work. Many are the experiences reported of interested persons talking to publishers on the street corners for a half hour or more at one time, making inquiry about the work and getting a clearer understanding of what is meant by 'God’s kingdom, the only hope of the world’. The message of truth is available if they want it. Those who are thoroughly dissatisfied with the conditions of world affairs are looking for something better, and, having heard of Jehovah’s witnesses’ message, they can find them. “Seek, and ye shall find.” (Matt. 7:7) Those persons who do not get down to the main corners of town very often, of course, await the call of Jehovah’s witnesses to their own home. They will come eventually; but then, because of prejudice or because of having read something unfavorable in the newspapers, these persons refuse to give them audience. It would be quite selfish for Jehovah’s witnesses to say to such persons whom they meet: “I’ll tell you this message only once, and you’ll have to take it or leave it.” No, that is not their attitude. It takes time to make clear the truths of God’s Word when a person’s mind is all mixed up with the affairs of this world. So Jehovah’s witnesses will take the time to call again. Even many of the followers of -Christ Jesus who went from city to city and village to village to hear him preach did not believe, or found other things more important; and thousands of them forsook him and followed him no longer. (John 6:66) They chose to stay with the old world and go down with it. It is a matter of personal decision on the part of the individuals hearing the message of truth. The Lord says: “He that hath an ear, let him hear.” But those who refuse to hear the first time will be given a second and third and fourth opportunity between now and the battle of Armageddon, if Jehovah’s witnesses can get around that often.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The message of Jehovah’s witnesses is heralded far and wide and the people of the United States have had the opportunity and will continue to have the chance to hear the truth in the homes, the highways and the byways. That is why the public find Jehovah’s witnesses on the street corners; and, according to reports, they have during the past year placed 7,448,325 magazines with interested people, to passers-by. Many of the small stores are called on by these magazine publishers. Office buildings are visited; factories are called upon during noon hours when the workingmen come out; and an attempt is made to reach all people in all walks of life, in all parts of the city and country. They are trying to neglect no one. The gospel is free to rich and poor alike, and if anyone wants to hear, Jehovah’s witnesses are glad to relate the truth to him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak number of publishers for the service year was in September: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;64,467</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>TERRITORY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">While there are 3,056 organized companies conducting the evangel work throughout the country, that does not mean all the United States is well covered. The United States is divided into 3,063 counties, and 1,206 of these counties are assigned to the 3,056 companies. They cannot cover all this territory satisfactorily, and, in many instances, general pioneers or special publishers are assigned to work with them. Other pioneers take over whole counties and work them as a missionary would in any other country. There were at the close of the year 1,346 counties that were not witnessed to during the service year 1944. These represent 43 percent of all the counties; however, they do not represent 43 percent of the population of the United States. But the particular counties that were not covered represent approximately 15 percent of the country’s population. Fifteen percent of the country’s population means that at least 19,500,000 persons were not called on during the past service year. This population would make up a good-sized country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When the call goes forth for more workers, it is not an idle call; when the call goes forth for more time in the field, it is not a call made without good reason. The Society and the brethren at headquarters are fully cognizant of the fact that there are millions of people in the United States, where there is a larger number of publishers than in any other single country, that do not receive information concerning God’s kingdom. They may have heard about it three or four years ago, when somebody went through those counties; but in the last year, in these days of great distress, in these days when people must make decision as to whom they will serve, millions upon millions of persons have not had the opportunity of hearing the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Looking at the population of the United States from another angle, there are approximately 1,900 cities with population of 4,000 or more that are set aside for special publisher witnessing. Some of these cities are in the counties mentioned above that were not worked, but many of the others are in counties that have been assigned and cannot be reached by the company publishers. Of these 1,900 cities only 303 have been thoroughly covered during the past year. Five hundred and eighty are assigned and are being worked, but have not been thoroughly covered as yet. Four hundred and thirty-seven of these cities were witnessed to in the previous year, but no companies have been organized therein. Thus people who heard the truth in these particular towns are not being properly taken care of, because the workers are few. This leaves 580 cities, of the 1,900 with more than 4,000 population, yet to be witnessed to in the coming year in the continental United States. Some of these cities are getting a little witnessing, because they happen to be in company territory; but, as mentioned, they are, at best, called on only twice a year. If the town is very far distant from the company’s headquarters, probably it is witnessed to only once a year. This may be primarily due to gasoline rationing and transportation difficulties. But the facts are that there is much territory in the United States and millions of persons yet to be reached with the message of the Kingdom. When we see what is yet to be done in the United States, it is breath-taking to imagine what must be done throughout the world. But still the Master said that “this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come”. The field is great, the laborers are few; but those who labor in the vineyard delight to do the Master’s will and press on diligently in the service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark81"></a>SPECIAL PIONEER PUBLISHERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">During the service year of 1944 the report shows an average of 1,212 special pioneer publishers engaging in the field service every month. These constitute about 2 percent of all the Kingdom publishers, and these 2 percent do about 15 percent of the work, make 17 percent of the back-calls, and conduct that percentage of the total book studies. The comparison of the good increase in this field as to efficiency is very interesting.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The special pioneer publishers are sent to towns with populations of 4,000 or more and where no companies are organized. There they witness to the people and try to develop a company, if possible. The territory is covered four times during their stay in the city. Special publishers are also used to help out weak companies. Where there are only a few publishers and where the territory is not properly served, these special pioneer publishers are sent into the territory to help in the organization and to see that the work gets done properly so far as the proclamation of the Kingdom is concerned from door to door. These brethren are willing to go anywhere the Society sends them; and, in order that they might meet their expenses in these isolated places, the Society allows them $25 a month in addition to giving them their publications at the pioneer costs. The “Good Hopes” fund of the Society is drawn upon to assist these special publishers in their work. During the year they were given assistance financially to the amount of $226,984.52. The brethren contributing to the “Good Hopes” fund rejoice (and have often so expressed themselves through letters) in the fact that the pioneers who are doing such splendid work receive this assistance. The Society will continue to give aid to the special pioneer publishers as long as it appears to be the Lord’s will and as long as such provision is made. A study of the work accomplished by these special pioneer publishers is very interesting and can be seen on the chart on page 56.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark83"></a>GENERAL PIONEERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The requirements to be met by general pioneers are not as difficult as those of the specials. The specials are required to put in 175 hours a month and make 50 back-calls in order to receive the allowance or financial assistance, whereas the general pioneer need put in only 150 hours a month in any territory of his choosing. The special pioneer is sent to the territory the Society believes most in need of the witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There were 3,834 general pioneers engaging in the field service during the service year of the Society, in territories of companies and in some isolated territories. These brethren are working in territory that is available and which suits their purpose best, such as may be the case when a housewife is putting in pioneer time and her husband engages in some gainful occupation. Others, man and wife, see their way clear to put in full time and do so. Still others have some small responsibilities that they must take care of regularly each month, requiring some of their time, but are able to put in 150 hours a month. This group of general pioneers has done a marvelous work during the year, having put in almost 6 million hours of field service, placing over 4| million pieces of literature and nearly 2 million magazines. They have made over 1J million back-calls and are conducting over 17,000 back-call book studies each week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It will be noted that, in comparing the average hours of the general pioneer of last year with the pioneer of this year, there has been a great improvement. During the service year of 1943 the records show that there was an average of 4,788 general pioneers on the list, averaging 111.8 hours per month; whereas now there are only 3,834 on the list, but they average 130.2 hours. What is the reason for this? It is natural that many new publishers will come into the pioneer ranks during the year, and others leave because of circumstances best known to themselves and conditions over which they have no control. Sometimes the pioneer list goes away up, and other times it drops. During the year the pioneer list reached a total enrolled of over 5,700, but hundreds of these brethren were putting in only 40, 50 and 60 hours a month of field service and were not living up to their agreement with the Society to put in 150 hours or thereabouts. Due notice was given to the pioneers not reaching the required time and all were invited to put forth an extraordinary effort for at least two months and then continue to maintain a good average if they wished to remain on the list. There were over 800 that were engaged in other duties not allowing them to put in pioneer time, and these, of necessity, were dropped from the pioneer ranks. Others left of their own accord, for they knew they were not able to meet the requirement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society did not, however, drop any of the pioneers who had been on the list for a good number of years and who because of being infirm could not meet the requirements. There were retained 142 who had been in the pioneer service for a long number of years even though they cannot now reach the goal set for the general pioneer publisher. Some publishers just sign up for the general pioneer work when in an enthusiastic state of mind and they do not “count the cost” or fully appreciate what is required, and hence they become pioneers in name only. They try to hold down some full-time position on the outside and at the same time do pioneer work. This appears to be impossible. When one becomes a pioneer he must make that his first duty, and this can be accomplished by seeing to it that he gets in his pioneer time first each day, which would mean at least six hours of publishing every day in the week for six days a week. If he keeps this up consistently he will reach his 150 hours in the month and receive the Lord’s rich blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is a joy to see that the pioneers have now reached an average of 130.2 hours, the highest ever. We believe that, during the coming year, this average will go higher. The average number of back-calls jumped from 26.7 to 32.6 per month; and the book studies, from 3.4 to 4.6 per week. We rejoice with them in this grand activity.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark84"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark85"></a>THE PUBLISHER</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The grandest of all privileges anyone can enjoy is to be in the full-time service of the Lord, either in one of the Society’s institutions or as a pioneer publisher. When one is a special pioneer, putting in 175 hours a month, he hasn’t any time for anything else, no matter how hard he tries, if he is going to get in his time and do the work he has agreed to do. Those who cannot work this hard but are able to put in as many as 150 hours can always be full-time servants of the Lord as general pioneer publishers ■ and this is a blessed place in the Lord’s organization. However, through Jehovah’s Theocratic organization He has made it possible for every one who desires to worship Him in “spirit and in truth” to be a publisher. Thus we have the company organization, in which there are Jehovah’s witnesses who proclaim and publish the Kingdom as they have opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Every one who ever gains life within the Lord’s organization must sing forth praises and express to others his belief and faith in his God in heaven and His accomplishments. So that those who cannot put in full time, but who averaged 15 hours monthly during 1944, might have part in the service, the Society has arranged to organize them into companies and have them served by brethren capable of teaching and giving instruction in the Lord’s Word. Book studies, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> studies and service meetings are regularly scheduled each week so these part-time ministers will be better fitted to meet the people and aid them in Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The servants to the brethren have, during 1944, visited each company approximately twice, giving additional instruction in the ministry. They stayed longer at each company this year than last, with the exception of the very small ones, where they stayed only a day; but almost all companies had a two- or three-day visit within a six-month period. There are 28 servants to the brethren traveling throughout the United States. Many brethren at Bethel and Kingdom Farms also have the privilege of serving companies in the capacity of servant to the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Permission has been obtained from the Department of Justice to serve the brethren incarcerated in the various prisons throughout the country. During seven months of the year brethren in twenty-one different prisons throughout the United States have been served, on the average of once every six weeks. At all times the Lord’s organization tries to keep in touch with all the brethren so that they may receive the proper food and instruction from the Lord’s table.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the visits of the servant to the brethren proper instruction is given to the company servants and the publishers themselves on how to carry forward with the Lord’s work and how best to serve the interested people. It affords the publisher an opportunity to inquire as to the best method of presenting the message to the people, and it also gives the servant to the brethren an opportunity to go over the records of the company to see wherein it falls short and how it might improve its work as a company. It was necessary for the apostles to continually visit the early church and discuss matters with the servants and overseers in the congregations so that all would be of one mind as to the important thing to be done. Today we know that the important thing is to preach “this gospel of the kingdom”, and the Society delights to aid all the servants and publishers when it can do so.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark86"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark87"></a>OPPOSITION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Christ Jesus said that his people would go through great tribulation because of the work they are carrying on. It would not be done without opposition and persecution at the hands of the Devil and his wicked agents. Therefore the true footstep followers of Christ Jesus expect trouble to come. They are not asking for it, nor would they promote it. But, strange as it may seem, the opposition to the preaching of the gospel does not come from the heathen or non-believers, but the greatest opposition comes from those who profess to be members of the so-called “Christian” religious organizations. Why anyone professing to be a follower of Christ Jesus should object to the message being preached, whatever its form, is hard to understand. But it has ever been thus. The message that Christ Jesus preached was that foretold by the prophets of old. The scribes and Pharisees claimed to preach the same thing as the prophets of old, but they did not. They were teaching their traditions, and not the Word of the Lord, which the prophets taught. (Matt. 15: 3) So it is today. The religious organizations have built up their traditions and their forms of worship, and when Jehovah’s witnesses come along with their simple but proper form of worship they are mobbed, beaten, dragged into court and accused of all manner of evil. This, however, does not deter them from going ahead with the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During this greatest year for the work of free education ever conducted by the Lord’s people there have been fewer arrests of Jehovah’s witnesses for preaching the gospel than for any other year since 1932. For this we rejoice. Approximately 175 brethren were arrested. Practically all these cases were dismissed, either before or after the court trial, and it was necessary to take comparatively few appeals. The complete defeat of the opposers of The Theocracy in June, 1943, by the large number of opinions favorable to Jehovah’s witnesses rendered by the Supreme Court of the United States manifestly disorganized the forces and schemes of the freedom-hating, intolerance-advocating enemy. The number of arrests is very small, considering the thousands of company publishers and pioneer publishers who put in millions of hours in calling from house to house and village to village in trying to locate the “other sheep”. Even peace and tranquillity are found in territories where great opposition existed more than ten years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In 1940 a great effort was put forth by the mobsters and opposers of Jehovah’s witnesses to destroy them and to stop the preaching entirely. This unprecedented action against them did not deter them nor weaken their faith. They relied on Jehovah God and his Son, Christ Jesus, to bring them through victoriously. They rejoice that during this service year they have enjoyed freedom of worship under the protection of their Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many cases growing out of the opposition during 1942 and 1943 had been appealed to appellate courts at the beginning of last year. Most of these eases have been disposed of, and many favorably to Jehovah’s witnesses; a few were unfavorable. Space would not permit to set out a detailed discussion of these cases</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">won in the United States during the past twelve months; but it is noteworthy that there were only thirty instances of mob violence against Jehovah’s witnesses in the United States during the past year, to compare with the 600 mobs reported in 1940. However, in July, 1944, one faithful special pioneer publisher was shot to death by a hater of the truth who warned the pioneer to get out of his assigned territory. The pioneer went about his assigned duty in a peaceful manner, but the backers of the gunman saw to it that he did his work. The witnessing will not stop in that territory, by the Lord’s grace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The fight to maintain freedom of worship in this day must continue to the very end of this old world. The postwar period will not lighten things on Jehovah’s witnesses, for undoubtedly every one will be expected to wholeheartedly support the “new order”, regardless of its form. The work of Jehovah’s witnesses is to ‘go, disciple all nations’ and to tell them of the truth, regardless of opposition. The faithful ambassadors to the homes of the people will brace themselves to meet opposition when it arises. They will always be armed with the “sword of the spirit, which is the word of God”, and this will enable them to defeat persecution. (Eph. 6:17) The safety of the Lord’s servant comes in close association with the Lord’s people and in his being well versed in the Word of God. This is his sure protection and his only hope for peace of heart and mind in this old world. Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to march behind their glorious and victorious Leader, Christ Jesus, fully appreciating that he has taken unto himself his great power and that his reign began in 1914. It is no time now to slack for fear of the enemy; for we have a victorious Leader, and Jehovah’s witnesses will march on courageously, wielding the “sword of the spirit, which is the word of God”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark88"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark89"></a>UNITED ANNOUNCERS’ THEOCRATIC ASSEMBLY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">It seemed as though all the events of free education carried on by Jehovah’s witnesses during the year were pointing toward a united assembly of Jehovah’s servants. They had enjoyed many testimony periods, particularly the “Feed the Flock” Testimony Period in February and the “Freedom of Worship” Testimony Period in April. These had to do with the great </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> campaign that began in February, which campaign surpassed all previous ones in the matter of ■placing the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> magazine with the “other sheep”. The great message of free education and proper worship of God is the theme of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. </span><span class="font3">But after carrying on this work of free education for a year since the previous convention, the “Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly, the Lord’s people were looking forward to another assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This assembly was called the “United Announcers’ Theocratic Assembly”, which name was indeed very appropriate. Jehovah’s witnesses desire to give free education and to teach people how to properly worship God, and this was certainly expressed in their 1944 convention theme, “United Announcers.” They really have something to announce to the people. It is not the propaganda for the upholding of old systems; it is not the engaging in politics or the putting forth of some commercial schemes; but they are unitedly announcing that “the kingdom is at hand”. In 1914 the King Christ Jesus took unto himself his great power and began to reign. He made this very clear to his people in 1922 and thereafter. The servants of the Most High God appreciated that the King is present, reigning, and that he is carrying on his work through his people, giving the final warning concerning the destruction of this old world and the good news of the incoming New World, of which the “kingdom of heaven” would be the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font3"> Government. How appropriate, then, for the united announcers of this one world under the “kingdom of heaven” to be called together in August, from the 9th to the 13th. Those who were privileged to attend this convention appreciated more fully what “united announcers” meant after the convention was over, and its direct relationship to the truths revealed throughout the five days of the assembly of Jehovah’s servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Early in the year Buffalo was selected as the key city. It had a beautiful Memorial Auditorium sufficiently large to take care of the key-city attendees, but not large enough for a convention to which all of Jehovah’s witnesses could be invited. It became necessary to tie in sixteen other cities in the United States with the key city so that ample room would be had in the Memorial Auditorium for those in the eastern part of the United States to comfortably assemble and worship their God. The conventions of Jehovah’s witnesses are far different from the conventions of organizations that serve the interests of this world. There is none of the ballyhoo, parades, and honoring of men that one usually associates with conventions. All honor is due the Creator, Jehovah, and the united announcers see to it that He receives their worship and praise. This they demonstrated from the very opening day. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Early in the morning of August 9 they assembled in the Memorial Auditorium, there to receive instructions concerning the field activity of calling on the people throughout the city and announcing the public lecture to be given Sunday, entitled “The Kingdom of God Is Nigh”. Jehovah’s witnesses are well acquainted with this theme, but they wanted others throughout Buffalo and the sixteen cities tied in therewith to be fully informed of this particular lecture. The thousands that attend the conventions of Jehovah’s witnesses do not come only for benefiting themselves and becoming better educated in the Word of the Lord; but they come also to aid the people of good-will in that particular territory. So they make it their business to call from house to house, witness on the street corners as opportunity affords, and at the same time feed upon the good things that the Lord provides at these gatherings of His people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On Wednesday afternoon the main hall of the Memorial Auditorium was filled before the opening address was to be given, and an overflow crowd filtered into the Exhibition Hall immediately below the main assembly hall. Upward of sixteen thousand convention-ers had come to Buffalo, from every state in the Union and from all parts of Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The public-address system in this auditorium was of the best and it was easy to hear the remarks of all persons speaking from the platform. As one looked toward the platform he saw the glittering sign bearing the heart-comforting yeartext: “Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God.” (Ps. 143:10) The very feel of the convention was that the persons assembled were there to be taught of the Lord and to learn of his will, and they knew even before the assembly opened that they would be refreshed thereby and be ready to go to their homes to carry forth the glad message of the Kingdom. They had full confidence in the Lord’s organization to provide the much-needed information and message of the hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Buffalo and the sixteen cities tied in by direct wire were not the only assemblies in August, but 66 cities in all saw Jehovah’s witnesses meet. What unity! What oneness of idea, spirit and purpose was expressed in this alone! A tremendous work was involved in all these cities in getting halls ready, arranging for rooming accommodations, etc., and all this work was done without cost to individuals. Volunteers came from all parts of the country at their own expense to assist in getting these things ready. This was a picture of the Lord’s organization in action, directed by his spirit! When the convention itself began it was not long until all those attending it found something to do, either in the field, bookroom, cafeteria, or any other place they chose to serve their brethren. But these were not the all-important positions they wished to take up; their positions were somewhere in the auditorium when the instructions from the Lord were given. So at meeting time all departments were closed and the Lord’s people assembled together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The United Announcers’ Theocratic Assembly was officially opened by the chairman, who spoke to all seventeen conventions by direct wire. It was really interesting to follow his talk as he showed the growth of the Lord’s organization, earthly, from 1886 onward; how the small group then gathered together in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, never for a moment slacking their hand, but doing good unto their “neighbor”. The organization continued to grow, in the description given, until, just the previous year, at the “Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly, there were recorded 169,000 attenders at the public meeting. Thus the growth of the Lord’s organization, visible, was a joy to behold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After the 25-minute welcoming speech, the keynote speech of the assembly was delivered. This was given by the president of the Watchtower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, and the subject of his address was, “Seek Ye First the Kingdom.” The material brought to the attention of the listeners was searching. The plain words of Christ Jesus were used as a basis. The questions that Jesus propounded to the apostles were again propounded to the Lord’s servants. His replies were rehearsed, his trust in his Father was expressed, and there was no question in the minds of the listeners that the all-important thing to do now was to ‘seek first the Kingdom of God and his righteousness’, have faith in Jehovah, and rest assured that all things needful would be added unto them. It was a powerful talk; it left no room for anyone to straddle the fence. This is not the time to look after one’s personal interests; but “ ‘sell that ye have, and give alms’ to the poor”, was a point stressed. (Luke 12: 33) ‘Almsgiving’ here means using what one has to carry on the good work, with no commercial attachment to it. The Lord’s people “freely” received and they must “freely give”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those cities that were not tied in directly with Buffalo had manuscript copy and were privileged to read this same talk to the brethren world-wide. This talk set the theme and pace for the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The president of the Society was followed immediately by another director of the organization, who spoke on the subject “Song of Kingdom Service”. Those who were seeking first the Kingdom certainly were the ones who were singing the song of the Kingdom ; for what else was there to do ? Being wholly devoted to the Lord, it was necessary to make known the high praises of God, and this talk covered the point excellently. At the conclusion of this talk it was pointed out that in the early days of the church the Lord’s people enjoyed singing and many of the Psalms were used and put to music. Then the speaker released for the first time a new songbook called “Kingdom Service Song Book”. As this was held aloft for the audience to see, joyous acclaim was made; for here w<sup>r</sup>as an opportunity to express by voice and joyful song their feelings from time to time, which would bring praise unto their Maker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The evening session afforded the brethren the first opportunity to use this new songbook, and they sang the song “Take Sides with Jehovah”. An excellent orchestra played and the entire assembly broke forth in song, which brought tears to the eyes of many. The program for the rest of the evening moved along rapidly with further instruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then came Thursday, August 10. The few hours of field service passed rapidly. The organization set up in the auditorium began to run more smoothly. Everything was in readiness for the afternoon and evening sessions of this day. Excellent instruction was presented to the assembly on “The Publisher in Theocratic Service”. Another speaker pointed out the “Duties of the Servant to the Brethren” and what a great help he has been and is to the publisher and to the Theocratic organization throughout the country. The “Company Organization and Servants’ Responsibility” with regard thereto was developed by a third speaker. All of these talks were heard at the various conventions, as manuscripts had previously been sent them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thursday was a service day. In the morning the publishers went into the field, and the entire afternoon was devoted to instructions concerning field activity. Now comes the evening with a reproduction (on the platform) of a company service meeting. This was very unique. Here all saw a typical company of Jehovah’s witnesses on the platform. The company servant and his assistants went through their regular routine, as they would at any service meeting. But it was not just “any service meeting”; it was a well-prepared service meeting. The company servant knew what he wanted to say, and he said it. All those who were assigned a part in the program were well prepared, not because they were on a convention program but because it is the proper thing to do at all service meetings. Brethren coming from all parts of the city to a company service meeting expect to receive instruction and guidance in the ways of serving the Lord. Therefore those who are charged with the responsibility of giving this instruction should be well prepared and should state the material clearly, either by a discourse or through the question-and-answer method, or by a demonstration. At Buffalo this was presented forcefully, not only through the ear but also through the eye by enacting on the platform a typical service meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That service meetings can be made interesting and something to be desired each week was proved here. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> was discussed, back-call work taken up, and a demonstration presented to the company. The brethren comprising the publishers in the company responded to the questions. They were alert, they were anxious to learn, they were pleased to be in the Lord’s organization, and they delighted to be at this meeting because it was an instruction in service and each one hoped it would make him a better minister. All the lights in the auditorium had been darkened at the start of the service meeting and all one could see was the “little company somewhere in the United States” on the platform. It was an enthusiastic meeting. It made everyone in the audience feel, “I wish all our meetings were just as interesting and helpful at home.” It made every company servant feel, “That’s the way ours are going to be in the future, by the Lord’s grace.” It requires effort and it requires planning, and this convention afforded a splendid opportunity of showing the brethren what can be done and what should be done, to the honor and glory of Jehovah’s name, in their service meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Early in the evening, as the auditorium was being filled, the pioneers were ushered into reserved seats on the main floor of the large auditorium, just in front of the speaker’s platform. They had extra-good seats to see this demonstration, but it was not for this purpose that they were gathered together, primarily. The assembly was made so that the president of the Society might address them on “Field Blessings and Privileges”. Similar gatherings of pioneers were held in every one of the sixteen auditoriums throughout the country that were now tied in with Buffalo. There were upward of 50,000 in attendance at this Thursday evening meeting, of which 5,865 were pioneers. While the instruction dealt primarily with the pioneer work and was very beneficial for pioneers, it had application to all the publishers of the Kingdom that were unitedly announcing the good news concerning Christ’s reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Reports were made concerning Gileadites who had gone to foreign lands; what they had accomplished, what blessings were theirs and what trials. Facts were presented, showing what can be done under opposition, and why, despite opposition, we must continue on; that, for the aid and benefit of the “other sheep”, the Lord’s people cannot stop at this time. Regardless of opposition and the decrees of governments or nations, the Lord’s people, individually and collectively, must carry on this gospel-preaching work. If Jesus had stopped because of the threats, or the apostles because of the persecution, what would have happened to the preaching of the Word of God? It would have died out, unless Almighty God raised up others. This message of the Kingdom has now been placed in the hands of Jehovah’s witnesses, and they look well to the preaching of it; and their field blessings and privileges are tremendous because of their faithfulness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the close of this talk a real surprise came to all in attendance at the assembly. Announcement was made that now the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc., were printers and distributors of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">American Standard Version</span><span class="font3"> Bible, a Bible far superior to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">King James Version,</span><span class="font3"> which Bible has the greatest circulation. The advantages of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">American Standard Version</span><span class="font3"> were pointed out, attention being drawn to the cyclopedic concordance of 95 pages that had been added to this Bible for the aid of the publisher. It was received with the greatest of enthusiasm. It was then announced that every one of the pioneers assembled at the convention, not only at Buffalo but also at the other sixteen convention cities tied in with Buffalo, would receive a copy free. Well, that was too much. There was no restraint of joy and appreciation. With this brief announcement the network binding together all seventeen cities was broken, and then the pioneers filed out four abreast, at Buffalo, through an exit near the platform and received their copy of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">American Standard Version.</span><span class="font3"> By the Lord’s grace, this Bible will be a real help to the servants of the Kingdom in their unitedly announcing the glorious blessings in store for man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The brethren, already fully satisfied, began their third assembly day. Whatever happened in the remaining three days was just that much more blessing for which to give expression of thanks to God. Service was the theme of Friday morning. Then came the opening session of the afternoon with a series of talks on the “Holy Spirit”. These talks were a review of material having already appeared in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> but it was material that the brethren wanted to review. When one fully appreciates that if it were not for this holy spirit or active force of God operating upon His servants nothing could be accomplished by His servants, then indeed it is something to be sought after and something to study about. It was very easy to see that the active force of Jehovah was working in and through all his devoted people, whether anointed or of the “other sheep”. This world-wide educational work that is being carried on daily, year in and year out, could not be accomplished by man’s power, but only under the direction of “The Higher Powers” and because of its being backed up by their irresistible force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All were anxious to assemble at the evening session, which was devoted to “The Value of Theocratic Ministry”, a discussion of forty-five minutes’ duration. This talk was climaxed by another living story. Our typical “any company” took its position on the platform, lights went out, and the drama began. This Theocratic ministry school was small, but very much alive. All members composing this “any company” attended the Theocratic ministry school at the Bethel home, and it was easy to see that the course they had taken at Bethel was to their upbuilding, by the way they responded to questions, by the manner in which the talks were given, and by the counsel received. Brothers and sisters alike responded in the “Review”, and all took notes on the instruction talk. They were there to learn and improve their Kingdom presentation to the public. The evening was very instructive and it proved to be one of those sessions of the entire convention that one was glad he did not miss. The entire day, in fact, was very beneficial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There was a little feeling among the brethren that the convention was coming to a close as Saturday, August 12, came. It was moving too fast! But the day was so filled with activity that this fleeting thought left them quickly and all became engrossed with the day’s activities. Those brethren that could not be there for the entire convention were now beginning to stream in, joining the publishers in the field, and then finding a place in the auditorium or somewhere else where the talks could be heard. So, by the time the afternoon session began there was a throng of 25,000 assembled to hear one of the principal speeches of the convention, the subject being “This Gospel Shall Be Preached”. While this subject has been the theme of Jehovah’s witnesses for years and all knew that this was a command of Christ Jesus, after hearing the hour’s talk the phrase “this gospel” had greater force and meant more to every listener than it ever did before in his life. Each one who had made a consecration to serve God and who was determined to carry it out to the finish was grateful to the Lord for the truths that came forth from the temple through this dissertation. It meant, not the slacking of the hand, but the pressing on with greater zeal than ever before. There was work to be done now and in the postwar period, and all were glad that they were living to do that work; that they were living at this time to preach “this gospel” to all the world for a witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Appreciation of this speech was expressed by everyone in the auditoriums, not only at Buffalo but also throughout the country and world, in their acceptance of the Resolution presented to the convention at the close of this talk. The Resolution is brief, but a careful study of it reveals the true feeling of Jehovah’s witnesses today and what they are determined to do, by the Lord’s grace, and are doing under the direction of the great Theocrat. As a matter of record, and for brief consideration, the Resolution is here published.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark91"></a>RESOLUTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Studied in the light of Christ Jesus’ prophecy concerning the signs that would mark the end of the world, all the events of this world and also the experiences of Jesus’ true followers make certain that in A.D. 1914 Satan the Devil’s uninterrupted rule ended and Jehovah’s Theocratic Government and the authority of his Christ began;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Despite the most intensive activity of Jehovah’s consecrated people during the past thirty years to publish the kingdom of God by his Christ as mankind’s sole hope, the message of the Kingdom continues to be rejected by the world rulers. Already, before end of the global war, the world leaders and governors are proposing for the postwar epoch a new or revised scheme of international collaboration for world peace, prosperity and security; and this they do in defiance of the established kingdom of God ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thebefobe, be rr besolved:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That the kingdom of God by his Son Christ Jesus is the Government of the new world of righteousness; and it alone is the hope of all human creatures desiring everlasting life, unbroken tranquillity, security against all aggression by the Devil’s organization visible and invisible, and the full freedom on earth of the sons of God;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That the inspired Word of God foretells the revival after this total war of a man-made arrangement for the political, economic and religious co-operation of the nations; and that this will divert mankind’s attention away from God’s kingdom and will attempt to stand in the holy place of that Righteous Government, and hence will be an “abomination” in God’s sight and will bring desolation upon all nations in expression of his wrath;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That we, as Jehovah’s witnesses, will continue to give our unswerving allegiance to God’s kingdom;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That the prophetic command of Christ Jesus still stands in effect, to wit, “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations”;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">That we, as those who are fully consecrated to God to do his will in the footsteps of Christ Jesus, recognize our obligation as ministers of the Kingdom gospel; and that, therefore, down to the final end of Satan’s organization and its postwar creation for dominating humankind, we will keep integrity by continuing to advocate the kingdom of God and never slacking in preaching to all nations that “The kingdom is at hand”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses fully realize that they are the ambassadors of the New World of righteousness, and to this work they are determined to devote all their energies and time and are set to fight for that one Government to the finish. All know they are living in the greatest of all days. To have lived at the time of Noah and to have taken a stand with him would have been a wonderful privilege. To have seen the old world go down then would have been a joy. To have lived with Christ Jesus, walked with him and hearkened unto his counsel, and to have been associated with the early church, would have been an incomparable privilege. But to live in these last days of the old world, when both the “heavens” and the “earth” are shaken and consumed by fire and destroyed, and to have a share in the announcement that this old world is going out and the New World coming in, is a privilege, joy and cause for appreciation on the part of one having an understanding of God’s purposes that cannot be expressed in words. We are living in the day of the vindication of Jehovah’s name and Word; we are living in the day when all wickedness, the Devil, his organization and all that goes with it, will cease to be and the righteous New World under the “kingdom of heaven” will be fully established. What a day! Jehovah’s day! What an announcement to make to the people ! Truly there is nothing on earth to compare with it. Jehovah’s witnesses appreciate this and express their understanding by accepting wholeheartedly and unanimously the Resolution set out heretofore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Immediately at the close of the reading and acceptance of this Resolution there was the announcement of the new book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”.</span><span class="font3"> This was given free to everyone that accepted the Resolution. At this assembly there were over 68,000 persons in attendance in the United States alone. All received this new book with joy and they were delighted with the opportunity of taking this message, “The Kingdom Is at Hand,” to the people; for they knew that the Kingdom </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font3"> at hand and they hailed it with all joy and gladness of heart and were thrilled with the truths and events of the afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What would the evening session bring ? Another two hours to be tied in with all the convention assemblies throughout the United States. It featured a series of talks on “Faithful Endurance for the Kingdom”. On the platform were sitting seven brethren, some of them directors of the Society, all workers in the factory and the Bethel home. They were brethren who spent many years in the field service, proving integrity from 28 up to 55 full years in active service, and still going strong. They were examples of faithful endurance. And for what were they working? in whose interest? In the Kingdom interests and for Jehovah God! Most of them had gone through the difficult experiences of 1914 and 1918 and 1925, but had continued right on up to the present time, having lived through thirty years of the Kingdom’s establishment. They were not anxious to quit or retire. Even though some of these brethren were over eighty years of age, they were not looking for a pension or for a home in which to go to settle down for the rest of their days and enjoy life. They were enjoying life the way they lived at the Bethel home, serving there all their time. True, the elder brethren cannot do as much at the age of eighty as they did when they were forty or twenty-five; but they had given unto the Lord their heart, mind, soul and strength. This strength had been largely spent, but what strength was left they still give in daily service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was a joyful hour, for all delighted to hear their experiences, their comparisons, and their wise and sage counsel. This hour flitted by as though it were minutes; but there were other things to learn. This was revealed to all by the excellent talk on “The King’s Marriage Feast”. This was based on Matthew 22:1-14, and it fitted right in with “Faithful Endurance for the Kingdom”. After hearing these living witnesses of faithfulness and endurance, this talk on “The King’s Marriage Feast” meant so much more to us. It showed every one that if he is for the King and interested in His work he should be alert to the privileges that are his and never for a moment take a back seat and relax. If he started in this work, let him hail the King and continue to be in close association with Him and perform the duties required of him. At the elose of the program another helpful instrument that will be used to great advantage by the Lord’s people, the new questions booklet on the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”,</span><span class="font3"> released that afternoon, was presented to the brethren. The brethren were glad to get hold of this, for it meant that as soon as the country-wide and world-wide distribution began the book-study work with this new instrument would begin also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Four days had already gone by, but Sunday was the day that everyone at the convention was talking about. All the publishers were advertising the public lecture and they were looking forward to a mighty assembly of people. The morning session opened early, beginning at 8:00 a.m. Those who desired to be immersed and thus symbolize their consecration to the Lord made appearance at the auditorium. There were 588 that symbolized their consecration by water baptism. Immediately after they had gone to the immersion pools the regular assembly for service took place. The morning text was discussed and counsel was given on the same; some experiences by Gilead graduates were heard, as had been the case each morning; and then to the field all went.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Buffalo has a large population speaking the Polish language and they were invited to the auditorium to hear a lecture on “Religion Reaps the Whirlwind”. Some 800 Polish persons attended this one-o’clock meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Other programs were held immediately thereafter, in English, on the subjects “Treasure in Earthen Vessels” and “The Death of the Firstborn”. Then a short intermission was had, giving the public opportunity to get into the Auditorium building, if there was room; but there was none in the main auditorium. So the public had to take positions in the basement of the auditorium and on the outside, which places were served well by loud-speakers. Everything was packed out, and by 4:00 p.m. upward of 30,000 persons were situated in and around the auditorium. The program began with the playing of “Take Sides with Jehovah”, by the excellent orchestra. Then, right at 4:00 p.m., all the auditoriums throughout the United States were tied in with Buffalo, as well as two radio stations (WHLD of Niagara Falls and WBBR of Brooklyn). “The Kingdom of God Is Nigh” is what the people who attended wanted to hear about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the speaker’s opening remarks he said: “As if by a resurrection out of a dead past of nineteen centuries ago the cry again goes forth as a challenge to all the world, ‘The kingdom of God is nigh at hand.’ ” This cry was not coming up from any of the religious organizations who claimed to represent God. It was not hailed by the political powers who were looking for a new world order and were trying to establish one. They had left God and His Son, Christ Jesus, out of the picture entirely. This was a cry which began when Christ Jesus was upon the earth. It has been silent for nineteen hundred years and, at the close of this old world, it reawakes and sounds out louder and louder until it fills the whole earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The facts and the scriptures were presented, showing that the old world had ended in 1914; that the Devil himself has been thrown out of heaven and down to the earth, but as yet has not been removed from the earth. A final warning was to be announced, and this Jehovah’s witnesses had the privilege of doing. The facts that were presented to the audience were those things that had taken place in the past thirty years, which were indisputable facts in fulfillment of Bible prophecy and proving that “the kingdom of God is nigh at hand”. This only hope for the world was shown, and the necessity for the fleeing to God’s Kingdom by those who love righteousness was forcefully brought out; also that they must remain there until the battle of Armageddon is over. This meant that they must come unto the Lord’s Theocratic organization and serve there in the interest of his Kingdom, work for it and proclaim the message “The kingdom of God is nigh at hand”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The lecture was well received by this tremendous audience. In the United States alone, in the seventeen convention cities, 92,723 heard. Thousands more heard by radio, and by other speakers in other countries. On the initial delivery of “The Kingdom of God Is Nigh” upward of 140,000 persons heard. This is just the beginning! Millions will hear of the message; for on that day at the close of the lecture the booklet containing this speech was delivered free to all hearers. Since then millions of copies have been printed and they are going into the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The climax of the convention had been reached. Looking at it from every angle, it was a total success. Jehovah’s spirit pervaded all the arrangements, and the Lord’s people rejoiced, were refreshed and were satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some had to start on their way home shortly after the public talk, but thousands upon thousands remained, nearly filling the auditorium for the evening sessions. It was a pleasant close. Good things were brought to mind. Closing remarks were made by the president of the Society. Testimonials from the public were read and telegrams and cablegrams from all parts of the world were brought to the attention of the hearers. The Resolution that had been accepted by the con-ventioners the day previous was reviewed and the main points impressed upon the minds of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The time had come for closing. The five-day assembly was over. But the work that was emphasized at this assembly had just really commenced. The witness of this assembly would reach to the ends of the earth, and the message “The Kingdom of God Is Nigh” would be spread far and wide as the Lord’s people go forth to disciple all the nations and to declare that “the Kingdom is at hand”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER COUNTRIES UNDER THE BROOKLYN OFFICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No matter where Jehovah’s witnesses live throughout the world, those intensely interested in the preaching of the gospel make reports to the headquarters office or to one of the Society’s branch offices. Where countries or islands have not been assigned to a specific branch office, then the local companies and pioneers in that territory report to Brooklyn. In some places reporting there is only one publisher of the Kingdom; but in others there will be found forty or more, depending on the progress of the work in that particular vicinity or country. If the work is progressing very well in a certain country or island, and it appears that the Society should establish a branch office there for the best interests of the work, then all reports from the pioneers and companies go to that branch office each month. The branch office, in turn, makes a monthly report to the president of the Society and an annual report at the end of the Society’s service year. The substance of such reports is set forth in this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A brief comment will be made on each territory outside the continental United States, but whose publishers report to the Brooklyn office.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark92"></a>ALASKA</span></h2>
<p><a name="bookmark93"></a><span class="font2">Some work has been done in this vast territory. The population is not great; but there are little towns and villages scattered throughout Alaska witti populations varying from several hundred to approximately ten thousand persons. There are one pioneer and one company comprised of two publishers. These brethren put in 451 hours in field service during the service year, and they placed 348 pieces of literature. The pioneer is conducting five book studies, with an attendance of thirteen each week. There are quite a number of subscribers for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font2">magazines in the country, but no one has ever been there to organize them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is a wonderful field here to be covered. At the end of the year the Society arranged to send eight graduates of Gilead to Alaska. Two of them have gone to Ketchikan, four to Juneau, and two are now in Anchorage. It will be most interesting to compare next year’s report with this one. ‘Go, disciple all nations’ includes these northern countries.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark94"></a>NEWFOUNDLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The island of Newfoundland stretches across the mouth of the swift St. Lawrence river, from the strait of Belleisle, near Labrador, to the Cabot strait, off Cape Breton island. This wilderness country has a population of three hundred thousand people. About half of this population is settled in the principal city, St. John’s, and other small Industrial towns along the railway, which runs from St. Jolin’s, on the east coast, to Port aux Basques, on the west coast, a distance of 547 miles. The remainder of the population resides in small towns and villages along the coasts and, in fact, a few persons will be found in almost every cove and inlet. St. Jolin’s, the capital city, has a population of fifty-five thousand people, and it is a very lively trade center.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is much work yet to be done in Newfoundland. The report for the service year shows a peak of 30 publishers engaging in the field service. There are certain restrictions on literature; so the placements do not amount to very much. Only 1,344 publications were put out during the year. However, the publishers put in 1,683 hours. Some back-calls are made, but book studies are few. There have been 43 different publishers engaging in the work and, according to the best figures available, there are approximately 150 persons associated with the seven organized companies, but some of these individuals are isolated. There are no pioneers to get around to these isolated brethren and assist them, for all the pioneer work is carried on by two brethren that take care of the depot at St. John’s. These two brethren travel whenever possible, either by train or boat, to aid the various companies. Of course, this is in addition to the regular work at the depot: making shipments, handling correspondence, putting through subscriptions, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some public lectures were given throughout the year and, generally speaking, the educational work has made progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Of all those associated, only 75 brethren were able to come together and report at Memorial service, and 5 professed to be of the anointed and partook of the emblems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The depot and home are owned by the International Bible Students Association of Newfoundland, Ltd., and the work generally is carried on under the direction of this corporation. The corporation made provision to mimeograph </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">articles, thus keeping the brethren in that country supplied with “meat in due season”. Every effort Is being made to supply them with more literature and to get the work better organized. It is hoped that some day Gilead graduates will go to Newfoundland to help the inhabitants of this land through the free-education campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The two brethren in charge of the St. John’s office were brought to the Buffalo convention, and were given instructions on how to press forward with the work in Newfoundland, according to the organization outline. The depot servant says that the people of Newfoundland are gradually coming to the frame of mind where they appreciate and respect the work of Jehovah’s witnesses more than in the past, and he feels the foundation has been laid for a greater work in the future. By the lord’s grace, they hope to have a part in it and are looking for some help from Gilead so that a greater </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">heap of witness</span><span class="font2"> may be built up in that country.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark95"></a>ICELAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">This is another country far to the north, a large island lying just outside the Arctic circle. The Society has had one pioneer in this land for many years. He has done splendid work in the distribution of literature. Last year he placed 1,446 bound books and 5,250 booklets, making a grand total of 6,696 pieces of literature. He made a number of back-calls during the year, but none of these have been developed into book studies. This pioneer travels considerably along the coast, but it is hoped that in the coming year he will be able to establish some studies with the natives of Iceland.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark96"></a>THE WEST INDIES AND BERMUDA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Basseterre is a small island in the British West Indies. Three publishers are there, doing what they can with the limited supply of literature they have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Haiti is a French-populated territory in the West Indies. There is one company of seven publishers on the island, and </span><span class="font2">these brethren put in 1,500 hours during the year. Their placements have been low, but they are carrying on back-call work and book-study activity. Some day soon we hope to arrange for some brethren who speak French to aid their fellow publishers in Haiti.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Netherlands West Indies find only one publisher, but he is doing what he can and sends in reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Guadeloupe is an island belonging to the republic of France. There are nine publishers on this island and they have put forth a strenuous effort to get the gospel of the Kingdom preached. When the Petain government of France held power it banned and confiscated all the Society’s literature, and the present regime claims that the Petain government destroyed all confiscated literature. The brethren have petitioned the present government to release any literature that it may have. The government expressed a willingness to release it, if available, but advised that if none could be found they would admit into the country an amount similar to that destroyed, if the publishers wished to have it sent. This was done, and the brethren there are now quite active in the distribution of this literature. In the past few months 572 pieces have been put out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There appear to be two groups on the Island: one group of brethren who desire to study and then sing forth the praises of the Lord and carry on the educational work; and there is another small group that desire to come together for study only, and then sit back and do nothing. It appears that there are splendid opportunities on this island for advancing the Kingdom work; and it may be that a Theocratic-minded, French-speaking brother, filled with zeal, would do both groups much good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Despite decrees that no preaching of the gospel may be done in Bermuda, there are two publishers there that continue on faithfully to sound forth the message of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is the Society’s hope that some day all the islands in the West Indies will be reached with the Kingdom message, so that these Dutch, Spanish, French, and English people may learn of man’s only hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PUERTO RICO</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark97"></a><span class="font2">Puerto Rico is United States territory in the W’est Indies. The inhabitants of this island rejoice to hear the truth. A marvelous witness was given in this land during the year, as will be noted from a comparison of the literature placements. In the service year of 1943, 4,882 books and booklets were placed; but in the service year of 1944 there were 25,929 books and booklets and 2,440 magazines placed In the hands of the people. There are eight company publishers and six pioneers that are doing fine work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The tremendous Increase in the distribution of literature is due, primarily, to the activity of four graduates of Gilead, who were sent to Puerto Rico as special pioneers. In their six months of service there thus far they have averaged 183 hours per month in the field service. These four special publishers are making an average of 84 back-calls a month, and each one is conducting at least 16 book studies weekly. This has resulted in a wonderful witness, the company is growing, and, with these publishers all co-operating together, it is expected that a tremendous increase will be shown in Puerto Rico during 1945. More special publishers from Gilead were sent to Puerto Rico to aid in the publishing work. The language spoken is Spanish, and the people are receptive and glad to hear the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In many respects the work in Puerto Rico can be taken as a good criterion of how the work will progress in foreign countries where Theocratic-minded Gilead graduates, with a proper understanding of the importance of all branches of the service, instruct the publishers. The special publishers sent to Puerto Rico do not confine their activity to the door-to-door work, but they have introduced the magazine work and the back-call and book-study activity. The newly interested ones coming into the truth receive instruction in all these features of service, and they willingly engage in all these activities. Thus they will be well-rounded-out publishers and the witness given in Puerto Rico will be balanced.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark98"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark99"></a>BRITISH HONDURAS, CENTRAL AMERICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Reports from this country have been very meager. During the year two pioneers and five company publishers have reported. There is one company. The hours devoted to witnessing in British Honduras totaled 765. Some back-calls were made and a few book studies were conducted. It has been difficult to get reports from many British possessions because of certain bans that the post office censorship in these countries has put on mail. However, sufficient number of reports came through during the year to show that the brethren are faithful and continuing on in the proclamation of the Kingdom. There is real need for assistance in this land.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark100"></a>PANAMA AND CANAL ZONE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Considerable work is carried on in this territory. What is true concerning other brethren in Central America is also true of the brethren in Panama and the Canal Zone, namely, they are anxious to receive some assistance. They are doing the best they can, but they know that if a good instructor came to direct the work the Kingdom interests would advance much more rapidly. There are over fifty different publishers in the area, and all of them participated in the service sometime during the year. The report actually shows forty-three publishers as an average, two of them pioneers and forty-one associated with the companies. There are three companies in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The time spent in the field during the year is good: 7,656 hours. During this time they placed 15,491 books and booklets and 9,933 magazines. The brethren are back-call-minded and have done well in this regard, and they have shown good progress in establishing book studies, too. The two pioneers are conducting eight studies each week ; and the forty-one company publishers are conducting thirteen book studies each week. The company publishers have not reached the quota of one book study per publisher each week, but they are striving toward that end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Wherever graduates of Gilead have been sent, the local brethren and the people of good-will have expressed appreciation for the aid given them in the organization and studies. Bequests have come from Panama several times, asking that some Gilead graduates be sent there. The Society has tried to send some down, but the Passport Division of the State Department says there are certain restrictions that must be enforced until after the war and that it is inadvisable at the present time to send missionaries into the territory. There are many good people In Panama hungering and thirsting after the truth, but the laborers are few.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark101"></a>COLOMBIA AND VENEZUELA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The country of Panama ties South America to Central America. Going south from Panama we find the country of Colombia and, next to that, Venezuela, on the Caribbean sea. A little work has been done in these two countries by four publishers, three in Colombia and one pioneer in Venezuela. There is a wonderful field here for witnessing, if arrangements can be made to send missionaries into the countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The one pioneer in Venezuela reports, for ten months only, 4,927 pieces of literature placed. The Society tries to keep the publishers in these countries supplied as well as possible with literature, but sometimes this is very difficult. The few reports given concerning these territories on the Caribbean sea show the need of more servants in these fields to preach “this gospel of the kingdom”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark102"></a>EGYPT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Not too many reports come through from Egypt, but there are fifty-six publishers that engage in the work every month, to compare with thirty-three reported the previous year. It appears that they had a fair supply of literature to keep going, for upward of 20,000 publications were placed in the hands of the interested. There is much to be done in Egypt and the work requires a lot of organization. The brethren there are willing, but they have not received Theocratic instruction. About once or twice a year letters come through from Egypt, giving reports of their activity and expressing their joy in the Ix&gt;rd. Three companies are organized, two pioneers are active; and some book studies are being conducted, but not to the same extent as in other countries where Theocratic instructions are more fully appreciated. There are many different tongues spoken in Egypt, and it is hoped that some day soon this vast field will be opened.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark103"></a>SYRIA AND LEBANON</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">The brethren in this part of the world have continued on faithfully through very trying times. One company is organized and there are four pioneers in the country, making a total of nine publishers. The literature they have on hand they are using, and they distributed 12,614 books and booklets. The book-study work, according to reports, has not as yet been organized nor appreciated. This is no fault of the brethren, for very little correspondence goes through. The brethren are looking forward to the time when the restrictions on communication will be relaxed and new publications will reach them for the educational work that must be done in these lands.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark104"></a>PALESTINE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">There is only one publisher reporting from here, but the small report we do have is mostly for work done in 1943, with but little work done in 1944. It requires real courage and faith on the part of an individual to stand alone in a country, proclaiming the message of the Kingdom and seeing very little results from the work done. But at Haifa, Palestine, there is one publisher zealously proclaiming the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The reports that follow in this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font3"> come from branches that are in direct communication with the president’s office and which have filed annual reports.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark105"></a>ARGENTINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Many years ago the Society established a branch office in Argentina. As the work grew the countries of Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay came under the jurisdiction of the Argentine branch; and, for convenience, depots were established in these three countries. It is hoped that sometime soon branches can be established in each of these countries, because the populations are sufficiently large. The workers are few, but, by the Lord’s grace, these will be increased as opportunity affords to send publishers in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All of this territory has been overridden by the clergy of the Catholic Hierarchy. This religious sect thinks that all South America belongs to the Hierarchy ; and little do they believe that it belongs to the Lord. In fact, for centuries they have &quot;been trying to take it away from the Lord and have held it within the scope of the old world. It has always been Vatican City’s desire to rule world-wide, and she has gotten a strong grip on the South American countries. The influence of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in Argentina has made that country Fascist, even as its influence made Italy Fascist and threw Germany into the clutches of National Socialism. The Hierarchy has always preferred totalitarian rule to democratic rule. Democratic rule gives the people something to say in government; but under totalitarian methods the rulers tell the people what to do and hold them in a tight system of regimentation. The people of Argentina never had a chance, but the other countries are a little more liberal in their forms of government. Some day before the battle of Armageddon even the people may see the great need for relief from the oppression of this oetopus-like organization and will throw off religion completely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Branch servant reports concerning Argentina:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This year we have had to put up with many difficulties, one of which was the scarcity of literature. Aid came to us through our friends in Montevideo and also from Santiago, Chile. These brethren sent to us extra magazines that they had on their shelves, and all of these were distributed in Argentina. Constantly we tried to get literature from the Society’s office in Brooklyn, and when this was found to be impossible we then began to bring literature Into the country from Montevideo. This was costly, for there was much red tape to go through over a period of months in obtaining permits from the Montevideo government to export and then to get it into the country at Buenos Aires. But we were successful and received many cartons of literature. What publications were brought in amounted to very little, but it was the best we could do under the circumstances. Jehovah God appreciates our labors and His hand can be clearly seen to be with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is not very pleasing to send in a yearly report showing fewer placements of literature than in the previous year, but circumstances made this occur. Another sad thing for us is that we have had fewer hours and fewer workers in the field than in previous years. It is hard to convince the brethren to continue to work in the interests of the Kingdom when we have no literature, and it was because of the shortage of publications that many ceased in their service. It being a time of many other troubles in this country, many of the brethren have become frightened and they have withheld in their service work. We rejoice to see the many who are of strong faith in the Rock of Ages and who are bound not to relax nor slack their hand because of the things that happen here. We thank God that it is not so bad as it could have been. We are in hopes of a good increase in this coming year. We appreciate more fully the importance of the back-call work, which has been greatly increased, but now the brethren must be further instructed concerning the importance of book studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With all the opposition from the Devil, we still have plenty of signs from God that He is with us. This has been one of the most dangerous of all the years in serving the Lord, but, even so, we have done things that we are sure we could not have done without the Lord’s help, We expect shortages of literature and many other things, but our God has helped us through these troublous times. So even with our trials and difficulties, and even though our figures do not show up so well, we do not call this our bad year; but it is better to say “the best year for the truth”. When the adversary makes much fuss, then Jehovah does the blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is to our joy that we had an average of 348 publishers in the field service each month, distributing 123,399 books and booklets in addition to the 28,249 magazines. The back-calls are on the increase. Three thousand six hundred and twenty-seven were made during the service year, to compare with 1,756 the previous year. Each week the pioneers, special publishers and company publishers are conducting only 33 book studies, but this we hope to increase during 1945.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark106"></a>CHILE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">While there was literature available all the year for the publishers in Chile, still we have had a lower distribution of books and booklets. During the service year of 1944 there were nearly 43,000 publications placed, to compare with 45,000 last year. However, there was a splendid increase in the distribution of magazines. Fifty-eight publishers engaged in the field service and put in 9,531 hours. It seems hard to make people realize the real privilege they have of being Theocratic publishers and announcers of the King and his Kingdom. We hope to do better in the coming year, if this be God’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Chile they had a convention at the same date as that in the States. Mall service to Chile appears to be more favorable; for they received the things there sooner than we did in Argentina. The convention was very successful. At the public meeting they had 250 persons in attendance and they were able to engage four radio stations to broadcast the lecture “Peace—Can It Last?” They have been able since the convention to continue broadcasting over two or three of the stations. Some of them have taken the Spanish talks throughout the entire year. This is a good thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We are looking forward to the time when the president will send someone to take over the work in Chile, and I am glad that you indicated you would make Chile a direct branch of the Society instead of a depot of Argentina. So we pray that the heavenly Father will send more laborers to his vineyard for the betterment of the work of The Theocracy.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark107"></a>PARAGUAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">As things stand now in this country, the work is quite disorganized. This is due to the activities of the man in charge last year, causing much disturbance In the work. He left the Lord’s organization, but did much damage before he went away. It is just a matter now of beginning again. A new brother has been sent there from Argentina and we are doing all we can, but you will see that the report is much under the one of last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are now eight publishers in the field, to copipare with thirty-three the previous year. However, these publishers put out 3,646 pieces of literature and spent 1,622 hours in the field. We hope it will be possible soon for the Society to send some of the graduates of Gilead. These brethren will be so much better for organizing and instructing the servants of the Lord in this country. We are waiting for such an event to happen and we look forward to the results it will bring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Paraguay is a country exceedingly poor. Many of the people do not know how to read, and many others speak very poor Spanish. So it is hard for them to grasp the truth, unless one has patience. The brethren carrying on the work in this land must be willing to teach and help others. Now that the work has been retarded through unfaithfulness of the former depot servant, we need some strong brethren to push ahead with the work that is now going so slowly.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark108"></a>URUGUAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">In this country w’e have had some progress in the work. More publishers in the field have added to the service, and in the last month two pioneers have entered the field. There has been an excellent increase in the number of hours, as will be seen by the report. There are eight pioneer publishers and twenty company publishers, making an average of twenty-eight this service year, to compare with last year’s twenty-six. The brethren placed 31,610 books and booklets; and they put in 12,551 hours, to compare with 10,437 last year. Nearly 4,000 magazines were distributed. The back-call work is well on the increase, over 1,000 back-calls being made, to compare witli 400 last year. The book-study work needs to be organized and the brethren must see the importance of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The brethren in this country really rejoice in their great liberty to serve the Lord, which, in fact, is the greatest privilege that any person can have. The friends here are also waiting for the coming of someone from Gilead College to help them with new instructions and proper organization. They want to be useful in the service of The Theocracy. In this country they did not lack literature, but we appreciate the aid they gave the brethren in Argentina.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Uruguay is a liberal country, indeed. I say now that the Society there is rather well thought of by the authorities. They have been able to use a broadcasting station without interference of any kind. After the general convention in the States the brethren wanted a convention to be held in their country, and this has been arranged for October.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The brethren from all these countries send their good wishes to you and, in all sincerity, expect that you will in due time come to this side and see us. It will be in next September that I will have come here to Argentina just twenty years ago. With this wonderful message and with Jehovah’s help much has been done, all to the honor and glory of the Lord. After these twenty years of joyful service we also expect some of the Gilead graduates to come as instructors and aid us here in Argentina and other countries. We all ask the Lord’s rich blessing upon you and all the witnessing work, and that he prosper the work of our hands for his glory and honor.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark109"></a>AUSTRALIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The campaign of free education has moved ahead quite freely in Australia during the past service year. The brethren there are indeed grateful to the great Educator, Jehovah, for teaching them to do his will. Being part of the one great Theocratic organization visible on the earth, they look to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> for the refreshing stream of life-giving truths that have continued to flow through its columns. The report for the service in the field is very encouraging, and for a detailed consideration the reader may turn to the table setting out the field service report for the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Due to the present global war all transportation has been mobilized for that purpose. The Brooklyn factory that in former years supplied literature to the Australian brethren could not make shipments during the past year, with the exception of 10,000 Watchtower No. 10 Bibles and 1,000 copies of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott. </span><span class="font3">All other literature used was in storage locally or was printed there. It was possible to obtain enough paper, even though a shortage prevailed, to produce 49,150 books, 910,000 booklets, 549,660 magazines, and large quantities of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font3"> and other leaflets. One of the books published was </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”;</span><span class="font3"> also the booklets </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom in the New World, The Coming World Regeneration,</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion Reaps the Whirlwind,</span><span class="font3"> all of these three booklets being printed in substantial quantities. These new publications, along with the older ones in storage, kept the brethren busy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> have been published locally, but the brethren are looking forward to the time when the magazines will be mailed direct from Brooklyn. It is hoped that this will be possible during the year. For some of the details, and comment on the work in Australia, excerpts from the Branch servant’s report are given here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As students of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> we know that our ministry of service is a glorious treasure, priceless and enduring. As Theocratic publishers we have striven in the field to hold fast that treasure and prove our love and devotion to Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Evidences of the outpouring of the Lord’s spirit on the special publishers come from all parts. Two brothers In a New South Wales town have in four months established 39 book studies, attended by 65 persons each week. From Canberra, the federal capital, we have recently received the first report of the company formed there. For a start, they have six publishers, all of whom were educated and organized for service by two special publishers. In Western Australia, a special pioneer is holding regular studies with a group of 17 aboriginals. Those who can read have their own copies of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”,</span><span class="font2"> and delight to take part in the study, and the pioneer is teaching the others how to read. To get to the convention they sold some of their belongings and reckoned afterwards that it was well worth while.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While the special publishers and general pioneers are doing excellent work, the same is true in connection with the companies. The brethren throughout the land are trying to organize companies wherever they are. These new companies especially appreciate the service rendered by the servants to the brethren. The following comes from an isolated company of only two publishers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“You will be pleased to hear that we managed to get sixteen interested people to attend the servant’s talk. Judging from the rapt expression on their faces, It was enjoyed by</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">all. We now have five regular book studies, and, by the Lord’s grace, we Intend to get more studies In the homes of the people of good-will.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Knowing what the regular visits of the servants to the brethren mean to the companies and how valuable is their work as “the eyes, ears and mouth” of the office, we give thanks for the institution of this Theocratic service. The brethren who serve in this capacity are ever mindful of their responsibilities and privileges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Testimony Periods. The “Defeat of Persecution” Testimony Period in October was a powerful follow-up to the “Free Nation’s” Theocratic Assembly. The new booklet, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom in the New World,</span><span class="font2"> was available for distribution and more than 100,000 copies went out. There has been a good deal of comment in the press about the growing bureaucratic control of the nation, so the new booklet met with a ready response from people yearning for true freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the month of May, featuring “Teach All Nations”, a special effort was made to reach the foreign-language communities. Interesting reports have come from the capital cities especially, and the results have been even better than anticipated. In the Greek community of Sydney alone, 700 pieces of literature were placed, and the recordings played many times. A publisher working among the Chinese met one who enjoyed the message so much he offered later to act as interpreter, but instead of waiting for the publisher to tell him what to say. he started right in witnessing himself. Eighteen bound books were placed in twenty minutes. Some of the Chinese came back for more literature an hour later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Recognition of Ministers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Five years ago the authorities of the nation took the stand that Jehovah’s witnesses were not ordained ministers. This view was often challenged in the courts, but, until recently, without success. Terms of imprisonment were common. Then came the ban and Jehovah’s witnesses were looked upon as having no rights whatsoever. In June, 1943, however, the High Court declared invalid the regulations under which the ban was Imposed, and restored the legal standing and rights of the Society. The authorities still refused to recognize any as ordained ministers, so the case of a special publisher, Frank Grundy, was taken to the courts. On appeal it came before Judge Holt in Sydney. A good witness was given, both sides tendering as evidence publications of the Society. The false allegations of the respondents were effectively disproved and the judge held that ‘‘on the evidence before me on this appeal I cannot find that this faith is not </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Iona fide&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the question of whether the appellant was to be recognized as a minister, the judge stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“In various homes, he conducted meetings twice a week which were opened and closed with prayer. At these meetings study was made of the Bible and of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">and hymns were sung to the accompaniment of a piano when available. About 20-25 persons generally attended these meetings and he also held other meetings in different homes on every other night of the week and, during the day, was engaged in canvassing from house to house. In these circumstances, although there was no church or fixed place for holding meetings, I am of the opinion that he looked after something equivalent to a parish, conducted religious meetings, had a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bona fide</span><span class="font2"> congregation and ministered to his congregation spiritually. I am of opinion that he falls within the meaning of ‘Minister of Religion’ in the Defence Act, 1903-1941. I therefore allow the appeal and quash the conviction.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The judgment, now a precedent, was then made the basis of discussions with the Man Power authorities on the standing of other ordained ministers of the Society. As a result, 150 brethren, men and women of the pioneer ranks and Bethel family, have been recognized as ministers, students, and missionaries. Thus the “earth” has “swallowed up the river” and the full-time service of The Theocracy is able to go on, free from hindrance, to the honor of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">An interesting commentary on the “ban” was made on March 30, 1944, by Mr. Justice Brennan in a written judgment in the Supreme Court of Queensland. Courageously he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“A state of hysteria existed in our public life for some time after the outbreak of the present world disaster. Australia by most of her public men had for years prior to the war been fiddling without a single thought for the morrow. When it became evident that our very existence was likely to be immediately threatened by an Invasion of a foreign power, the hysteria became a panic. Jehovah’s witnesses, as an organization, was set upon and declared by the powers that be, subversive, and was consequently banned. Such action, though unfortunate, probably was justified on account of the disorganized state, and the ignorance of some of the public men, of our social system. When matters somewhat cooled down, the High Court of Australia in its traditional British calmness, gave judgment against the banning of the organization and restored to Jehovah’s witnesses its constitutional rights to religious freedom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">United Announcers’ Theocratic Assembly</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As the year drew to a close all hearts and minds turned to the 1944 convention. It was indeed a glorious time of feasting in perfect harmony and joy of heart. Unity was apparent to a degree never experienced before. People of good-will who came to the convention noted this above everything else. It pervaded the entire atmosphere and made everyone feel thrilled to be a part of such a united body of announcers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From breakfast on Thursday morning until the closing remarks on Sunday night, the Lord’s organization provided all things necessary. A part of every feature of Kingdom activity was available to all—house-to-house and street witnessing, leaflet distribution, and the convention sessions— and these together made up a full and well-balanced program for the convention. The reports show that 2,286 publishers were in the field, many of them for the first time. Eighty-two brethren symbolized their consecration at the Australian assemblies. At Sydney a number of the candidates were Italians. The Italian publisher who had helped them in the truth interpreted the talk for them, and, fully understanding the step they were taking, they were then immersed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Words fail to express our appreciation of having the text of the main Buffalo speeches at each assembly. These talks cemented the unity and vigorously developed the theme, “the Kingdom is at hand.” The responsibility of those who would have the Lord’s blessing in announcing the Kingdom was made unmistakably clear, and in this the faithful rejoiced. Side by side with the Kingdom theme, the understanding both of the operation of Jehovah’s spirit and of the King’s invitation to his feast provided a spiritual banquet “filling our hearts with food and gladness”. Surely there has been no greater evidence of the flowing of Jehovah’s spirit toward his creatures. These talks, together with your cabled greetings, made us feel at one with our brethren at Buffalo and other assembly points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Three thousand eight hundred were present at the eight assemblies on Saturday afternoon to hear the address “This Gospel Shall Be Preached”. At all points the conventioners accepted the Resolution with a determined and unanimous “Aye”. That one word was uttered by men and women who meant by it that they would, by the Lord’s grace, carry out every word of that to which they had assented. Then followed the announcement of the new book. The applause had scarcely subsided when it was vigorously renewed at the release of the booklet, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion Reaps the Whirlwind.</span><span class="font2"> At other sessions the conventioners were overjoyed to learn of the new songbook and that the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">American Standard Version </span><span class="font2">was to take its place alongside the two versions of the Great Textbook already printed on the Society’s presses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The high light of the convention was undoubtedly the public lecture, “The Kingdom of God Is Nigh.” The total attendance was 8,000, an improvement of 10 percent on last year. Particularly noticeable was the presence of newly interested folk to whom the special invitation letter had been given. These so much enjoyed the Sunday afternoon lecture that many came to the evening session, so that, apart from the public lecture, this was the best-attended session of the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One report from the Sydney Town Hall concerned an evangelist preacher who had spoken at a regular stand on a street corner for the last 30 years. After hearing the lecture he exclaimed that at last he had found the truth and that, though his colleagues would expect him at his usual stand that night, he would not be there and would never be there again. He wanted to know, and was promptly advised, what he should now do to learn more about the Kingdom. Every assembly has sent like reports indicating that the public address was the most telling message that has ever been presented to the people of this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From this convention we now go forth to a new year, strengthened in purpose and refreshed in mind, to make the announcement that the Kingdom is at hand ring throughout the land. This we know to be the Lord’s will, and being his will, it cannot fall, even though w’e are mere earthen vessels and our preaching appears to be the height of folly. It is our prayer that we may continually march forward at one with yourself and all other united announcers to the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Fiji Islands</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1938 the publications of the Society were banned, and in 1940 the work in this island almost came to a standstill. However, the brethren carried on the best they could. Now the spiritual food reaches them regularly and all are strengthened thereby.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the past year a brother returned to Australia from Fiji, reporting that he was able to get the brethren together and that now they are having regular studies and field service. There are eight publishers on the island, and they distributed what literature they had, namely, 100 booklets. Back-calls are being made and the work is advancing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BRAZIL</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark110"></a><span class="font3">Brazil is the largest of all the South American countries. While there are only a few hundred publishers, they are zealous and are accomplishing much in the interests of advertising the Kingdom. In every aspect the field service has advanced over the previous year’s activity. This will be clearly seen as one examines the table setting out the field-service report. The work was not accomplished without opposition, but the joy of worshiping God in “spirit and in truth” has held this little band of witnesses together in this great land. Undoubtedly there are thousands more who will heed the Lord’s call when reached. The problem is the reaching of all these people. The few publishers there are doing a magnificent job. What might be done, by the Lord’s grace, with more laborers, would be hard to estimate. The call of the brethren of this land for graduates of Gilead to come and aid is not a call to come and do the work that they should be doing; but it is a call to take on territory that they are unable to reach, and to aid the “other sheep” now scattered throughout all the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The appreciation and zeal of the brethren are well expressed by the Branch servant of Brazil, and a portion of his annual report is recorded here:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another year of total war with all its horrors for the nations of earth; another year of joyful Kingdom service for Jehovah’s devoted people. His Kingdom publishers in Brazil not only have held their own in the battle of light against darkness, but have gained ground, as will be seen from the report that follows. For tills they thank “God that glveth the increase”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> Campaign began in March and was carried through June. It was a blessing and a joy to those who entered fully Into the campaign. There were 667 new subscriptions listed, Including 88 from the States, while in the campaign of the former year less than half that number were secured. Again the Branch family set a special goal for subscriptions and had the pleasure of adding 87 to our list. The 17,864 individual magazines placed were 2,536 in excess of the number placed the year previous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There was a monthly average of 283 Kingdom publishers in the field, an increase of 31 over last year, almost the number of Gideon's little band. They have worked diligently and the Lord has blessed their efforts. Quite a number of the company publishers spend 90 to 100 hours a month in the service. Their average hours increased from 18.8 last year to 23.4 this year. Only with the entrance of this service year were the back-call book studies reported, and to date the monthly average is only 0.3; however, the new book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children </span><span class="font2">with the help of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Study Questions</span><span class="font2"> booklet will undoubtedly give an impetus to the studies, and it is expected to see these materially increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the heat of that memorable year, 1940, the zeal for the service of his “god&quot; led someone to avail himself of 20,000 copies of literature which shows that the hope for mankind Is not fascism, but freedom of the worship of God. The circulation of the booklet was prohibited, but the 20,000 copies failed to be secured with a sealed stone at the mouth of the cave, and now in that city five of its public servants have symbolized their consecration to serve the true and living God and at least five others are deeply interested in the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By the Lord’s grace, the equipment for the field was added to. The book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font2"> received just before the August Assembly, has animated the workers more than any other book ever received. In addition, the disc to introduce it and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Study Questions</span><span class="font2"> booklet for studies with the newly-interested have enheartened the brethren to such an extent that their presentation is almost irresistible and that beautiful little blue book is going into the hands of the people at a surprising rate and its message right into their hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Just as our stock of the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font2"> is exhausted, we have had the privilege of preparing </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion Reaps the Whirlwind,</span><span class="font2"> which will, no doubt, do a powerful work of “uncovering” the errors that have saddened many hearts. As we finish using one Instrument the great Provider furnishes us with another and mightier one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Appreciation of your thoughtfulness to send down an office copy of each </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font2"> by airmail is inexpressible. This better enables us now to keep the publishers up-to-date on service instructions with our </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informante.</span><span class="font2"> Two features have been added to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sentinela.</span><span class="font2"> Beginning with the January number of this year, the questions for study have appeared at the bottom of the page just as in the English </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> This has put new life into the studies, enabling the students to derive more benefit from the study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">So far as is known, South America’s first convention was held in Sao Paulo in July, 1936, and since that time there has been one or more such gatherings of the Lord’s people each year, usually at Memorial; for the past three years we have participated in the great Theocratic feasts of ingathering with our brethren world-wide. The good of these seasons of refreshing cannot be overestimated. Since Brazil lacks as yet large, well-organized companies with regular visits from the servants to the brethren and there are many scattered, isolated publishers, the assemblies help to unify the work, to enable the brethren to realize that we are one, Jehovah’s people for the purpose of publishing His name; and the food and instructions furnished at the time, coming direct from the storehouse dispensed by the “faithful and wise servant”, serve to build us up in our most holy faith. We find ourselves richly nourished and strong in the power of the Lord to go forth and continue the Christian’s glorious warfare. The united witness given on such occasions, both house-to-house and the advertised public lecture and street magazine work, makes known Jehovah’s doings on a greater scale than is possible with the efforts of the small groups alone. The year just closed saw two such assemblies in Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The first convention, April 7-9, included the Memorial and was held in six cities: Porto Alegre, Curitiba, Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador and Manaus, as well as smaller groups of witnesses who gathered in Recife and Cornelio Procopio for united Theocratic activity. In Salvador, where the public lecture had been interfered with in August of the previous year, the lecture “Freedom in the New World” was given entirely without the power of Jehovah’s enemies to interfere. The brethren were jubilant, and their joy overflowed at the announcement of the assembly to follow in August. Forty-six were immersed. Salvador and Manaus felt keen disappointment that it was not possible to include them in the August assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In accordance with the president’s instructions, preparations were made to hold the United Announcers’ Theocratic Assembly in one city. Rio de Janeiro was chosen, but the problem of securing an adequate hall far enough in advance, added to the consideration that Sao Paulo is accessible to a larger number of Jehovah’s witnesses, led to the decision to hold the assembly there. The public lecture was the best ever given in Brazil and was received with rapt attention by the audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The happiest moment of the assembly and the time of greatest joy I have ever seen in all our conventions in Brazil was that of the release of the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font2"> in Portuguese, for which we had eagerly waited since its announcement in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Comjort All That Mourn</span><span class="font2"> booklet some months previous. At this assembly 20 persons were immersed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As the activities of the best Kingdom year end and we enter upon a new service year, there can be noted a great movement of the people looking toward The Theocracy, just as the movement of earth’s creatures at dawn signals their welcome of a new day. Ours is a blessed privilege to be able to reach out and help those who are groping for the light of day. We are determined to ‘do with our might what our hands find to do’, continuing this &quot;foolishness of preaching”. And may Jehovah add to the number of the preachers! Our very increasing privileges renew our strength in Jehovah, who is our strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We look forward joyfully to receive our Gilead comrades, and pray for their speedy and safe arrival in our midst. Through you we send loving greetings to ail the Israel of God on this earth, especially to those who are serving with you at Bethel.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark111"></a>BRITISH GUIANA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The faithful publishers of the Kingdom in this little country on the north shore of South America have not slacked their hand because of opposition. Through their good works, particularly book studies, the publishers have increased from twenty-three last year to forty this service year. They have no literature to distribute, because a ban has been on the Society’s literature for a considerable time. But this does not slow down the preaching activity; for they continue to ‘go, disciple those that will hear’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The brethren put in 5,725 hours, to compare with 3,512 for the previous year. It appears from the report that this is the first year they have started bookstudy activity. There are three companies organized, and the faithful publishers are determined to carry on regardless of what happens. The Branch servant gives us the high lights for the year:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Publishers here have continued to deliver the witness in spite of the discouraging conditions that seem peculiar to this country, and which may be a result of our geographical position, so far removed from the strife and turmoil of the North. There is much religion, but, although folk are usually willing to listen to a verbal witness, we find little disposition to study God's Word, and so we experience some difficulty in arranging book studies. However, we have been encouraged by your advice and exhortation, and we mean to press on in the service of our King in order to gain his daily approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We had not previously heard that revised Instructions had been issued recently, for, as you are aware, we have not been permitted to receive literature for some considerable time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the circumstances, we were surprised at a Governor’s Proclamation, which was issued on the 29th June, prohibiting the importation of all the literature of the Society. (Previous action would appear to have been taken under the Censorship Regulations.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We thereupon wrote the government, in the belief that at least our Bibles would be released, but our application was rejected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The British Guiana government now occupies the unique position of having placed a ban on the Importation of Bibles! Presumably our mere handling (not even printing, as we pointed out in connection with the shipment in question) copies of God’s Word contaminates the Holy Book! ‘Verily they will have their reward.’ The brethren are by no means downhearted on this account, for they realize that the matter is in the Lord’s hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Two conventions were held in Georgetown during the year, and both served to enthuse and edify those who attended. The first, in April, had as its keynote “The Truth Shall Make You Bree”, and approximately 200 persons assembled for the public discourse on that subject. The second, as we forecast in our July letter, was fixed for 12th and 13th August, to synchronize with the Buffalo convention, and we followed your instructions as closely as we could, with the result that many who attended declared it “the best yet”. About 200 people heard the public discourse, “Religion Reaps the Whirlwind,” which was received with many manifestations of interest. The Resolution was thereafter read and unanimously adopted, bringing the proceedings to a close. We look forward to greater activity in the Lord’s service in the coming year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark112"></a>BRITISH ISLES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">This land across the English Channel from the European mainland underwent a terrific assault by the Nazi hordes. Great bodies of water are no sure protection these days; for the Devil has brought forth many diabolical instruments of destruction, such as the robot bomb and other weapons of annihilation. The British people have stood up well under the onslaught. Those in covenant relationship with God in this land have had to face the same dangers and difficulties of life that this old world brings to a nation in the midst of total war. While the demons are carrying out the policy of the Devil through their agents on the earth, namely, that of “rule or ruin”, this has not frightened the Lord’s people nor has it made them hold up for the duration. The horrors brought by the robot bomb, day and night, did not retard the witness, because the servants of the Lord in the British Isles were determined to reach as many people of good-will as possible. They have done well, under the Lord’s direction and with his blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Although every effort has been made to obtain relief from the unjust restrictions that have been placed upon the receipt and dispatch of the Society’s publications, no relief has yet been given. While great professions of freedom, especially freedom of worship, are expressed in the Atlantic Charter and by the government of England, this oppressive measure against the free circulation of the Bible and Bible literature has continued. Despite all appeals made, it is still true that the brethren in England cannot dispatch the Bible or Bible literature to any place outside the British Isles. In fact, they are not allowed to send the Society’s literature to our brethren in Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Notwithstanding these severe restrictions, the work goes on at a good pace and a new peak of publishers was reached in April, when 13,114 persons shared in the field service. This is an increase of 800 over any previous peak. The number of hours devoted to witnessing and calling upon the people is higher than in any previous year. A study of the tabulated report will show the zeal of these brethren, who are faithfully serving the Lord in the face of many obstacles not encountered by most Kingdom publishers. It is not at all possible to supply literature in the quantities needed. Never has there been a greater demand for reading matter than at the present time, and everything the Society can have printed locally is easily distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The lack of literature places the publishers in this land in a very difficult position. For the last three years the pioneers have worked with meager supplies. Their work is one, really, of arranging for return calls and starting book studies. The pioneers have done surprisingly well in arranging for these studies and in placing with the interested people what few publications they had. The pioneers in England have labored hard, as a whole, and they have stood firm in their integrity. It will be noted, when one examines the tabulated report, that most of the pioneers are special pioneer publishers. It is necessary for them to receive financial help from the Society in order, under the circumstances, for them to keep going. The brethren in England have been very generous in making it possible for these publishers who have been in the pioneer service for a long time to remain in that work. Very grateful are the pioneers for the help the Society has given them, which has been possible because of the generosity shown on the part of the brethren in their contributions to the Society. Undoubtedly the Lord has put it into the minds of those who love righteousness and The Theocracy to render the necessary financial assistance so that these pioneers may continue in the full-time service, awaiting the day when more literature will be theirs to give an even wider witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our brethren in Britain give their thanks to Jehovah for the inestimable privilege of service granted them in the land during 1944. No matter what the trial, no matter what the difficulty, no matter what the hardship, this one thing they have done, that is, preach the gospel of the Kingdom. All are looking forward to the time when greater liberty will be granted so that more people who love righteousness can be helped and brought unto the organization. The Branch servant’s report is very interesting and gives us a good picture of conditions as they exist there and how the brethren are faring under these conditions. Excerpts from his report follow:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The year past has proved to be one of the most momentous in the history of these Isles. Major events of far-reaching importance have passed over us. These are known throughout the civilized world and will, no doubt, be felt in the days that are ahead. With the severity of war conditions close upon us, Jehovah’s people in this land have striven to keep integrity with him while pushing on with the great work of free education for men of good-will toward God. In all the vicissitudes of the year gone by, it has been evident at every turn that Jehovah’s power has been over and around his people. To Jehovah, then, is due all the praise and gratitude for whatever progress has been made in extending the knowledge of his gracious purposes to those who “seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This has been done, not without opposition from demons and men. At times there have been attacks from the air that have made regular Kingdom service extremely difficult. Many faithful brethren have lost their homes and all their possessions in these vicious attacks of recent months. Yet, despite these abnormal conditions, they have kept on in the all-important work of preaching the gospel. In all these experiences the Lord’s protecting care has been marvelously demonstrated, for none have lost their lives although in the midst of destruction on every hand. It is evident that the Lord has more work for them to do and they have been very conscious of this fact. On several occasions home Bible-study meetings have been in progress when bombs have struck either the home or near-by dwellings and both the brethren and the newly interested in whose homes the studies were being held have had marvelous escapes. Time and again while the company meetings have been in progress flying bombs have passed over at low altitude, with their terrifying noise. Only those who have been conscious of their relationship to the great Theocrat have been able to continue In unabated steadfastness of service, remaining on the job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We commenced the year with the theme of free education as our campaign of action. With the yeartext before us, “Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God,” it was seen that the work of Bible instruction must be carried forward in the way that the Lord has directed. The need of proper instruction for the Lord’s people was felt and applied. The work of instructing others with the equipment the Lord has given us has taken on larger dimensions during the year. Some have fallen out by the way, others have slacked the hand so far as Kingdom service is concerned, but it can truly be recorded that these have been few, while many new ones have joined the ranks of the united announcers of The Theocracy. With the invasion of the continent, the flying bombs, and the consequent evacuation of large numbers of the population, it will be seen that Jehovah’s servants in this land have accomplished their work under exceptionally difficult circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Spiritual Sustenance</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To Jehovah we render thanks for the constant flow of refreshing truths that have come to us. This above all things has kept the Lord’s people in unity of purpose. In keeping with the promise given, the household has been provided with “meat in due season”. There has never been any lack of sustaining food at any time throughout the year. The weekly studies as well as private study have enabled the Lord’s people to drink deeply at the well of truth. The wonderful unfolding of the Scriptures setting out “God’s Freewoman”, “The Glorious Treasure of Service,” etc., has done much to keep our minds set for the New World and all its glorious privileges. The Lord has truly prepared a table before us ‘in the presence of our enemies’. All can testify that the studies and the method of study, when closely followed, enable all to partake and assimilate the food provided. They have indeed been a satisfying portion. Such food could not come from any other source than from the great Giver of all good gifts through his “faithful and wise servant”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">New Publications</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the year we have been able to print and distribute the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font2"> and the several new booklets that have come to us. The quantities have been limited by reason of the paper restrictions. But the publishers have been grateful for these limited supplies. Our main effort has been directed to supplying books and question booklets to enable them to continue their bookstudy work. The WT. Bible has also been made available to the brethren. These are rationed also and not all the brethren are yet supplied. The 1944 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font2"> was got out to the field much earlier in the year than has been the case in recent years. The grand record of integrity and service by the Lord’s people throughout the earth has served to inspire the publishers here to greater activity. At the service meetings throughout the year consideration has been given to these reports, and this has intensified the appreciation of the Lord’s organization In the minds of the brethren. We now have the new book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Kingdom Is at Hand”,</span><span class="font2"> and we are all set for printing this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The great campaign of free education has gone forward during the year. As will be noted in the report that follows, the field service consists mainly of back-calls, which show a marked Improvement over the previous year, and also book studies. The back-call and book-study work has been the most important and beneficial way of helping the people of good-will. The book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font2"> has been made available by having it printed in this country. It has been placed with the brethren for use in the field, and their expressions are only of appreciation. This instrument the brethren especially appreciate, as It is adapted to the book-study work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Peak number of publishers was in April: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.114</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Assemblies</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Fifty-five small assemblies were held on April 1 and 2 throughout the British Isles. These were arranged at suitable points to accommodate all. The number in attendance was 12,300. On this occasion the subject of the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom in the New World</span><span class="font2"> was delivered and the booklet released for the first time. No special advertising was done. The purpose was to Invite all the people of good-will to join in this “Freedom of Worship” Assembly and exercise their privilege of worship. Letters of invitation were sent out. Many had a share in the field service for the first time. We believe that the assembly was much appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The United Announcers’ Theocratic Assembly was the outstanding event of the year. When we were first informed of the date of this international assembly, the conditions in our part of the earth were critical. Most of the suitable halls were already booked up for other purposes and there seemed little prospect of our holding the assembly at the same time. As the time approached the problems increased; we had the additional burden of flying bombs in the south of England and evacuation from the London area to all parts of the country. This meant additional travel difficulties. However, we went forward with our plans, and now we can give thanks to Jehovah for the way in which he caused all the difficulties to be overcome. Arrangements were made for ten assembly points as follows: Belfast, Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol, Cardiff, Derby, Glasgow, London, Northampton and Stockport.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By the Lord’s grace, we received all the manuscripts for the program just in time and we were able to have the identical items that were enjoyed in America and elsewhere. This is the first time that we have shared the program in detail. And it truly was a “feast of fat things”. There was a richness about the discourses on this occasion which lingered with us. The many exhortations to steadfastness in preaching the gospel and guarding well our treasure of service have given much help to all. It was impossible to get halls large enough to accommodate the interested and the public. At two points we were unable to do any advertising of the public lecture for the reason that the public could not be accommodated. At the other points advertising was limited to placards worn by the publishers in the streets and the letters of invitation to the people of good-will. Despite the limitations, the attendance on Sunday was nearly 14,500.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It was a special joy to us on this occasion to have the lecture “The Kingdom of God Is Nigh”. There was much applause and enthusiasm shown throughout the assembly. The Resolution was accepted enthusiastically. The announcement of the new book brought a volume of clapping. Although we were not privileged to actually receive these items at the assembly, there was much joy in the prospect of them later. The booklets </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion Reaps the Whirlwind </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming World Regeneration</span><span class="font2"> were released at the assembly as well as the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News.</span><span class="font2"> The number immersed was 666.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At Bristol the assembly was held under canvas. The weather was favorable and everything went well. All were of the opinion that it was a most blessed time. In London there was a freedom from flying bombs during the daytime while the brethren were together. So we thank the Lord for all his goodness in making it possible for his people in Britain once again to share with the united announcers in assembly for worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At this moment the situation in this land is a little easier than it has been for a few years. If in the Lord's providences you, Brother Knorr, are able to visit us in 1945 you can be assured of a very warm welcome. The British brethren would be delighted to have you with them. We have our work set for us and, by the Lord’s grace, we will continue the work of free education, looking to Jehovah to keep us under his care, while he frustrates all the schemes of the enemy. In keeping with the Resolution adopted at the United Announcers’ Assembly, we “recognize our obligation as ministers of the Kingdom gospel. . . . we will keep integrity by continuing to advocate the kingdom of God and never slack in preaching to all nations that ‘the kingdom is at hand’</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark113"></a>CANADA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions in the Dominion of Canada have done well, and it is very manifest that the spirit of God or his active force has enabled them to do the exploits accomplished, all to his honor and glory. Only by Jehovah’s irresistible power could the transformation witnessed in Canada be brought about, that is, as regards the publishing work. As was true in the days of the early Christians, so our Canadian brethren were driven underground for a time. The faithful followers of the Lord in the early church received no protection from the governments of the land, but their safety was in the Lord God. They resided in the islands of the sea, the catacombs, and the caves of the earth, and from these places they came out at different times to preach to those who wanted to know “Christ and him crucified”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In like manner the work of the Christian people of Canada was forced underground, because of government action in 1940. Though a ban was thrown around Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions, and they were forbidden to preach the gospel, nothing could seal their mouth in the proclamation of the Kingdom except death. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy did not have sufficient power to put the infamous decrees of the Dark Ages into effect, using the methods of the Inquisition; but they did succeed in having the work throttled. An organization might be dissolved, but as long as its people are not destroyed its work will continue, if the people are sincere and believe in the organization instructions under which they serve. Our Canadian brethren believed in Almighty God and in their right to worship him in “spirit and in truth”. This they continued to do regardless of the banning or dissolving of their legal organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now Jehovah’s witnesses shine forth as the light of day in Canada and are really in the limelight. Because the ban has been lifted on Jehovah’s witnesses and the International Bible Students Association, their legal organization, they do not brag and assume this accomplishment as their own. No; but they rejoice in the display of Jehovah’s loving-kindness and favor toward them in bringing about circumstances that would cause this ban to be lifted and give them greater freedom to worship him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Today we find a greater number of witnesses for the Kingdom in Canada than ever before. A greater number of hours are being put into the work and more people of good-will are being aided. The report of the Canadian Branch servant helps us to appreciate the conditions that existed there, and the accomplishments during the service year 1944 by these faithful brethren :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For more than three years the ban had been enforced against every activity of Jehovah’s witnesses, and it is only during this past year that the restrictions have been lifted to any extent. However, the progress of the truth and the ‘hunting’ and ‘fishing’ for the Lord’s “other sheep” went on. Whereas in 1940 there was an average of 6,081 publishers engaging in the field each month, In the month of June, 1944, there were 10,345 participating. In the year ending September, 1939, a total of 944,905 hours were devoted to the field service, and 132,226 back-calls were made, whereas this service year’s report shows 1,762,463 hours and 542,733 back-calls. These facts of themselves establish evidence of the operation of the spirit of the Lord in and upon his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the Testimony Period “Defeat of Persecution” came announcement of the removal of the ban on Jehovah’s witnesses. This news flashed across the country and was Immediately hailed with joy as the prelude to greater activity. Thougli tins concession did not bring full freedom from restrictions since the ban was yet on the legal corporations, yet it did bring an easing of our position and a splendid bridgehead for further attack. Companies commenced Immediately engaging Kingdom Halls and advertising them as in pre-ban days. All praise was given to Jehovah for this victory as was evidenced by the following quotation from a letter sent out to the brethren in October, 1943:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Jehovah, the God of the free, through his great Emancipator, has burst asunder another Devil-inspired band of restraint upon the Lord’s servants. . . . The publishers of The Theocracy had determined that no matter what persecution came; regardless of whether any raised their voice on their behalf, the name of Jehovah </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">would </span><span class="font2">be praised: the New World </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">would</span><span class="font2"> be proclaimed; the King’s enthronement </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">would</span><span class="font2"> be announced, as long as life and breath remained with them. Their faithful keeping of integrity has been recognized and blessed of Jehovah. Out of a clear sky came the announcement of the ban’s removal, and this after all human efforts had failed! For all his loving-kindness and tender mercies manifested toward us, what shall we say? what shall we do? There is only one answer—Fobward Jehovah’s witnesses I”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah’s witnesses did go forward. Even though there was no recognition of the legal organization by the government, they were determined to become organized. To this end they established a central office, thus co-ordinating all the field work. No sooner was the office established and the way opened for direct communication of the companies with this office, as well as the pioneers, than it was announced that the magazine </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Thy Word Is Truth”</span><span class="font2"> would be published. It became the official publication of Jehovah’s witnesses. Arrangements were Immediately made for placing orders for the publication of books and booklets with commercial printers. It was not long before the first booklet was distributed, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom in the New World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Then came the launching of the great campaign of obtaining subscriptions for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Thy Word Is Truth&quot;,</span><span class="font2"> starting with the “Feed the Flock” Testimony Period. This magazine contains all the food convenient for the Lord’s people, that which has been provided for all his servants throughout the entire world. A quota of 20,000 new subscriptions was set for the brethren and, by the Lord’s grace, this was reached. There are now nearly 30,000 subscribers for the English edition. Shortly thereafter the French and Ukrainian editions of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Thy Word Is Truth&quot;</span><span class="font2"> were published, and these publications have found a ready response and their circulations constantly increased during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The work tn Canada was due for better organization, and the brethren here have been blessed with four servants to the brethren who are graduates of the Gilead College. The brethren throughout the land appreciated very much the instructions received, and were grateful for better Theocratic organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The work surged ahead rapidly. When it was possible to obtain more paper for printing </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Thy Word Is Truth&quot;,</span><span class="font2"> the magazine work opened up, including routes and street witnessing. Then came another booklet printed locally. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming World Regeneration.</span><span class="font2"> The issue of freedom of worship of Almighty God was kept constantly to the fore, and the Lord’s free men and women in this land demonstrated their God-given liberty. This included the open celebration of the Memorial. The attendance was 15,655, of which 1,668 partook of the emblems. This constant forward surge of truth and hard work on the part of all the publishers did not go on unhindered. While the ban was lifted, there was still opposition on the part of so-called “patriotic” groups, and especially the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Charges were brought against many brethren, many were brought to trial, and some were put into prison. The brethren have received considerable help from the Branch office, but many have courageously defended themselves before courts, boards, and othei’ official bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A strenuous effort was put forth during the year to have the government recognize the Christian ministers as “ordained of God”, but as yet not even those who preside over large congregations have been acknowledged as ministers. This is truly surprising! The country lifts the ban on Jehovah’s witnesses, recognizes their right to worship, finds in its midst upward of 15,000 persons attending meetings, and yet will acknowledge none as ministers. The fight for proper recognition continues before the officials involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While “Jehovah’s witnesses” were recognized, the Society fully appreciated the need of legal recognition in that country so that its property might be returned. The government was approached through legal counsel, but there seemed to be no way to obtain that recognition without putting forth greater effort; so it was decided to make use of the ancient right of petition. The petition was addressed to the House of Commons of Canada and read, in part, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The Undersigned People of Canada petition you in behalf of the ‘International Bible Students Association of Canada’, a charitable organization by means of which Jehovah’s witnesses of Canada were enabled from 1925 to 1940 to carry on their Christian activities in Canada and to own property in which their headquarters were located ... [11] the petition of the undersigned Is that your honourable body may be pleased to take such steps as will restore the International Bible Students Association of Canada to its former legal status and return its property for the use and benefit of Jehovah’s witnesses . . . [1T] that your honourable house will take all necessary steps for removal of remaining restraints against this Christian organization that freely gives the people a comforting message from the Word of Almighty God . . ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The whole month of June was set aside for obtaining signatures, but, before the Petition could be completed and presented for debate in the House of Commons, the government decided to remove the ban on the I.B.S.A. of Canada. This decision was made known by publication of an Orderin-Council passed on the 13th day of June, 1944, but not made public until the ICtli. The good news was quickly circulated to all of the companies throughout the land and petition activity ceased. Though thus abruptly terminated it is known that 223,448 signatures were obtained. Though the signatures were not used for their original purpose, yet it was a pleasure for the publishers to call back on these persons and acquaint them with the good news of the ban’s removal, and stimulate their interest in the Theocratic message. Jehovah thus granted another victory to his chosen people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Despite all handicaps throughout the year, the printing forged ahead. As the year comes to a close it is crowned with the production of the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font2"> and its companion questions booklet; also the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion Reaps the Whirlwind.</span><span class="font2"> This equipment has now fitted us for further educational work and grants us increased opportunities for service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the year the total number of booklets printed was 1,557,253, and the total bound books so far 27,367. Since the time that the magazine </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“Thy Word Is Truth&quot;</span><span class="font2"> was first published nearly 1,000,000 copies have been produced. In addition to this, 600,000 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kinydom Netos,</span><span class="font2"> more than 100,000 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font2"> and 200,000 Home Bible study leatiets have been printed and sent out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The publishers in Canada have been thrilled to receive so many new releases in the year, and they are once again becoming literature-conscious. They see the importance of calling from door to door, even as Jesus did in his day, and then following up with back-calls and book studies. The pioneer work is again coming into its own, and there are 394 participating in this field of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The year came to a close with the blessings of the United Announcers’ Theocratic Assembly. Since it was not possible for all the Canadian brethren to be present at Buffalo, the Lord graciously arranged for two assemblies in Canada, one at Winnipeg and the other at Vancouver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The great progress made during the year can be ascertained quickly by a review of the comparative report.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Jehovah’s spirit poured out upon his consecrated people has wrought wonders during the past year, thus preparing them for the grand privilege of engaging in his work throughout another year. The psalmist beautifully expresses our heartfelt gratitude and recognition of the Lord’s provisions in the following words: “Thou givest unto them, they gather; thou openest thy hand, they are satisfied with good. I will sing unto Jehovah as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have any being.”—Psalm 104 : 28, 33, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">American Standard Version.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark117"></a>COSTA RICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">For years prior to the service year of 1944 Costa Rica operated as one of the outlying countries under the Brooklyn office, and there was established at Siquirres, Costa Rica, a depot. From that point the brethren in the country were supplied with literature. Most of the work was accomplished among the Englishspeaking people that lived on the Atlantic seaboard and along the railroad between Port Limon and Siquirres. Most of the publishers in the land were English-speaking persons, but the great field for witness work was among the Spanish people, who spoke the national tongue of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In December, 1943, two Gilead graduates were sent to Costa Rica for the purpose of helping the Spanish-and English-speaking people of that land. Upon arriving in the capital, San Jose, they found approximately thirty persons associated with the organization; but, due to a misunderstanding, two groups had been formed within the city. A meeting was called and the two groups came together. It was pointed out to them that there must be no division among the Lord’s people, but that they must come together and unite for service. This meeting was very successful, and from that time forward the work has moved ahead in leaps and bounds. Now, by the Lord’s grace, the local organization in San Jose is working smoothly and the group has grown to 60. A Kingdom Hall was established and, eventually, this same location in San Jose was used for the depot of the Society. Formerly the depot had been in Siquirres, but in January the stock was moved to San Jose. Later in the year, in March, the president of the Society visited the country of Costa Rica. He set up a branch organization, arranged for living quarters for the brethren handling the branch work, and made preparations for more Gileadites to come down later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The report from the Branch servant shows that there are now six companies in Costa Rica. In September, 1943, there were 96 company publishers. At the close of the year a peak of 181 publishers was reached, including two special pioneers from Gilead and four other pioneers that began work in the country. This wonderful increase in publishers and the work in general has caused the enemy to bring about some opposition ; and this is to be expected. Radio announcements have been made to the effect that Jehovah’s witnesses have no right to carry on their work and that the government should stop it. This, of course, was backed by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy of Costa Rica, which claims this country as one of its own. Thus far the only opposition is talk and threats by both Catholics and Evangelicals, who have quite a strong hold in Costa Rica.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One of the Evangelical preachers threatened to put a pioneer sister in jail if she did not stop giving the witness. This threat was made in the home of a man of good-will, and the interested person promptly took the sister’s side and told the preacher he would have to deal with him first before anyone was committed to jail. Those who love truth and righteousness no longer want to stay in the dark and under the thumb of the clergy, but they rejoice to hear the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The report by the Branch servant of this new branch in Costa Rica is very interesting, and some of his report to the president is reprinted here:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah’s blessing lias surely been upon the efforts of his servants in this Central American country. In spite of the fact that the people are dominated and overrun by the priesthood many people of good-will have manifested themselves and have taken their stand on the side of the King and his kingdom. This fact is best demonstrated by the increase in number of publishers. September, 1943, had 96 company publishers and 2 pioneers reporting; for August, 1944, 171 company publishers, 8 general pioneer’s and the 2 special pioneers from Gilead reported, making a total of 181 Theocratic educators in this land of superstition and ignorance There is yet much more room for Improvement, as thus far only the surface has been scratched. In the past much literature has been placed, but now the publishers are beginning to appreciate the necessity of the back-call and book-study work. In the past year back-calls have increased from 211 reported last September to 594 for August, 1944. Book studies in the same period have jumped from 42 to 146.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We were especially blessed by the Lord with a visit from the Society’s president and his secretary in March. An assembly was scheduled and arranged for and the brethren notified that the president would speak to them on March 5. The assembly opened in the morning with all taking part in the field service. Then in the afternoon the assembly was addressed by the president’s secretary and the newly appointed Branch servant. The best part was saved for the last and when all could be present when the president addressed 330 Costa Ricans on “The Glorious Treasure of Service”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This was San Jose’s first assembly and the first time a president of the Society had visited this country. The result of the assembly can best be shown by the fact that for March the San Jose company set a new peak of 40 publishers, or an increase of 15 over February, and the Port Litnon company reached Its previous all-time peak of 43. However, Port Limon did not stop there, but in August set another all-time peak with 70 publishers reporting. In fact, it was this assembly that gave us the “push” to the Increased activity. All are looking forward to a return visit and further feasting at the Lord’s table.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During three days of the United Announcers’ Theocratic Assembly in August two convention points were arranged for: one for the English-speaking brethren on the Atlantic side in Port Limon and one for the Spanish brethren in San Jose. All but two of the manuscripts came through on time and we followed the Buffalo schedule as nearly as possible during our three days of convention. Local brethren read the manuscripts and were thus given an opportunity to put into practice some of the training being received from the Theocratic ministry course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Both assemblies were well attended and no opposition was encountered at either point. All the new releases were eagerly accepted even though there was not a copy of any of them to show. Both assemblies joyfully adopted the Resolution and made it their own; that “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached In all the world for a witness unto all nations”; and that all will continue to preach “to all nations. ‘The kingdom is at hand,’ ” and to do so with what instruments are on hand until a supply of the new book and booklets arrives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The public lectures were attended by 560, and the peak attendance for the other sessions was on Sunday night, when 393 were assembled at the two points. This was Costa Rica’s first assembly held simultaneously with the one in the States, and it was Indeed a wonderful experience. We were indeed united with all the Theocratic United Announcers world-wide. Especially did the brethren appreciate the president’s and the Bethel family’s expression of love and best wishes conveyed to them at the close of the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Beside these two assemblies a small assembly was held In Port Limon during Memorial, with a public lecture on Sunday. The lecture “The Coming World Regeneration” was advertised in advance and, in spite of the fact that the world was celebrating Easter Sunday, 154 persons attended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Immediately after the April assembly in Port Limon we visited the Cahuita company. This is a small company situated in the brush about thirty miles down the coast from Port Limon. We started the trip about six-thirty in the morning by train. At noon we reached the end of the line, twenty-four miles in five and a half hours. The remaining miles proved to be quite an interesting trip and were made b.v mule car. The mule car was a flat handcar on narrower than narrow-gauge rails. About fifteen people were piled on, one little wiry mule was hitched up, and the trip started down through the tropical brush. Once the car derailed, but everything was soon righted and we were off again. At the end of this line the Cahuita friends met us and, with pioneer Brother Jackson whom they had sent to Limon to “guide” us back, we took to a small trail through the brush and walked the remaining mile or so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Here the brethren were again counseled and the necessity of putting </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Organization Instructions</span><span class="font2"> into effect was stressed, even if they were only five or six. The brethren had heard of the public lecture that had been held in Port Limon, so they wanted to hold one in Cahuita also. Everyone was notified, and the Kingdom Hall was packed out, 75 in all, inside and outside. A witness was given and some of the new interest we had contacted during the day expressed themselves as desiring to meet and study regularly with the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The company in Puntarenas is all Spanish, and the brethren there are working together in very close unity and harmony. Five and six publishers have been reporting quite regularly, but when the report came in for August with 10 it was indeed a pleasant surprise. Eleven from Punta renas attended the assembly in San Jose and evidently went back home determined to put forth more effort. A group of Puntarenas publishers went to Nicaragua in April and worked in and around the capital city, Managua. At the same time one of the San Jose publishers was also there spending his vacation, giving the witness in his native land. The entire group placed over 600 booklets and 30 bound books in the few days spent there and reported a vast field of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The magazine work was started in March upon the arrival of our first distributors’ copies. The San Jose brethren are slow to take hold of this work but the few that do take part have wonderful success. Due to the irregularity of the mails many Saturdays we are without magazines; so the street work continues with the latest booklets. This has proved to be a most interesting work and we have met all kinds of people, especially from Panama, for many Americans come to San Jose to get away from the terrible heat there. Of course they are surprised to find the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> on the streets the same as in the States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some even ask if we came all the way down here just to do this work Many, too, are finding out for the first time what is between the covers, after having seen the magazines on the streets in the States for a number of years.</span></p>

It will be our united endeavor to carry the work forward in this land in the manner the Lord has appointed, come what may. Indeed we thank the Lord for the privilege of being his servants in the earth at this time and for the privilege of carrying forward his life-giving message to those hungry for it. These people here need Theocratic education; and be assured that we will do our best to see that they get it.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark118"></a>CUBA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah God has poured out his rich blessing upon the brethren in Cuba. For many years faithful, hardworking pioneers, along with a small number of company publishers, have attended to the ‘planting’ and placing of literature in the hands of the people of Cuba. Much ‘watering’ has been done by further proclamation of the Kingdom, and now the Lord has given the increase. As the apostle stated, “So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.” (1 Cor. 3:6,7) Those brethren who have been ‘planting’ and ‘watering’ for years rejoice in the accomplishments of today. They know that nothing can be accomplished in their own strength, but they appreciate that results can be obtained only when God gives the increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In September, 1942, there were 431 publishers engaging in the work. In 1943 these increased to 648 publishers, and for the service year of 1944 the average reached 954. It can now be seen that the 1945 service year will find a like increase, because the peak of publishers in Cuba has already reached 1,260 and well over 1,100 publishers haye engaged in the work for the past four months. There are four million people in Cuba, and many thereof have expressed their appreciation for the truth by taking a stand for the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">So that the work might progress better than in times past, a corporation was organized in Cuba known as “La Torre del Vigia”. Its charter has been filed with all the provincial governments of Cuba and acknowledgment of recognition has been made by all these local governments. Cuba is a good example of what can be accomplished in the Latin countries when some time and attention are given to them by the publishers of the Kingdom. With proper organization and strenuous effort being put forth by energetic brethren desirous of magnifying the Lord’s name, results are brought forth. The brethren who were sent to Havana, Cuba, did not go there in their own strength but in the strength of the Lord and with a sincere desire to feed the “other sheep”. As the “other sheep” have associated themselves with the Lord’s organization in years past they have seen their responsibility and have taken hold of the work with glad hearts, and their efforts have been richly blessed. The Cubans can see the fruits of their labors, and they express gratitude to the Lord for the privilege of honoring his name at this time, prior to the battle of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Society appointed a new Branch servant, a graduate of Gilead, during the past service year. The brethren who were formerly at the branch and in charge are co-operating splendidly with the present servant, and excellent progress has been made in the reorganization of the branch and the work generally throughout the entire island of Cuba. The Branch servant’s report is interesting and excerpts from that report are here published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Pioneer Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the year there was an average of 17 special publishers in the service. These brethren averaged 174.9 hours and 70.7 back-calls and had the unbelievable average of 14.2 book studies each. One publisher from the States conducted thirty-two different studies in one month. Of these 17 specials, 12 were members of the first graduating class of Gilead. These brethren have been working here for eleven months, and, by the Lord’s grace, they have been a great aid to the Cuban brethren. In the time that they have been here they have aided twelve to become publishers, and have brought many people of good-will to the Kingdom Hall meetings. These American brethren attended the service meeting regularly. As they grew better able to express themselves in the Spanish language they took part in the service meetings; the brethren were given assignments on the program, and the sisters gave helpful service experiences. Not only that, but four of the Gileadites acted as chairmen at the recent conventions. At all times, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">studies, service meetings, and conventions, they were a great aid to the brethren and good-will interest, and gave them many helpful suggestions. As to their Spanish, the local brethren have stated that the Gileadites have shown a great improvement during the past eleven months. The native special publishers have also done a good work. They have organized quite a few companies throughout the island. These have also been a great aid to the people of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">General Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There has been an average of 77 general pioneers reporting time for the year. A peak was reached in May, when 85 reported. They averaged 128.1 hours, 27.4 back-calls, and 5.4 book studies. These brethren have also organized quite a few companies in this country. These pioneers showed a great improvement in activity during the past four months. Similarly as was done in the States, those pioneers not meeting the requirements were dropped from the list. However, other new pioneers have joined the ranks, thus making up for those who were dropped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Company Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are 46 organized companies throughout Cuba. This is an increase of 11 over the previous year. There was an average of 860 company publishers participating in the field service. A new peak in company publishers was reached in August, with 1,166 engaging. They averaged 20.1 hours, 3.6 back-calls, and .7 book study per publisher. There is not a single automobile used in the field service in the whole Island, and yet the publishers averaged over 20 hours. This fact should be an Incentive to some of the publishers in the States who claim that gas rationing has caused a drop in their hours. Practically every company has shown a good increase in publishers during the year, and not one has shown a decrease. Many of the larger companies have shown tremendous increases. For example, take the Havana company. In September, 1943, there were 66 publishers reporting field service. Eleven months later, in August, 1944, the amazing total of 185 reported service; an increase of almost two hundred percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In March the servant to the brethren visited the company and completely reorganized it. All the servants were shown their responsibility and all willingly responded thereto. Eight company book studies were organized. The publishers responded to the book-study arrangement and co-operated fully with the study conductors. The Havana Kingdom Hall</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">was painted, the seating arrangement was changed, the lighting was Improved, a speaker’s platform and stand were built, and all unnecessary signs were removed. The service meetings were made more interesting, thus aiding the brethren in the service. The Gileadites also aided the publishers considerably. All of these things, the reorganization of the company, the book study groups, the Improving of the Kingdom Hall, the special publishers from the States, and, above all, the blessing of Jehovah God, brought about the wonderful increase in this company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">About two and a half years ago a faithful, hard-working pioneer publisher started to work in the rural sections of the town of Bahia Honda, in the province of Pinar del Rio. When he started there wasn’t a single publisher in that section reporting time other than himself. During the two and a half years’ time he organized four new companies. The number of publishers in these four companies now total 140. Out of these companies have also come four new pioneers. One of these companies was organized in February. This company’s first report showed 38 publishers averaging 28.4 hours per publisher. The amazing part of it Is that this was the first time that the majority of these 38 ever participated in the service. Many of the brethren in this section have never had any schooling, and the pioneer has had to teach many of them to read and write. There are many sections like this throughout Cuba. The people in these sections have very little education, but they quickly take to the life-giving truths of God’s Word when It Is presented to them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Early in February Brother Knorr, his secretary, and two members of the board of directors visited this island, stopping at Havana Their stay was for ten days. While the president was here he made arrangements to completely reorganize the work at the Branch. An apartment for the family at the Branch was rented in the Vedado section of Havana. The climax of Brother Knorr’s visit came during the first general assembly of the Lord’s people ever held in Cuba. This was a two-day convention. Five hundred brethren attended on the first day to hear the key speech of the convention, on the subject “The Glorious Treasure of Service”. And on Sunday a record crowd of over 1,500 jammed out the convention hall to hear the public lecture given by Brother Knorr, “The Coming World Regeneration.” All in attendance greatly enjoyed the lecture and showed their approval by thunderous applause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">United Announcers’ Assembly</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The year’s activities reached their climax at this convention. Four cities participated in the three-day United Announcers’ Theocratic Assembly: Havana, Cienfuegos, Santiago de Cuba, and Bahia Honda.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The talks given at the convention were similar to the ones given at Buffalo, the only exception being the public talk “The Kingdom of God Is Nigh”. This was not received in time to be used for the public lecture. “Religion Reaps the Whirlwind” was appropriately substituted. This was the Lord’s provision, because this was the first “hot” talk ever given in Cuba. The crowds enjoyed it immensely and showed their enjoyment and approval by a tremendous amount of applause. The chairmen at all four conventions were all Gilead graduates. These brethren, because of their Gilead training, were able to give their Cuban brethren much instruction as to organizing and properly running a convention. The Gilead brethren who acted as chairmen made the announcements and gave two or more talks at the convention, all in Spanish. The brethren from the convention cities later wrote into the Branch expressing their appreciation in having the Gilead brethren as chairmen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The combined peak attendance at the four assemblies was 1,881. Three of the convention halls were packed out and many had to stand to hear the publie lecture on Sunday. An amazing total of 136 w’ere immersed, 71 of these being immersed at the Havana convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Extensive advertising was done. Almost 200,000 handbills were distributed, and 1,500 placards were either placed in store windows or were carried about by the information walkers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming World Regeneration,</span><span class="font2"> in Spanish, was released at the convention. A free copy was given to all in attendance. This was the first time a new publication had been released at a Cuban convention. The brethren were overjoyed at its release.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Under the direction of the great Theocrat, this year has been the most blessed in the history of the Lord’s people in Cuba. For these many blessings and increases we give thanks to Jehovah, knowing full well that these blessings and increases have come from him alone.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark119"></a>DENMARK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The Nazi aggressors overran this country and are now using the people and produce of this nation to bolster their wartime economy. Despite Nazi domination, Jehovah’s witnesses have been able to carry on in this land during the years of total war. While the Branch servant and other members of the Society have been restrained and isolated, it does not appear that they are in a concentration camp, such as is true of many of Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany. Despite their removal from general activity, the work goes forward in Denmark. It is true that there is a slight decrease in the number of publishers as compared with last year, but this must be expected in view of the oppressive Nazi rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The distribution of literature is considerably under that of the previous year, and this is due to the shortage of paper and lack of supplies. The report that follows, however, will show that the brethren are doing everything they possibly can in the daytime to press ahead with the back-call activity, distribution of magazines and booklets, and everything else possible to get the message into the hands of the people. We have every reason to believe that the work in Denmark will blossom out after the war. Much free literature has been distributed and the brethren are doing everything they can to hold high the light of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A visitor returning from Denmark to Sweden sends in the following report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Curfew restrictions in the land of Denmark have made it very difficult for the Lord’s people in that land to use the evenings in regular door-to-door work, while general conditions there, as in all lands occupied by an aggressor nation, are not helpful to the furtherance of the work. It is evident that, without the Lord’s protection and blessing, little could have been accomplished in that country, and the report for the eleven months now submitted is therefore all the more gratifying. The pioneer work has been especially difficult and all pioneers have had to be supported financially in order to continue. Owing to government restrictions the branch has not been able to use paper in its possession to the extent desired as far as magazines are concerned. The tendency in the country is to have all dailies and magazines gradually cut down more and more. For this reason some of the paper on hand has been put to good use in the reprinting of the following books: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Creation, Enemies, Religion,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font2"> 20,000 copies of each having been ordered. The booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming World Regeneration</span><span class="font2"> will soon be distributed, and another booklet based upon the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font2">article “Suffering Precedes First Resurrection” is also being spread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is a joy to be able to report that there Is a good spirit and unity among the Lord’s people in Denmark. Opposition in that land, as elsewhere, is getting more marked, but, on the other hand, more and more of the people of good-will are manifesting themselves. It is indeed encouraging to see from the report that those who have properly appreciated their relationship to the Great Theocrat have fearlessly gone forward with the message of his kingdom and have thus shared in the victory which the Ix»rd is now giving to his people.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark120"></a>FINLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Not very many reports come through from Finland. The rulers of this nation took sides with the Nazis, and now, as their defeat appears inevitable, they are forced to come over on the side of the Allies. The Finnish army is now fighting the Nazi army. Reports coming through from Finland while that country was under the Nazi heel show that every effort was put forth to stop the work. The Finnish army was under the control of the Nazis. Representatives went to the one in charge of the work in Finland and asked him to give the army advice as to how to make an end of the work of Jehovah’s witnesses “in the most painless way”. The servant showed the officials that it would be impossible for anyone to stop the work of Jehovah’s witnesses no matter how severe the persecution brought to bear against them. He explained that these people were Christians representing the Lord, and were commissioned by Him to spread the truth; that they must do this at all costs. He pointed out that they were not interfering in any way with the war effort. They tried to bribe the brother to put forth an effort to stop Jehovah’s witnesses from working, saying that it was their intention to give him greater freedom even though he was their prisoner. Now that he refused to call the others off from preaching the gospel, they would have to keep him in prison for a longer time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What has happened since the effort began to drive the Nazis out of Finland cannot be stated; but some field service reports show that there were 1,598 publishers engaging in the field in Finland during the year, and these brethren have placed upward of 66,000 books and booklets and have devoted 76,920 hours in the field. This is a report for only seven months of the service year. What has happened since February, 1944, has not been reported. A splendid work is being carried on in the back-call activity, for upward of 27,000 back-calls were made in these seven months. Seventeen pioneers continue to preach the gospel of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The precious truths that give the Lord’s people strength and courage reach them from time to time. These truths are translated into the Finnish language and circulated among the brethren. A report from that country states: “Although the enemy has tried to take from us all the means to do the work, yet the Lord has provided us with means to go on.” The report also states that the Finnish brethren have observed the faithfulness of their German brethren, who have been thrown into Nazi concentration camps and many of them killed, and are determined that they, too, shall stand fast for the Kingdom, resisting the regimentation of Nazi-Catholic totalitarian rule. While many of the brethren in Finland have been thrown into prison and some killed, yet the Lord can preserve those whom he will use for the further work of witnessing after this total war. We rejoice with our brethren in the grand witness they are giving throughout the country. Jehovah’s witnesses, according to the report, are the only ones receiving any persecution from the Nazi overlords, who at that time controlled the army and the police.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The following report comes from the brother in charge of the work in the absence of the Branch servant:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The censor has been quite kindly disposed toward us, so that nothing of any importance in our articles has been cut out, although we have presented the truth in our writings according to the original, as, for example, the leaflet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News,</span><span class="font2"> No. 11, which we printed and distributed throughout the whole country. The censor could not pass the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fighting for Liberty on the Home Front,</span><span class="font2"> owing, as he said, to the present political situation. We have been able to print the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming World Regeneration,</span><span class="font2"> however, as it stands. It is still a requirement that everything that is to be printed must be submitted to the censor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have been able to assemble for conventions without any hindrance. Fifty-four such gatherings have been arranged, with 2,587 publishers attending, as well as 186 other meetings, where the attendance reached 4,397. The action of the chief of police in one of our largest cities is well worth mentioning. Some time ago he caused a notice, forbidding assembly, to be nailed on the door of our convention hall, and had police on guard at the door during the first period of persecution; but now. although our opponents Informed him of our gathering together in a “mission church” in the center of the city, he told these persecutors that Jehovah’s witnesses had as much right as all other believers to assemble at festivals. Other prefects of police in towns and in the country districts have shown a good will toward us and have wondered why we are persecuted in a land where freedom of religion exists. We have had opportunity to give them a witness, and they have refused to join with those who persecute us. The truth has never been spread among the ruling classes as at the present time, when all of our work is officially forbidden. We see that Jehovah has permitted these difficulties to come upon us so that the truth shall be made known, and so that we shall be able to demonstrate our Integrity and stand the test.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the nine months of the report a total of 107 symbolized their consecration to do Jehovah’s will. A total of 15,385 miles was traveled by the Society’s representatives; 1,582 letters were received, and 1,514 dispatched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our prayer is that we may be faithful and in agreement with the activities of the Society.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark121"></a>FRANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Not for several years had we heard from our brethren in France, while overrun by the Nazis. But while this </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font3"> was being written word came to hand that ‘the whole family in Paris is well and busy in their Father’s business’. The report says that they have been working during these several years, and with very good results in spite of the many difficulties. It is hoped that now the work will move on again as before without hindrance. The brethren are looking forward to the time when communications between them and the head office will be open to the fullest extent, so that the message of truth may have free course throughout all of France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Reports from other sources in France show that the brethren are busy preaching the gospel; that their chief desire now is for literature to study and distribute to the “other sheep”. We rejoice in Jehovah God’s preserving power over his people. We can feel sure that this protection was for a purpose, namely, so that an even greater witness might be given, to the honor and glory of Jehovah’s name. We rejoice with our brethren and, by the Lord’s grace, will give them all the support possible so that they can get off to a new and better start in aiding the people of France to worship the only true God.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark122"></a>HAWAIIAN ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The work in these islands has progressed very well during the past year. Publishers for the Kingdom reached a new peak of 82 during the year, but the average each month was 60. With this increased number of publishers, the islands are being more thoroughly covered and a better witness given. Some years back the pioneers did the bulk of the work on the islands, but now the company publishers (most of whom are of the “other sheep” class) are doing about half of the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are many problems to overcome in the witness work on these islands, and the Branch servant’s report gives us some idea of what these problems are and the joys the brethren have in carrying forward the Kingdom interests under obstacles. In his report for the service year, he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some who have been served with studies In their homes are now out holding studies for other “sheep”. (Rev. 22:17) Studies have been held in English, Chinese, Hawaiian, Spanish, Ilocano, Tagalog, Korean, and Japanese. In some cases brethren serving do not understand these languages, and the method is for the conductor to use an English publication, and the attending ones to use the corresponding book in their own language. On Kauai there is a group of Ilocano-speaking brethren, and the pioneers working there travel a very long distance to hold meetings with them. One has to interpret, as most do not understand English. Questions are asked in Ilocano, and then translated into English, and the discussion and answers translated back and forth. This requires much time and patience, but the result is the feeding of the Lord’s “other sheep”. These brethren are very earnest and sincere. It will be a happy day when language barriers are removed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Because of the increased demand for war workers in Honolulu, the population of the other islands has dwindled very greatly. The result is that pioneers have to travel long distances to reach the people left. Camps in which many formerly lived are now almost empty. Pioneers have much to contend with in the way of sickness, both for themselves and for their children. Also, on some islands there have been heavy, continued rains, and on others no rain, both conditions hindering. Accidents, car troubles, and other things, had to be overcome. Placements of literature are lower than formerly, due to the limited supply of literature. Now placements are mostly single books, or subscriptions. It is a continuous struggle for the pioneers to get in their time, and to make ends meet, but, by the Lord’s grace, they push on faithfully. There are 10 pioneers and 1 special pion'eer, all doing splendid work. One of the pioneers writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Dear Brethren: The Lord has richly blessed us on the island of Hawaii during the year. For the world it has been a year of bitterness and hatred, but for those of the glorious Theocracy it has been a year of bounteous feasting and joyous service. The Theocratic ministry course has been a blessing. It has been the means used to bring one brother a distance of €10 miles weekly to attend the meetings. Due to conditions prevailing with bus travel, this brother arrives on Sunday at 11 a.m., and then Is unable to leave until Monday 2 p.m. The spiritual refreshment received on these weekly visits has resulted in a fine showing in the field service by this brother in his isolated territory. It Is a real joy to behold the welcome and hearty greetings extended by isolated sheep when the Theocratic minister arrives to conduct the weekly study. The flfty-and-more-mile trips to get there fade into insignificance. One of these new sheep has been a minister of religion, but after two or three studies the Lord’s way no more mention was made about being a minister. We look forward eagerly to the results of this study in the very near future. Many who showed no interest are now willing to start a study, and it is with great thankfulness to Jehovah for the privilege that we go forth as His minister to conduct these studies. The rain comes down in torrents on this island, so that keeping the literature presentable is a problem, but the studies are not affected by this at all. So the studies in the people’s homes are a boon to us here in enabling us to get more hours in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The convention was a delight to all faithful hearts. All those days of delightful fellowship, the speeches provided by the Society ‘full of fat things’ to be consumed, the many releases, surely goodness and mercy shall follow us all the days of our lives, and we shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The first supply of the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Truth Shall Make You Free</span><span class="font2"> arrived during November, 1943. This has been a very wonderful book for the studies, Informing the people of Jehovah and his purposes. The question booklet, with its many additional scriptures, helps too. For this and the many other provisions for the work, heartfelt thanks are daily rendered to Jehovah. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> studies are much enjoyed, and really teach the important doctrines of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The United Announcers’ Theocratic Assembly, coming at the close of the year, was just fine. In Honolulu a good assembly was had, with all pioneers and practically all publishers present. All the discourses provided from Buffalo were read, and much appreciated. It was the largest and best convention yet for Honolulu, and at the public meeting 125 requests were turned in for the new booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom of God Is Nigh.</span><span class="font2"> It was a real service convention, both during the preceding weeks of delivery of 3,000 letters and 35,000 handbills and during the sessions. Every possible means was used to invite others; window signs, automobile signs, large signs, spot announcements with sound equipment, street witnessing, were all effectively used. The meetings were well attended, and closest attention was given. News of the new publications was enthusiastically received. The supply of English literature was used up during the assembly; so the prospect of a further supply of new books was much appreciated. The weather was quite warm, and the brethren had worked hard and long for many weeks, but at the close felt thankful indeed to the Lord for the privileges of service and for the encouragement and strengthening received from feeding at the Lord’s table.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This report is submitted with many thanks to Jehovah for the manifold provisions he has made for his work and people.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark123"></a>INDIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The difficulties that confronted the brethren in India during the past year have been mountainous as compared with those of former years; but, by the Lord’s grace, they have been able to surmount them. They look into the future with confidence that Jehovah’s mighty arm will bring complete salvation and deliverance to all, and remove the oppressor. The persecution that has been brought against the Lord’s people with intent to stop the work entirely has been defeated by the faithful activity on the part of the servants of God. They have been uncompromising and have been obedient to Theocratic rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Due to very severe censorship on the part of government agencies, not all the information from the Society reaches the brethren, such as that contained in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant, The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation. </span><span class="font3">The Indian government has decided that this message of truth from God’s Holy Bible represents a “potential menace to security and must, on that ground, be prevented from reaching the public”. When Jehovah decrees that “this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness” and commands Christians to 'go, disciple all nations’, this does not mean that the preaching work is subject to control by any creature or government in heaven or on earth. Jehovah has seen to it that his witness goes through, even against the greatest of opposition. His servants, who are willing to undergo persecution and trials because of their faithfulness, are assured of great reward. Their joy and pleasure in serving The Theocratic Government constitute sufficient reward; but they know that eternal life is theirs because of faithfulness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Not only is the government trying to throttle the work during the present total war, but there also are some brethren who would try to cause dissension among the workers for the Kingdom. We know that the Lord will guide his people in the right way; but he permits discord from time to time, which tries the integrity of his servants. The only safe place to be is in the Lord’s organization, associating with those who love righteousness, doing the work of the Lord and feeding upon the food he provides. Doing this, we shall be at unity with our brethren, shall be honoring his name, and shall be looking well to the interests of the Kingdom. The great majority of the brethren in India are trying to do this very thing, and Jehovah’s blessing is manifestly upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There has been an increase in number of publishers over the previous year, a greater number of hours have been devoted to the service, more back-calls have been made, and there has been improvement in the book-study work. Due to shortage of literature, fewer publications have been distributed; but a greater witness has been given because the Lord’s people are determined to see that the gospel is preached. The report from the Branch servant is most interesting and it gives us the local color and sets forth conditions under which the brethren have to work. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Legal</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The year opened with the government’s ban on all Importation and printing of the Society’s literature still In force. No way has appeared open by which these restrictions could be removed, but we are still trying to find a way. That this Is really an iniquitous restriction will be seen by what has taken place in recent months. Government issued an order under the Defence of India Rules prohibiting the reproduction of “any document emanating from the Society”, and prohibiting the Society, or anyone holding office in the Society, from publishing “any document” whatsoever. Does this mean we cannot publish the Bible itself? It does. In order to facilitate the preaching of this gospel of the Kingdom a leaflet entitled “Thy Kingdom Come”, containing nothing whatsoever but direct quotations from the Bible, without note or comment, was published. Government prosecuted the publisher and he was sentenced to pay a fine of Rs 100/-without alternative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This case was tried In Bombay by the chief presidency magistrate and both he and the prosecution declared they saw nothing objectionable in the leaflet. The magistrate went so far as to call it “a fine bit of missionary work. . . . like a carpet or screen made up of beads taken from the Bible and woven into a beautiful design”. In his written judgment the magistrate described it as ‘‘a collection of passages chosen from the Old and New Testaments of the Bible, strung together in an appropriate manner to make one long connected article”. But the magistrate was not empowered to go into the question of whether or not the leaflet represented “a potential menace to security”. That was a question which Government alone was competent to decide! So he found the accused “guilty” and passed the sentence as above stated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This sentence, being less than Rs 200/-, is not appealable, but we could apply to the High Court for Revision on a point of law (not of fact). This we did, challenging in the High Court the validity of the Government order. The High Court, however, held that the order was quite within the scope of the Defence of India Rules, and, as in the lower court, declared it had no power to go into the question of whether the subject matter of the leaflet may be considered “prejudicial to the efficient prosecution of the war”. We are now appealing to the Federal Court and are determined to do all we can to fight this unjust imposition. Inasmuch as Government itself, “after careful consideration” having “satisfied itself” that any document emanating from the Society or any of its office-bearers must represent a “potential menace to security”, then that would seem to end the matter so far as any court of law in the land has power to intervene. The powers of Government appear to be arbitrary. There are Higher Powers, however, in which we trust, and it is certain that when the Lord in his temple chooses to liberate us from this bondage then the bond will be broken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is a similar case now on in the courts at Delhi. There the position is still more open to just criticism. Thirteen clergymen of Delhi, representing at least six different denominations of “Christendom”, including the Roman, combined in publishing a leaflet entitled “A Warning to All Christians in Delhi”, attacking Jehovah’s witnesses and defaming the good name of the Society. The local friends replied by publishing a leaflet of similar layout and bearing the same title but otherwise containing nothing but direct quotations from the Bible. Though this leaflet did not emanate from the Society, nor was the publisher one holding office in the Society, yet both the publisher and the local company servant have been prosecuted for publishing it. They were both arrested, and are now on bail awaiting trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Recently a shipment of Bibles and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglotts</span><span class="font2"> arrived from America. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglotts</span><span class="font2"> have been seized by the police because they are annotated! Just what Benjamin Wilson’s annotations in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott</span><span class="font2"> have to do with India’s security is a question which the government might perhaps explain, but meanwhile we are deprived of this Bible translation and have so far received no reply to our requests (the first was sent almost two months ago) for these books to be delivered to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Activity in the field has made good progress and has, on the whole, been unhindered except by lack of literature. In certain towns local restrictions have been so severe that It has not been possible to work with any literature other than the plain Bible. But pavement witnessing and house-to-house work have been done everywhere. In most cases the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Children,</span><span class="font2"> the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hope,</span><span class="font2"> and leaflet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Thy Kingdom Come,</span><span class="font2"> and Gospel portions, have formed the only available literature. Phonograph work is still being done, but we have only a limited selection of records (most have been seized) and, of course, none of the newer recordings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Servant to the Bbethben. This service has been a real blessing to the companies. With so few companies in British India it has not been necessary to have a brother occupied in this service all the year round, and so one of the special pioneers was trained for the work and he has visited the companies as required. To make the round of the eight companies in British India it requires about 5,000 miles of traveling. In Travancore the depot servant there has undertaken this work with 28 companies and has been on the job during the entire year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Language Difficulties. One of the biggest problems facing the witnesses in India is that of language. Of the “Christian” population the majority are Indians who know little or no English. When we had our vernacular literature we were able to offer at least some small booklet to these folk, leaving them to learn what they could from them. Now we have no vernacular literature and it is almost impossible to touch this vast field of Indian Christians. I wrote to you some time ago about this problem and you authorized me to have some suitable brethren take up a language training. It has not been found practicable to extend this facility to many, but a start has been made. All the friends were urged to try to pick up a working knowledge of some Indian language, and two special pioneers were given the facility of proper training. These two pioneers are now able to conduct a Bible study in the vernacular and it is hoped that </span><span class="font2">we shall ultimately be able to tackle this problem in a really efficient manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Conventions. Owing to the time required to receive anything from America, we have, for the past two years, arranged for assemblies in the month of January. The weather is then more pleasant, too. In this way we were able to participate in the Minneapolis assembly and go through the same program. The English-speaking friends gathered in Bombay, over one hundred of them, and we had a joyful time. The meetings were held in an intensely Roman Catholic suburb, which caused quite a stir in the locality. Brother Joseph from Travancore was present, and, on his return, arranged for similar assemblies of the Indian brethren there. One brother tried to get across from Ceylon, but couldn’t manage it in time. He came a month later, stayed a whole month, and thus took back with him the spirit of Minneapolis</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Travancore. The work in this native state deserves a paragraph to itself. The brethren there are zealous and keen to do all they know how to advance the Kingdom interests. They are not so fortunately placed as regards the advantages of life as many in other lands, and for this reason the work of organizing them into systematic routine methods is sometimes difficult. Not all, by any means, possess a timepiece, which means that the counting of hours on field service, or punctuality at meetings, and the duration of meetings, is not strictly accurate. The position of the sun in the sky, or the state of feeling in the stomach, is sometimes the chief guide as to what time it is. But when they get together for a study they become so enthused that the idea of limiting studies to one hour seems to them quite impossible. The Lord knows their hearts, and surely will not expect of them that same degree of efficiency Insofar as methodical work is concerned as he does of those ‘unto whom much is given’. (Luke 12: 48) These faithful brethren have had to copy all their </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> studies out by hand, but they have been kept quite up-to-date with their regular weekly studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the time of making up this report news is received of your tour into Central America and the great blessing Gilead College has been in training workers for those fields. It makes us long for similar advantages here, and I am sure I am expressing the sentiments of all the friends in India when I ask if we may have the benefit of a visit from you and some of the “Gileadites” when opportunity permits. There will be a very warm welcome for you when you come I</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Ceylon</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This, of course, Is a separate country. Under war conditions it has not been possible to do much organized work there. Communication is difficult and all the Society’s literature is prohibited from entering the country. There have been two publishers active all through the year, but reports have been received only very irregularly. One of these brethren, as stated above, visited India during the year and so was able to learn of the things which we ourselves were enjoying. Reports show that these two brethren have devoted 975 hours to the field work, placing 20 books (mostly Bibles), 100 booklets, and have recorded 41 back-calls and 50 study series. They labor under difficulties, but appear to be doing what they can to advertise the name of Jehovah and The Theocratic Government under Christ as the hope of the world.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark124"></a>JAMAICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">This island is a British possession in the West Indies. As is true concerning many colonies and dominions of the British Empire, a ban has been placed upon Jehovah’s witnesses. Centuries ago the British people were fighters for freedom of speech and freedom of worship, but the powers in control of government affairs today are of the mind that the Bible is not a good thing during wartime. Despite the ban upon Jehovah’s witnesses in Jamaica, the brethren there remain faithful and true. Their trials have been great, but they rejoice to serve the Lord and speak his Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Conditions in Jamaica are well described by the Branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There were fe.w outstanding events this year aside from the third petition to the government for the unfettering of Jehovah’s witnesses by lifting the ban on the importation of the literature published by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This was sent to the present governor, Mr. Hudgings, who succeeded Mr. Arthur Richards, to whom the first petition was sent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This last petition was sent January 24, 1944, and his reply through the colonial secretary, dated 4th of February, 1944, reads as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“I am directed by the governor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 24th of January, and to inform you that His Excellency regrets that he is not prepared to withdraw the proclamation prohibiting the importation into Jamaica of literature published by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“I am sir, your obedient servant”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(Signed) ‘‘The Colonial Secretary”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Notwithstanding this refusal, Jehovah’s witnesses, who see the present issue involved affects the name and honor of Jehovah and his King as well as the supremacy of The Theocracy, have not ceased to publish the good news of the Kingdom as commanded. With little or no literature in hand, but with the “high praises” of God “in their mouths and a two-edged sword in their hand”, they have fulfilled the prophecy. ‘They speak of the glory of his kingdom and talk of his power; to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The Loud is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.” He provided for this time and, to make witnessing possible without literature, and to equip his announcers, we have the school for the improvement of the Theocratic ministry, which opened for the first time in Jamaica at the first of this service year and finished the 52 lessons the last week in August with incalculable results to the benefit of all who have attended. At the beginning of this service year there was but one school In the island, and at its end (August) there are 27 schools in operation. These same studies have been supplied in mimeograph form to all companies desiring them, both large and small, because we have no stock of books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In addition to this there are 65 small companies, too small to operate a school. They too have received the entire course of 52 lessons in this same form, and have set apart a time for the study of the lessons for improving the Theocratic ministry. The results are inestimable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The next event, and the one marking the close of the year, was the United Announcers’ Theocratic Assembly, held August 11-13. For the best results a three-day convention was arranged for that week-end, instead of five days. A program and a brief report were sent to you, which I hope you received. No material for a program has been received here. But according to your instructions, I used the material at hand; and no one was disappointed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">We now stand at attention, awaiting the opportunity to serve all people of good-will in this land. By the Lord’s grace, we will continue to promote our work of Theocratic education, preparing the people, young and old, for a better and higher life upon this earth under the Kingdom rule, which “kingdom of God is nigh at hand”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark125"></a>MEXICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The witness for the Kingdom has gone forward in Mexico as never before. During the service year of 1944 there were more publishers in the field than at any previous time, an average of 2,071 reporting. A peak of 2,431 proclaimers of the message of the Kingdom reported during one month. It will be of interest to the reader to consider the tabulated report. The excellent improvement in the witness given in Mexico is due to the reorganization of the service there. Servants to the brethren have been sent to all companies, the pioneer work is better organized, magazine work was begun, and a better appreciation is had of back-calls and book studies. The brethren there now see the urgency of preaching the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When the servants to the brethren began visiting the companies, it was found that very few attended the service meetings regularly and many did not appreciate the need for the IV</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">atchtower</span><span class="font3"> study. This has been corrected. Because of attending service meetings and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> studies and being built up in the most holy faith, the “other sheep” in that land are taking hold of their privileges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The work in Mexico is not being carried forward without opposition. Every once in a while it breaks out somewhere throughout the country, for the Catholics are very much disgruntled because of the service being performed by these people that in times past used to be prisoners in the prison-houses, the church organizations. The Lord has freed them from this condition and now they are putting forth every effort to free others; but, because of their so doing, the Catholic organization through its pastors and priests has directed mob action against small groups who are worshiping the Lord. Some of the brethren have been hurt, but this has not dampened the zeal on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses in that land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A very interesting report is set out by the Branch servant, who is in charge of the local organization operating under the name of “La Torre del Vigia de Mexico,‘A.C.”, a Mexican association. Part of his report reads as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The visiting of company organizations in Mexico involves much more than buying a bus or train ticket and getting off at the company’s headquarters. The majority of the companies in this country are small and completely isolated from highways or railroads. Before the servant to the brethren work could be inaugurated it was necessary to send a letter to each company requesting information as to how to reach the place where the company was situated. One of the companies answered: “The only line that passes near this place Is a telegraph line.” Thanks to Jehovah, the servants are getting to the companies and are serving them. This entails a great deal of hardship and expense, but the privileges far outweigh the difficulties. To reach some companies the servant must go by mule or by foot, sometimes days at a time. The publishers are overjoyed at the visit and all the people of good-will for miles around are gathered when he arrives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The first time around the routes took ten months, and more than 175 companies were visited by two brethren. During Brother Knorr’s visit in February of this year it was arranged for two brethren, graduates from Gilead, to help us get the other companies visited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Increase of Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The peak number of company publishers at the close of the 1943 service year was 1,652. Our fondest hope was to reach 2,000 publishers during 1944. To this end the Society arranged for a special campaign In Mexico for the month of January, 1944. The public press had been carrying articles for months regarding the coming peace conferences and the religious editors had been harping on the part the holy (?) father (?) was to play in these important dis-(Missions. Everyone was interested in this topic and anxious for information. You can imagine our delight when the Society advised us that 75,000 copies of the Spanish booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Peace-Can It Last!</span><span class="font2"> fresh off the press, were on the way for the January campaign. The Devil himself had prepared the people for this booklet by having well advertised the subject “peace”. In record time the entire shipment of 75,000 booklets was sent out to the companies and pioneers with instructions to hold these until January first. On this day the Lord’s entire organization in Mexico moved forward as one man. The booklet went like wildfire and by the tenth of January the companies were writing into headquarters crying for “mfis folletos” (more booklets). Before the religious “pastors” could warn their church members the entire 75,000 booklets were safely In the hands of the eager “sheep”. The fact that all these booklets were placed In less than two weeks was a real cause for thanksgiving. As if this weren’t enough cause for raising a shout of joy, the January report showed that a new peak had been reached— 2,431 company publishers—an Increase of more than 47 percent over last year’s peak! That this was not an “accident” can be seen by the fact that since January the average number of company publishers has stayed above the 2,000 mark.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">As has no doubt happened in every country, the Theocratic service in Mexico has suffered somewhat because of the present global war. It has been several years since we have been able to receive phonographs or recordings, and the sound attendance has decreased accordingly. Since the outbreak of the war all ocean shipping has been suspended and all importations into the country must be made via railway freight, resulting, as is to be expected, in a congestion of shipping. As an example of how this affects the Lord’s service: In February of 1944 we were advised that the Society was sending us a quantity of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom in the New World</span><span class="font2"> in Spanish for a special campaign. Judging by the time other shipments delayed to reach us we announced the campaign for June, a full three months ahead. When May arrived and the shipment was still “expected any day now”, as the express office was pleased to reply to our insistent inquiries, we had the railway company instigate an investigation. We were finally informed that, because of abnormal conditions, several boxcars had been “lost” somewhere between here and the United States border and that our shipment was in one of these ears. After two months more the missing cars were found on a forgotten railroad siding and we did not receive this shipment until August, six months after it had been shipped from the New York factory. We are now looking forward to a big campaign to make up for this loss of time and expect to make the Devil pay the hard way for his interference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Magazines</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The magazines have gone exceptionally well this year, due to several reasons, among which are the following: The improved size and attractiveness of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La Atalaya</span><span class="font2"> as well as the timeliness of the articles; an increase of the streetwork activities; the offering of magazines in the door-to-door work to make up for the shortage of colored-cover booklets; and, above all, to a better appreciation of their importance on the part of the brethren, thanks to the servants to the brethren who continually keep this to the fore as they visit from company to company. The publishers have taken well to the Society’s suggestion that they work an hour or two before the meetings. As a result, an hour before the Sunday </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> studies the magazine publishers are to be seen on all the corners for a good distance around the Kingdom Halls. This has served to get in more hours, to call attention to the studies, and to place the “water of truth” with those who are taking their “Sunday stroll”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">President’s Visit</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The outstanding event of the year was Brother Knorr’s visit to the Mexican Branch in February and March of this year. Arrangements were made for a local assembly In Mexico city and we had the pleasure of hearing the president speak on the thrilling subject “The Glorious Treasure of Service”. Those in attendance were overjoyed to hear, at the same time, of the Theocratic progress in the United States, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and other places, and to learn that, if it be the Lord’s will, we shall soon have some of the college graduates here in Mexico to help with the gigantic task of educating the “men of good-will”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Brother Knorr gave the family many needed instructions and then gave us a big surprise. The Branch was to be expanded by the addition of a new concrete structure which is to shelter the Bethel family of Mexico and the Society’s Branch offices! Also a modern laundry room was to be built onto the present building for the family’s benefit and, who knows, maybe for the benefit of the coming Gileadites too!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">United Announcers’ Assembly</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Assembly was a fitting climax to a busy year and we rejoiced to participate in the great feast. A program was prepared as nearly like the one at the key city as was possl-ble, and as fast as the speeches were received in manuscript form they were translated and sent to the three assembly points in Mexico, which were Mazatldn, Monterrey and Mexico city. Inasmuch as the government was making plans for a great educational program the public was much interested in anything that had to do with education. Taking advantage of this we announced the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font2"> booklet on the back of the invitations to the public lecture of August 13. The advertisement read to this effect: &quot;Apart from hearing the lecture you should read the booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered.</span><span class="font2"> This booklet contains a wealth of information and discloses who the ‘wolves in sheep’s clothing’ are who have fought for so long against the education of the people, using fanaticism.” The response was very gratifying. Orders poured In from people in all walks of life and from every corner of the republic, asking for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font2"> booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As was to be expected after this foretaste, the public expected an exposd Sunday the 13th; and, by His grace, they were not disappointed. In accord with Brother Knorr’s instructions the lecture delivered to the assemblies in Mexico for the public lecture was none other than the famous “Religion Reaps the Whirlwind”. The result was all anyone could hope for. A few “good religionists” had their susceptibilities shocked and left the auditoriums in a huff but the public that packed out the halls soaked it in and interrupted time and again with thunderous applause and then accepted free copies of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font2"> booklet after the lecture was over. For this reason the campaign with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font2"> book Is being continued and it Is being placed left and right in spite of all the “warnings” that the clergymen are shouting against that “Protestant propaganda”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Without doubt the King’s freemen will push ahead in Mexico with the ever-increasing battle for truth and freedom. We confidently look ahead to the best year yet in Theocratic service, and look to the Giver of every good and perfect gift for more and more increases with which to honor his name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark126"></a>GUATEMALA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">This country, which lies to the south of Mexico, is under the Mexican Branch office. There are only five different publishers in Guatemala. They are not able to get very much work done, but they do place some literature from time to time. There is one publisher who does very well. She travels out in the jungles and visits the small farmhouses and little villages throughout the land. Guatemala is a Catholic-controlled country, and this makes it difficult for the brethren to get organized and started. They desire very much to have some help come into Guatemala so as to give them proper instruction concerning what to do and how to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The president of the Society had the good pleasure of stopping there when he was traveling through Central America last winter. He visited with these brethren and it was a joy to be associated with them for a few hours and learn of their problems and blessings. The Society has been trying for some time to send a representative into Guatemala so that these brethren might be properly instructed and the “other sheep” gathered together into a company organization. If it is the Lord’s will, we feel sure that this will be accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the year the publishers put out 500 pieces of literature and 278 magazines. They also conducted 141 back-calls and some book studies. It is hoped that the work in Guatemala can be increased.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark127"></a>NEW ZEALAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">A real effort has been made to have the ban lifted from our brethren in New Zealand, but here is another instance where the British rulers are fearful of something; or, probably better stated, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has sufficient influence in this territory to keep the ban on. In Australia they failed to hold the ban even during wartime. The same is true of Canada and South Africa. But New Zealand will have to struggle along for a while yet, until the ruling factors change their mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Even though there are restrictions on Jehovah’s witnesses, we find an increase in the work in New Zealand during the service year of 1944. Instead of only 409 publishers reporting, we find 450. More hours have been devoted to field service this year than in the previous year. It was the good fortune of the brethren to receive more books and booklets through the mails, and these have been distributed wisely. Though the ban was lifted on the work in Australia, this seems to have had no influence on the rulers of New Zealand. But the brethren in New Zealand are determined to go on. The servant looking after the work in this part of the world writes as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The only possible way to arm ourselves against the demon onslaughts is to keep busy in the Kingdom service. The work of educating the people of good-will is tremendous and is the only work worth while on earth today. It calls for real hard work on the part of all publishers, both in regard to preparing themselves for this work by diligent study and in participating in the actual work of free education. If the publishers fail to thoroughly equip themselves as servants of The Theocracy, they are inefficient in their witness work, and tbeir efforts are not rewarded by finding responsive hearts. Furthermore, failure to awaken the interest of the people sometimes leaves the inefficient publisher discouraged and less eager to press on in the work. New Zealand companies have all studies and the course in Theocratic ministry as recommended by the Society. By fully using in Theocratic interests time formerly wasted in pleasure a definite forward movement in the work is sure to result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Companies. At the beginning of the year there were 37 companies reporting; now there are 40, with the possibility of a further increase soon. Average hours are 16.8; back-calls, 3.6, and book studies, .7. A careful analysis of the company figures shows that the real work is being done by a minority of the publishers. I am certain that diligence in study, and a definite effort by all to increase their knowledge and efficiency, will result in greatly improved averages in hours, back-calls and book studies. There is an old saying, that “nothing succeeds like success”, and I believe that those publishers who are successful in arousing interest among the people of good-will have great joy through experiencing the Lord’s blessing on their work, and are thereby spurred on to greater efforts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">There has not been much opposition manifested during the present year, other than the restrictions under which we are working. On every hand we contact many inquiring people who need the comforting message we alone have for them. The crying need is for more educators to cope with the great work to be done, and to this end we pray the Lord of the harvest to send more laborers into the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All of us appreciate the Society’s loving interest in our welfare and the steps taken to ensure that we have a continuous supply of “food convenient”. Not one number of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> has been missed, and, although American copies are sometimes very scarce, we have always received one copy from which to make other copies, so that we all may keep abreast of the increasing light of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We also thank the Lord for the Minneapolis releases, of which we have received a goodly number. By the Lord’s grace, we shall use such equipment as we have in the great work of free education of men of good-will.

<p><span class="font3">The Branch office of the Society is located in Cape Town, South Africa, and it has jurisdiction over considerable territory. Reports are received from six different countries, namely, the Union of South Africa, Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, Portuguese East Africa, and Tanganyika. Jehovah has showered great blessings upon his people in this part of the earth and has greatly prospered the work of free education in behalf of the “men of good-will”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the Union of South Africa, where the Branch office is located, it has been a year of great victory and progress all along the line. In other countries to the north, also under the jurisdiction of the Branch, many restrictions still prevail and all efforts to remove such have thus far been without avail. Notwithstanding the difficulties, however, the Kingdom message continues to go out in these lands with its warning to opposers and comfort for all lovers of righteousness. The report which follows shows that in this vast territory there has been an average of 9,624 publishers engaging in the field each month. This is an increase of 1,403 over the average number reporting the previous year. A similar increase is found in almost every field of activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A summary of all the work in the southern part of Africa is compiled in the report which follows. Immediately thereafter are printed reports of conditions in the various countries under the jurisdiction of the Branch as furnished by the Branch servant.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Union of South Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Outstanding event in the Union was the victory by the Greater Jephthah resulting in the removal of the ban placed on the importation of the Kingdom literature three years earlier. Seven incoming shipments (about 1,800 cartons) were seized early in 1941. During the same year </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> were banned and six of the Society’s other publications already circulating for some years were seized. An effort to seize all the literature already in the country failed. The fight for the removal of the ban and the release of the literature has gone on without letup during the past three years. There have been legal actions, representations made to those in authority, a petition circulated and signed by thousands of persons of good-will, a pamphlet widely circulated in English and Afrikaans setting forth the facts, and much correspondence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In October the main legal action was still in progress and we were endeavoring to find ways and means of getting the minister concerned to grant the interview he had promised several years earlier but had thus far denied. Our stocks of literature were running very low and we prayed more earnestly than ever that the shipments might be released, and kept on fighting. Then things began to happen quickly. There were several changes in the cabinet, resulting in a new minister of the interior’s being appointed. A letter was sent by the Branch servant to the controller of censorship requesting the removal of the ban. A copy of this letter was sent to the new minister and the request renewed for the interview promised by his predecessor in office. The new minister did not shelve the matter, and the interview was eventually granted January 18. At this interview the minister expressed his readiness, subject to confirmation by the minister of justice, to (1) release the seized shipments; (2) remove the ban on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation; </span><span class="font2">(3) rescind the order issued by the chief control officer under which six of the publications were seized and to return the literature to the owners; (4) rescind the order issued under the Emergency Regulations declaring all the literature to be subversive. A week later confirmation was received in writing and a few days later we took delivery of the shipments, none the worse for their three years’ detention. Clearly the Lord had answered our prayer and given the victory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Although the distribution of literature was greatly curtailed during the past three years, the “new work” which began in 1941 has gone forward by leaps and bounds. In 1941 there was an average of 981 publishers in the Union; in 1942 the average was 1,357; in 1943 it was 1,837; and now, in the year just ended, 2,339. It can scarcely be said, therefore, that the Lord’s work has suffered as a result of the ban I On the other hand, as it was 1900 years ago so today, the church has thrived and grown and persecution has been defeated. Company organizations have increased from 127 in 1940 to a present total of 218.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As will be seen from the report for the past year the number of publishers has increased by 27 percent; hours, by 26 percent; back-calls, by 25 percent; back-call book studies in operation, by 120 percent. The release of the shipments in February enables us to show Increased placements of both volumes and booklets. New subscriptions and single copies of the magazines are twice as many as the previous year. A peak in number of publishers was reached in April, when 2,637 were In action; an increase of 511 on last year’s peak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Campaigns</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We shared in each campaign as it came along even though we did not have the same literature to offer. The subscription campaign (February-April) was the best yet. When it was arranged the ban was still operating on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font2"> and we set out to get 1,000 new subscriptions for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vertroosting.</span><span class="font2"> In the three months we entered 2,156 new subscriptions, of which number 1,338 were for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vertroosting.</span><span class="font2"> Total new subscriptions entered during the year numbered 3,762 to compare with 1,945 the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Production</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We were not able to import any new literature during the year, but supplies were printed locally of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom in the New World</span><span class="font2"> in English and Afrikaans, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Course in Theocratic Ministry,</span><span class="font2"> the 1944 Calendar, and other essential requirements, including the South African magazines, which proved to be convenient food for many. In all, the printing room turned out 1,029,691 pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After considerable effort and delay we were recently able to obtain a certificate of essentiality to import bound volumes, and we hope to have soon, if not all we require, at least reasonably good supplies of the bound books published in recent years. Our first shipment of the Watchtower edition of the Bible was lost at sea, and this was a big disappointment. We hope, however, that a repeat shipment will soon come to hand. The friends are looking forward with eager expectation to handling it and also the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Theocratic Ministry Course</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Of the many good things received during the year special mention must be made of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Course in Theocratic Ministry. </span><span class="font2">Practically all the European companies have taken up the course with enthusiasm, and those of the African friends who have even a smattering of English are trying their best to follow the lessons week by week. All of us are profiting much by It and seeking to apply the Instruction on the Theocratic battlefront. A number of the young pioneers are now hoping they may be privileged to receive a call to Gilead some day for an intensive training. News of Gilead and its graduates has greatly thrilled us and given us a broader vision of the immense work still to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Once again we desire to express our gratitude to the Lord for his protecting care and our sincere appreciation to you for all the help and encouragement we have received. During the difficult years just past we have never been in want. In fact, not a single meal was missed and healthy appetites were more than satisfied with the abundance of refreshing and energizing food which came to hand from the Great Provider. These experiences have greatly strengthened our faith and confidence in the Ixird and given us renewed zeal and determination to stand fast in the freedom for which Christ set us free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Southern Rhodesia</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The friends in Southern Rhodesia are still without literature. Following the removal of the ban in South Africa further efforts were made to have the restrictions withdrawn in this land, but without success. Nevertheless the work continues to go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At Intervals throughout the period we rejoiced in the thrilling news of our brethren in other lands and shared their joys in the Theocratic victories gained. Following the removal of the restriction in the Union of South Africa we were glad to receive the assistance from Cape Town that enabled us to make application to the minister of Southern Rhodesia for removal of the restrictions here. The replies received from the departments concerned were to the effect that the government was not prepared to consider the removal of the restrictions. We look forward to the day when the helps prepared by the Lord’s organization will be available to us to be used to his praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The conditions prevailing among Africans in general are such that the comforting message of the Lord brings them hope and joy. Recently at one center a servant to the brethren was scheduled to conduct a study of the “New World” in the compound. This joyful news spread throughout the compound, with the result that over 90 Africans who normally would have attended a church service turned aside to hear about the New World interest. They drank in the refreshing truths of Jehovah’s arrangement for all them that love him and many of these attenders publicly testified they had never heard news as wonderful as this in their church, to which they were not returning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The results of Jehovah’s educational program toward the people of good-will are evident. Some time ago a publisher commenced a book study with a family, who were scarcely able to read and who had great difficulty in finding the Scripture texts cited when reference had to be made to the Bible. They were of good will to the Lord, however, and the application of his methods, together with their eagerness to learn, has resulted in their being able to read with understanding and to quickly find the reference in the Lord’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The course of Jehovah’s witnesses and the stand taken by them have in many cases exposed the hypocrisy of the religionists and caused people of good-will to awake to the facts and to shun religion. A friend in his door-to-door work met a middle-aged man who welcomed his caller when he learned he was one of the witnesses. He recounted that he had been a regular church attendee until recently when he had seen his parson taking a position on a tribunal before which one of Jehovah’s witnesses appeared. The parson, he considered, should have been beside the J.w.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Toward the end of the period arrangements were made to hold a form of convention in Southern Rhodesia. The recent division of territory between the servants made it convenient to have two centers to serve the Africans, which also made the transport problem less difficult. Mrewa served the Mashonaland friends and Bulawayo cared for those In Mata-beleland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There was much joy and eager anticipation by companies when the arrangement was made known. The day before the activities were scheduled to begin friends were arriving on trains, lorries, bicycles and foot, in numbers greater than had been anticipated, but all friends joyfully entered into the work of arranging for their visitors. Northern Rhodesia also sent down a quota of friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A native chief at Mrewa, who is interested in the Lord’s work, helped with his car to transport friends to the meeting place and donated money toward buying food for the visitors. A European general dealer in that district also donated mealie meal. A messenger of the Native Department assisted three friends who were strangers to the district and had difficulty in finding their way. He gave them food and a place to sleep and next morning led them to the meeting place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It was not possible to engage a hall for the Africans over the convention. Most of the buildings at the Bulawayo center are under the control of religionists. Applications to them for accommodation were gently but firmly refused. The publicity slogan for Southern Rhodesia, however, is “Winter in Rhodesian sunshine”. The weather was kind and the sun shone from a cloudless sky as the friends gathered on the veld under the shade of friendly trees. There, seated in a large semicircle, they listened to the discourses and instruction talks after mornings spent in service in the field. The conditions reminded one of the days of Jesus when he spoke to the multitudes on the hillsides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Bulawayo Center—Africans</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Three hundred forty publishers handed in reports showing they had spent 4,080 hours in service. Back-calls totaled 153. The public discourse entitled “Jehovah’s New World” had an attendance of 1,028. This grand gathering listened attentively to the unfolding of the Creator’s purpose to vindicate his name through the establishment of his Theocratic government. They were thrilled to realize they were living in the day of its establishment and to hear some of the blessings that will shortly come to all people of goodwill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By baptism 27 “other sheep” symbolized their consecration to do the Lord’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Mrewa Center—Africans</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Police Camp at Mrewa received news of the intended gathering of Jehovah’s witnesses and requested the date of the gathering so that they could, as the local company expressed It, “send a representative to see if there was anything against the government”. It has since been reported that the representative could find “nothing against the government”. This finding is not surprising, as Jehovah’s witnesses were not gathered for that purpose but they came together to proclaim in partnership the good news of God’s kingdom, thereby comforting those that mourn, and to encourage each other in good works. They treated all people with kindness, refrained from controversies with opposers, and conducted themselves in an orderly way as representatives of the great Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The public discourse on “Jehovah’s New World” held on a Sunday afternoon between 4 and 5 p.m. had an attendance of 347 eager listeners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One hundred thirty-one publishers reported working 1,224 hours and making 63 back-calls. Twenty-three symbolized their consecration to the Lord by water immersion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">European Center—Bulawayo</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A small, comfortable hall was engaged from the Independent Order of Good Templars for two public discourses entitled “Righteous New World” and “Has Jesus Begun His Reign?” The friends kept this in remembrance in their door-to-door work and the day before the meeting all names on the back-call files were called upon with an invitation to attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Every seat was occupied in the small hall on the Sunday afternoon and 73 Europeans listened eagerly as the chairman introduced Jehovah’s witnesses and their work. Then the audience listened intently to the discourses. At the close of this meeting many came forward to say that the time had been all too short, they could have listened to much more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A few days after this meeting one of the witnesses was stopped on the street by one of the attenders who asked for a back-call to be made as soon as possible as he did not wish to longer delay learning the truth and what course he must take to please the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Northern Rhodesia</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The number of publishers has increased from 2,784 to a monthly average of 3,062. Hours of field service and back-calls remain about the same as last year. The hour average of 30 per publisher is high, but the back-call average of 1 is low. This is due to many of the publishers’ having to work under the farm labor conscription scheme, w’hieh takes them away from their homes and native village and they are frequently moved around and obliged to work in comparative isolation. The back-call study work is making progress in spite of present restrictions, however. Company organizations number 140.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Nine servants to the brethren have traveled approximately 8,000 miles during the year, at a cost of £547. Companies in the bush have been visited twice on an average and those on the rail head more frequently. It is frequently necessary for the servant to stay as long as a week or more at some centers to give the necessary instruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The government in 1943 found themselves extremely short of food and an already serious situation was obviated only by frantic borrowing from other territories. This made those responsible for agricultural production determined to produce locally as much grain and foodstuff as possible, with a consequence that instructions were given to chiefs to see that Africans residing in their districts do much more work on their gardens, or the plots of the chiefs themselves. European farmers, for the same reason, demanded more native labor and quite a considerable percentage of Jehovah’s witnesses were inspanned, together with others, either on the Instructions of the local chiefs or Labour Corps recruiters, to spend a good deal more time than formerly in food production, road-making, building, or the collecting of a rubber-producing fluid from trees. They have therefore had to “redeem the time” in order to keep up the previous averages and many smaller far-away companies in the bush have for months on end been almost completely bereft of their able men and servants, with a resulting weakening of the remaining nucleus composed of old men and illiterate women. These have tried hard to serve under heavy odds, but the back-calls have specially suffered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A further factor, unimportant though it may seem, is the lack of cycle parts and tires, which has forced, from almost all, the only practical means of traveling in the bush with any measure of speed and carrying ability, and limited the range of witnessing from centers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But these things are by way of an explanation of the annual totals. They do not reveal that the Lord’s people were never more united in the things of the Kingdom; that the witness work has made a deep impression upon the people; and that it is, generally speaking, only a fear of official disfavor that holds back thousands from a more intimate contact with us; but prejudice is breaking down and the work is spreading beyond our borders, to Angola, Tanganyika, and the Congo. And it takes a courageous man to stand for God and his Theocratic kingdom in the last-named territory. Not only are the work and literature completely banned, but Congo Africans professing association with us are liable to be transported to a certain district where they are kept in a loose sort of confinement sometimes for several years. Letters sent us from the Congo seldom reach here, and mail sent back is, it seems, not delivered ; but ‘where sin aboundeth, grace doth much more abound’, and into the darkness the word of life finds access and, despite privations and possible punishment within our limits, everything possible is being done to help our fellow Kingdom workers in this priest-ridden country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Age-old customs, which in other countries would be considered backward and servile in the extreme, involving sometimes something much more than civility and respectful obedience, provide a substrata upon which justification is sought to prevent quiet Bible studies in Barotseland, Mumbwa, and other districts, but experience has shown, or should have demonstrated by this time, that the expressed will of God Almighty comes first to those in covenant relationship with him, and imprisonment, followed by more imprisonment, has ended by many chiefs’ realizing the hopelessness and human waste of this form of religious intolerance which makes the British Constitutional rights and the provisions of the Atlantic Charter a far-away but unrealized echo here in some areas, and a wonder to some who do not believe our message but who, at least, know that the early church was a persecuted company of poor, sincere, often ill-educated and humble people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Europeans resident In this territory are enjoying considerable prosperity at present; war has increased their incomes greatly and restrictions are few indeed. But, even so, many of them realize that the promised “new order” is not composed of men with new hearts, quickened by the power of God and his Christ; and the meek, although few of them accept the Kingdom message as yet, can see that no real hope lies outside an arrangement that is not centered in a power that can and will “destroy them that destroy the earth”, and bring man to God without the wardrobe of devotional machinery and the tradition associated with the religious systems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Nyasaland</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The prohibition placed on the Importation of literature at the end of the previous service year has affected the distribution this year. Protests and application for the removal of the ban have been turned down. The literature held by the Society was not seized, and this continues to go out and to be used for the enlightenment of those of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another episode which turned out to be a rather painful one for an African minister was when he Impertinently demanded of one of the brethren his books so that he might tear them up. When the brother refused, the minister pushed him in the face, sticking one of his fingers in the brother’s eye. The brother kept control of his feelings, deciding to see how things go. The minister repeated the performance, but, unfortunately for him, one of his fingers found its way into the brother’s mouth. He bit It hard and did not let go until the minister pleaded for mercy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Concerning the New World of Jehovah: Nothing has so roused the interest of the people of good-will in this country as has the latest expression on this subject. One brother, In delivering a talk on the New World, brought out: “When Adam sinned no children were born to him in the garden; all were born in the ‘bush’ and, friends, we are still In the ‘bush’. We have not yet returned to the garden. But the time is near now when we will leave this ‘matekenya’ (jigger flea) world to enter the new fully-established world of Jehovah.” In one part of the country the interested friends followed Jehovah’s witnesses from village to village drinking in these sure promises and wondering that they have been so blind. This opening year will doubtless see many more “sheep” following the true Shepherd joining in the song of praise to Jehovah, the Everlasting God and Founder of righteousness and Giver of every perfect gift and to whom we all hope to prove faithful fighters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Tanganyika and Portuguese East Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Mails from Tanganyika and Portuguese East Africa have been irregular and quite a few letters and reports have gone astray en route. A number of publishers who resided in Portuguese East Africa for some years have now returned to Nyasaland, in which country it is possible to have a greater share in the witness work. Of those remaining there has been an average of 17, mostly on the sugar estates. Although they do not have much free time they averaged 14.9 hours and were able to make a few back-calls and conduct studies with those of good-will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The reports from Tanganyika indicate Increasing opposition, confiscation of literature, etc., but there was a monthly average of 75 publishers who averaged 8.1 hours in the field service. We try to help and encourage these friends by means of correspondence, the only avenue open or, should we say, partly open at present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SWEDEN</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark129"></a><span class="font3">Sweden is one of the few neutral nations in this world of global war, but this does not mean it is a more peaceful place for Jehovah’s witnesses. Regardless of where they reside, Jehovah’s witnesses are ‘in the world, but not a part of it’. The rulers and people of all nations, generally speaking, are not looking for the New World of righteousness; but they are looking for a “new order” formed by man. Therefore the clergy, politicians and commercial men have worked hand in hand to hang onto the old regime or re-establish it in some new cloak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The religionists of Sweden are very much displeased with the action of Jehovah’s witnesses, because these are telling the truth. The Lord’s people in this northern European country are going ahead with the message peacefully and calmly, but persistently. Probably this last year has brought forth the greatest opposition against the truth, but, even so, the publishers have increased from 2,352 to 2,542. The brethren are beginning to appreciate the need of making back-calls and conducting book studies, and there is much improvement in this work. It is believed that in the coming year greater activity will be found in these two lines of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Branch servant gives us a good idea of what has been taking place, and parts of his annual report are set out here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The service year just ended has certainly been an eventful one, and the experiences in which the Lord’s company of witnesses in this country have shared have brought them into line with their brethren in most other places, in that they have been more marked targets for the venomous darts of the enemy. By this time there is hardly a newspaper of any sort or description in the country that has not carried one or more spiteful articles denouncing Jehovah’s witnesses as “fifth columnists financed by foreign capital”, “an advance guard of Communism,” “false prophets,” “enemies of the state and society,” etc., etc., using all the usual epithets. Needless to say, it is the clergy who are behind this, and if anyone required evidence of this fact the clergy themselves saw to it that such was produced, seeing that all these attacks started as the result of a booklet against us being issued by a professor of theology, and several of his colleagues among the clergy wrote against us over their own signatures and gave lectures against us, using stuff that this professor had compiled, and the croakings in the press culminated at the time a big church council was gathered In the capital in the middle of May. The result of these writings has been, of course, to make the work more difficult, as many people do not take the trouble to investigate whether the papers have stated the truth, and just do not want to listen to what we have to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To some small extent there has even been trouble on the streets when the publishers have offered the magazines on the pavements. The street work is, of course, a feature of our service that is most vexing to the clergy. In a small town a Salvation Army captain took the trouble to go out on the street with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">War Cry</span><span class="font2"> every time our publishers were there, standing alongside them and trying to persuade people not to take our literature. After a while his action caused the people to take sides and led to rather heated discussions among those gathered around the publishers, so that the police interfered and brought a sister into court for causing traffic difficulties. There, however, the blame for the trouble was placed at the right quarter and a good witness for the truth was given which resulted in the case being dismissed. The chief of police, however, being influenced by the state church priest, who had publicly commended the Salvation Army captain for his behavior, appealed against the decision, and the case is now pending in a higher court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Although there are many such opposers, many people who hitherto have not taken the trouble to look into our message have now been aroused to do so because of the vehement accusations which they could see, on the face of it, could not possibly be true. Many of the interested have also been aroused to activity through these unjust attacks. The accusations have been dealt with in articles in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font2"> special editions of which have been widely distributed, and also in publications of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News </span><span class="font2">style, one of which, headed “Who Is Behind the Attacks Against Jehovah’s witnesses?” was spread to the number of 600,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some few newspapers have commented fairly favorably on our replies, but the majority continue to obey their masters’ voice without troubling to think for themselves. As an interesting fact it is noted that these attacks started just when the distribution of a 300,000 edition of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fighting for Liberty on the Home Front</span><span class="font2"> was completed, a booklet, by the way, that went out exceedingly quick, the whole edition leaving the office in exactly three months. It is rather amusing to see how even the clergy themselves have now had to adopt the method of calling upon the people personally in order to get the latter to read what the clergy have written against us, even giving such literature away free to persons and institutions. One can judge from that how really afraid they are because of the onslaught of the truth. With such motives behind their efforts these, of course, do not last long; they soon get tired and gradually retire into their own holes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord’s people, however, who have prayed, “Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God,” have received renewed strength and courage and gladly carry on through “evil report and good report”. The average number of publishers out during the year has been 2,542 (last year 2,352), the peak being 2,637.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The special pioneers have had the joy of seeing 17 new companies organized as a result of their efforts. Through the efforts of other pioneers 11 new companies have been formed. In other ways, such as by the division of larger companies, the movement of publishers from one district to another, etc., a further 116 new companies have been organized.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In addition to the literature above reported, 1,188,000 copies of leaflets in the “Kingdom News” style have been distributed, together with 20,500 copies of an extract from our edition of “Consolation”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is every prospect that the back-call and book-study work will take on a new impetus during the ensuing year, as these features were specially stressed during the convention held here August 11-13 at six different towns. During this convention the “Course in Theocratic Ministry” was introduced, and the effect of the taking up of this course in the companies will certainly be to help the publishers to be more effective, both in general back-call work and in starting and conducting book studies especially. The convention was attended by 3,040 persons. (The first convention in Sweden of which there is a record was held in Stockholm in 1904 and was attended by less than 100.) A total of 241 symbolized their consecration during the convention, and 2,230 different publishers took part in the field service, placing a total of 16,541 pieces of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In one of the convention towns, where there were about 500 publishers on the streets, one man stated that he had seen the town so full with magazine distributors that he had reckoned that there must have been about 25,000 of them. In another town there happened to be at the same time a church meeting with two bishops and representatives from all congregations in the diocese present. These religionists thought that we had come there just to disturb their assembly, as on the Saturday afternoon “it was impossible to walk anywhere in town without repeatedly being approached by Jehovah-witnesses”, as one local newspaper put it. Little they knew that our assembly was decided and planned months ahead of their diocesan meeting, and was only a small part of a big, world-wide convention.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark130"></a>NORWAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The only way any information can be obtained about the work done in Norway is through Sweden. Visitors go from Sweden to Norway from time to time, and occasionally they meet with the brethren and bring back reports. Information is at hand that in the capital of Norway there are now twenty study groups meeting regularly for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> studies, the attendance aggregating about three hundred. Communications inside the country being very restricted, personal connection between the local office and the companies in the provinces has been impossible, except in the case of companies in the districts near the office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Despite these conditions the Lord’s people have been regularly supplied with “meat in due season” in a marvelous manner and, as far as it is possible to ascertain, a spirit of devotion and unity now exists among the Lord’s witnesses in that country. Some of the literature that the Germans had decreed should be destroyed found its way into the hands of people of good-will and they are reading it and rejoicing in the message of truth. It appears that the Lord’s people are talking, and this they will continue to do because they have the command to preach this gospel of the Kingdom, as have all other servants of the Lord throughout the World. It is hoped that soon the brethren, and all the people throughout the land, will have the liberty to hear the truth preached boldly again, so that the lovers of righteousness may take their stand for the Kingdom before the battle of Armageddon.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark131"></a>SWITZERLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Because of the European war it has for some time been impossible to communicate directly with our brethren in Switzerland. However, once in a while communications do come through and these show that the brethren in Switzerland are content with their present situation and that things are going fairly well. They do have the opportunity of preaching from door to door, and they have kept this up constantly throughout the entire war. As one letter puts it, they are “not in a bed of roses”; but they are meeting their obstacles with a joyful heart. They are looking forward to the time when peace will again reign among the nations so that they can carry on the work to a greater extent in Switzerland and surrounding countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> magazine, which they still publish in Switzerland, there was a convention in Zurich this year and upward of 4,000 of the Lord’s people assembled. Fifty-seven were baptized at this assembly. The brethren also report on the keeping of the Memorial; so it appears that thus far they have freedom of assembly and worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A cablegram was received in the month of October from the Branch servant stating that he had completed the year’s report and was forwarding it and that he hoped it would come through. At the time of preparing the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font3"> this report had not come through; but we may assume from the message received that they have a report and that the work continues, all to the honor and glory of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark132"></a>TRINIDAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The work continues in this island under certain restrictions, but progress has been made. Two hundred and ninety publishers have engaged in the field service, and they placed 11,886 pieces of literature. They are doing good work in the back-call activity, doubling the report of the former year. In the service year 1944 they made 3,076 back-calls and started a larger number of book studies. They are able to assemble and have conventions, and these have brought many rich blessings to Jehovah’s witnesses in that land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Branch servant writes concerning conditions there, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the U. S. A. there is a continuous and copious flow of books and booklets. Here we are allowed only </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font2"> and three booklets that already have been widely circulated, and those which companies had in hand at the end of 1943 were soon placed, leaving us nothing at all. We afterwards received some booklets, but no </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Harp of God. </span><span class="font2">This is our great handicap, lack of literature, but we call the attention of the brethren to the fact that Jesus and His disciples did a wonderful work without literature. Some may not have been as zealous as in former years, but the Lord has brought in enough and more in numbers to do the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Barbados. Barbados and the islands mentioned below come under the direction of the Branch servant at Trinidad, and good work has been done in these places. Sixty-one publishers are located in Barbados, and they placed 244 bound books and have spent 5,528 hours in the field service. A good witness has been given, even though under restrictions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dominica. Three publishers on this island spent 74 hours in the field, and placed 94 publications. A few back-calls have been made. The brethren here need some help and instruction on Theocratic organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Montserrat. Two publishers on this island are doing what they can. They keep in communication with the Society the best they can and as mails will allow. They used sound equipment to some extent, made a few back-calls, and are trying to push ahead with the work. Illness has interfered with their activity to a very great extent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">St. Vincent. This island has received a very good witness by the seven publishers living there. In but nine months’ time 2,637 hours were spent in the field. If the report were in for the full year, it would show a considerably better record of activity. There is hardly any literature to use, but the brethren are doing good work in making back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tobago. Nineteen publishers live here, and they spent nearly 1,000 hours witnessing to the Kingdom. These brethren, too, must learn to work as did the disciples, going from door to door in the preaching of the gospel. Literature is very scarce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is hoped that sometime soon all of these islands can be supplied with more literature, and probably have a brother visit them so as to give these servants of the Lord further instruction as to their responsibility and privilege.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark133"></a>WEST AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Many are the difficulties that the brethren in West Africa must overcome. No great effort is made on the part of the government to educate the natives of that land, but when they hear the marvelous message of truth they rejoice to accept it. The report shows the determined stand these brethren have taken for the truth. They are not willing to bow down before images or men, for they know that this is contrary to God’s law. They fully appreciate God’s kingdom as being the only hope for the world, and they joyfully preach this kingdom to all that have a hearing ear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The report shows a very splendid increase in Nigeria in the way of publishers; and the brethren on the Gold Coast are holding their own as far as publishers are concerned. The literature was taken away from them some years ago, but the brethren engage in the back-call activity; for this is all they can do, in addition to witnessing from house to house and telling the people of the message. The time will come soon, we hope, when more literature may go into these lands to help those that love righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Branch servant in West Africa reports for two countries, namely, the Gold Coast and Nigeria. His report follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Gold Coast</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In spite of all hardships, the work in this country continues to progress. As usual, communications are not regular with the brethren, because of existing conditions. Notwithstanding this, the work has been so organized that the hungry ones for the truth are being regularly fed from the Lord’s table; a sub-office having been organized at Accra, the capital of the Gold Coast, and servants appointed to visit and encourage the brethren in the thirty-three companies and units.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One of the zealous brethren in this country paid a Theocratic visit in June to Nigeria, having been used by the Lord to bring some of his rich provisions to us, that is, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font2"> another one of which we received a month later from London.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The average number of regular publishers in this country is 231, the highest peak total being 495, during the month of October, 1943, when the reports from all publishers seem to have reached us. According to reports which have come to hand, the publishers, during the whole year, have put in a total of 42,188 hours, made 1,581 back-calls, and have conducted a total of 583 book studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Interest is being shown by some of those who are hearing the message, as evidenced by the fact that a total of 21 persons symbolized their consecration to God by water baptism. At the time of the Memorial, the brethren assembled in 12 centers to study the Lord’s Word, the total number of those who attended being 354 and the total number of partakers of the emblems being 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Most of the companies have just started the course in Theocratic Ministry training, and therefore we look forward to greater activity on the part of each publisher of the Word during the ensuing year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Over 200 united announcers assembled at Swedru in August, and a grand witness was given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Excepting those who are somewhat slack or are lukewarm, all the brethren are at unity one with another, all having one purpose in view, that is, the vindication of Jehovah’s name; and all are busy spending all they reasonably can in the advancement of the Theocratic interest. The persecution by the religious elements and some of the native chiefs has not in the least deterred the faithful ones in performing their covenant obligations. Their determination is to continue to press forward the battle until Armageddon brings all enemies of The Theocracy to lick the dust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Nigeria</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is always cause for joy and thankfulness to the Lord for his continuous blessings on the work in this part of West Africa. With each passing year the Lord has increased the opportunity of service for his people and all the faithful are glad for such privileges, doing with their might what their hands find to do. The past year has been one of increased activity by the publishers in Nigeria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Persecution</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That the opposers of the Lord and his kingdom under the leadership of the demons will continue to oppose until they are destroyed is made sure by the fact that the brethren are persecuted for ‘doing good’. Persecution is more severe in some places than in others; but, as the Lord has promised his faithful people (Jeremiah 15:20,21), he has continued to deliver his people and thus enable them to defeat persecution. There are a number of cases on record, one of which is as hereunder reported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A man, who pretendedly associated himself as one of the Lord’s people, requested that the brethren in that company assist him financially to gain the native stool of chieftaincy. The brethren refused to do so and pointed out to him that to be a chief in the present arrangements of this Satanic world is a devilish desire and a course which is against the Lord. He did not listen to the brethren, but pursued his course, and the Devil saw to it that he was elevated, even to the position of presidency over the other native ruling chiefs. Because the brethren, in addition to not giving him support to become a chief, would not hail him as king and prostrate on their bellies as do others before him, he became mad against them and wanted to rid them out of the entire district. He proceeded to destroy their study-meeting places, tying their women with ropes, flogging the brethren even to bleeding, and, under false charges, got thirteen of them to be Imprisoned; many of the brethren having fled away to other districts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The matter was promptly taken up with the authorities, facts of the case being made public in the local papers. The result was that the imprisoned brethren were released, those who fled away returned, and the chief was officially warned by the district officer not to interfere any more with the worship of Almighty God by Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Prior to the release and the return of the brethren to their homes, the chief has caused drums to be beaten, feasting and rejoicing that lie has triumphed over his enemies; but the joy did not last long, as he afterwards had to remain in his house for days in shame when the Lord’s righteous cause triumphed. This happened at Aiyetoro-Gbede, Kabba district, a distance of some 390 miles from Lagos. Other chiefs in the near-by districts and other places, who also were prejudiced against Jehovah’s witnesses for their nonprostration before them, and having been waiting to see the final result of that chief’s action in order to follow suit, were thus curbed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Come what may, under the leadership of their invisible Lord and Ruler, Christ Jesus, the brethren are determined to continue in the service until Jehovah’s name is fully vindicated. The stand taken by the faithful ones while being persecuted has caused others to inquire as to the causes and they have thereby come to know the truth. Thus, instead of persecution’s stopping the witness, it is spreading It.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Seeing that conventions are now being arranged worldwide, and that such are arranged by the head office in Brooklyn, no local ones other than the campaigns are arranged. The brethren throughout the country had been preparing and looking forward to the announcement from the head office as to when the convention should take place. They knew it would be a time when all the Lord’s people throughout the earth would meet together to feast on spiritual food and unite in assembly for wide proclamation of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our joy was full, therefore, when the time of the convention was announced to be from August 9-13, 1944. However, because of existing conditions, we in West Africa held the convention from August 11-13, that is, for three Instead of five days. It w<sup>T</sup>as held in six centers, namely Ibadan, Ondo, Port Harcourt, Kaduna, Sapele, and Kabba. The attendances respectively were 2,441, 300, 1,370, 65, 775, and 280, making a grand total of 5,231. The same program was used at all the centers, and the same message delivered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The friends made great effort to attend this annual worldwide assembly. Conditions re transport facilities not being as favorable here as in more advanced countries make one the more admire the zeal and efforts put forth by these children of the King. Although in the rainy season, we were blessed with three days of fair weather throughout. A good witness was given and we look forward for results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At Ibadan, the key city of the convention, it was necessary to take the loud-speaker off the sound-car and machine and install same in the Theatre Hall, where the convention was held, so as to address the 2,441 conventioners through the microphone. This enabled all to hear the lectures by the different speakers plainly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the public lecture, which was on the subject “The Kingdom of God Is Nigh”, the Theatre Hall was packed out, no standing room available, the audience numbering over 5,000.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark134"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark135"></a>SUMMARY</span></h1>
<p><span class="font8">T</span><span class="font3">HIS report shows the great expanse of the Theocratic activity in the earth today. It is not man’s work. If it were of man, then it would have come to nought long before now because of the opposition expressed toward it. From the things that have occurred in every country one can readily see that it is not an easy matter to stand for the truth. It was not done without difficulties in the time of the apostles, nor is it done so now. The truth has never been popular in this old world drenched in blood and governed by intrigue. Christians of all times have understood that they must walk in God’s way and must serve the Lord according to his expressed will, not according to the evil practices of this world. “What doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the Lord thy God.”—Deuteronomy 10:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One would think that persons trying to do good to their neighbor and teach Jehovah’s laws would get on well with the “Christian” nations. But are they Christlike? The way in which Jehovah requires his people to walk does not allow for compromise with the world, nor does it permit them to engage in the world’s iniquities and wickedness. The “present evil world” is not Christian. God has set up a very high standard for men and women who love him, and he does not bring this standard down to the level in which men of this world revel. Religionists have lowered that standard by offering tradition to men in its stead. Thus they present to the world a ‘form of godliness, but they have denied the power thereof’. Politicians, commercialists and all men of selfish</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">interests have tried to bring the true standards of Christ Jesus down to their level, and have tried to dissuade all others from taking the proper course. This Christians cannot do, and therefore they find no favor in the eyes of this evil world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If this world and its standards were in accord with the principles of truth and righteousness, it would not have been necessary for the apostle to warn the followers of Christ Jesus not to conform themselves to this world, but to cleave to the higher standards of their Master, Christ Jesus. The apostle Paul addressing the Romans, who were under the domination of the Roman Empire ruled by the Caesars, said to them: “Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.” (Rom. 12:2) Jehovah’s witnesses aim at something higher than what this world has to offer, the example set by Christ Jesus, and therefore they must 'transform’ or ‘renew’ their minds or their way of thinking in order to “prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God”. This they have done and they fully appreciate that the only hope for the world is God’s kingdom, not a “new order based on moral principles” of this old world. The “moral principles” of this old world are degraded and have always led to death; and they will continue to take people into the grave. Religion has not heeded the Master’s words to “love thy neighbour”, nor the all-important command to “love the Lord thy God”. If one desires everlasting life with peace and prosperity, he must gain an understanding of the “perfect will of God”, which the nations reject. The righteous will of God is so much higher and superior to man’s that it is necessary to renovate one’s mind, get rid of the old “moral principles” of man and then fill the mind with the principles of truth and righteousness as set forth in God’s Word, the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Men and women who have come to a knowledge of the truth as set forth in God’s Word and have faith in it have been freed from the bondage of the old world. The apostle says, “You were invited to freedom.” (Gal. 5:13, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott)</span><span class="font3"> Regardless of all the adverse opposition and actions of men to take away that freedom, it cannot be done if we hold to the principles for which Christ Jesus freed us. Jehovah’s witnesses will refuse to give up the right of freedom of worship and praise, which they know belongs to Jehovah, regardless of pressure and opposition brought against them to try to force them to lower their standards to the level of this present evil world’s “moral principles”. Never again will they go back into bondage and be forced to conform to this world, now that they have been freed to preach “The kingdom is at hand”. They are not subject to religious traditions, which have for centuries tried to silence the mouth of truth. Religionists killed Jesus because he spoke the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All the physical facts in fulfillment of prophecy indicate that “the kingdom of God is nigh at hand”. It is here, and it is here to stay! Jehovah’s witnesses have this information and knowledge, and every one of them must proclaim this far and wide, even unto the ends of the earth. This, by the grace of God, they are doing, even though this Kingdom means the removal of all the kingdoms of this world. Jesus said, and Christians believe, “My kingdom is not of this world.” They are not afraid to face the realities of life brought about by their preaching, which, in some instances, mean the very killing of this body; but never the destruction of their eternal existence. They fully appreciate that it is not an easy task to serve the Lord and preach this kingdom as the apostles and the faithful followers did in the days of Jesus. The record shows Christians will undergo persecution for Christ’s sake. Jehovah’s witnesses are minded to stand fast for the Kingdom and proclaim it until this message has had as wide a witness as it pleases Jehovah to give through his witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is well known that the age-old and corrupted Roman Catholic sect has tried for centuries through craft, deceit and diplomacy to gain control of the world, and how it has used the Nazi ruler as the “sword of the church” to gain world domination. It makes no difference to the Hierarchy how many people are murdered or killed in war, even though they are her children, “children of the church,” let alone Jehovah’s witnesses, so long as the church acquires the coveted power. How can such a corrupt organization ever bring about world peace, when its lust for power has been so clearly seen by the peoples for centuries? It can’t be done, and it never will be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Years ago Christ Jesus spoke fearlessly to the rulers, saying, “My kingdom is not of this world”; but he was the King of the kingdom that would rule the new world. His kingdom would be one of righteousness and was future from his day. It was future by approximately 1900 years, and now his kingdom has come. The King has taken unto himself his power and has begun his reign. Jehovah’s witnesses recognize this fact and proclaim it, and therefore support the King and his standards; for what else could ambassadors do?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Today we find, according to the year’s report, 110,505 publishers proclaiming this message each month, despite opposition. This is an increase of publishers over last year, even though the obstacles and persecution have been greater because of the global war. To aid the people to gain the true understanding of the Word of God, 20,332,955 books and booklets were left with them. This was accomplished in the same manner as Jesus taught his disciples and then had them do, namely, by going from door to door, from house to house, from village to village, making back-calls and conducting studies in the homes of the interested people. Throughout all the world where the message has had free course during the past year Jehovah’s witnesses also stood on street corners and delivered to people who wished to read magazines the total of 9,293,913 copies. A marvelous witness indeed!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is not enough for these servants of the Lord to just distribute literature, depending upon the person with whom it is left to read it; but it is also their responsibility to teach and instruct those who love righteousness. Jehovah’s witnesses made 7,769,144 back-calls on such persons during the service year of 1944. Many of these back-calls turned out to be most profitable, for the people really wanted to study a book in their own home and learn of Christ’s standards. Throughout the twelve months of the year Jehovah’s witnesses were conducting 94,581 book studies each week in the homes of the interested; and the attendance at these studies totaled 218,409. This is indeed a large congregation for Jehovah’s witnesses to care for, but we look forward to coming years when this congregation will be even greater in number. Undoubtedly there are many more people of good-will who show a meek and humble spirit that will yet become dissatisfied with this old world and its “moral principles” and will break loose from it and will want to study the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This privilege that Jehovah’s witnesses have is no small matter with them; for the only way in which they can really show to their Maker their gratitude for the freedom which they possess and the knowledge they have of the great Creator is to express it in worship, and their form of worship is to sing forth the Lord’s praises. This they have done day and night before the temple of the Lord by talking kindly and sincerely to people of all nations for 31,458,684 hours. This is the time spent by Jehovah’s witnesses worldwide preaching “this gospel of the kingdom”, in but twelve months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The total of 110,505 publishers is only the average monthly number reporting, and does not reveal the full number of Jehovah’s witnesses praising the name of the Lord yearly. There were approximately 120,000 publishers reportedly doing this grand work, for this indicates the peak of publishers reached sometime during the year in all the nations represented. Thousands in totalitarian-controlled countries have shown their determination to proclaim this message of the Kingdom, even under the most adverse conditions, but were unable to report. Jehovah sees their integrity, and appreciates their zeal and devotion, and they will receive their reward. If in a few years communications are open with other countries, then those brethren will undoubtedly report to the home office, because they will appreciate the need for organization and Theocratic instruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is really a joy to be working with such an organization—small, but powerful, because brought forth by God. It is held together by his spirit of truth, a force no one can destroy. Jehovah’s witnesses today stand in the same position as did the nation of natural Israel in its time of favor with God and when Jehovah dealt with that people centuries ago. He fought their battles, cared for them, fed them and held them together in unity, all for his name’s sake. We see this being accomplished today with his spiritual Israel through God’s holy spirit, his active force, on an even greater scale. He no longer keeps them in just one land, but his people are scattered from one end of the earth to the other to preach the good news. Still there is unity, oneness of mind, devotion, and worship to the only true God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Grateful to the Lord are all his people for his manifold blessings, his protection and his care during the past year. It has been a joy to everyone who knows the Lord and is associated with his Theocratic organization to carry on fearlessly and shoulder to shoulder, having one thing in mind: “The kingdom is at hand.” It is the desire of all who have come unto the Theocratic organization for safety, by the grace of God, to maintain their integrity and to share in the vindication of his glorious and holy name.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark136"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark137"></a>ANNUAL MEETING</span></h1>
<p><span class="font8">O</span><span class="font3">N Saturday morning, at eleven o’clock, January 8, 1944, the annual meeting of members of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Ine., a New York corporation, was held at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 2, New York. The meeting was opened with prayer to Jehovah. The total membership of fifty-five persons were present, in person or by proxy, except two. The general business of the membership corporation was taken care of, and reports were made by the president and the secretary and treasurer on the condition of the Society and its activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The directors of the New York corporation are divided into two groups, namely, Class A and Class B. The term of office of the Class A directors expired. Those nominated to fill the vacancy were N. H. Knorr, H. H. Riemer, and A. R. Goux. These, all former directors, were re-elected for the ensuing term of two years. The Class B directors, having been elected to office the previous year, have one more year to serve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The members, having taken care of the necessary business, then adjourned; and immediately thereafter the directors of the corporation held a directors’ meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The present directors of the New York corporation are: N. H. Knorr, H. C. Covington, H. H. Riemer, A. R. Goux, W. E. Van Amburgh, F. W. Franz and J. C. Booth. One matter of business was the election of officers for the ensuing year. Those elected were N. H. Knorr, president; H. C. Covington, vice-presi-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">191 </span><span class="font3">dent; W. E. Van Amburgh, secretary and treasurer. The business matters of the Society were discussed and preparations for advancing the work were considered, after which the meeting adjourned.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark138"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark139"></a>PENNSYLVANIA CORPORATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">The annual meeting of the members of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, a Pennsylvania corporation, was held on October 2, 1944, at the Syria Mosque, Bigelow Boulevard, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The meeting was called to order by the president, N. H. Knorr, at 10:00 a.m. At the time of this meeting the Society’s records showed that persons in good standing as shareholders of the corporation totaled 4,428. These persons held voting shares to the total number of 232,266. The number of votes necessary for a quorum, or 51 percent of the votes in good standing, in order to transact business at this meeting, would be </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">total of 118,455. The record shows that there was a quorum at the meeting by the presence of voters either in person or by proxy holding a total of 225,305 shares or votes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There were a number of resolutions to be discussed by the members of the corporation, as well as the matter of electing directors and officers. The directors elected to serve the interests of the corporation were: W. E. Van Amburgh, T. J. Sullivan, H. H. Riemer, Grant Suiter, N. H. Knorr, H. C. Covington and F. W. Franz. Of these directors, the following officers were elected: president, N. H. Knorr; vice-president, H. C. Covington; secretary and treasurer, W. E. Van Amburgh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then amendments to the charter were presented in the form of the resolutions. The resolutions that involved the biggest changes in the charter were numbers 2 and 4. Resolution number 2 enlarged the purposes of the charter and set out the work of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society more specifically; which work, briefly stated, is 'preaching this gospel of the Kingdom in all the world for a witness’, and the preparing of men and women to carry on this work. Resolution number 4 was for the purpose of amending the charter so that the membership of the organization would at no time be more than 500 individuals or less than 300. This resolution made no provision for membership based on money contributions to the Society, as Article No. 5 of the original corporation charter did. This resolution also provided that the new membership of 300 to 500 persons elect a board of directors, and that the board of directors elect its own officers to look after the interests of the corporation, in accordance with the responsibility placed in the directors by the Pennsylvania statutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The other resolutions were minor and had to do with the streamlining of the charter. All members attending the annual meeting were enthusiastic about the changes. At the conclusion of all business the president of the Society made a brief report on the general activity of the corporation world-wide, and then the meeting was adjourned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Proper papers were filed with the court and due notice made in the newspapers concerning the suggested change of charter as recommended by the present shareholders. At the time of preparation of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font3"> the court had not handed down its final decision as to whether or not these amendments are acceptable to the state and whether they will be made</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">part of the charter of the Pennsylvania corporation. A hearing, however, was held before a master appointed by the court for a thorough examination and clarification of the recommended changes, which were the expressed wish of the entire membership body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Throughout the year both of the above-named corporations had directors’ meetings from time to time to discuss ways and means of handling the Society’s business. All the members of the boards of directors look well to the Kingdom interests committed into their care, each one fully appreciating his privilege of serving in this capacity and realizing his responsibility before the Lord of seeking first the Kingdom. Each one knows full well that “this gospel of the kingdom” must be preached in all the world for a witness. It is their unanimous desire to see this work done according to the Lord’s good pleasure, to the honor and glory of His name.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark140"></a><span class="font5">YEARTEXT FOR 1945</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations.&quot;—Matthew 28:19, Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These were the words spoken by the resurrected Master to his disciples some days before his ascension into heaven, as recorded by Matthew. Christ Jesus must have been a fearless Leader and, at the same time, a very comforting companion. The words that flowed from his mouth were words of life. Now this great Leader of the people was leaving his disciples to go and prepare a place for them, so that where he is they might also be. In his absence, however, there was a tremendous work for the disciples to do: ‘go, disciple all the nations.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The real import of this command was brought to the disciples’ attention at Pentecost when they began to speak in different tongues. They now used not only the language they spoke as Galileans, but also the language of the dwellers of Media, Cappadocia, Pontus, and Asia; yes, even the Egyptians and Romans could understand them now. The Greeks and Arabs could hear the message of the Lord in their native tongues. This mighty miracle of God was for a purpose: so that they might </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘go,</span><span class="font4"> disciple all the nations’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was not many years thereafter that the apostles did go into other countries—to Greece, Asia, Parthia, and Babylon. Servants of the Lord visited Egypt and Rome and, eventually, as years went by, got into all of Europe and the isles of the sea. When the lands of the Western Hemisphere were discovered, North America and South America, the message of Jehovah’s witnesses was brought to these people. That is how far-reaching the Lord’s above words to his disciples are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is a very definite purpose in doing all this preaching. First of all, God, through his Son, is taking out of the Gentile nations a people for his name, and these share in its vindication. Then in the last days, at the end of this old world, Jesus foretold the doing of a great gospel-preaching work; for he said to his disciples of that time: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness.” This was a special message that the Lord Jesus directed should be given in all the world for a witness in the last days. It was a message relating to the day when Jehovah of hosts would vindicate his name by dashing to pieces all the nations of this earth, thus proving his supremacy; it was a message in which proclamation was to be made that the King, Christ Jesus, was set upon his throne as King of the righteous New World; it is the good news that Jehovah God the King-Father and Christ Jesus the King-Son reigned together. That day is here, and this good news is being shouted out by the earthly announcers of the message, the fact that “the kingdom of God is nigh”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here again, then, this command of Christ Jesus, “Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations,” must have a fulfillment. The “other sheep” must be gathered unto the organization and given opportunity to hear the truth and take their stand for the Kingdom. Not only was God’s Word written for his chosen people, spiritual Israel, whom he had been gathering now for 1900 years, but it was also written for the aid and comfort of all the “other sheep” that must be brought together into the one fold. Christ said: “Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold,” and these too he must bring unto his Theocratic organization. To do this his disciples, Jehovah’s witnesses, must go to all the nations and preach this message. Their companions, the “other sheep”, gladly join them in this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They do not heed the threats of persecution, nor do they fear to be brought before governors and kings because of their being ambassadors of Christ Jesus. They are fully aware that the Master said: “Here I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. . . . But be on your guard against men, for they will give you up to their courts, and have you flogged in their synagogues, and you will be brought before governors and kings on my account, to bear your testimony before them and the heathen. . . . You will be hated by everybody on my account, but the man who holds out to the very end will be saved.”—Matthew 10:16-22, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Goodspeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord’s faithful witnesses today fully appreciate these words of the Master and they are not fearful of what might be done to them; but they will, by God’s grace, hold out to the very end bearing testimony. They have one work to do, that is, to preach “this gospel of the kingdom”. They must ‘go, disciple all the nations’. Under the direction of Jehovah’s Theocratic organization this work goes on and will be done according to the good pleasure of Jehovah God and to the honor and vindication of his name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">After that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.—1 Cor. 1:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the midst of all the world turmoil there are those who show wisdom different from the world’s, the wisdom of God. They choose to be guided by it, cost whatever it may in this world. If these are wise, what are they doing for the betterment of the world? Nothing; that is, nothing for this world, because it is a doomed world, and is beyond bettering and preserving. But as for the groaning people, those who are led by the wisdom of God are doing what results in the real betterment of human creatures, preparing them for everlasting life in a new world of righteousness and peace. What, then, are these doing ? They are preaching, acting as preachers and ministers of the gospel. These must not be confused with the ministers of organized religion.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Let the Lord be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.—Ps. 35:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s servant has chosen to serve the God of truth and righteousness undividedly. For him there is no turning aside or back with divine approval. To show integrity he must keep fidelity and preserve unbreakable his attachment to the Lord of his choice. The enemy opposition simply furnishes the servant the opportunity to demonstrate obedience to the Lord under fire. By thus manifesting unquenchable love for Him, he honors the Lord as the Worthy One to whom service is due. It is not his own pleasure and will that he seeks to do, nor that of the enemies or any other creatures. It is his Lord’s will and pleasure that are all-important to carry out. The Lord God backs up his servant, and deals with the enemies as deserving. He enlightens his servant as to His good pleasure, because he delights in his servant’s willingness and loyalty and is glad to keep him in His service.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named.—Eph. 3:14,15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah is the heavenly Father. Those who know his Fatherhood are not ashamed of his name, but pray, “Our Father, which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.” He is the matchless Organizer of perfection. He is the Father of his grand family in heaven and earth, a universal family. He knows how and is also able to rule this universal household well and to have it in subjection that thus order, peace and well-being may result. For this purpose he has his household of devoted children organized. Together they constitute or make up his universal organization. It is well for us on earth that Jehovah's invisible organization is orderly according to righteousness. As to those on earth who form the visible part of his organization, God’s own orderliness is set forth as the reason for them to work together in peace.-l Cor. 14: 33.

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s “freewoman” is an organization of free creatures. It is the mother of his sons, who are free, and never brings forth any children to bondage. It is the mother of the beloved Son of God, who brings eternal freedom to all them that wait in faith upon God to effect complete deliverance from sin, imperfection, death and the Devil. Four thousand years after God’s promise in Eden concerning the Seed, his “freewoman” brought forth the promised Deliverer, who will shortly bruise the head of Satan the Devil, thereby destroying his power. During the time that God’s “freewoman” was sterile of such Seed, the faith of men of old was sorely tried. Now in this day the faith of other men who likewise believe His promises is being severely tried until the Promised Seed wounds fatally the head of the wicked Serpent and thereby vindicates the name of Jehovah God and his word of promise.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">In the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory.—Matt. 19:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Christ Jesus used the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">regeneration</span><span class="font3"> to mean the re-ereation of the world of righteousness, the new world of “new heavens and a new earth”, (2 Pet. 3:13) The new world will not mean the universal organization of Jehovah God; for that organization includes seraphim, cherubim and angels and has always existed since God created his first and only begotten Son. Never has it broken down or ceased. Hence it does not need renewing or re-ereation. Of course, the righteous new world will include creatures who are of or who become members of Jehovah’s universal organization; yet the new world is something that has a separate standing and hence a special treatment. Why so ? Because it is made of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">new</span><span class="font3"> heavens and a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">new </span><span class="font3">earth.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1 sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which 1 did among them.—Josh. 24:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Back in Egypt the slaying of the passover lamb had been preceded by great plagues, nine of them, upon Pharaoh’s realm. The slaughter of the passover lamb was followed by the worst plague, the death of all Egypt’s firstborn, to the great reproach of her gods. Correspondingly, prior to Jesus’ death his activities and preaching were very destructive of religion among the Jews and hence they were like plagues to Satan and his chief ones on earth, particularly the clergy. Jesus exposed their traditions of the elders as being hypocritical worship and contrary to God’s Word and commandments. He told them they were of their father the Devil, and not representatives of God. His worst judgment declaration was made against such religious clergy just a few days before they had him nailed to the tree.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; preach.—2 Tim. 4:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s King is reigning. This means a new force has been injected into the affairs of this world. The course of the nations in total war is one of inflicting death upon millions. The course of Jehovah’s reigning King is one of destroying death. Remarkable as it may seem, the Scriptures reveal that his work of resurrection has already gone forward. His work of making the dead to live again will not halt until it embraces the general resurrection of humankind and places the human dead that are in .the graves back on earth, all subject to his disposition as King and Judge. Such is good news. It is Scriptural gospel, and has been true since the active reign of the King began in A.D. 1914, and true particularly since 1918. Therefore preach this word of the gospel.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Have hope toward God, . . . that there shall be a resurrection of the dead.—Acts 24:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah startled and surprised the entire enemy camp when he revealed his purpose to resurrect the dead. Jehovah is the God of resurrection. To his faithful, only begotten Son he has given the privilege of co-operating with Him in resurrecting the dead, but only after he had first raised this beloved Son himself from among the dead. Therefore the Son says: “I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.” (John 11: 25, 26) Rather than human immortality, the resurrection of the dead is the true Christian hope for future life. This hope is that which sustains a Christian to undergo the most extreme hardships and to face violent death confidently and without flinching while he carries on as a witness in the service of Jehovah. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. —Eph. 4:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How is unity among brethren disrupted? By the failure of any to show the spirit of the Lord, which spirit must be in harmony with his written Word. The disturbers of the peace and unity of the brethren within the Theocratic organization are hateful to God. The practices of such disturbers are detestable to him. (Prov. 6:16-19) Whoever is haughty and thinks he is better than the rest of the company, such one the Lord hates. Properly, one should be common, normal, one of the group. Never try to be outstanding and to lift yourself (in your own estimation) above your brethren and then treat them from your conceited standpoint. Also the Lord hates a lying tongue, because he is the Father of truth. With his whole being, therefore, he hates a lie. His Word is unchangeable and to be depended upon.

<p><span class="font3">Ye </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">are my witnesses, saith Jehovah.-Isa. 43:10, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is true that Jehovah has never asked the “witnesses of Jehovah” to be his witnesses; he </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">commands </span><span class="font3">them to be such. Why so? Because Jehovah’s witnesses are composed of men and women who accept the Bible as the inspired Word of Jehovah God and who take it for what God says therein. Through that Word they hear no invitation to join any religious sect, great or small, but do hear Jehovah’s invitation to give themselves to Him in full surrender and consecration through the Redeemer Christ Jesus, who is “the way, and the truth, and the life”. Those truly Jehovah’s witnesses have acted on this divine invitation. They have wholly devoted themselves to the Most High God through the merit of Christ Jesus and have thereby entered into an abiding covenant of obedience to Him. Hence they are bound to do his will forever, and the Lord God commissions and commands them to do his will. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Thou, 0 Lord, art our father.—Isa. 63:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah is the great First Father, for he is the only Uncaused One and his name means “He causes to be”, for a purpose, of course. He is the Fountain-head of all life throughout the endless reaches of the universe. Upon this unique Life-giver depends the existence of every living creature in heaven and in earth. He is the Father of spirits. As the human body without the spirit is dead, so the creature that refuses to be subject to the Father of spirits must lose all life early or later. From everlasting to everlasting He is God, and he is The One Being. (Ps. 90:1,2) All others are creatures, with a start in existence more or less remote. None but He can truthfully say of himself, “I AM THAT I AM.” (Ex. 3:14) His only begotten Son is the “image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature”, and owns Jehovah as his Father. —Col. 1:15.

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah makes a Fighter out of the Lamb. The lamblikeness of this One, Jehovah well knew, was not a sign of weakness and fear, but was proof of courage and integrity even to the death under fire of the enemy. Therefore Jehovah called him to lead the most terrific fight in universal history. That One as a perfect, innocent, inoffensive man on earth died like a lamb, that he might enact the part of “the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world”. Because of this sacrifice of his human life for ever, God raised the Lamb from death to a new life, life in the spirit realm. God exalted him to the highest place ever accorded to a creature, Jehovah’s own right hand on the throne. It is with this new life, and in this exalted position, that the Lamb will wage the final war that ends all man-made wars and that vindicates the name and Godship of Jehovah.

<p><span class="font3">In the right order of things, the “Captain of their salvation” should be first among all the brethren of his. That is according to God’s rule as to His only begotten Son: “That in all things he might have the pre-eminence.” Hence before Christ Jesus there were no sons of God to be brought out from among men and unto heavenly glory. He being their Leader and Commander, he must be first and they must become sons of God after him and must follow his steps and follow the example he left. They must learn from him how to suffer in faithfulness and integrity toward Jehovah God in order to merit the heavenly prize. Then they would be worthy to share the glory above, into which their Captain was the first to be brought by Jehovah God.—Col. 1:18; 1 Pet. 2: 21.

<p><span class="font3">After Jesus’ anointing with the holy spirit of God the anointing of the bride company of Jesus’ followers must come not only from God but through Christ Jesus. This was as foretold by John the Baptist, who said: “He who sent me to immerse in water he said to me, ‘On whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and resting, this is he who immerses in holy spirit.’ ” (John 1:33, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott)</span><span class="font3"> On the day of Pentecost Peter explained to the perplexed onlookers that what they were observing was the baptism of the holy spirit of God upon the faithful followers of Christ Jesus. Peter said: “This Jesus . . . being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the holy [spirit], he hath shed forth this [spirit], which ye now see and hear.” (Acts 2:14-36) Peter thus acknowledged that God’s spirit or active force proceeded through Christ Jesus. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">That he has been given the truth and thereby been honored by the Lord with the privilege of being a witness for the Supreme Ruler, this fact is fundamentally a sufficient honor for him and upholds him in the way of God’s service. Religionists and allies may heap reproach and misrepresentation upon such humble servant of God and may thereby bring him low in the eyes of the deceived public and superpatriots. But this does not knock him out of the work as a witness of Jehovah God. In spite of the false evil-report and unfavorable public opinion and nasty opposition, the honor of being merely a servant of the true God and an ambassador of his enthroned King upholds the one who is humble in spirit. It keeps him from dropping out of the ranks of those who are following in Christ’s footsteps and marching toward the New World of righteousness.

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah God knew what the people needed more than anything else, and therefore he sent and commissioned his Son Jesus to deliver the Kingdom gospel to them. Christ Jesus knew what his Father’s will was in this regard. Hence when he appeared at the Nazareth synagogue amid those who had known him hitherto as a carpenter, the son of a carpenter, Jesus read his commission to preach from God’s Holy Scriptures. (Luke 4:16-21) He did not set aside Jehovah’s commission to him, but was one in mind with his Father on this matter and gladly complied with his Father’s will. Jesus set himself to his real life’s-work, which was uot merely to the highest good of humankind but primarily to the eternal glory of God and the vindication of Jehovah’s name.

<p><span class="font3">Nothing is closer to the affections of Jehovah than the kingdom of God, because of the righteous cause attached to it. For his own name’s sake he establishes it. Its chief service is to vindicate his name, clearing his name from all the besmirching reproach that the Devil and all this world have slung at it for centuries without interruption or hindrance. The Kingdom will purge the universe of all evildoers and will unite all creatures in one blissful and unbreakable unity with the Supreme Sovereign, the Almighty God. For this earth the Kingdom will usher in a new world of righteousness, and it will bring obedient men into the family of God and thereby into his universal organization. Moreover, the dearest member of God’s family is his appointed Representative in that Kingdom, namely, his beloved Son, Christ Jesus, who is a King after God’s own heart.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Matt. 22:11, Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The putting on of the wedding garment pictures the course of obedience toward God with due respect to Him and his kingdom and his calling one thereto. The wearing of the wedding garment of “righteous acts” pictures the wearer’s carrying out the terms of his anointing or commission from God. He acts as a faithful witness of Jehovah and announces his Kingdom by Christ Jesus, and so identifies himself as unqualifiedly devoted to Jehovah and to his King and Theocracy. Failure now to wear the garment means a breaking of one’s integrity. It signifies a refusal to carry out the terms of the commission or anointing to represent and publicize the Kingdom in obedience to Theocratic instructions from Jehovah the King. It means a refusal to be identified with his kingdom, because of the reproaches that such brings. IT </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah God is approaching the grand climax of his “strange work”, which work precedes the battle of Armageddon. The not distant future, into which the postwar road leads, will witness the end of a work that he will never repeat. Its end will also spell the end of man’s global organization which fails to favor the strange work of God. Such disaster upon man’s boasted self-rule of the globe will come by the direct action of Almighty God. In ancient time Mount Perazim and the valley of Gibeon were sites of his strange or spectacular doings. Armageddon, to which all the nations are now gathered, will shortly mark his strangest of acts, of which his former acts at Gibeon were mere typical samples.

<p><span class="font3">The organization of consecrated ones whom God charges with the work of preaching the Kingdom must be and is Theocratic. The Kingdom is Theocratic in that it is of God and he rules it, and Christ Jesus his King and Chief Servant is subject to Almighty God and acts according to God’s will. God’s commandment for his King is that he should rule now amidst his enemies and see to it that the good news of the Kingdom is first preached world-wide. After this “strange work” the King Christ Jesus must destroy all creatures and organizations that hate and oppose the Kingdom in the battle of Armageddon. Consequently, the organization on earth of Kingdom announcers must be Theocratic ; otherwise God cannot use them.

They do this by fully consecrating or devoting themselves to the Founder of the Government, Jehovah God. They do so in the name and good offices of his King Christ Jesus; for only by his King do they have any avenue of approach to Jehovah, the great Theocratic Ruler. It is thenceforth binding upon them to pay their vows of consecration to Him by giving him their prime obedience and putting Him above the political states under which they live at present. Whereas their complete dedication of themselves to Jehovah as the one Universal Ruler does not make them a part of the “people for his name”, they do have a large part in now declaring and magnifying His name before it is vindicated in the final war of Armageddon. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah God is not building two organizations today, with two different works; but the “stranger” class must subject themselves to the one Theocratic organization. This being so, it is their duty and privilege to join with the remnant in the same work of proclaiming publicly and from house to house that “the kingdom of heaven is at hand”. Their appointed service now is no different from that of the remnant. (Rev. 22:17) And it is in this respect that the Theocratic law of “one ordinance” applies. Since now the Theocratic Kingdom has been set up and Jehovah’s King is gathering to his temple of worship all his “other sheep” before the tribulation of Armageddon, it is incumbent upon such gathered “other sheep” to obey the “one ordinance”, namely, to ‘preach this gospel of the Kingdom in all the world for a witness to all nations’.—Matt. 24:14.

<p><span class="font3">Since the spirit is no person and has no personal name as such, the “name” of the holy spirit refers to the service or function it performs. That service is the carrying out of God’s will. To be baptized into the name of the holy spirit means, then, that the one symbolizing his consecration by water immersion has dedicated himself to live, serve and act in harmony and in unity with the holy spirit of the heavenly Father, knowing that it is of God and by his Son. The baptized one will seek to observe the spirit’s operations as the Father makes them plain to him. He will ask the Father for more of this spirit, and will seek to be filled with it, that thereby he may be enabled to do God’s will. He will diligently study God’s Word daily, because through that Word also the spirit of God operates and because His will is revealed through that same Word.—Luke 11:13; John 6:63.

In wisdom they have severed their connections with religion and the selfish organizations of this world, and have dedicated themselves to the Lord God through faith in Christ Jesus. In view of their vows to God they are under the obligation to do his will. What is his will? It is to preach the good purposes of Jehovah God, and to do so in the way that his Son set the example. They therefore realize that they have a commission from the Most High God to be preachers of the gospel. Therefore they do not let the world-wide propaganda, slogans and appeals of this world draw or turn them aside from their vocation or calling. Diligently they do this one thing, preach.

He has arisen upon them. His glory is reflected upon them by Christ Jesus the Head of the capital organization, and hence the enlightened remnant are the ones commanded to arise and shine with God’s light of truth and freedom. He has vastly bettered their earthly condition as gold is better than brass. He appoints the oversight of such remnant to Peace and Prosperity, and the setting of their organization tasks to Righteousness.

<p><span class="font3">That such prophetic scripture applied to Jesus and was fulfilled in him is shown by the apostle’s quotation of it, at Matthew 12:15-21, as fitting Jesus: “Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him,” etc. His enemies challenged his being “The chosen of God”. Nevertheless, he is the one whom Jehovah, the Builder of His capital organization Zion, has chosen and laid as the foundation member of it, saying : “Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect [chosen], precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.” Those who would be united with him in the capital organization Zion must come to Christ Jesus: “Coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen [elect] of God.” —Luke 23:35; 1 Pet. 2:4,6; Isa. 28:16.

<p><span class="font3">God accepting their consecrations and justifying them from their sins through the sacrificial merit of Jesus, he accepted them for sacrifice with their Head and Leader. As Jesus died the death of faithfulness for the vindication of Jehovah’s name, so these too must be “faithful unto death”. In that behalf Jehovah God baptized them into the “body of Christ”, to be his body-members and to follow him in integrity and service toward God down to the very death, by whatever means it came. For no other end, therefore, were these Christians baptized into him than for eventual death in faithfulness, to be “dead ones”. Thus they were baptized for the dead, not, of course, in the expectation of remaining dead for eternity, but in the hope of being raised from the dead as Christ Jesus was raised from death.

But just as surely as the witnesses of Jehovah have consecrated their all unreservedly to Almighty God and must follow the example of their Leader, “The Faithful and True Witness,” just so surely it is mandatory upon them to be Christlike witnesses of Jehovah God and there is no escaping the obligation. It betrays religious ignorance to say that Jehovah’s witnesses are not old enough in existence to have Bible prophecies fulfilled upon them. Over seven centuries before Christ, God’s word went forth through Isaiah, saying, “Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord [Jehovah], and my servant whom I have chosen”; showing that Jehovah’s witnesses existed back there, even before Rome was founded in 753 B.C.—Isa. 43:10.

Not at all. In view of his own departure and the length of time ahead, Jesus laid the foundation for a body of gospel proclaimers whose ministry would extend over the entire interval of time and would never let the preaching fail until The Theocracy should come. Hence he chose and educated twelve apostles to pursue the same vocation as he did. They must so appreciate it as of the greatest consequence and moment that they would never neglect it or push it into a secondary place or turn away from it.

The multitude of “men of good-will” who devote themselves to God through Christ may be assured that Christ also died for their sins according to the Scriptures. His death was primarily because of his unbreakable integrity toward God and his flat refusal to compromise with God’s enemies and their religion. Though able to call to his rescue twelve legions of angels against those who had come out to get his life, he submitted to the ordeal of a violent death, because it served the purposes of Jehovah God: first, to prove God’s universal sovereignty or domination as obeyed and adhered to unswervingly by his Chief Servant, Christ Jesus; and, second, to provide a ransom sacrifice for the redemption of believing sinners.

<p><span class="font3">Those begotten of God are confirmed or guaranteed unto Christ as being members of his “body” or his church by being anointed with the spirit of God. By being begotten and anointed with God’s spirit or active force, the consecrated one is baptized as a “new creature” into the body of Christ and becomes one of those espoused to him as the great Bridegroom. Such baptism of the spirit is common to or is jointly shared by all the members of the body, regardless of the different offices which they fill in the body. Hence it is “one baptism”, just as there is one common faith and one common hope of their calling, and one common Head over the whole body, namely, Christ Jesus. For God, who gives the holy spirit, “gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body.” —Eph. 1: 22, 23. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">8/1</span></p>

When religion or demonism causes political legislators and governors to make laws and decrees against Jehovah’s consecrated people and their God-ordained work and worship of Him, then Jehovah’s witnesses keep on doing His righteousness and fight for the God-given freedom to worship and serve Him.

(Eph. 4: 25-27) The man with knowledge of God’s Word should not let words fly loosely, and in a torrent, especially when perturbed. If, with knowledge, he has understanding of his relationship with God and of his proper place in the Theocratic organization, he will not let the heat of anger or vexation overpower him. He will endeavor to keep cool and balanced in thought. With such a spirit or disposition and frame of mind he can excel or master the conditions, the set of circumstances that would drive the foolish person into sin.

<p><span class="font3">We have come to the “fulness of times”. Hence the season has arrived for the “dispensation” or administration of human affairs by his King of the New World. For there to be a unified New World there must be one ruler over all humankind, and that one himself in perfect unity with the great Builder of the New World, Jehovah God. The one ruler whom the Creator has appointed and raised up for the rule of the undivided world is his obedient and faithful Son, Christ Jesus, whose unity with the Father was held fast even to the Son’s martyrdom on the tree. It is of highest importance for us to know this. We today arc living when times long in arriving are converging upon us, and those times were appointed by Jehovah, the God of purpose. Men and their organizations try to change His times and seasons, but fixed and unmovable these stand. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Paul thus well stated the position of Jehovah’s witnesses in this twentieth century. He himself was one of that long line of witnesses starting with Abel. Since 1918 the testimony that has been given by this hated and persecuted minority has resulted in a dividing of the people, for and against. To the sanctimonious religionists it has been like a putrid stink in their nostrils. Although the religionists pit their vast strength against it, the testimony so offensive to them continues to be delivered. The great God, who sends this testimony, which is good news to all those of good-will, bears his witnesses up in his everlasting arms and gives them triumph after triumph over the strongholds of religion and demonism. Like Paul, these can give thanks to God. IV </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The march out of modern Egypt is under way. Jehovah’s witnesses and the multitude of their companions are marching in freedom to the Red sea of Armageddon. Their troubles at the hands of Pharaoh Satan and his modern Egyptians are not ended, but Satan and all his hordes of religious intolerance and other forms of persecution are in hot pursuit, like Pharaoh’s chariots and horsemen of war. Now Jehovah’s cloud of his presence and power has gotten in between and holds them off from overwhelming his delivered people until his “strange work” by them is done in this world. The “Red sea” will rid Jehovah’s people for ever of demon and human pursuers. Jehovah bids us to be unmurmuring and uncomplaining and to have faith.

In meekness he will accept God’s reproofs through her, knowing that such a course tends to life. (Prov. 29:15) He will pray for her peace and prosperity. He will not slander or speak against her other sons. (Pss. 122:6-8; 50:20) He will safeguard the interests of the organization, being on constant guard against giving out any information that would betray the organization and expose it to danger from the enemies of “Jerusalem which is above”.

This divine judgment not only bespoke the destruction of any world organization that Satan the Devil might set up; it did more. It gave promise of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">rebirth</span><span class="font3"> of a righteous world, to displace that wicked world which Satan would extend over the earth. The Lord fitly used the figure of human birth, by speaking of a seed of “the woman”, to picture the bringing forth of the means or agency that He would use to crush the Devil’s world organization, head and all. God’s decree was that sin, and its organization, shall not forever inhabit the living creation. In due time He would bring forth out of his “woman” or holy organization His servant to destroy all willful sinners and the effects of sin.

<p><span class="font3">The religionists of modern “Christendom”, in giving themselves over to eating, drinking, marriages, and material and commercial pursuits, rather than to God’s kingdom now established, betray that they are just as ignorant of God as were the religionists in the days of Noah before the flood came and destroyed them all. Mingling with such company for diversion and enjoyment is certain to corrupt one’s belief and Christian course. It throws one off guard, so that the day of the Lord’s final reckoning with this world comes upon one like a snare. (Luke 21.- 34-36) Let no true Christian be deceived as to the dire outcome of such companionships. “Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned ?

<p><span class="font3">The spirit of God coming upon his respective servants enabled them to do exploits worthy of mention. When the tabernacle for Jehovah’s worship was ordered to be built in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, God called the man named Bezaleel for the work and said the above. God assigned to him a companion worker, Aholiab, and to these two and all their corps of assistants Almighty God gave wisdom and ingenuity to prepare all the things for the tabernacle according to the pattern that Jehovah gave to Moses in the mount. These two men especially were made able by God’s spirit to teach others who devotedly engaged in His service. Later David made great preparations to have the temple of Jehovah built at Jerusalem. The pattern of the work which he turned over to his son and successor to follow was by inspiration. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">6/15</span></p>

Religious clergymen, who seek a good standing with this world and its politicians and moneyed merchandisers, could not be qualified and competent for such unselfish service and its reproaches and sufferings, and are not. “For,” continues the apostle, “we are not as many, which corrupt [which deal deceitfully with] the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.”—2 Cor. 2:17; marginal reading. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">What is more foolish than to pursue things of this world and frantically to strive to spare them from destruction at Armageddon? During the final century before the great global flood, which was the more practical and wiser course ? That of the people who simply ate, drank, married, bought, and sold? or that of Noah? What did Noah do? Most religionists think of Noah as only a boatbuilder. But the apostle says of him that God “spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly”. Through Noah’s preaching, seven other persons joined him in the boat. These were the only humans that gained salvation during that world catastrophe. Yet the whole world of the ungodly that then was called Noah a fool, unrealistic and unpractical, and scoffed at his preaching.

<p><span class="font3">Satan, the god of this world, is the god of mammon. Mammon, or money, is the symbol of selfishness and of that upon which one centers his selfish interest and affection. At this end of the world it calls for the highest confidence in the Lord not to make material things the chief objective on one’s program but to keep on giving one’s chief thought and attention to serving God and his Theocracy. We cannot divide ourselves between both pursuits. We cannot be conformed to this world and seek after the things it worries about, without shoving God’s kingdom into the background as of less value than self. There are only the two masters; and where these masters do not even co-operate, but are at deadly enmity with each other, we cannot love and serve both at the same time and receive reward from both.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">As</span><span class="font3"> the one who offered himself for sacrifice as the “Lamb of God”, Jesus was foreshadowed by the Jewish nation’s first high priest, namely, Aaron, Moses’ brother. But as the royal One who fights against all opposers of Jehovah’s universal sovereignty and whips them at the battle of Armageddon, he was prefigured by that priest upon a royal throne, Melchizedek, the king of Salem. He did not self-conceitedly assume to grab either of these offices for himself, but waited upon Jehovah’s call and responded to it. When the perfect man Jesus was baptized and God’s spirit descended upon him, he was begotten of the spirit and God’s voice from heaven announced that this spirit-begotten One was His Son. There, at his begetting by the spirit to be a spiritual Son of God, the call applied to Jesus to be the great High Priest of God and he was chosen for that office.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Even now are there many antichrists.—1 John 2:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If one who has been anointed proves unfaithful and goes out from the congregation of the anointed, he becomes an antichrist. His going out does not prove he is right, and that those whom he leaves behind are in the wrong and do not have the truth. God’s spirit, which came with their anointing and which abides in them, illuminates them and assures them that they have the truth. But the unfaithful anointed one is cast out of the “body” or Theocratic organization by Christ Jesus the Head. God’s spirit does not abide in that unfaithful one and he does not abide in Christ but goes into the darkness of untruth and error. Such one is therefore an antichrist. The faithful ones from whom he is cut off and disconnected are not antichrists, but abide in Christ. Jesus foretold that in the “last time”, at the end of this world, where we are now, the “evil servant” class would be such an antichrist.—Matt. 24: 48-51.

<p><span class="font3">This in no way pictures that a cleavage takes place in Jehovah’s universal organization, to produce disunity and a kingdom divided against itself. To the contrary, the cleavage pictures the birth of the new Theocratic Government under Christ Jesus. This is also pictured in Daniel’s prophecy as the ‘cutting of the stone out of the mountain without the use of human hands or powers’, and which stone also destroys the entire Devil’s organization from the universe and becomes a great mountain and fills the whole earth. The cutting out of that symbolic stone, and the cleaving of the symbolic Mount of Olives with half of it moving to the north, took place in 1914.

<p><span class="font3">Jesus’ being born thus as a human Son of God was not for earthly glory. Jesus was made flesh primarily to suffer therein at the hands of Satan and his wicked servants. Why? To prove that his integrity toward Jehovah God was unbreakable under the most diabolical persecution and thereby prove that Satan the Devil is a liar and so vindicate God’s name and universal rulership. His human death as a martyr also served to provide a ransom sacrifice in behalf of every man and woman that accepts him as Savior and obeys him. (Heb. 5: 8, 9) Jesus’ being a fleshly human creature was meant to be only temporary; for the sufferings in the flesh must be the path he must tread to heavenly glory.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations. —Matt. 28:19, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That means teaching the people of all nations, with the result that Jehovah the Father will draw some of them to Christ and these will deny themselves and undertake to follow his steps as his disciples. “Make disciples” denotes no compulsion or governmental and political pressure at all. Men can win disciples to follow them, but they cannot manufacture such for Christ. (John 6: 44, 45) The Father does not compel, but draws men into discipleship. So it must be. (Matt. 16: 24-26) This fact makes it impossible that true disciples of Christ should try to stir up a world revolution or try to set themselves up as a man-made global theocracy to act as spiritual adviser to political governments underneath. Such a human theocracy ean not save human souls, for it cannot save even the soul of the one attempting such a global theocracy; but, instead, he loses his own soul.

<p><span class="font3">For any organization on earth to be approved of the Most High God and to be usable for him to do his work of preaching “this gospel of the kingdom” that organization must be Theocratic. That is to say, it must be built according to the Bible truth that Jehovah God is the Supreme Ruler and that, under Him, Christ Jesus is his appointed Head of the congregation. Jehovah’s witnesses are members of his Theocratic organization, but they are not The Theocracy and are not trying to set up a Theocracy. The Theocracy is Jehovah’s kingdom by Christ Jesus; and they are simply announcers of it as its visible representatives and ambassadors. Jesus is no exception to the Theocratic rule that Jehovah is supreme and runs his organization absolutely according to His will. Jesus is Jehovah’s Chief Servant and is the Head Servant of Jehovah’s company of witnesses. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Jesus Christ’s resurrection from death is a proof of more than of his having kept integrity toward God unto the death and of having shown worthiness of life immortal as the Vindicator of Jehovah’s name and Word. His being raised out of death is a guarantee of a resurrection to come of others who are dead in the tombs. It guarantees that man’s terrible enemy death shall be destroyed, its companion, the grave, also being blotted out. Hence both resurrection facts are inseparably tied together, so that if the one is true, the other is also; if the one is denied, the other is also denied at the same time. To deny that Almighty God raised up Jesus from hell, the grave, would mean to deny his power to do so; but more: it would deny his purpose to raise others by Jesus Christ. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

Never checking himself to look ahead to what may be the outcome of unbridled speech or conduct, the hasty one acts the way he is disposed to under the unsettling conditions and persists in doing what is unwise. Thus he exalts or carries away folly, and is sure to abound in transgressions. “An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression.” (29:22) The best remedy for such a disposition is the discipline and counsel of the great Lord and Ruler.

Yet that is not saying that the entire congregation is constituted to sit as a court before which cases of sin among the brethren against one another are to be submitted for final adjustment. Theocratic rule should be observed in the congregation. God’s organization of his people is Theocratic. The laws thereof come from himself, Jehovah, the Supreme One. They do not draw their strength and validness from the voice or vote of the congregation and are not applied because of the consent of the governed. “For Jehovah is our judge, Jehovah is our lawgiver.”—Isa. 33: 22, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.

Hence when the King by his Son at the temple puts the question as to their irregular appearance before Jehovah, Christ Jesus and the angels, this class is muzzled, having no alibi. The Kingdom opportunities to act as Jehovah’s witnesses and to prove love and devotion to The Theocracy by keeping their integrity to God under revilings and persecutions by this world are all about them and free to them. But they refuse to don the garment of identification and to be like the Kingdom heirs, Jehovah’s faithful active witnesses.

Yet he need not worry and hesitate to go forth into the field preaching “this gospel of the kingdom”, as Paul did, who was not ordained by any man.

Because there the Son became spiritual, being begotten of God’s spirit to hope of life in the spirit and being audibly confessed by God as His Son.

<p><span class="font3">Political governments yielding to religion seek to encroach upon the inalienable right of “strangers”. Mainly, that right is to worship God freely according to His law and the dictates of their enlightened conscience. Hence the attempt to take away their right assumes the form of putting the political-religious state above God and then punishing the “strangers and pilgrims”; for what ? For abiding by His law and thus failing to obey unrighteous laws of men mischievously framed against those in whom no fault can be found except that they obey God first. Obedience to God is man’s most vital right. By exercise of this right man carries on his worship of the Supreme One, Jehovah. That is Theocratic obedience and worship, for that which is Theocratic looks up to Him as Most High and as the Almighty One who rules above all his universe, including this earth and man upon it. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In his present glorified capacity in heaven Jesus is Jehovah’s servant and wields the sword of execution against the disobedient ones refusing to be subject to the Most High God Jehovah, Although a Servant, Christ Jesus is one of the Higher Powers or Authorities with Jehovah God. Hence the apostle warns the disciples, as above. In the Theocratic organization the true followers of Christ Jesus are his servants. They cannot be the servants of religious clergymen nor of political rulers who fight against Jehovah and his royal Theocracy, the Kingdom. Jesus said: “If any one serve </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[diakoneiri]</span><span class="font3"> me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall my servant </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[didkonos] be.”</span><span class="font3"> (John 12:26, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.</span><span class="font3">) His apostles referred to themselves as servants and used the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">didkonos.</span><span class="font3"> W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added.—Matt. 6:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus was not going in for a second-rate thing when he made the Kingdom his exclusive business. He recommended it to others who wanted to be on the right side, the winning side of the issue, and to serve the true God, and thereby to gain eternal life to praise and honor him forever. The seeker first of the Kingdom redeems the time by studying The Book, which tells all about The Theocratic Government and its mysteries, righteous purposes and everlasting blessings. Then he gives his supreme allegiance to that Government and endeavors to live in harmony with its purposes. He lets the world and its politics and struggle for world domination go their way. While yet obliged to be in this world, he sees carefully to it that he does not let himself become part of it. He touches not the unclean thing, and watches to “keep himself unspotted from the world”. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

It is for the education of the entire organization, that all the members of it may do the divine will in unity and harmony. The Head of that servant organization is God’s Chief Servant, Christ Jesus, and in teaching his visible organization on earth Jehovah associates this beloved Son with Him. A servant of Jehovah today must look to His organization to learn His will. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Removal of God’s spirit from King Saul left only room for a contrary spirit to control him. God sent an evil spirit upon him indirectly, in that he gave him no encouragement and His dealings with the anointed David stirred up in Saul the spirit of jealousy, bitterness, despondency and fear for his kingship and royal line. Hence God was not responsible for Saul’s wicked attempts to kill David. As for David, he was a changed man from the day of the coming of God’s spirit upon him after his anointing. It was with that divine spirit upon him that he went out single-handed to take up Goliath’s challenge and defiance of Jehovah. It was by the spirit of Jehovah that David succeeded in making the lumbering giant bite the dust. “The battle is Jehovah’s,” David shouted out.-l Sam. 17:40-54. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span></p>

It was a serious matter for them, one of either life or death. They could not afford to let their consciences be overridden by the political powers of the land. Nor was it for the political power as judge, advised by the religious counselors, to determine whether the worship of Jehovah was right. That would be letting man’s mere opinion decide whether to deny them freedom of worship while at the same time granting freedom of religion to his priests and their dupes. Pharaoh was confronted with no mere human law and demand, but with the Most High God’s. Hence it was the right and wise thing for the state to bend to Jehovah’s demand. Let nations today take note.

<p><span class="font3">Prior to the baptism of Jehovah’s only begotten Son while on earth as a man, God’s spirit or active force acted upon earthly creatures to cause them to speak, do, see or move according to the divine will; and its power was irresistible even to God’s enemies. Beginning with Jesus, the same spirit or active force of Almighty God has been used to beget consecrated men and women to a heavenly inheritance; and these have been anointed by his spirit to commission them to His service and to enlighten them on the truths of His Word as due to be understood. At this end of the world, when just a remnant of those begotten of God as sons unto heavenly glory are yet on earth, the same spirit has operated toward men of good-will, whom the Good Shepherd Christ Jesus is now gathering to the side of God’s kingdom.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Eccl. 10:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A remnant of earth’s population have shown a spirit opposite to that of the nations. They have heeded the above wise counsel of Jehovah’s Word. They are those in the service of the Most High Ruler, these having consecrated themselves wholly to his sacred service. They have thus devoted themselves to the interests of His kingdom through the worthiness and good offices of the Ruler’s Son, Christ Jesus, The Prince of Peace. On that basis the Ruler has received them and given them a place in his service. Their assigned duty is that of declaring the name of the Universal Ruler and publishing the good news of his kingdom and rule by his Son Christ Jesus. Faithfulness on the remnant’s part in the performance of their appointed service causes the Ruler to show a favorable spirit toward them.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God.—Mark 1:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah is the Sender of the gospel. He makes the gospel; for he is the Creator of the facts that provide the good news, and which facts he causes to be recorded and understood. At his own appointed time he sends forth the gospel. To this end he chooses, ordains and sends out the publishers of the gospel. No work, life’s occupation or career could be greater and more essential than that of preaching the Kingdom gospel. Why ? Because no job or calling could be higher and more vital and beneficial than that pursued by the Chief Servant of the Most High God, namely, his Son Christ Jesus. It was only on the one day, Nisan 14 of A.D. 33, that he hung upon the tree and died; but what was he doing during the years between then and his baptism by John the Baptist? He was acting as a publisher of Jehovah’s Theocracy. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">At assemblies of Jehovah’s Theocratic organization those of the “stranger” class have the right and privilege to offer prayer to Him, and also to conduct meetings for Bible study and for service preparations, even with members of the spiritual remnant being present. The adding, of these “stranger” servants to the Theocratic organization was foretold in the words above to the restored anointed remnant. Likewise, the consecrated “stranger” can perform baptisms in water of those who want to symbolize their consecration to God; just as John the baptist, who was not begotten or anointed of God’s spirit, was privileged to immerse in water both Jesus himself and also many of Jesus’ disciples.—John 1:29-37.

<p><span class="font3">The united cleaving to Christ is aided by having a unity of faith and understanding, instead of having sectarianism with a so-called “federal council” or an “international conference” of sects as a binder. The binding tie between true disciples is strengthened by having a similarity of work, no matter in what land they may reside, all engaging in that one and the same work in an organized manner, co-operating with one another in Christ Jesus. He is the necessary unifying Head. Whatever organization exists on earth for carrying out God’s commandments must be subject to Christ Jesus as Head. It must operate in strict harmony with his instructions through the Bible. The Lord God is the One who through Christ builds this organization, for it is He who draws the disciples to Christ. This visible organization, instead of being The Theocracy, is subject to Theocratic law and is composed of those who are ambassadors for it.

<p><span class="font3">Christ Jesus the King leads his footstep followers against religion. By spreading abroad everywhere the truths of the Bible concerning Jehovah’s name and his kingdom under Christ they are diffusing, displaying and making manifest everywhere the sweet fragrance of the knowledge of the gracious God, whose truth makes us free from religion and its bondage. These educators in truth and righteousness care not at all what the stinky goats of opposition may say in condemnation of the educational campaign. Jehovah’s witnesses march triumphantly along in His service, announcing the line of march of His victorious King.

Majestically, without the least excitement or hurry at what this world and its prince do, he moves forward unhalted to the supreme event, the vindication of his name and the complete world regeneration. The first requirement is the establishment of the heavenly Government of the Seed of his “woman”. It is the kingdom of heaven, with persons on the throne of uncorruptible integrity toward God. Their integrity must be tested and proved. Such testing could be done only in the midst of the world of which Satan the Devil is the god.

Then it became public, world-wide, before Gentile nations and their rulers, that this remnant were the “people for his name”.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 15:21, Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Scriptures prove that many at death have perished, because they have gone down into destruction from which no recovery is possible. True it is that by Adam’s sin death passed upon all men descending from him, but not “second death”, which is the death of destruction in gehenna. Hence those having only the inheritance of death that was unavoidable through Adam would be redeemable or be in line for a resurrection out of death. Those whose inherited condemnation to death had been added to by willful wickedness that brings the divine judgment of destruction have more than an inheritance from the first man. They go to gehenna, and are not among ‘all those that are in their graves’ and that ‘shall hear the voice of the Son of God and come forth’ to resurrection. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Christ Jesus did not glorify himself and seek to exalt himself, but was called to his high position as Aaron was called to the priesthood. Jehovah God is the One who does the calling to the Kingdom. He does so according to His purpose. (Rom. 8:28) No one hearing the good news from Him could assume to determine for himself that he will be in the heavenly capital organization with Christ Jesus. It is not for the one hearing the good news to purpose the high calling for himself, but it is God who must make choice from among the many millions who hear. For that reason, whoever makes a consecration or complete dedication of himself to God does not do so on the condition of receiving the heavenly prize in Zion. He does so simply to do God’s will and to be subject to God’s placing of him in God’s final arrangement of all creatures that live eternally. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">These recognize the throne of God, that is, His kingdom. They unitedly serve in his temple, which is a ‘house of prayer for all nations’. To Jehovah God and his Lamb, the Prince of Peace, they give the credit for salvation, and not to worldly rulers and their symbols and emblems. They do not let themselves be divided and set at odds with one another because of the fact that they have come out of all nations, kindreds, people and tongues. The unifying power in their lives is their attachment to the Throne, the kingdom of God. Like the remnant of whom they are the companions, these persons of earthly hopes now seek to live for the New World.

<p><span class="font3">Jesus’ faithfulness to death and his resurrection out of death were a plaguing blow to antitypical Pharaoh, Satan the Devil. Jesus kept his perfect integrity toward God even to the putting off from himself his earthly life. Thereby he gained the victory over the demon principalities and powers of Satan as well as over their official representatives upon earth, all of whom were trying to force Jesus into a fracture of his integrity. But by his perfection of obedience to God he triumphed over all the enemy powers of this world. He stripped them of all false charges against him and of all their boasts of being “the higher powers” superior to Jehovah. Along with that, Jesus triumphed over all the religious forces.

<p><span class="font3">At Pentecost Christ’s disciples were “baptized for the dead” by being baptized into Christ, the spirit of God then being poured out upon them and anointing them as body-members. If there were no resurrection out of death at the time of the establishment of the Kingdom, what would be the sense of their being so baptized? A Christian may be sincere in saying, ‘Well, even if there were nothing more to it than just this earthly life, the privilege and joy of serving God is so great and blessed that I would be satisfied with just this.’ But Paul says: “If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.” (1 Cor. 15:19) This shows God’s Word is written expressly for us to entertain the hope of resurrection as a comforting and staying power in life.

They accept small contributions freely given by persons who accept the valuable books, booklets and magazines that make plain God’s Word; but such is not trafficking or adulterating his Word. The money contribution is to the work and its expense that the Bible explanations may be spread abroad to still others. Because they tell the pure and simple Bible truth in all sincerity as Christians and continually study to clear away all the religious traditions from all Bible instruction, Jehovah’s witnesses are hated, boycotted, discriminated against and suppressed.

<p><span class="font3">This means to appoint those who are recognized as being elders spiritually to certain essential services within the congregation. It does not mean creating elders by vote or appointment. It shows that those whose mature fruits of word, doctrine and conduct prove them to be elders or mature ones in a spiritual way are the ones qualified to be clothed upon with responsibilities of service. Hence these elders are the ones whom the apostle says to appoint to places of service in the Christian congregation. The rule was that those who were to be appointed to be overseers </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(episkopos)</span><span class="font3"> over the flock of God were required to be elders, and this appointment must be made with or under the spirit of God.

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s truth concerning His purposes and man’s destiny differs radically from all religion. Sacred truth is not a religion. In no way can this be better seen than by comparing the truth with the teachings of religion. “Thy word is true from the beginning,” said the adoring psalmist to Jehovah God. Centuries later the One of whom the psalmist was a prototype added: “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.” (Ps. 119:160; John 17:17) Therefore it is certain that the Holy Bible is not a book of religion. It has nothing in common with religion, although religion has all along endeavored to mix some of the Bible with itself in order to take on an appearance of truth.

Almighty God will see to it that the time is sufficient and that publishers sufficient are there. The question is, Who will have a part in the fulfillment of Jesus’ prophecy with all the blessedness it means for the ones taking part therein ? Will it include you and us ? It will, if we appreciate the opportunity and discharge our obligations to God according to our complete consecrations of ourselves to Him. These words by his Son Jesus are not simply a prophecy of what is to be, but are also a command. God’s mere statement as to what work is to be done at a certain time constitutes or stands as a command to those who are at that specified time serving him. Those who are faithful to him at that time will not want the prophecy’s fulfillment to get away from them, leaving them without a privileged part therein.

<p><span class="font3">His spirit, which Jesus commended to God, was his life-force or power of life. That power returned to God, who gave it to Jesus; and God alone could restore it to his dead Son. God did so when he raised him from the death-state and restored him to life as a living soul. The great Life-giver Jehovah safely kept that which Jesus commended to him, because Jesus died in blameless integrity toward God and did not forfeit his right to everlasting life. The enemies were able by God’s permission to kill the body, yet they could not destroy Jesus’ right to life as a living soul and they could not obstruct God’s power to resurrect Christ Jesus to life as a living soul. On the third day Christ Jesus came into existence again as a living soul by God’s resurrecting of his Son from the dead. Thus the Scriptures make a distinction between </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">soul</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">spirit.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things. But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.—Luke 12:30,31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Kingdom must be first on our hearts, and we should apply ourselves unselfishly to serving its interests. God, who offers the heavenly honor, is also the Father, and will not fail to provide our basic needs while we concentrate on that which is of most importance. It is a test upon our faith, zeal and appreciation for us to let food, clothing, comforts and home have the secondary place in our lives and to specialize upon the higher interests and to seek them first. Jesus reminds us that “the workman is worthy of his meat”, and “the labourer is worthy of his hire”. If the heavenly Father feeds and clothes the wild beasts and fowls and herbs of the field, it is unreasonable and also faithless to think that he would not shelter, feed and clothe faithful workmen who colabor with God.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I will make of thee a great nation, . . . and I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.—Gen. 12:2,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God’s promise or covenant to Abraham foretold that Jehovah would bring forth a Seed which would become a Government or “nation”, and by which Seed Jehovah would make his own name great and would be the Sender of great blessings. The receivers of such would be creatures on earth who blessed or praised the name of God the Greater Abraham; whereas those who cursed Jehovah’s name would receive the divine curse, meaning everlasting destruction. Even though Satan the Devil should cause the vast majority of humankind to curse Jehovah’s name and suffer destruction, yet there would be representatives of all families or tribes of the earth that would prove worthy of blessing. Abraham showed belief in this promise by clearing out of Babylon. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">There came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.—Mark 1:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was as a spiritual Son, and not as a human Son, that God testified concerning Jesus by the voice from heaven. Jesus’ baptism in water was to symbolize his consecration to God to do his Father’s will, and God’s will was that Jesus should suffer to the death in proof of his faithfulness to God and that thereafter he should live as a spirit creature in heavenly glory. Thus Jesus, with God’s will definitely set before him and with a heavenly calling and hope of life, now had God’s spirit resting upon him and was a new creature, a spiritual son of God. This was the first time such a thing ever occurred on earth. It illustrates how Jesus’ followers may become sons of God whom the heavenly Father brings to celestial glory. Spiritual sons they become, because no human parent has anything to do with the matter. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.—1 Cor. 5:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Israelites remained indoors under the blood, so signifying they were obedient to Jehovah as the true God and were also trusting in the blood of the unblemished lamb, the sacrifice approved of God. Such obedient action pictured faith in Christ’s shed blood as the means to spare one from God’s wrath and from the execution of death at the hands of his Executioner. Today such faith in Christ’s blood, followed up by a complete consecration of ourselves to God to be one of his redeemed people, frees us from the obligation to justify ourselves before God by our own merit and works of righteousness. Despite all our works toward self-righteousness, our consciences would accuse us as under God’s wrath still and subject to condemnation due to inborn sin. Faith in the blood as the atonement does bring justification to the consecrated and makes them alive to righteousness. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Having blotted out the bond written in ordinances . . . nailing it to the cross.—Col. 2:14, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thereafter the religious clergy could no longer judge his disciples upon the basis of the law covenant. They could not make it a requirement to the salvation of Jesus’ disciples, requiring these to live as natural Jews according to the handwriting or bond of ordinances with its obligations. Christ Jesus has nailed such to his tree and has made his disciples free. They must not care for the judgment of the religionists, nor permit such to drag them back into the keeping of the formalities of the typical law covenant and making a religion of such, thereby giving up their Christian liberty. The religious clergy have been plagued to death as far as true Christians are concerned; and the apostles of Christ Jesus declared their liberty from such </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">dead</span><span class="font3"> ones, when they said to the Jewish clergy: “We ought to obey God rather than men.” W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The faithful remnant in 1918 prayed to be cleansed from their sin of inactivity respecting their anointing, and from the uncleanness of fear of the combined enemies. The Lord God responded to their supplications by Christ Jesus at the temple. The largest assembly of spirit-begotten anointed Christians was arranged for for the summer of 1919. Just prior thereto the Lord God, by His spirit, caused the unclean spirit of fear to be cleansed away from his faithful remnant by the truths published in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font3"> in the article “Blessed Are the Fearless”. At the assembly the keynote speech by the president of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font3"> publishers was this very theme. As a result the life-giving, actuating spirit of Jehovah’s fearless service began to be poured out upon his faithful remnant, to fulfill Joel 2: 28, 29.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. But now is Christ risen from the dead.—1 Cor. 15:19,20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Reasonably the apostle Paul concludes that if there be no resurrection out of death, then his dead brethren are perished, and he and his living brethren, who suffer the assaults of Satan and his demons, are “of all men most miserable”. But the faithful Christians, who endure the miserable time that Satan and his seed try to make for them and who endure it with blameless integrity toward God, have more than hope only in this life. They have hope of future life beyond the power of these demons to molest, not by reason of inherent immortality of soul, but by the power of God to raise them out of death. The certainty of this hope is proved by his raising his beloved and only begotten Son from the dead. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Such dwelling together is refreshing and reviving, like the heavy dews upon Mount Hermon during Palestine’s hot, dry season of six months’ duration. The dews were so heavy that their area of coverage extended from Mount Hermon down to Mount Zion. Zion was a symbol of Jehovah’s capital organization. At the true Zion, the capital, the everlasting Life-giver commands his blessing to rest, the blessing of “life for evermore”. That life, the gift of God, resides in his High Priest, the King. None of earth can gain everlasting life save through the capital organization and its King, Christ Jesus. The dews of ancient Mount Zion were life-giving. At this scorching end of the world, the blessings unto life in the new world of righteousness descend like dew upon all who dwell together in brotherly unity by subjecting themselves to the Theocratic rule.

Also, now, God’s “other sheep” will honor His “woman”, joyfully serving under her direction at present, looking forward to the blessed hope of being adopted after the battle of Armageddon as her beloved earthly children through Christ Jesus.

Such work cannot be erased, though men refuse to read this testimonial evidence of our ministry. The religionists’ documents of commendation are scraps of paper, man’s word. Jehovah’s witnesses, besides quoting support from the Bible, submit live testimonials in flesh and blood.

This he will do by setting up a righteous, uncorruptible Government that actually brings life in peace, happiness and prosperity to mankind on earth. The world declares its purpose is to civilize all peoples and to give them permanent peace, economic prosperity, social security, and good government, locally and internationally. On the surface, it would seem that the purposes of this world and of Jehovah God are running parallel with each other, or that they are in fact both one; and that this world is practically carrying out the purpose of God and should therefore have his approval and blessing. However, their purposes are not one, and Jehovah God has nothing in common with this world. That is why His way and methods differ from the world’s.

During Christ’s 1000-year reign he will apply merit in behalf of all others who prove worthy of life everlasting in Paradise on earth. The benefit of his merit does not come automatically to any human creature, but comes only to those manifesting faith in God’s provision through Christ. The benefit that comes now to those for whom his merit is applied is justification by faith, which faith is demonstrated by consecration. Since the merit is from Jesus’ human sacrifice, the justification of these by faith is as to their flesh, for naturally they are sinners in the flesh. Such justification is only a means to an end, that the one consecrating to God can be made receivable by God to become his servant for ever. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span></p>

For that reason he acts foolishly, and the results are those of foolishness. The spirit within him is in itself invisible to onlookers. Yet it is a driving force within him. Hence at first it may cause the fool to take on an angry countenance, his blood leaving his face, his lips becoming livid. Then, on top of this visible effect of such spirit, it vents itself in violent language and actions to foolish effect. The wise person has control over his spirit, including its quality of anger. He knows that thoughtless action will do no good and may displease the Lord. He takes thought for consequences and keeps back his anger.

No less degree of faithfulness is required of the virgin companions than is required of the remnant. If the test of endurance seems to be applied to the companions longer than they had thought, and if the time till the Armageddon fight and victory of Jehovah seems to be longer than once expected, let these companions not faint or grow weary.

Over such devotion to the King they greatly rejoice, because it means that the interests of his kingdom have been increased to that extent. Having a common bond to the Kingdom, and being separated because of it from this world and the political institutions thereof, both the remnant and the “strangers” of good-will now dwell together and act in harmony with one another. Because both classes are traveling onward to the near future time when the Kingdom will dominate all the earth with no opposing man-made governments, both the spiritual remnant and their earthly companions are “strangers and pilgrims” to this world which lies under the power of the wicked one, Satan the Devil.—1 Pet. 2:11.

If now the “other sheep” follow the same Shepherd, they cannot do otherwise than participate with the remnant in getting the testimony respecting Jehovah’s kingdom and his vengeance out to all nations, regardless of what language. The remnant have no authority to quit testifying before the end comes. Therefore the “other sheep”, their companions, have no authority to slack the hand and let down on the witness work.

Because they know God can resurrect them out of death if He permits the Devil and his minions to kill their bodies. The Devil cannot destroy their souls, that is, their life through a resurrection from the dead into the New World. They know that only God can destroy their souls or life privileges in gehenna, symbolic of everlasting destruction. (Matt. 10:28) By going down eventually into their baptism into death in blamelessness and integrity toward God, they maintain their conditional right to life in the New World.

They are the last members on earth of Christ’s bride-class. Hence, in this day of Jehovah, when the “pure river of water of life” is flowing out from the Kingdom throne and through his visible organization, let this remnant of the “bride” join with the Bridegroom, the Spirit, in saying, “Come.” Let them encourage to like service all men of good-will that hear, by bidding them to say to still others, “Come.” Then by a combined preaching of “this gospel of the Kingdom” to all races, nations, peoples and tongues, let both the remnant and these good-will companions extend the King’s welcome to all others who are athirst for life-giving truth.

The apostle says we are living, not under the old law, but in the time of antitypical realities which were long ago foreshadowed in that law covenant. Our antitypical Mediator is Christ Jesus; he is also our antitypical High Priest of God. Hence in the words above the apostle points to Israel’s ancient law code of the old covenant that was abolished by Christ, and he shows the difference between it and the spirit or moving force of Jehovah which is upon his approved servants now.

God’s energizing force to cause those who have the spirit of life to say or do things beyond their natural powers to perform and which things they did not understand is described by the apostle above. If those prophets of before Christ foretold things they did not understand and did so by God’s holy active force, then it follows that the understanding or explanation of such things by the followers of Christ must be by the same force.

Their exploits in His service are as much accomplished by the spirit or active force of God through Christ as are the exploits of the remnant, “the people that do know their God.” (Dan. 11:32) The spirit of Almighty God is resting potently upon the devoted companions of the remnant. This is not saying they have been begotten of God’s spirit and will have to die so as to go to heaven. It does not mean they are anointed with the spirit and made members of Christ’s body. John the Baptist and Christ Jesus worked in the same field for some months and God’s spirit rested upon them both. Yet John was not begotten of the spirit.

Thereby the earthly realm will become once more wholly a part of the universal organization of the Most High God. Humbly Christ will claim no independent sovereignty of his own. Having succeeded in his kingdom over the earth and fulfilled God’s will toward it, he will gladly submit himself in absolute allegiance and obedience to Jehovah God.

Therefore they stuck to sobriety and to an active life in the field as wandering tenters, like Jael. Of natural Jonadab-Rechabites and Kenites we know of none today. But God’s promise was doubtless given and recorded to remind us that there would be modern-day Jonadabs. They are the “stranger” class of good-will, who in their varied acts of faith were foreshadowed by the Kenites, including Hobab, Jael, Jonadab and the Rechabites.

Christ Jesus said that the things in the Law and Prophets and Psalms were written concerning him, and by illuminating such Scriptures the spirit comforter would testify of Christ Jesus and glorify him. This spirit or active force would not be a blind force running wild, but would be tuned to convey to the church what the great Sender Jehovah God said and hence what it heard; and it would also attune the faithful Christians to what the heavenly Father had said and what they heard from his recorded Word and his inspired servants.

Only God’s “woman”, his faithful universal organization above, can produce such righteous “heavens” over mankind. It is thus seen that the very foundation of a new world or a regenerated world of righteousness is a righteous, incorruptible government, mightier than Satan and all his demons and able to destroy all wicked creatures and to wipe out all the effects of the thousands of years of sin’s operation.

Such capital organization is God’s offspring and also the Seed of his </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">freewoman</span><span class="font3"> or universal organization. “Capital” means “chief”, as being the seat of the general government. Hence the Christ organization is the Kingdom of heaven, which kingdom has no earthly part or “phase”. It is at the top of the universal organization and rules it, the seraphim, cherubim and angels being subject to it. Necessarily, the earthly part of the universal organization, being lower than angels, will be subject to the Kingdom or capital organization. Only Jehovah God, as supreme, is above the Kingdom, for he is the Head over all the Christ. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

Satan now pulls off the biggest fraud in the history of his world organization. He starts the fable a-rolling, and uses all possible channels of propaganda and publicity to make it popular, that the afterwar association of nations is man’s last and only hope for a peaceful earth with security, prosperity and justice to all races, nations, minorities and languages. A blasphemous fable this is. Against it God’s Word sets forth Jehovah’s kingdom by his Christ as the only successful and permanent means for bringing in a new world of righteousness, peace, safety, health, prosperity and life forever for faithful men on the earth. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span></p>

And said unto me, Thou art my servant, 0 Israel, in whom I will be glorified. . . . And now, saith the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob [Jehovah’s holy nation] again to him.” These words, applying primarily to Jesus, apply also to the members of his body. These are called from the womb or from the time of begettal as members of God’s organization, Zion, to be her children.—Gal. 4:26.

<p><span class="font3">The ministry of Jehovah’s witnesses is a glorious one. If it is not apparent to religious unbelievers who persecute us, it is because they read the Bible but do not have seeing eyes. To get the veil that is before their eyes removed, they must turn to God in faith; for when Moses went before the presence of God he removed the veil that hid his face from the Jews. Those Israelites feared to see God’s glory in Moses’ face and asked it to be veiled from their eyes. Moses, their go-between, was reflecting Jehovah’s glory, proving he had been with Jehovah, just as a phosphorescent substance, after it has been exposed to the light, carries an afterglow in the dark. Moses foreshadowed God’s great Prophet, Christ Jesus. Like his prototype, this Greater Moses does not fear to behold Jehovah’s glory direct.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Eph. 1:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The major portion of the “body of Christ” having already been gathered together by resurrection in one with the new world-Ruler in the heavens, there remains but a remnant of such “body” members upon earth. These too must be gathered together in one under their Head Christ Jesus. They have been so gathered throughout the entire earth. Not physically so, but in oneness of purpose and effort, in oneness of organization, in oneness of action, and in oneness of understanding of the great Textbook of life, the Bible. Hence they have not permitted the divisions of the religious sects and organizations to split them. Nor have they let the political squabbles and controversies of the nations rend them asunder. They recognize and abide by the principle set forth at Galatians 3:28 as to the “body of Christ”. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">That command of Jesus Christ holds good today. Although this is a time when the dead are being multiplied wholesale, those who show the wisdom of obedience to Christ cannot turn aside from fulfilling their commission to preach. Certainly, no matter what they might otherwise do of a practical kind from the world’s standpoint, it would not keep the people from dying or being made to die prematurely against their wills. What “practical thing”, so called, can restore life to those thus dying? Hence, although the gospel preaching does not seem of practical benefit to humanity, that does not mean it is not of the highest wisdom to preach, and to preach now in the midst of a global upheaval. In the midst of a dying race of mankind Jesus did not think it foolishness to preach. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">6/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">By ‘selling what one possesses and giving it away in alms’ Jesus meant for his followers to convert or change what they own and have into something capable of being used unselfishly for the benefit of others according to God’s will. That is to say, Put your means into equipping yourself for distributing to others the good things God has to offer concerning his Kingdom. Thus you will engage in a non-eommercial work. Such is a charitable ministry or a dispensing of God’s Word and with no financial returns or accumulation of material wealth for yourself. Jehovah is the greatest Almsgiver, and Christ Jesus was an imitator of Him in almsgiving. Jesus’ disciples must follow in his steps in giving alms. Such alms are the life-giving spiritual truths of God’s Word and spiritual help, and not literal money. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">All members of the church’s governing body pushed the proclamation of the good news of the Kingdom to the ends of the earth. They lived up to the designation which the Lord gave them of apostle, which term means “sent-forth one”. They fulfilled their calling to be apostles by going forth from place to place and from house to house to preach, and organizing companies of Jehovah’s consecrated people. In other words, they all acted as evangelists and as ambassadors of Jehovah and in behalf of Christ Jesus. Thus, back there, the governing body of Jehovah’s Theocratic arrangement of his people not only directed the announcing of the Kingdom throughout the earth but also took an active forward part in evangelistic work themselves. Why? Because this is the fundamental work on earth of all the members of Jehovah’s Theocratic organization, whether apostles or not.

<p><span class="font3">Make no mistake of understanding. The days of “great tribulation” were not cut short by the halting of World War I; no more than those days were renewed by the outbreak of World War II in 1939. The Lord God and his Christ were not responsible for either World War I or this present global conflict. Satan the Devil and his demons and their human agents are accountable for these wars. The real days of the “great tribulation” are those which are brought against Satan’s organization visible and invisible by the great King Jehovah and his Associate King Christ Jesus. The tribulation began against that wicked organization in 1914, when the “times of the Gentiles” came to their close. The final end and grand climax of that tribulation will come at the decisive fight between Jehovah’s hosts and Satan’s at Armageddon.

<p><span class="font3">The name carries with it all the honor, authority, power and office that the Father has laid upon the Son. One’s consecration to God the Father, which consecration is symbolized by being immersed in water, must take into consideration the place to which the Father has assigned the Son in the vindication of His name and universal sovereignty. None can be consecrated to God except through him. Being baptized into the name of the Son means being baptized unto a recognition and obedience toward that for which the Son’s name stands, to wit, his position and office in God’s purpose and arrangement. The Son, by his own loyal course to his Father, left the one and only example for his followers to copy, and they must obey his example as well as his words.

<p><span class="font3">Jesus when on earth was faithful in that to which he was anointed. Therefore Revelation 3:14 speaks of him as “The faithful and true witness”. All the faithful apostles were Christlike witnesses of Jehovah. All members of the bride of Christ are, by force of their anointing, obliged to be witnesses of Jehovah concerning the Kingdom in which they shall share with Jesus the Bridegroom for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. (1 Cor. 9:16) Such obligation applies to the remnant of the bride class yet on earth. For that reason the remnant of anointed ones have joyfully taken up and acted under the Scriptural name “Jehovah’s witnesses”. Hence they must now say, “Come,” to all “men of good-will”.—Rev. 22:17.

<p><span class="font3">Death has been like a monster that has prodded all mankind with a death-dealing sting. That sting is sin; for “the wages of sin is death”. Sin’s strength has been God’s law which condemned sinners to death and called for execution of those infected with sin, thus causing a payment of sin’s wages. But where, now, as respects the “body of Christ”, is that sting and that victory of death, in view of the redemptive death and the resurrection of Jesus? They are completely nullified, counteracted! And where is any cause for death’s boasting in view of the resurrection of the “body of Christ” which has already begun ? As for the remnant of the “body” yet alive on earth and engaged in Jehovah’s service, death can stop them only momentarily, for at death they are changed instantaneously: “and their works do follow them,” in glory, in the Kingdom !—Rev. 14:13.

It has behind it the Most High God Omnipotent; it has behind it the Son of God with all authority in heaven and on earth; it has behind it invincible power, the holy spirit or active force. And in being thus commanded the consecrated servants of God are receiving an ordination which is above any commission or appointment that humans and religious institutions could bestow upon a creature. This divine command directing the consecrated ones to the work of God is a law to them which no supreme court, international court, or world court can nullify or revoke. Nothing they may decide, hand down or rule respecting worldly affairs can be understood to have force or authority against this command to preach and to teach in all nations.

The letter is not written in ink that can be rubbed out, but is inscribed by and with the active force or spirit of God, who works in us. It is not as in the case of Moses, when the law of the Ten Commandments was written with the finger of God on two tablets of stone. Our letter is written on the fleshly tablets of human hearts, because of the change of heart and mind that our spiritual ministry causes in the Lord’s “other sheep”. Our work with God’s Word has made an impression upon them and has wrought results in them that are readable or discernible. Such results, therefore, make them our letter.

While praying thus, he must search the written Word of God, wherein the divine will is recorded, trusting God by his spirit to reveal his will through those sacred pages. (2 Tim. 2: 15) Keep in mind, however, that it is the servant class, not an individual person, that prays to be taught to do God’s will. The revelation of God’s will must therefore be, not for an individual, but for the entire company of His faithful remnant. It is not an individual student of God’s Word that reveals His will, nor is it for an individual to presume to interpret God’s Word to make plain His will. Jehovah God is the sole Interpreter of his Word and is the Teacher of highest education, for the entire company of His people. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span></p>

One who gets out of harmony with God’s universal rule of obedience can not be or remain a part of Jehovah’s organization; for thereby he fails to perform his part of the organizational work.

<p><span class="font3">The Greater Moses, Christ Jesus at the temple, is responsible for the plagues. He has been authorized by Jehovah God to enforce them upon stubborn, resisting “Christendom”. Such plagues are messages of judgment from Jehovah God and are revealed through his Bible. They are expressed against all things of this world of religion, or demonism, and politics and commerce. Such judgment messages expose this world as Satan’s and boldly declare what shall soon come upon it in the battle of Armageddon, now near. Like Aaron who used Moses’ rod, so Jehovah’s witnesses, joined by their good-will companions, have been used to deliver these judgment proclamations in Jehovah’s name and guided and protected by His holy angels, particularly since 1922. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span></p>

The malicious, deliberately wicked and rebels against God die not merely as Adam’s descendants, but also as seed of the Serpent, the children of the wicked one Satan.

This did not alter the correctness of what they wrote, any more than for a faithful copyist to make an exact copy without understanding it affected his copy. Balaam’s prophecy was an example of where God’s spirit irresistibly prevailed over what an unfaithful prophet wanted to say and it turned an intended curse into a blessing.—Num. 22:38; 23: 8, 12, 20, 26; 24:1-3, 12, 13; Neh. 13: 2.

<p><span class="font3">The term </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">water</span><span class="font3"> in conjunction with spirit does not mean literal water as for baptism. Instead, “water” symbolizes that which has to be preached to the man before being begotten of the spirit, namely, the truth concerning Jehovah God and his purpose through Christ Jesus. This likening of truth to clean water is not unusual in Scripture. Said Peter later: “Seeing ye have </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">purified</span><span class="font3"> your souls in obeying the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">truth</span><span class="font3"> through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">pure</span><span class="font3"> heart fervently.” Then to show that the word of truth performs its part in the begetting of a new creature in Christ, Peter adds: “Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever. . . . this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.”—1 Pet. 1: 22-25.

<p><span class="font3">What was withholding or acting as a restraining force in even the apostle’s day was the holy spirit.

<p><span class="font3">If the apostle Paul encountered such perils and exposed himself to death from purely the motives of a natural man, and without love for God and belief in resurrection, what would it avail him? To face perils with such motives as the religionists of this world have would be of no advantage and would end up in loss of faith. So the apostle warns us. It is not with safety to one’s faith in God and his purpose for a Christian to keep regular company with religionists who do not believe that the dead rise to life in a resurrection, but who have selfish motives of worldly glory, fame and honor for what brave exploits they do with an unconcern for death. To such the course of self-indulgence in this life appears to be the most reasonable to their natural minds. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">4/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">It is He also who has made us competent to serve Him in connexion with a new Covenant.—2 Cor. 3:6, Weym.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Christ Jesus, the “Lamb of God”, was killed and his blood was offered in God’s presence to ‘take away the sin of the world’. For this reason Gentiles as well as Jews become qualified to serve as competent ministers of the new covenant. The old covenant was inaugurated at Mount Sinai with a law code, delivered to the Israelites through their mediator Moses. But as respects the new covenant, this was validated over Jesus’ blood on Passover Day of A.D. 33, and it was inaugurated or dedicated fifty days after he arose from the dead as the living Mediator. It was inaugurated on the day of Pentecost by the outpouring of God’s spirit upon those then consecrated to him as Christ’s followers. By such outpouring these anointed ones became ministers or servants, not of a written code like that at Mount Sinai, but of the spirit of God.

<p><span class="font3">The course above outlined by the great Peace-maker is for the purpose of keeping peace and unity among the brethren, rather than stirring up discord by talebearing and whispering. It does not matter what problem comes up among those of the Lord’s organization, there is always a proper order to follow, and it is set forth in the Lord’s Holy Word. As long as we follow that, unity will be maintained; there will be no disruption. Those trying to bring about disruption the Lord God by His angels will clean out from his organization in due time, and it will be after those that are approved by Him under the test are made manifest. —1 Cor. 11:19.

<p><span class="font3">Man’s present enjoyment of practical, material things has been futile, vain, eternally. Life in the new world of righteousness will be enjoyed under The Theocratic Government, which Jehovah God sets up for the permanent rule of this earth. To prove worthy of life eternal in the Theocratic world it is necessary for life-seekers to get into harmony with that Righteous Government. The wisdom of this world does not believe in or want that Government. The religious clergy and others who have the wisdom of this world do not tell the people anything in favor of that new world and its Theocratic Government. Therefore if the people of this generation are to gain life and if they are to prepare to live in that righteous Theocratic world they must first hear about it, and to that end someone must preach the true gospel to them.

<p><span class="font3">Christ Jesus has not begun begetting children as yet. Hence the consecrated persons of good-will who now drink at the river of living water are not yet begotten by him. Neither does God’s spirit of revelation testify to their hearts and minds that they are his spiritual adopted sons. Nor does the same holy spirit proclaim a heavenly reward for them or open up to them from God’s Word the hope of a heavenly spiritual inheritance. Nonetheless, they must continue faithfully at the side of the begotten and anointed remnant in the gospel-preaching work of Jehovah God. They must maintain their constancy and integrity in his service under stress of reproach, persecution and demonic opposition till the work is done. Then the “Everlasting Father”, Christ Jesus, will justify them to life during his millennial reign through the benefits of his ransom sacrifice.

<p><span class="font3">The waters of life descend from the Kingdom source and through God’s visible organization and then to men. (Rev. 22:1, 2) Hence in this day of Jehovah the “living waters” of the Kingdom gospel are observed to “go out from Jerusalem”. Eastward and westward they go, to reach the seas of humanity alienated from Jehovah God. No winter torrent such as dries up in the hot, dry season of persecution is this river of living water. The prophecy says, “In summer and in winter shall it be.” And the facts disclose that all the year round, in season and out of season, in times of violent heat of persecution and in more peaceful times, the life-imparting waters keep flowing from the Kingdom throne and through the faithful organization of Jehovah’s witnesses.

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s good news about The Theocratic Government is irrepressible. The haters of such good news or gospel resort to violent and illegal means to stamp it out, but in vain! In the effort to keep this life-saving message from reaching the perishing people, they try to break up the organization of those who do their duty to God by preaching the good news of the Kingdom. Yes, in places they do cause the message-bearers to be scattered bodily, but such enemy accomplishment merely works out toward scattering the good news more widely, because the message-bearers refuse to quit preaching. While scattering or uprooting many of such active announcers, the religious-totalitarian persecutions and opposition fail to break up the organization and stop the organized activity for educating the people. Why? Because the enemies of the gospel fight against God. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">At this end of the world, when Christ Jesus comes to the temple for judgment of his followers, there would be the final remnant of his church or bodymembers upon the earth. These faithful ones he would constitute into a servant-body under himself as Head. This very action he foretold in the above text. For such reason the term </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">servant</span><span class="font3"> is consistently used among the remnant of consecrated, spirit-begotten and anointed witnesses of Jehovah. The term designates them as servants of God, and not of men.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Rom. 14:17, A. S. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Enjoyment of present Kingdom privileges is not a matter of what or how much or when we eat and drink. It is a matter of serving the King in the right way, getting along peaceably with fellow servants, and rejoicing because God’s spirit is upon you and is showing you and guiding you into the precious truths and privileges of serving Him. Those who in this way render service pleasing to God and approved of his King will not perish for lack of food, drink and clothing and be knocked inactive in that way. God stands pledged to provide all things he knows they have need of, and never yet has his pledge failed. Why, then, lay up treasures on earth for days to come and neglect God’s service in order to do so? You may share the fate of those who in the night of Armageddon will have their lives demanded of them. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The “stranger” class of today read this promise made over God’s name to Ebed-melech. They may recognize in it a promise written under inspiration for their benefit, because of the like services they render to the faithful remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses foreshadowed by Jeremiah. In view of the rapid approach of God’s vengeance at Armageddon, bringing the destruction of Jerusalem’s counterpart, modern-day “Christendom”, and of all organized religion, this promise is a great comfort to these “strangers” of good-will. They are the “sheep” which Jesus the King said visit him while in prison by doing the like to the imprisoned ones of his spiritual brethren. He will shield them from destruction and invite them into earthly blessings under the Kingdom.—Matt. 25: 34-40. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">12/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The divine command to teach and preach reaches into every quarter of the earth and into every nation. It throws open every nation to entry by God’s consecrated servants on their preaching and teaching mission. No religious cult can rightly seek under any sort of selfish plea to keep out the teachers of the divine Word. Only the holy spirit, under the direction of Jehovah through Christ, can rightfully prevent those who are commanded to teach from entering into any territory of the earth at a certain time. The spirit operated against Paul’s efforts because the gospel laborers were few, and the spirit was guiding what few laborers there were in order to direct the course of the gospel into fields that were due to be opened up at the particular time.

The truth regarding the life-giving Government is pictured as a stream, which issues forth from the throne of God and of his once-sacrificed Son. Seemingly small at its source, it increases in width and depth to the volume of a mighty river. Jehovah God on his throne is the eternal Fountain of life. His faithful Son, who was sacrificed as the Lamb of God that life everlasting might be provided for obedient humankind, is the One by whom the life is extended to believers. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

The regeneration begins with the setting up of the Kingdom, God’s Government in the hands of his glorified Son. This Theocratic Government has already been established, all the facts since A.D. 1914 going to show that he took to himself his great power in that year and set the beloved Son as King “in the throne of his glory” in the heavens. The regeneration there begun will not halt until a new world has been born in which obedient humankind will live on earth in the bloom of perpetual health and in plenty amid peaceful and safe conditions and righteous surroundings. This will take place both after and in spite of the fact that all efforts toward the so-called “moral regeneration” of mankind by worldly leaders in the postwar era will have failed.

<p><span class="font3">When dying on the tree in antitypical Egypt, Christ Jesus abolished the Jewish law covenant and provided his blood to make valid the new covenant in behalf of his followers, whether natural Gentiles or Jews. By his integrity maintained toward God unto the death, not a natural death, but one of extreme reproach on the tree, Jesus was made a curse. But thereby he lifted the curse of the law covenant from all believing Jews. (Gal. 3:13, 14) All this was a defeat for Satan the Devil, who hoped to hold all the Gentiles as well as Jews under his tyrannical power. It was a great plague to the Jewish religionists who held onto the now hollow shell of the law covenant, the outward observances thereof. It resulted in the death of the religious clergy, that is, as far as their authority and aweinspiring influence and power affected the Jewish disciples of Jesus.

<p><span class="font3">This states the resurrection order of Jesus and his church. He, as firstfruits, was foreshadowed by the barley-harvest firstfruits offered up by Israel’s high priest on Nisan 16, Jesus’ resurrection day; and he started </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">off</span><span class="font3"> the resurrection. (Col. 1:18) After him properly come those who share with him in the first resurrection. Who are they? “They who are the Christ’s in his presence,” that is, his second presence. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font3"> They that are then Christ’s are the members of his body, the church of which he is the head. He is the One foretold as “the Seed of Abraham”, in whom all families and nations of the earth are to be blessed. All his body-members, by being adopted as the spiritual sons of God, have been made a part with Christ Jesus as such “Seed of Abraham”.—Gal. 3:29.

<p><span class="font3">Certainly, the consecrated one that God does make a member of the heavenly Zion must know about it and must come to hope for it. How, then, does God call a consecrated one to the “high calling”? It is by begetting such to be His spiritual child. Such one must be “born of water [truth] and of the spirit”. (John 3:5) The fact that Jehovah God begets such one constitutes the call. It being impossible for creatures as humans to gain the heavenly glory with Christ Jesus, the ones that are called to things heavenly must be those who are born of God, or begotten by his spirit as spiritual sons, for only such could enter into heavenly conditions. Christ Jesus “brought life and immortality to light through the gospel”; and by reason of such gospel they know unto what glorious estate they have been called;—2 Tim. 1: 8-10.

<p><span class="font3">The spirit or mental disposition may be hid from human eyes, but the force of such spirit or frame of mind is certain to impel one in a direction that produces visible results disclosing or betraying what is concealed inside one or what one really is or what really motivates one. Men have to depend upon visible manifestations of the spirit of a person. Oftentimes they may be thrown off the track of right conclusions by skillful camouflage and hypocrisy of a person; but not so God, who looks not on outward appearance, but on the heart. Judging men by the disposition of mind and the intentional, chosen direction of their effort, Jehovah God is never deceived. For wise, Scriptural reasons, then, those who fear God as Judge and Ruler now take heed to their spirit most anxiously. They desire a clean heart.

They will perform this obligation of service as in God’s sight, knowing that we would not escape his notice were we to do unrighteously or deceitfully. Humans may be deceived, but not God, who judges us. So we speak the truth in the fear of God.

Their commission to be the witnesses of the Most High God they will cherish as their most precious possession.

Were Jehovah’s remnant and their companions to yield to such invasion of their orderly and peaceful dwelling together in unity, their Theocratic organization would be broken up and their power for united action in Jehovah’s service would be weakened.

Had he not died, he would have failed to provide the ransom sacrifice for mankind, and his disciples would be without redemption and hence would die and remain dead. But by dying and then being raised from death, he procured redemption for them and opened the way for them to be with him in the heavenly kingdom, that thus he should not be alone in it. His disciples must follow his course and die like him.

Contrariwise, the preaching of the gospel is unto salvation; no, not salvation of this world, but salvation of all individuals that believe and act upon the gospel they hear.

<p><span class="font3">By virtue of Jesus’ being begotten and anointed as the spiritual Son of God he could quote Isaiah 61: 1, 2, as above in the Jewish synagogue at Nazareth to his fellow townsmen. In the case of Jesus his anointing, which commissioned him to preach, came on him immediately when he was begotten of the spirit, after his consecration to do God’s will had been accepted of his Father, which consecration he symbolized by baptism in water. His Father baptized him with holy spirit, and thereafter Jesus refrained from carpenter work at Nazareth and did the gospel ministry as set out in the commission at Isaiah 61: 1, 2. Before him there had been anointings, but his was the first anointing with God’s holy spirit. It was his commission to be a priest higher than Aaron and to be a king greater than David or Solomon.

Then was there an outstanding further manifestation of the pouring forth of God’s spirit upon his faithful servants to accomplish a witness in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all nations. Back there, A.D. 33 and 36, the miniature fulfillment of Joel 2: 28, 29 was the coming of the spirit comforter to the church. It is the same spirit that was poured out in the larger fulfillment from and after 1919 upon the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses. This has been of great comfort, enlightenment and strengthening power to them. Why ? Because although gathered into the temple condition of unity with Jesus, they are still in the flesh and he is invisible to their eyes.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?—Matt. 6: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If Satan cannot force men of independent spirit into working for the upkeep and perpetuation of this world by regimentation, then he entices them into the service of mammon by tall salaries, wages, and hopes of financial and social security within the worldly organization. It is time to wake up to what is taking place; time to look the situation squarely in the face and then heed the wisdom of the One like whom no other man has ever spoken. No one having the mind of Jesus will deny that the life (or soul) and the body are more important than the food, clothing and shelter which are applied to the body and which perish with their using. And yet life and the body can be guaranteed a prolonged existence only by putting the Kingdom foremost and serving its cause as of maximum importance. This is the way to meet the issue of universal domination with blessed results. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">As </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.—Isa. 62:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God’s relationship to his organization is as unto a woman or wife. (Isa. 54: 5) God’s universal organization, which receives its life from God, is his creation and is made up of his holy and devoted creatures. As perfect woman was to be perfect man’s helpmeet, so God’s organization is properly His helpmeet and is subject to him for his purposes. As his organization, she was made for him and for his glory and must work with him, never trying to usurp authority over him, but holding to her proper place under the Supreme One, her divine Head. Hence, as to those who, by God’s grace, are faithful, active members of his organization or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">woman,</span><span class="font3"> it is written: “For we are labourers together with God.” (1 Cor. 3: 9) “We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.”—2 Cor. 6:1.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit.—2 Cor. 3: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The priesthood and Levite service of the old covenant have been abolished, and Christ’s followers are not servants or ministers of that covenant. They are competent and qualified servants of the new covenant. They are not ordained by the code of laws of the abolished covenant, but are ordained, used and led by the invincible spirit of God; for, “if ye be led of the spirit, ye are not under the law.” (Gal. 5:18) God’s spirit or active force works within us to carry out his will and purpose, if we are willing and trustful and proceed according to his recorded Word. The written code of the old law covenant condemned to death the Jews under it, and thus “the written code kills”. The inworking energy or spirit of God enlightens and strengthens us and leads us in the way that guides to life, and thus “the spirit gives life” or “makes alive”.—TVeym.; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.</span><span class="font3"> IV </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Know how to conduct thyself in God’s house. —1 Tim. 3: 15, Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Theocratic rule in God’s house takes note of a visible governing body under Jehovah and his Christ. It therefore lays upon such governing body the duty to make the appointments of special servants in the local congregations or companies of Jehovah’s faithful witnesses. The Theocratic organization is ruled, not from any or all congregations upward as source of power and authority, but from Jehovah, The Theocrat, down through his Head of the church, Christ Jesus the King. In the first century it was the group of the apostles in particular, together with the body of elders that they associated with them at Jerusalem, that made up the visible ruling body of Jehovah’s Theocratic organization on earth. This fact agreed with what Christ Jesus, the Head of the church, said to his apostles, at Matthew 18:18; John 20: 23. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Love ... is the bond of perfectness.—Col. 3:14, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The remnant and the “stranger” class love one another dearly and are on the most intimate terms. All strife, rivalry and contention they put from among them as they unitedly serve the interests of the Kingdom, The Theocratic Government. Both groups are governed by one Theocratic law, God’s law, and they respect and help one another as servants of the supreme Theocratic Ruler, Jehovah. Together, as the remnant rightly takes the faithful lead, they follow in the footsteps of Jehovah’s King, Christ Jesus, whithersoever he leads. Their respective destinies are not the most important and deciding thing. Faithful obedience to God with unbreakable integrity to Him is the most important thing, that they may have a part with his kingdom in vindicating his name and in proving the issue of his right to the universal domination. They are inseparably united together for the Kingdom and its purposes. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">11/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.—Jer. 1:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Nothing stands out clearer than this, namely, That, regardless of temporary hindrances in some directions, the gospel is the thing to be preached and the effort should be made to preach it in, every place possible where the feet of the gospel preachers can carry them. As ambassadors of the Lord, his commissioned servants go forth into a world hostile to him and lying under the wicked one. Because of serving in the capacity of ambassadors, the gospel preachers are not warranted thereby to treat with political governments so as to enter into a so-called “concordat” and arrange favorable conditions under which to preach the gospel in a country. The Lord’s ambassadors may not thus make themselves friends of the world and as such be a part of it. Christ died, not for political governments, but for the people, and to these his ambassadors must go direct, regardless of nationality.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">In one house shall it be eaten; . . . neither shall ye break a bone thereof.—Ex. 12: 46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since blood is that which makes atonement for the sinner and results in cleansing, the eating of the passover lamb’s flesh could not represent justification to the believer in Christ. Rather, it pictured the fellowship which the believer in Christ’s blood has with Jesus in doing God’s will. It means following in JesUs’ footsteps while the believer is in the flesh on earth. Christ Jesus did God’s will, leaving his disciples the example to follow his steps. Hence while trusting in the atoning blood of the “Lamb of God”, the believers must partake of him by doing God’s will as Jesus did it in the flesh. Such obedience to the divine will is acceptable to God through Christ Jesus. This is a strengthening spiritual nourishment to the active believers, as Jesus himself admitted, saying: “My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.”—John 4:34.

<p><span class="font3">Here is a principle of living which the framers of the Atlantic Charter for the postwar era have not counted on nor embodied into their scheme for a “finer and better world”. The planners for an international peace machine, backed by an adequate police force, are working hard for international collaboration, but they do not propose to overstep national differences. National sovereignties are to be sacrificed as little as possible, and there is proposed a selfdetermination of peoples. Thus the “new order” draftsmen give in to a divisive force and barrier, and it will never be “one world” that will hold together for long. The fact stands settled, that it is humanly impossible to bring about a united world. Only God Almighty can and will create a united world of righteousness. Waiting on him to do so will not bring any disappointments. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

This is the long-foretold “day of Jehovah of hosts”, for it is the day of his Theocracy’s coming. It is the thrilling day of the Kingdom already come and no more needed to be waited for. When its establishment was yet 1800 years in the future, Jesus, according to God’s will, considered it of such importance as to preach it. How much more important to sing it forth now when that Righteous Government is here! Yea, if Paul in that distant past could say, ‘Woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel! for necessity is laid upon me’ (1 Cor. 9:16); then woe unto those upon whom the necessity is laid now, if these preached not “this gospel” that the Kingdom has come and its purposes are due to be fulfilled. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The wind is brought forth out of the treasuries of God and is according to his word. (Jer. 51:16; Ps. 148: 7, 8) So the one begotten of God and who enters the Kingdom is like the wind in having God as his source. But the origin with God of such begotten one cannot be discerned by the natural man, whose eyes cannot see the wind that blows about this earth, but such origin is unseen to his eyes. As the natural man hears the sound of the passing wind, so he may observe the visible effects of the action of God’s spirit upon the one begotten of God, but cannot appreciate their cause, neither can he discern what is the heavenly destination toward which the spirit-begotten one is moving. Unless born of God in his spiritual organization which is higher than man, one cannot see and enter into the Kingdom. IV </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">7/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">From this we may be sure that many more were called than 144,000, the number finally united in resurrection with Christ Jesus the Bridegroom at the temple because of being judged as having made their calling and election sure. Those of the remnant yet needed to fill the remaining places in the Kingdom are subject at present to the test of endurance. For any of these in attendance at the bridechamber to fall out by failure to keep on the “wedding garment” means that others, how many we do not know, will be brought in by the King to take the vacated places. At the grand finale the Lord God will have the comparative “few”, the predestinated 144,000 members of the “bride” class, all of whom will have kept on their wedding garment and endured to the end of the proof of their integrity to God. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">John thus wrote concerning a disturber that wanted to shine and be boss and lord it over others. In taking action, John acted as a representative of the great Theocrat and as one of the twelve foundations of the church built upon Christ Jesus the Rock. The situation he took in hand was one where an individual was sinning against his brethren and thereby troubling the peace, unity and spiritual health of all the congregation. There was no congregational assembly and voting upon what should be done. The serious situation was brought to the attention of a most responsible representative of the Lord’s organization, possibly the sole survivor at that time of the twelve apostles. He advised what action he would take in behalf of the congregation. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world.—Rom. 12:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Because all human life-prospects for the New World of righteousness were sacrificed the consecrated ones have been begotten of God to spiritual life. Their carrying out of their consecration till human death will be rewarded in the resurrection by life in the spirit in heaven. That their lives might be acceptable to God and approved for sacrifice was why they were justified by the merit of Christ’s blood applied for them. Their lives are thus sacrificed, not that it brings merit to other humans. It could not do so, because their justification is by faith, and all the merit is in Jesus’ perfect sacrifice as high priest. But their lives are sacrificed in God’s service, unselfishly, in the interest of his Theocratic Government and for the vindication of His name. Heavenly hopes are therefore given them instead.

<p><span class="font3">The Son of God sends forth the invitation to lifeseekers to come to the river of living water of truth. He is now a mighty Spirit; which means he is invisible to mankind. How, then, does the invitation to life everlasting reach “men of good-will”? The “bride” joins the Spirit in extending the gracious invitation to those parched with thirst for life-satisfying truth. Inasmuch as only a remnant of the spirit-begotten ones who are espoused to the Spirit Bridegroom remain on earth in direct touch with mankind in this dying world, the remnant are the ones that receive the message from the Bridegroom. They then pass it on to all who have ears, that is, the hearing of faith to accept the message and to come. How does the remnant receive the message to preach it to others?

With the birth of the kingdom of God’s Son the time of regeneration began, and the most important and primary part of it, namely, the creation of the new heavens for the righteous new world. World regeneration is not yet complete, and will not be until the new earth has been created and all creatures that have constituted the “heavens and the earth which are now” have been destroyed in the battle of Armageddon, toward which all nations of earth are now blindly marching. At the destruction of this present wicked world, and at the creation of the “new earth” under the new heavens, the regeneration will be completed, for then the new world will have come. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span></p>

What though the vast majority of the common people of all the nations fall for the Devil’s cunning deceit and turn away their ears from favorably hearing the truth, Jehovah’s witnesses must persist in preaching without discouragement. They will thus perfect their obedience to God and keep their integrity toward Him. Never will they take up the world’s propaganda and preach its fables. They will not seek to please men with ears itching to hear things that satisfy man’s vanity and self-righteous sentiments.

Then Christ Jesus, the Seed of Abraham in whom all the nations will be blessed, becomes the “Everlasting Father” by giving everlasting life to such blessed ones out of all nations of the earth. (Gen. 22:18) They become his sons and daughters and thereby are taken into the universal organization of Jehovah God, becoming members of it. In such manner God’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">woman,</span><span class="font3"> the mother of The Seed of the Greater Abraham, becomes, as it were, the grandmother to such earthly children of her organization.

Here on earth they are weak in themselves and as respects political power and other influence in this world; but they trust for God’s grace to be sufficient for them. They are resurrected in the power of the Kingdom, with power far exceeding that of God’s mighty angels. While in the flesh they are held in great dishonor by this world, and suffer shame for Christ’s name. But in being awakened to everlasting life, they enter into the glories which God has prepared for them that love him and they appear with the Son of God in glory.

(Mal. 3:1-3; Isa. 6:1-11) It is the time, not for more religion, but for light! God commands the light to shine, and to shine not merely until it reaches his anointed remnant. It must rebound from them and flash upon others, men of good-will who are in darkness and in danger of destruction.

Thus it is that the world by wisdom of its own has not known God, but leaves Jehovah out of all its calculations and relies upon its own ability and schemes. Today, after about 6000 years of displaying the wisdom of this world, the peoples and nations are plunging about in a welter of blood, tears, sweat, selfslaughter. Why? The wisdom of this world says it is in the interest of a “new order”, so that out of this furnace of affliction might come forth a fusion of all nations and peoples together under a global government that will bring permanent peace and order and security to all mankind.

Angels, to the contrary, are registered as having continued to serve at the same time with the spirit comforter. Doubtless the holy-spirit comforter functioned through such angels on numerous occasions, though unseen to the disciples. God by Christ Jesus sent his angel to John on Patmos to signify to him coming events as symbolically envisioned in The Revelation. (Rev. 1:1, 2) It should not appear strange and out of order, therefore, that the joint operation of angels and spirit of God should be true of this time of the end. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

The Jonadabs merely carry out organization instructions in conducting and addressing meetings. Their consecration to God is just as true and full as that of the spiritual remnant to God. The same degree of faithfulness to their consecration vow is required of them as of the remnant. And the same spirit of the Lord operates today upon them as upon the remnant. As the “strangers” of good-will learn through the Theocratic organization, they transmit the learning to others, and are not originators or interpreters of the information they transmit. In the same way the faithful prophets of old provided the Hebrew Scriptures which become, by God’s spirit, “food in due season” for spiritual Israelites. “Strangers” can be and are God’s servants today.

(Rom. 13:1) That same year Jehovah revealed that Christianity is not a religion, but is the truth. These disclosures, published more widely from and after 1929, stirred up a great controversy. A tremendous cry arose in all “Christendom” particularly. Her firstborn ones had been smitten dead in their relation to the worship by Jehovah’s witnesses of the Most High God.

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah is the “God of the spirits of all flesh” in that he is the source of the life-force or power of life which all flesh enjoys while having conscious existence. (Num. 16:21, 22; 27:15, 16) AU flesh is dependent upon Jehovah for its life, and he can blot them out for being disobedient. (Acts 17:25, 28) When one servant dies, God can raise up another living servant to serve within His organization. The expression “Father of spirits” may refer to Jehovah in the sense in which Moses spoke of Him as “God of the spirits of all flesh”. However, “Father of spirits” may refer to God as the spiritual Father of Christians in contrast with the fleshly fathers that they have had. It may also mean that Jehovah God is the Father of spirit creatures, seeing that the Christians too are spiritual and have hope of life in the spirit in heaven with other spirit creatures there.

<p><span class="font3">Hence those that have fallen asleep in Christ are not perished, but at the coming of Christ Jesus to God’s spiritual temple for judgment in 1918 the time of their awakening to be with him arrived. The fact that the nations are raging at present, because of their opposition to the reign of God’s King, is no disproof of such resurrection, but rather the contrary: “We give thee thanks, 0 Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged.” (Rev. 11:17, 18) Christ Jesus once slept in death. He being the firstfruits, then those sleeping in him must be the afterfruits of the “first resurrection” class and must become living fruit unto God by being brought out of the death-sleep.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">In thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee. Deliver me, 0 Lord, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.—Ps. 143:8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The one thus praying, David, was anxious to make a move and get away from being holed up in a cave; but what way should he take? Should he retreat, or should he boldly advance into the open and engage in a battle of wits with the enemy as to strategy of movement ? If he took the offensive defiant of the enemy and fearless of what they might do to him, Almighty God could even then deliver him. (1 Sam. 23: 25-28) Jehovah’s servant needs not now retreat into a literal cave and hole up for safety if he flees to Jehovah to hide him. Even while the servant is active in the open and surrounded by watchful enemies, yet God can cover him in the shadow of his hand and preserve him. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W1/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Paul was writing to a specially appointed servant to the brethren and an overseer of their interests, namely, Timothy. This young man in his relationship to the apostle pictures the present visible organization, the Christian “society” the Lord is using, in its relationship to Christ Jesus, “the Apostle and High Priest of our profession.” (Heb. 3:1) Paul directed the overseer of the congregations to entertain the accusations against elder servants, but only before the proper number of witnesses; and also to give out public rebukes to sinners, for the wholesome effect it would have upon others of the congregation. No such authority was delegated to the congregation. In all eases Paul recognized the Theocratic rule in God’s organization and instructed accordingly.

<p><span class="font3">This incident in connection with Paul should be of comfort to God’s people today. The way into a certain area or territory may appear to be blocked against their best and most sincere efforts to reach it with the message in obedience to their commission to preach in all the world. Then they may know that today also the course of the gospel is directed by the Lord and he will not fail to guide them into the fields of service according to his time and purpose. Nevertheless, the gospel servant should plan and map out his itinerary or course of action in the work. That done, he should also look to the Lord for guidance and should follow his leadings when the servant’s chosen course seems blocked or his plans frustrated. The Lord knows where the fields are ripe for the message. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The anointed of the Lord was taken in their pits. —Lam. 4:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If one baptized with the spirit turns unfaithful to God by failing to carry out his responsibilities, he becomes unfaithful to his anointing and is cast off from the “body of Christ”. He loses the spirit of God and its illuminating and actuating power and forfeits his privileges of service in the “body”. Yet, down to the day of death, he is held responsible for failure to meet his obligations as an anointed one. This was illustrated in the case of King Saul. Being covenantbreakers worthy of death, the unfaithful anointed ones suffer destruction. It is because, having been “once enlightened, and having tasted the heavenly gift, and become partakers of holy spirit, and having tasted the good word of God and the powers of the coming age”, they have afterward fallen away and refused to carry out their vows of consecration or to do the things their anointing commissions them to do.—Heb. 6:4-6, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott.

<p><span class="font3">If a brother is on trial, and a person appears to testify and tells falsehoods in order to get the defendant into trouble, rather than speak the truth about him, the falsifier becomes hateful to God. By his false testimony he may think to gain favor with the one questioning him, but he is certainly putting himself in disfavor with the Lord. One who pleases the Lord must come clean with his testimony. If such one’s brother is under accusation and a point-blank statement is asked for, that one will say the truth about his brother. Even if it should bring a little persecution or rebukes from the worldly-minded, he will still be honest and say the truth. The Lord does not like a liar whose false testimony may be bought for some selfish advantage or bribe. TV </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Christ’s body-members are redeemed or delivered after Jehovah God sets up the Kingdom and sends his beloved Son to judge all the household of God. Then he receives the approved ones into the seat with him on the throne in the heavens. Those who have the seal or authoritative guarantee from God that they have been called to this heritage above have been begotten by his spirit. His spirit operates toward them and thus testifies to their being inheritors of heavenly hopes. This spirit actively works in their behalf with appreciable evidence; it is an advance installment or “earnest” or first deposit on what is in store for them in the future in heaven itself. Therefore they know they have been called of God, and they continue to ‘present their bodies a living sacrifice’. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">7/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Honest persons of good-will toward God and his Theocratic Government sense the sweetness of the knowledge of Him as diffused to them by His witnesses, who go from house to house, spreading Bible literature and making revisits upon the truth-seekers and conducting home Bible studies with them, at no charge for such service. To such persons the witness work has the smell of health and life, of living, lifegiving truth. They render thanks to Jehovah God and to his King, whose triumphal procession they joyfully join, loudly crying out: “Salvation [be ascribed] to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.” (Rev. 7: 9,10) They breathe in the atmosphere of the Kingdom truth, which is an odor of life that leads to life.

If it were man’s work and counsel, and if the organization were one made by religious men, both the work and the organization would come to nought and would be subject to destruction by the enemies who fight against such. The organization of Jehovah’s witnesses on earth must therefore be Theocratic ; which means it must be organized according to God’s Word, and not according to the pattern of religious and ecclesiastical systems of men. In apostolic days the faithful members of the Theocratic organization refused to take the lead from religious rulers who told them to quit working according to the divine will. The remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses who make up his visible Theocratic organization today answer in like terms as above to totalitarian religious clergy and rulers.

With that, the days of “great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time”, began upon Satan’s organization. At the beginning of the world Satan’s organization was not challenged nor thrown out and debased to this earth, but </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">now</span><span class="font3"> it suffered this most humiliating experience and tribulation.

The mother organization is pictured symbolically at Revelation 12:1, 2,17. God’s Word names the daughter organization with the name of its mother, namely, “new Jerusalem,” “the holy Jerusalem.” Thus the daughter takes her mother’s name and is called by it. Like her mother she is above, spiritual, heavenly, and hence extends her power downward to the earth over which she rules.

The heavenly treasure that now becomes the rich portion of these almsgivers is not crowded out of their lives nor displaced by earthly selfish treasure; but that heavenly treasure finds the fullest room in their lives. It never decreases, but is continually added to, because God gives them continually “meat in due season”. As Jesus said: “Every scribe [or one who deals with the written Word of God] who hath been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.”—Matt. 13: 52, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.

If one loses or proves unworthy of the right to life in the new world, what does it profit him how much practical benefit he gains from this present selfish world-organization?

If man had been supplied with and followed that which is most proper for the mind and heart, the peoples would not be in this terrible international mess of the present. Moreover, not everything that man needs pertains to the present living in the midst of this world. Life now is uncertain and short.

They did not leave their place in his service, quitting his work and organization in a spirit of faultfinding, hurt feelings, and selfjustification. Their heart’s desire was to resume his active service. For them to leave their place and abandon his work would simply have led to greater offenses. Contrariwise, they showed meekness and yielded to the reproofs of His Word, knowing that the “reproofs of instruction are the way of life”. They saw the Lord’s organization and did not want to forsake it or be cast out of it. They held to a place in God’s mercy by enduring the expression of his spirit of anger at them.

Because there must be no compulsion or intimidation or coercion about their efforts toward others, neither are political aims connected with their mission. To those looking upon the outward appearance the gospel preachers go forth unarmed. Nevertheless, they are armored spiritually, and their sword of offensive and defensive action is “the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God”. (Eph. 6:11-17) Governments of the nations need have no fear of the gospel activities of these true disciples of the Master. That with which they come equipped is God’s spirit and Word; and they partake of the spirit of God largely through God’s Word which they study, apply and preach.

This meant that these three girls by uniting themselves with Noah’s household came under great ridicule and reproach. Why? Because Noah’s preaching of righteousness and of the coming flood was disbelieved, ridiculed and rejected, and he was under great reproach for the name and pure worship of Jehovah. Because of this exercise of faith and putting their trust in Noah’s God, Jehovah preserved these wives of Noah’s sons, and they were used to carry out the divine mandate to fill the earth depopulated by the flood. It is clear, therefore, that these three women and their husbands, Noah’s sons, pictured the same class of today as did the “stranger that is within thy gates”.

Concerning his organization, especially the visible part of it on earth that the enemies broke down during World War I, the psalmist says: ‘When the Lord [Jehovah] shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory. To declare the name of the Lord in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem.” (Ps. 102:16, 21) That began to be fulfilled in 1918. Hence from and after 1918 his witnesses, who are of Zion, have been commanded to arise and shine. Christ Jesus is the Chief One or Head of Zion, and he reflects Jehovah’s glory upon his followers upon earth, toward whom he inaugurates the new covenant.

He died as God’s “Lamb” and was entombed on passover day, Nisan 14. On the sabbath day Nisan 15 he continued in the tomb, but on the third day, Nisan 16, the first day of the week, he was revived from the dead and he shewed himself alive to his disciples. Unlike others that were temporarily raised from the dead and thereafter died again, “Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.” He is “alive for evermore”.

<p><span class="font3">All the powers under Satan the Devil have been the enemies of righteous men. Nevertheless, with the destruction of such powers at Armageddon not all of man’s enemies will have been wiped out. A last enemy remains, and that is death itself, the death concerning which Adam’s descendants had no choice, it being thrust upon them by that man’s transgression in Eden. Christ Jesus was never subject to such death as is by Adam. His death was by self-sacrifice, according to God’s will, and he permitted his enemies to put him to death. His resurrection was not his own personal triumph over death, but that of Jehovah God, whose power raised his Son to life, breaking the bonds of the enemy death. Those whom Christ Jesus raised to life when he was on earth did not stay alive. It is when he reigns that he himself shows his power over death, to abolish it.

In the global flood the power and being of the Almighty Spirit were made visible to mankind in vindication of the name, word and supremacy of Jehovah. The great Spirit was beyond their sight, yet the power of destruction that swept the globe in the face of Satan’s opposition could come from a source no other than the omnipotent God of righteousness.

<p><span class="font3">In the resurrection the ‘‘body of Christ” becomes a spiritual one. Since the church, “his body,” is raised in the “likeness of his resurrection”, and since it is raised a “spiritual body”, then, too, Jesus was raised from the dead a spirit person, “in incorruption,” “in glory,” “in power.” That was why he was begotten of God’s spirit and acknowledged as the spiritual Son of God after his baptism in Jordan river. Hence Christ Jesus, “the last Adam,” was made a “life-giving spirit”. He was “put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit”.

In the church of God the term </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">elder </span><span class="font3">does not denote an office. Therefore there is no such thing as an “elective elder”. No man attains to being an elder in a congregation by being elected or voted in to be such. He becomes an elder by growing up as a Christian, that is, spiritually. Such spiritual growth does not necessarily require one to reach an advanced age physically, but requires one to make diligent study of God’s Word, which is the spiritual guide.

<p><span class="font3">The remnant of Christ’s body-members are part of Jehovah’s universal organization Zion or Jerusalem. Hence in not keeping silent and not resting for his </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">woman’s</span><span class="font3"> sake Jehovah does not keep quiet or rest till he has brought the remnant under Christ Jesus forth before the full view of the nations of earth and their kings or rulers. These behold the remnant to be clothed, as it were, in the “garments of salvation” and covered with the “robe of righteousness”. (61:10) They are seen to be the people saved of Jehovah God and the only ones righteous and approved in his sight and engaged officially in his service, because they are part of his organization. The “new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall name”, also applies to such remnant as part of his organization Zion. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I appoint unto you a kingdom,... That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.—Luke 22:29, 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Who are the “twelve tribes of Israel” whom those enthroned with Christ judge ? The faithful and believing ones of humankind who accept the priesthood and kingdom of Christ Jesus. They were foreshadowed by the ancient nation of Israel on the day that atonement sacrifices were offered up for the sins of the whole nation that they might enjoy relationship with God as his purchased people. Israel’s faithful kings acted as judges. To judge means to execute justice and to deliver from sin and oppression and from those who practice such. Hence the tribes of Israel while rejoicing in the peace, plenty and security during the reign of wise King Solomon pictured the obedient ones of humankind who gather to the King greater than Solomon and who are delivered from all oppressors at the battle of Armageddon. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The inward sense of Jehovah’s law has not changed for the spiritual Israelites. The remnant of these can now say to Jehovah God: “Thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou safest in the throne judging right.” (Ps. 9:4) Beyond this, Jehovah is also determined to maintain the right of the stranger class, now that his kingdom by Christ was set up in 1914. This class must be aided to live in peace and spiritual prosperity with the remnant of the “Israel of God”. This class they must never oppress, but must love them as themselves. (Lev. 25:35) They must judge righteously respecting the stranger and not pervert the judgment of the stranger. Otherwise, Jehovah will be a swift witness against them and cast them out of his Theocratic organization.—Deut. 1:16; 24:17. IV </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">12/1</span></p>

We are subjected to all kinds of enemy pressure to crack us and make us burst and so to unfit us to bear the commission from God. Hence it must be the power of our great Commissioner that helps us to stand the great mishandling of this totalitarian world and to hold fast the commission and prove worthy of being retained in his service. All the steam-roller regimentation of the postwar world down till Armageddon will fail to break God’s earthen vessels and to rob them of their treasure.

<p><span class="font3">There will be no </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">everlasting</span><span class="font3"> life in the postwar “new order”, but such will be only in the new world of God’s creation. It is time for all honest seekers of life to get at unity with those preparing to live in the righteous new world. Jehovah God is not at unity with this present wicked and imperfect world. He and it disagree thoroughly. That is why he will destroy it at the battle of Armageddon. This is a cause for alarm, even though it does not mean he will ever destroy this globe upon which we live. Only those now seeking to prove worthy of life in His new world have any assurances from his Word of getting through that battle alive and being admitted into the new world of endless peace. “The earth abideth for ever.” (Eccl. 1:4) Hence, instead of destroying this very good global creation, Jehovah’s purpose is reasonable, namely, to destroy those who destroy or defile the earth.

Yes, in the eyes of the worldly-wise. What Saul (or the apostle Paul) did thenceforth he himself tells when speaking to the elder brethren from Ephesus; he said he preached “publicly, and from house to house”. (Acts 20: 20, 21) Paul’s course may have seemed still more foolish in that he was mobbed, stoned, beaten, imprisoned and persecuted in all manner of ways for his zealous ministry as a preacher of the gospel from house to house. But Paul was wise. He took the seemingly foolish course of preaching from house to house because the greatest Preacher of all time, Christ Jesus, set him the example and also instructed him to do so.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh.—Joel 2:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At Pentecost Jesus’ followers were anointed when they were begotten of God. Although the spirit is poured out upon all consecrated flesh of God’s servants and handmaidens, yet it is not upon these as mere fleshly human creatures that God’s spirit or active force is poured out, baptizing them. Christ’s bride is to be spiritual, heavenly, and the spirit is poured out upon the members thereof as those who are begotten of God as his spiritual children. Naturally the baptism or outpouring of the spirit comes upon them while they are in the flesh; and the holy spirit of God operates through their fleshly bodies. Hence the anointing with the spirit had to wait until those who had consecrated themselves to God through Christ were “born again” or “born from above” and thereby became the spiritual children of the heavenly Father. Then they received the anointing with the holy spirit, as Jesus did. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">8/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A fool uttereth all his anger; but a wise man keepeth it back and stilleth it.—Prov. 29:11, A. 8. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The wise man takes thought for consequences and carefully weighs what will result if he gives way on the spot to anger. He feels anger, because there is occasion for it; but he realizes that to act instantly while in that disturbed or indignant frame of mind might cause harm rather than good. Hence he exercises self-control, with knowledge of God’s will and with endurance of the anger-provoking factors or events; and he holds himself in from careless, unrestrained expression of it. With holding it in there comes to him power, particularly if he looks to his great Helper, Jehovah God. At length he is able to still his anger and to reason clearly and then to act according to the line of God’s will and for the best interests of all concerned. He sees it is well not to harbor anger over too long a time, because the anger might harden him into an unwise mode of action, so committing sin.—Eph. 4: 25-27.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">At the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible.—1 Cor. 15:52.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Such “last trump” is not literal, but is symbolic, and denotes a mighty proclamation at the end of this world. The proclamation which is trumpeted forth is that Satan’s lease of power, his uninterrupted rule, has ended, and that the Kingdom of God through Christ has been established. This proclamation began to go forth in A.D. 1914 among the angels of heaven, but was sounded with special volume and emphasis after Satan and his demons were defeated in the “war in heaven” and flung down to the earth. Then the Lord Jesus came to the temple for judgment, amid the sounding of the trumpet by the angels. First then it was, beginning at his arrival in 1918, that the sleeping ones, “the dead in Christ,” were raised first, “raised incorruptible.” W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">4/15</span></p>

The worldly nations still keep up the encirclement of them and are conspiring on a world-wide scale to close in on them just prior to the battle of Armageddon to wipe them out utterly. Such antagonism and persecutions against Jehovah’s witnesses will not cease in the postwar period. His witnesses will stand isolated. Nevertheless, we see that Jehovah stands ready to go forth and to fight against all those nations, just as he did in ancient times in the day of violent battle against the enemies of his typical people. We wait upon him to bring us glorious deliverance by his “strange act” against such nations and the “dragon” organization which wars against us. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">It is God’s will that the world rulers be advised of Jehovah’s purpose to set up a Government. The gospel message of His kingdom is therefore a challenge to all governments of Satan’s world. It puts the rulers to the test. The compulsory appearing of the Lord’s witnesses before worldly authorities opens up the grand opportunity to declare the challenging message with all boldness, in order that this may be “for a testimony against them and the Gentiles”. It shows that such worldly authorities are not a part of God’s kingdom nor representatives thereof and are not ruling by divine right. To testify before them is a high privilege, and no witness of Jehovah should falter or fail to seize the opportunity to put in a testimony for the Kingdom when brought before worldly authorities to answer for his faith. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/13</span></p>

They regard the vindication of Jehovah’s name as of the highest moment, and rejoice that the Kingdom will accomplish that vindication. Also all their blessings of the eternity they hope to enjoy on this earth are dependent upon that same Kingdom. The King thereof died for them, his “other sheep”, as well as died for the ‘Tittle flock” of royal sheep. They love their Savior and King, and they also delight in his happiness, one feature of which is his bride. They are not ashamed to associate with the remnant of his bride yet on earth, nor to be seen in company with these ambassadors of the royal Bridegroom.

In the seventh year from 1922, namely, in 1928, the last of a series of annual judgment messages was released. The tenor of that message discloses that the last of the “seven last plagues” was sent forth upon antitypieal Egypt, the world. Does that mean the modern likeness of the tenth plague in Egypt has struck? The facts say Yes. Does that mean the firstborn of spiritual Egypt, where our Lord was killed, have been smitten? Yes, smitten by Jehovah’s judgment message. Now the world’s firstborn ones in religion, politics and commerce are dead in His sight and as respects his witnesses and their companions.

(1 Thess. 3: 2) Timothy was an assistant of Paul. Because of Timothy’s faithfulness and devotion to Jehovah God and his Christ, Paul acted by the spirit of God and appointed Timothy to serve as one of the governing body of the Christian church in that day. Hence Paul assigned to him as well as Titus to make appointments of elders to service in the Theocratic organization. In this regard, however, Paul warned Timothy to exercise great care, saying: “Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep thyself pure.” (1 Tim. 5:22) Were Timothy to make appointments to service hastily, and without due prayer and consideration, it might result that unsuitable persons would be appointed.

<p><span class="font3">Christ continues to rule in the midst of his foes. Armageddon, “the battle of that great day of God Almighty,” becomes unavoidable, to remove all such opponents, who refuse to bow willingly. By unsurpassed violence in that conflict, Jehovah God, through his King, will destroy Satan and all his demonic and human rule. It is then that Christ’s thousand-year reign as King unopposed begins. By the binding of Satan before the millennial reign begins Christ puts down, brings to nought, or abrogates all opposing rule, authority and power. He crushes them all out of existence under his feet. (Ps. 110:1, 2) Such accomplishment marks the final end of Satan’s world or organization. That final end draws near, as Jehovah’s witnesses hasten onward to finish the ‘preaching of this gospel of the kingdom in all the world for a witness unto all nations’.—Matt. 24:14.

Those who use their tongues rebelliously against God and his rightful rule of the earth bring upon themselves a break or an interruption to the continuance of their life-force or spirit. At the battle of Armageddon Jehovah will deal out death to all worldly rulers opposing the rule of his Kingdom by Christ Jesus. “He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.” (Ps. 76:12) In the time of the resurrection under Christ’s rule, God will not send forth his spirit or life-force to restore to life any such as wickedly fight against his King during the battle of Armageddon. At that battle God will demand their life, and his Warrior King will execute them. (Eccl. 8:8; 12:7) No fighters against God go to heaven.

<p><span class="font3">The wedding garment pictures that which must follow after one becomes a member of God’s called and chosen company espoused to his Son. The garment comes from the King Jehovah. It represents the Kingdom service on earth which he freely gives, in that he anoints those whom he begets and adopts as his children for heavenly royalty. By such anointing he commissions them to act as his witnesses and to proclaim the Kingdom gospel and to increase the Kingdom interests among all persons of good-will. This anointing or commission and the privileges of serving as His ambassadors are common to all his spirit-begotten ones whom he calls and chooses for a place in the Kingdom.

Which things also we speak, not in the words [technical, philosophic language of the world] which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the holy [spirit] teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual [or, expressing spiritual things with the spiritual language that the Bible uses as inspired by God’s spirit].” (12, 13) A man of this world who has its spirit and supports it does not have any desire for these things disclosed by God’s spirit and cannot understand them.

Such ones are those “other sheep” that have already been brought by the Good Shepherd into company with the last members of the “little flock”. Like the remnant these “other sheep” appreciate that the only treasure that will survive the fiery battle of Armageddon and continue unsinged and unconsumed into the New World is “this treasure” of the blessed ministry, the service to Jehovah God and his glorious King Christ Jesus.

It means keeping his commandments with loving obedience, specially his command to be his witness. One who honors God is not ashamed to bear witness to him; for silence would be a failure to confess him. Further, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">honor</span><span class="font3"> would mean the son’s keeping integrity by unswerving faithfulness to the Father, that God the Father may thus have an exemplary son by whom to give answer to Satan and his seed who reproach Jehovah God.—Prov. 27:11; Isa. 58:13,14.

By no force of Scriptural reasoning could drinking it picture the disciples’ drinking in the life-giving merits of Jesus’ lifeblood, with cancellation of sin going along with it. As to how this blood is used for removal of sin, the Scriptures speak of no blood-drinking, but say: “Unto him that loved us, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ivashed</span><span class="font3"> us from our sins in his own blood.” (Rev. 1:5) To harmonize with the Scriptural interpretation, drinking the Memorial wine as if it were his blood pictures that the drinker follows in Jesus’ footsteps and takes part in his death. Not that he becomes a part of Jesus’ ransom or atoning sacrifice, but that he undergoes a death of faithfulness according to Christ’s example and in company with him. Jesus died a reproachful death on the tree, where his blood was poured forth, the “blood of his cross”. IV </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Murder of a person can be committed without killing him physically, by bringing reproach and misrepresentation upon him and thereby stirring up hatred in the hearts of others against him. A thing God classes alongside of hands stained with innocent blood is a heart that devises wicked imaginations. This means not only plotting injurious malicious schemes against another, but also conjuring up imagined things against him. This not only is a waste of time but also injures the one imagining. If such one has not the full facts, if he does not see the case clearly; then, before he and others can see it, why should he imagine something of wicked implications against his brother?

In fact, the expressions “begotten of God” and “born of God” are used interchangeably.

Biblically, then, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">beget</span><span class="font3"> does not refer to the time of conception of a child or offspring in the womb.

This did not mean the individuals thereof were infallible, but they looked to God for guidance by his spirit. Aside from the apostles, just what were the names or designations of the various kinds of service those other elders were appointed to render is not recorded. That was the first church or congregation to be established. The governing body of all the later Christian churches in all the earth was located with the church at Jerusalem, as long as that city continued in existence or the apostles stayed there.

Not according to the apostle’s form of address: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font3"> write unto you, little children, . . . unto you, fathers, . . . unto you, young men.” (12-14) Writing to all alike, “little children,” “fathers,” and “young men”, about the anointing from the Holy One and its abiding in them, the apostle John indicates that at the time of the begetting by the spirit of God to be a spiritual son of God the consecrated servant of God is anointed with the spirit and baptized into the body of Christ. By the help of the spirit or active force of God, he must now increase in knowledge of the truth and in appreciation of his anointing and must increase in his ability to carry out the things the anointing commissions him to perform. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses accepted the little “book” of meat in due season which his Messenger provided by his “faithful and wise servant” organization. The spiritual meat was the steady revealments of truth as to Jehovah’s King and kingdom, and the vindication of his name at the battle of Armageddon by means of the kingdom. The spiritual food was not for private selfish enjoyment with a lingering sweetness in the mouth, but was to be proclaimed worldwide because it pertained to peoples, nations, tongues and kings. These certainly must be informed before God executes judgment. As the angel said: “Thou must prophesy again over [concerning] many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.”-—10:11, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan.

This is the favorable day of flight to real security against execution at Armageddon. This is the day to preach the gospel of the Kingdom and thereby prove our worthiness to salvation and also to point others to the only refuge of salvation. To the Kingdom valley, flanked by Jehovah’s “mountains”, namely, Jesus the King and all the holy angels with him, even thither is where the faithful remnant of God’s witnesses have fled. Thither too must all those men of good-will flee who would escape being annihilated with those nations that fight against God’s remnant.

Not that they go to heaven, but they join the remnant at the temple condition, and there render what service God assigns to them. In this way they “serve God day and night in his temple”. Their virginity they strive to maintain by keeping their integrity and preserving themselves “unspotted from the world”. They could not keep such virginity or purity in this world unless they gave God’s holy kingdom the first place in their lives and affections. Such virgin companions at the King’s palace join in the feasting. The remnant pass along the festal good things in brotherly love to one another and also to the Lord’s “other sheep”.

Every passing circumstance has an effect upon his frame of mind and he cannot direct his course of action according to the fixed rules of righteousness of God’s Word. He yields to the temptations, the pressures, the stimulations to selfish conduct and evildoing that play upon him in his various surroundings. He is excitable and is quickly roused to unreasonable anger, with outbursts of speech and action which are not to good effect. Thus he is disarmed and unprotected against invasion of the demons or the spirit of this world, and is easily taken captive by forces and powers that issue forth from sources other than from God.

His invisible organization is no mere childish imagination, but is a powerful foe to all godliness and righteousness upon this earth.

Now these may demonstrate their integrity toward God amid the present wickedness and opposition of the old world to Jehovah and his purpose. By this they show their worthiness of everlasting life through Christ Jesus.

His spirit is not bound by religion, but puts religion to flight. Those having his spirit are not blind nor in bondage to religion, but are free. Such freedom results in their using great plainness of speech, or boldness in showing forth God’s glory.

No; but the Head of the church says that the offended one, whose efforts at reconciliation have failed, may refuse to have anything further to do with such one until he comes for a reconciliation.

<p><span class="font3">Since 1918, and more particularly since 1931, thousands of the great flock of “other sheep” have been devoting themselves to God in full consecration. For the reason that God does the calling, none of them may assume that because they consecrate to God and symbolize their consecration by water baptism they have a heavenly calling. No more so than the faithful men of old had a heavenly calling. Consecration to God is made without laying down any conditions to Him. Sincere consecration says to God: “Thy will be done.” The consecrated one may hope for a heavenly inheritance only if God’s will is to call such one, and which will God manifests by begetting the consecrated one. That means also that such one has been made acceptable for begetting by being justified through faith in Christ’s blood and then being offered by the High Priest as a sacrifice.

He knew that if they acted unfaithfully as to his law regarding the stranger and oppressed the “stranger” minority and turned them away from their God-given right, then it would lead to contempt of other parts of his Theocratic law. It would be only a matter of time before the Israelites oppressed their brethren. This would mean eventual disaster for the entire nation. The righteousness of Jehovah’s Theocratic organization must take in the just and loving treatment of the stranger or sojourner.

Raising a new convert early to a responsible service in the Theocratic organization might cause him to be puffed up with pride and self-importance and to forget that he is a servant of God and not a boss over God’s people. Forgetting this, he might grasp ambitiously for power as Satan did contrary to Theocratic rule. The elder performing duties as an overseer or superintendent should not be one who would bring undue reproach upon the congregation because of improper conduct outside among the world. Appointing such one to special service in the congregation would prove a snare to him, deceiving him into imagining that his reproachful behavior outside does not matter.

This suggests the subjection of the members of Christ’s body or “church” to fiery trials and affliction.

It stands for affliction, being called the “bread of affliction”, due to separation from Egypt or the world. (Deut. 16:3) The privilege of being body members of Christ was given to his disciples. Their eating the Memorial bread pictures that, as a united body holding to Him their Head, they are enduring afflictions with Him and for His name’s sake.

For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.” (Vss. 19, 20) Jehovah’s preachers know the value of their work. They will keep on preaching the gospel, without stopping, until the final end of this world and of its wisdom comes at the battle of Armageddon.

<p><span class="font3">The manifestations of such spirit or invisible active energy of the all-powerful God are many and of great variety. The Bible records many such. A case of divine inspiration was Joseph’s interpretation of Pharaoh’s prophetic dream. God by remote control moved, by energy invisible, upon the mind of his servant to speak with understanding the things not possible for Joseph to unravel of himself. From wherever his lofty, glorious station is Jehovah God sent forth his spirit or invisible energy and beamed it directly upon the devoted Joseph.

With the flight of years, as death invades their ranks, the number of faithful remnant members decreases. Already the number of good-will persons with marked foreheads outstrips the remnant many times. They are now doing the bulk of the field work of publication from house to house and by home Bible studies.

Though it appear partly dark because of persecutions and oppression by enemies, yet Jehovah’s clear light of truth is shining and his blessings upon his people help to brighten the situation and prevent it from being altogether dark. It is a day by itself, for it precedes the 1000-year reign of his beloved Son. It is a particular day that Jehovah God has reserved for himself for vindicating his name. Therefore it is known as “Jehovah’s day”. At the evening of His day he will rise up and go forth by his King to give his own testimony to his supremacy and universal sovereignty.

<p><span class="font3">Rather than east off all his ties and spoil his reliability and integrity toward his Lord; rather than quit His service because of the suffering it leads to, the servant cleaves unshakably to his Lord and asks for some helpful recognition from the Lord that he is still retained as His servant. The real issue and cause for judgment is whether the servant is in a covenant with God to serve him, and whether in his heart the servant is denying that covenant and willingly breaking or failing to carry it out. The vital question is one of covenant-keeping, the fulfilling of one’s consecration to do the will of the Lord and Master. Only by being faithful to covenant obligations as His servant can his remnant properly beseech Him to answer them in faithfulness and righteousness.

Today the Good Shepherd Christ Jesus is gathering out from all nations, kindreds, people and tongues his “other sheep”.

<p><span class="font3">Like Moses on the mountaintop in Jehovah’s presence, and also like the Greater Moses at his Father’s right hand, his witnesses on earth do not veil their faces from Jehovah’s glory. They ask for no veil in between, but admire the glory reflected in the face of Jehovah’s Son and King, Christ Jesus the Mediator. This is what makes the change in the lives of those thus beholding it, for they must shed forth to others the light concerning God’s glory. The more of the glory of this light we receive, the more thereof we must radiate forth, and thus we are the more transformed. Our minds are renewed or renovated, although no bodily or facial change may be discernible. It is the light of the glorious message that we shed forth that produces the difference in us.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">He that hasteth with his feet sinneth.—Prov. 19:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A consecrated person, as soon as getting over with or off from what he considers the minimum requirements of serving God, may take the rest of the time for him to do according to selfish, pleasure-seeking inclinations. His </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">feet</span><span class="font3"> are not pleasing to Jehovah God. It is not possible to please God’s organization and be at unity with your faithful brethren and at the same time play around with the Devil’s organization or run a course parallel with its course. The two things do not go together. If a person’s feet are inclined to hasten in a certain direction that works mischief in the world; if he lets his feet bear him thither because he “likes to get away and do something else”, and he takes a chance amid unsafe circumstances, he is likely to find sometime that he has taken a losing chance. If we do not heed God’s counsel, but imitate the mischievous course of this world, we cannot look for His protection. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall. Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Prov. 16:18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now in the time of the end totalitarian dictators or would-be dictators exalt themselves to power and pelf and divide the honors with other like proud ones. The religious hierarchy and clergy seek for good standing with the world. The wise prefer to keep company with the lowly, those low in their own eyes, because they recognize Jehovah and Christ as “The Higher Powers”. Only thus do the wise gain the favor or grace of the Lord God; for he resists the proud. In the battle of Armageddon he will spoil those who have unrighteously spoiled the peoples of earth and persecuted his witnesses, whereas he will raise up his downtrodden and despoiled servants and beautify them with a blessed place in the New World.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—2 John 8, A. S. V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The final test of integrity amid this present wicked world is nearing its climax, Will those of the remnant and of their good-will companions lose out on appreciation? Will they let their desires gravitate back to the selfish attractions of this world and so excuse themselves from their present privileges of feeding on the Theocratic truth and serving it abroad to others? The Theocratic Government is at hand, and Satan’s “old world” organization is facing early destruction. A decisive choice must be made between the everlasting Government that will dominate Jehovah’s universe and the swiftly outgoing old world. For those who love Him with all their heart and soul there is but one choice. It is the one they made at their consecration to him, namely, “Seek ye first the kingdom of God.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a .. . nation.—Phil. 2:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witnesses can be law-abiding servants of God and preachers of the gospel in whatever land they dwell and under whatever form of government. They are not dangerous, armed political plotters, but their work is without political purpose and effect. Worldly rulers need not be uneasy about their free activity. At the same time no such ruler has any right to interfere with them, because they are under a command and authority higher than he. Sending them forth as Jesus did like unarmed and helpless sheep in the midst of wolves, he was not making them the prey of wicked worldly men, but was sending them forth in the true strength and defense. Such strength and defense are in God and in his spirit and Word. Jesus advised them of what to expect of men, thereby showing their need of good courage and dependence on God.

<p><span class="font3">Ye </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love.—1 Pet. 1:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus Peter says that the spirit-begotten ones must be obeying the truth through the spirit to keep their lives pure and to have pure love. This accords with the fact that, even before one’s begetting and receiving of God’s spirit, one must hear and believe the truth. Jesus brought the truth, and also said he is the Way, and the Truth, and the Life. Since water is used to symbolize truth, because of its cleansing power, it is written (1 John 5:6-8, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A. 8.</span><span class="font3"> F.) : “This is he that came by water [truth] and blood, even Jesus Christ; . . . there are three who bear witness, the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and the three agree in one.” Hence the spirit, Jehovah’s active force, is not given apart from God’s Word of truth. By going contrary to the Word and way of truth we act grievously against the spirit of truth. We are admonished against doing so.—Eph. 4:30. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">We may not always see the members of his organization that the Father uses to hand on or impart the spiritual food. God often uses the invisible members of his organization, such as seraphim and cherubim and angels under Christ Jesus, to send the needed information, counsel and guidance to us. In the wilderness the Israelites did not see the invisible ones whom God used to produce the manna on which they fed for forty years; but they knew it came in fulfillment of His word, and they accepted it and nourished themselves with it. (Ex. 16:13-35) If the spiritual food or teaching comes through his organization, then, whether we see the agency through which it comes or not, we honor the “mother” organization by giving first and most serious attention to such food, feeding at </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">her</span><span class="font3"> table.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">And, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.—Rev. 1:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After his coming to the temple, in 1918, Christ Jesus begins the active abolition of death and hell. It is now under way. How? By the raising of his faithful body-members, who were sleeping in death until his temple appearance. When the last of the faithful remnant will have finished his earthly service and Christ Jesus will have raised him instantaneously from the dead to reign with him, then the enemy death will have been completely abolished, put down, rendered powerless and destroyed as far as the members of Christ’s body are concerned. (Rev. 2:11) This does not wait till the thousand-year reign of Christ is finished, for his 144,000 body-members are appointed to live and reign with him a thousand years, while Satan is bound. Thereby they share with him in the first resurrection, and it is unto life immortal beyond the power of the second death. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">God’s faithful remnant of consecrated and anointed ones of today </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font3"> be His witnesses, reflecting His glory, as Christ Jesus did on earth and still does in heaven above. He, our Mediator, has taken away the veil by revealing and declaring to us Jehovah God. We must shine. God’s glory is now revealed through the gospel of his kingdom come, which kingdom will vindicate his name for eternity. His glory shines through the “glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God”. Its radiance is the “light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ”, the Greater Moses. We must reflect this glory by refraining from preaching ourselves and by speaking of the glory of Jehovah and the glory of his kingdom by his Son. So doing, we are His witnesses.—2 Cor. 4:4-6. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept.—Num. 11: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The “multitude” of today are subject to the same tests of endurance and the same provings of faith as those that are applied to the remnant. It is disastrous for them to look back to the world, symbolic Egypt, and to its pleasures which they have left behind them, and to murmur because of the hardness of the way in which they are now traveling to the New World. Jehovah’s people have a right to food that is necessary and according to His due season. But they have no right to murmur and complain against His provision, comparing their state with that of the world, and putting material things of earth above the spiritual sustenance, privileges, and freedom they enjoy. And the “stranger” class have no right to be provokers of complaint and discontent against Jehovah and his Greater Moses, in the manner of the mixed multitude out in the wilderness.

That is all that awaits any of the “virgins” forsaking the companionship and the united service with the remnant who abide faithful to Jehovah and his Christ. Let as many of the virgins as possible remain faithful. Though they be many more than the 144,000 of the “bride” class, yet, after the full-length test of integrity has sifted out even many of the “virgins” class, those who endure to Jehovah’s final vindication at Armageddon will compose a ‘great multitude whom no man can number’.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The holy spirit this signifying, that the way into the holy place hath not yet been made manifest, while the first tabernacle is yet standing.—Heb. 9:8, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Nothing in all the Scriptures indicates that the faithful ones of old upon whom the spirit came, both men and women down to John the Baptist, received any heavenly calling in consequence of the special application of God’s holy active force to them as his servants. No right to life in heaven was accorded to them thereby. No heavenly hopes were opened to their understanding, nor were they put in the way leading to life in heaven. The highest prospect held out for them is to enjoy a “better resurrection” to life everlasting on a perfected earth under the rule of Christ. Not that they might not have qualified if given the opportunity, but because it was not God’s purposed time for his spirit to operate to human creatures in behalf of a heavenly inheritance.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">It shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh.—Joel 2:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Final fulfillment of this did not mean that the Lord’s faithful spirit-begotten remnant had not been anointed at the time of each one’s spirit-begettal before 1919. Baptism with the spirit had been going on through all the centuries since Pentecost of A.D. 33 toward all who got the truth of his Word and who consecrated fully to him through Christ and who were then “born of water and spirit”. Hence the event of 1919 meant that the spirit or the arousing, energizing, life-infusing active force of God was poured out upon his anointed remnant to bring them to life again in his service. It renewed them unto the privileges and responsibility of their anointing. And then came A.D. 1922. Another great assembly, in the late summer, highlighted that year. Then the Lord’s spirit of service filled his people preparatory to expressing itself in field service. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

He reigns among his multifarious enemies at the earth by force of his irresistible dominance. The Theocracy is here to stay! Through it alone comes a durable peace for men of good-will on earth. In postwar years it is unavoidable that The Theocracy meet in head-on collision the worldly organization of Satan the Devil for the international collaboration of the nations. It is in the best of order, therefore, that God’s consecrated people be clad in full Theocratic armor and be acting within the safe enfolding of a fully Theocratic organization and arrangement. Religiocracy will fight against them with all its postwar allies, but will perish.

<p><span class="font3">The outpouring of the holy spirit from and after 1919 does not mean that the holy-spirit comforter has not been taken out of the way of the &quot;man of sin” class, permitting the revelation of that “son of perdition” class of religionists. The full and complete manifestation of that class, or “mystery of iniquity”, comprising both the clergy of “Christendom” and also the “evil servant” class, takes place in the time of the end, from and after 1914, when the “evil servant” class manifest themselves and throw in their lot with the religionists. The holy spirit being removed from all such ones, there is no restraining power upon them against boldly displaying themselves and showing forth the spirit of the Devil.

Jehovah’s witnesses and the multitude of their companions will go through that blood-red battle of Armageddon and come out on the other side in the free New World of righteousness. The pursuing demon-led Egyptian hosts, rashly pushing on to the final assault against Jehovah’s witnesses, will enter into the Red sea of Armageddon, but will never come out alive. Satan’s entire world will be swallowed up in destruction. Then, on freedom’s shores in the New World, all of Jehovah’s delivered people will, under the Greater Moses, Christ Jesus, sing praises to Him who gains the victory, “Jehovah of Hosts, mighty in battle.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span></p>

Jehovah’s witnesses are, many of them, like Peter and John, who boldly preached before the learned Jewish Supreme Court.

<p><span class="font3">The woman is God’s own “woman”, his holy universal organization. That organization remained faithful to God and hence came into enmity with Satan and his organized seed. God thus foretold that one of the members of his heavenly organization would be brought forth from it and would destroy Satan and his organization and thereby would execute to the full his mother’s enmity toward such wicked opposers of God. The promised seed is primarily Christ Jesus. His faithful followers are taken from among men and become members of God’s universal organization. God’s “woman” is thus the mother of a Liberator, the promised One who brings freedom. This shows that God’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">woman</span><span class="font3"> never yielded to Satan’s importunities nor came into bondage to him.

But God has now justified them in spirit by his favorable judgment of them at the temple judgment-trial and has glorified them with present-day glorious privileges of service as his witnesses and ambassadors. The false charges that the world lays against them in worldly tribunals do not count with God; for he justifies his elect remnant for their faithfulness. They must, however, be conformed to the image of the Chief One of the called, chosen and faithful company, Christ Jesus, by keeping faithful to God unto the end, even clear through the big fight at Armageddon.

And he reigns! In all parts of the earth where his faithful people are, there they confess that he reigns by his anointed King Christ Jesus, and they acknowledge Jehovah God and his King as the true “Higher Powers”. They subject themselves to these “powers that be” and obey them rather than men.

Baptism into his name means that the one thus symbolizing his consecration to the Father has given his unchangeable word to live thenceforth in fulfillment of Jehovah’s purpose and that he has taken his stand on Jehovah’s side of the great issue of universal domination. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span></p>

Merely by the name </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Christian</span><span class="font3"> the faithful remnant could not be distinguished from religionists who misuse the name by applying it to themselves. Providentially, long ago God’s mouth had prophetically directed these words to his remnant: “Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen.” This prophetic designation he now drew to their attention. Hence in full keeping with Isaiah 62: 2 the remnant, in 1931, recognized the name </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah's witnesses</span><span class="font3"> and intelligently chose to be called by it because it was from God’s mouth.

They must be faithful even to death. (1 Cor. 15: 36; Rev. 2:10) They must be buried in the likeness of Christ’s death, fulfilling to the final end their covenant with Jehovah God. Ah, but when so dying, while the “last trump” is sounding out its glorious message, these faithful finishers of their earthly course do not sleep in the tombs as fellow members were obliged to do till 1918. Jesus having come to the temple and judged them faithful unto death, he raised them to life as in a moment or twinkling of an eye.

Neither has any human authority any right to tell us to veil over the light and to darken and black it out to others. Things that men are ashamed of they hide over by deceit.

They do not say, ‘It is a long time yet to the wind-up, and, according to the present understanding of Bible chronology, six thousand years of human history will end first in the coming seventies and till then it is a long stretch to serve the Lord continuously and undividedly.’ No; the faithful watchers and servants do not worry about chronology, whether it is to be the second or third watch of the night, or even if the apparent extension of time is one day more, until tomorrow.

<p><span class="font3">During the time of Solomon’s reign when he was faithful and wise toward God, whom he represented on the throne, there was freedom from fear and want in that Theocratic nation. Especially was this so because there was freedom of worship of Jehovah God by all twelve tribes of Israel. “Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry. And Judah and Israel dwelt safely.” (1 Ki. 4:20, 25) Inasmuch as Solomon prefigured the promised Ruler, that joyous period of the twelve tribes of Israel under King Solomon prefigured the blessed condition of the faithful and obedient people of earth under Jehovah’s heavenly King, and all as a result of world regeneration. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The spirit of God that came upon Christ’s followers at Pentecost confirmed their ordination from God. It not only enabled them to preach the good news in foreign languages but also opened up the Scriptures to them and helped them to proceed according to God’s Word. The law covenant had shown them up as condemned to death, but God’s spirit now given to them under the new covenant was unto life. It qualified them to serve the gospel of life. The new covenant has as its purpose the taking out from among the nations of this world a “people for his name”. Quite properly, then, the Mediator of the new covenant was the chief witness for Jehovah’s name. All his followers who come under the covenant that he mediates must likewise be Jehovah’s witnesses. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Destruction of death will not be accomplished until all those who are in the graves solely as the result of Adam’s transgression in Eden have been brought out as amenable to the benefits of Christ’s ransom sacrifice and as susceptible to righteousness. That will open up to them the way to everlasting life, if they will walk therein. Under the reign of Christ the death which is by Adam is to be destroyed completely. The coming of Christ Jesus into the Kingdom as the One whose right it is to rule marks the beginning of his “presence”. As King and Judge he turns his face and attention to this earth and to the establishment of righteousness therein by the clearing out of the wicked. Thus he becomes present at the earth. His presence will continue till death’s destruction. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Such provision foreshadowed the right which Jehovah decrees as belonging to the “stranger” class today. For them to escape destruction at Armageddon with the blood-stained world, they must forsake all and flee to Jehovah’s Theocratic organization under Christ the High Priest and must put themselves under it. There they must abide for ever, inasmuch as Christ Jesus is deathless and abides a High Priest of God for ever and sits upon the throne of The Kingdom. To despise God’s refuge and forsake the side of his Theocratic organization means one thing: Such unappreciative ones come again under the blood-guilt of the world as breakers of his everlasting covenant. At the latest, therefore, they must suffer destruction with Satan’s world by the avenging sword of Jehovah’s mighty Executioner, Christ Jesus, at Armageddon.

He is the great Producer of the myriads of spirit creatures that inhabit the unseen heavenly realms, and of which his only begotten Son, Christ Jesus, is Chief. Because the active force which Jehovah uses to accomplish his perfect will is invisible and yet produces results visible or sensible to man, that active force is also called </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">spirit. </span><span class="font3">Being always used to a holy or righteous end, it is called His “holy spirit”. Exercised by him throughout the universe with many and different manifestations, yet it is but one holy spirit. That spirit of God was sent through space to operate in preparing this earth for man’s home. When man came into existence, it was the life-force or spirit that emanated from Jehovah God that caused man to live, and which life-force is sustained by breathing.

(Neh. 9:30; Zech. 7:12) Since then, more than thirty-five centuries have elapsed, but the same “Father of spirits” lives. He who was able to use men and women by the operation of his holy spirit so long ago, men and women who had no outlook of life in heaven but whose expectations were of eternal life on earth in the New World; that same great Source of the holy spirit is able to use it in connection with devoted persons of good-will living here below today.—Heb. 12: 9.

The people are not the sovereign rulers, and their officers are not the mere servants of the people, to receive their appointments from such people. In the visible part of the Theocratic organization on earth all its members are the servants of the Most High God, to do His will as they have covenanted to do. Any brethren among them who have appointments and responsibilities to render special work are not the people’s servants subject to their dictates, but are the servants of the Lord God The Theocrat. They are responsible to him and either stand or fall to him. Thus his consecrated people are a great servant body, engaged in serving God and his Christ.

Never will it fail, because it is not human, being neither of nor by men, but being heavenly, perfect, absolutely uncorruptible by religion and selfishness. The making disciples of all nations is to bring those persons of the nations who do become disciples into harmony with Jehovah’s glorious Theocracy through Christ. Efforts of Jehovah’s witnesses in all nations do not have as their goal the setting up one man on earth as chief spiritual authority over all believers throughout the earth. Such a religious head on earth can not be and is not the binding tie of all true Christians. True disciples follow Christ Jesus, and hence he is their Leader and Head, even be it that he is invisible in the heavens. Our adherence to him as Jehovah’s anointed King is therefore the binding tie. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">12/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The blood of sin-offering victims was not drunk, but was spinkled at the mercy seat in the Most Holy. The fleshly bodies of sin-offering victims were not eaten by priests or Levites, but were carried without the camp and burned there. (Heb. 13:11-13) It was the blood that made atonement when sprinkled at the mercy seat; the atonement power did not rest in the bodies of the victims that were burned. So the eating of the bloodless Memorial bread can not represent justification from sin through Jesus’ atoning sacrifice. It pictures doing God’s will in Christ after the member of Christ’s body has been justified from sin by faith in his blood, and then suffering affliction in the flesh for so doing. Eating and drinking at the Memorial, therefore, represents meeting the requirements which Jehovah God set up in Christ Jesus for gaining entrance into the Kingdom.

<p><span class="font3">A person that has been given an appointment of service in God’s organization should keep on the job until God makes the change for him. If he leans to his own understanding and thinks he would like to do something else that attracts him off the job, and then makes the change for himself, he may cause division in the organization for a time. An illustration of this is found in the case of John, whose surname was Mark. (Acts 12:12, 25; 13:1-5; 15:36-41) Only after Mark had proved himself by a continuous record of faithfulness was the rift healed and he came back into Paul’s confidence. All considered, the best course is not to risk such a strain on one’s relationship to God’s organization. For unity, peace, and the operation of the witness work without interruption, the consistently faithful servant will stay on his assigned service appointment.

Hence only the predetermined select </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">few</span><span class="font3"> are found at the last among the chosen “holy nation”. The calling of so many is not because the predetermined number fixed by God is so great, but because so many after having been called fail to hold their places and hence others must be called in order to take the places these unfaithful ones vacate. Hence although so many are called during the time of opportunity, yet in the end Jehovah God will have just the worthy few that he predestinated to have, and thus his purpose does not fail because of the unfaithfulness of so many.

He will bring to nothing all the “understanding of the prudent” who made predictions of what politics, commerce and religion could do to create a better and finer world for the common man. No such wisdom of the world will save them when the “battle of that great day of God Almighty” strikes. The only thing now being done that will lead to salvation and survival through that battle and unto life in the new world of righteousness is the thing which this world calls “the foolishness of preaching”.

This divinely operated and guided force has thus indeed been a helper to them and of great comfort to them and has given them confidence.

This association of Father and Son in this joint reign precedes the Armageddon of destruction for Satan’s hosts. It is like the association together of the “kings of the east”, Darius and his nephew Cyrus. After Babylon was thrown down, King Darius the Mede took over the empire once dominated-by Babylon.

The household followed Abraham out of the native land, breaking whatever religious ties were involved. They undertook the uncertainties of the unknown land of Canaan with him and shared what reproaches fell upon him for worshiping Jehovah. None of them inherited the privilege of the Abrahamic promise. Likewise today, the “strangers” are not the heirs of God, but are his servants, and are companions of the remnant of joint-heirs of the Kingdom. Together with the remnant they worship the same God.

The “strange work” preceding God’s “strange act” at Armageddon is not yet done. The postwar era comes with its human efforts and machinery for global peace.

Those in the graves, in God’s memory, as covered by the propitiatory power of Jesus’ sacrifice, will then come forth.

The reason why was that the word of truth explaining the great mystery of the Kingdom and showing the open privilege of entering into it with Messiah Christ had not been preached. God must first send the Pioneer of the way. Christ Jesus was the first one to preach such truth and to invite men into the Kingdom, thereby engendering a hope of it in their hearts.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Be </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; . . . rejoicing in hope.—Rom. 12:2,11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Solely by the study and application of God’s Word is the consecrated mind renewed or renovated and brought in line with the new world of righteousness. This in turn changes the disposition or frame of mind, which disposition should not be lukewarm, halfhearted, listless or sluggish, but enthusiastically and wholeheartedly bent on carrying out one’s vow to God. Only in such way can one serve Him with fervor of spirit. The rejoicing in the hope set before us also helps to give added inclination to the direction of the mind and its impulses. Additionally, there should be a continued tendency to prayer, so that one is instant in prayer and, as soon as the emergency arises, betakes himself in prayer to God. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Feet that be swift in running to mischief . . . doth the Lord hate.—Prov, 6:18,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Here </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mischief</span><span class="font3"> does not mean innocent fun and playing of practical jokes, but means </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">evil, harm, damage, injury,</span><span class="font3"> and not mere vexation and annoyance. A person consecrated to God may lightly think he is not running to mischief by taking a certain course, but he does well to analyze first whether his feet are swiftly hastening to that end or result. After putting in time in field service for the record’s sake he feels he must get off and have a good time with or like those who do not seek life in the new world. His feet are bearing him to a harmful end, even if he may think that, on the surface, there is nothing wrong with it for him as a Christian. He forgets what Paul said: “I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">when I have preached to others,</span><span class="font3"> I myself should be a castaway.”—1 Cor. 9: 27. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The realization of their begettal by God’s spirit, and that present installment of God’s holy spirit or active force operating in their spiritual behalf, fill the heaven-bound sons of God with the hope of glory in Christ. Rightly they rejoice “in hope of the glory of God”. His holy spirit not only floods their hearts with love for Jehovah God and for his service in the footsteps of his obedient Son Christ Jesus; it also makes the begotten ones to see the hope that is set before them and to appreciate that it is for them and they must walk worthy of it now. To this end that holy spirit opens up the Scriptures to their understanding and appreciation. The rulers of this world do not have such knowledge or revelation in the things of God’s Word.—1 Cor. 2: 8-10. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">7/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Prophecies addressed to God’s universal organization or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">freewoman</span><span class="font3"> have also a direct application to the remnant of Christ’s body on earth today. During the centuries since Jesus was on earth the only members on earth of God’s universal organization Zion have been those produced as her children, namely, members of Christ’s body, the church. Necessarily, then, the prophecies pertaining to God’s universal organization, Zion or Jerusalem above, have at the same, time application to Christ’s body-members as her sole representatives on earth. Her representatives are at once the members of her daughter organization, the espoused virgin or bride of Christ, and are heirs to a place in God’s capital organization, New Jerusalem. Thus prophecies concerning the capital organization also apply to Christ’s bride, the members of his church. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">—Titus 3:10, Weymouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Paul thus wrote to the special servant Titus. In all cases of apostolic times it is the Lord, through his Theocratic organization as represented by its special servants, who instructs servants or congregations what to do. The servant acting for the Theocratic organization would give no assignments of service to the disturber of unity. To the church Paul wrote: “If any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.” (2 Thess. 3:14,15) One refusing to obey organization instructions should not be followed or imitated by others of the congregation, but should be helped to see the error of his way. If he falls into causing divisions in the congregation, then the Theocratic organization must step in through its authorized servants.

<p><span class="font3">The elders in the congregations, who were also spiritual overseers thereof, presided at meetings of the disciples. Any elder thus acting as chairman of a meeting would be the president of the gathering on that occasion. Another elder might preside over other affairs of the congregation and be president in that limited sphere. The brethren should co-operate well with such elders who lead them faithfully in God’s service. (1 Thess. 5:12,13) Religious clergymen and ecclesiastics who are desirous of wielding power over congregations prefer to give to the apostle’s word the thought of ruling over others. But the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(proistemi)</span><span class="font3"> used by the apostle has the meaning of keeping order and taking the lead and conducting the service of God. It never means oppressing and domineering over the brethren. IV </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">11/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.—1 Cor. 15:53.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Certainly, when sleeping in death, the members of Christ’s “body” were not immortal. Immortality is not inherent, but “put on”, first at the resurrection, and put on only by the glorified members of Christ’s body. Incorruptibility is the companion of immortality, as stated at 2 Timothy 1:10: “Christ Jesus, who indeed hath abolished death, and hath thrown light upon life and incorruptibility through means of the gladmessage.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font3"> By such miracle of God’s power the members of Christ’s body become like him “who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see”. (1 Tim. 6:15,16) The resurrecting of his body-members, the church, represents a glorious victory over the stubborn gates of hell by him who has the “keys of death and of hell”.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field.—Matt. 13:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Christ Jesus, who first proved worthy of the Kingdom and of being its King, was the One that fully appreciated its worth and inestimable privilege. While yet on earth he gave it the first and fullest place in his life. He likened it to a “pearl of great price”, of the finest luster. He compared it to a treasure hoard suddenly discovered in a field. To obtain such it was worth joyfully selling all that one had on earth. This beloved Son of God was himself willing to lay aside all his heavenly glory and then, besides that, to lay aside all material things on earth, even to the sacrifice of human life, in order to win God’s approval for the Kingdom and to qualify for its throne. The kingdoms of this world and their artificial, whooped-up glory never fascinated or tempted him for a second. —Matt. 4: 8-10. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s capital organization and his universal organization co-operate together in perfect unity according to his will. Together they form the only mountains to which to flee for complete safety; and in the “valley” sheltered and protected by them is a secure haven. His kingdom by his Christ is the only hope of deliverance for those oppressed by the Devil and his organization. It is the only hope of salvation for all seekers of life. It is by that kingdom that Jehovah God will yet go forth against the nations besieging his people and will destroy them all in the great fight at Armageddon, just as he fought by that same kingdom against Satan’s demon organization in the “war in heaven”, now past.

<p><span class="font3">Those good-will servants who receive life from the Son of God during his 1000-year reign are evidently the ones meant as “thy seed’s seed”, because they receive everlasting life on earth after the bride class gains eternal life through Christ in heaven. As God’s spirit came upon Bezaleel, Othniel, Gideon, Samson, Jephthah, David, Elijah and Elisha of old, without their being anointed by the spirit to membership in the body of Christ thereby, in like manner now the spirit of God is most manifestly come upon the devoted persons of good-will who are obeying the command to say, “Come.” They walk not after this world’s course, but follow Christ Jesus and keep themselves unspotted from the world.

<p><span class="font3">Being copiously anointed with the oil, Aaron exhaled a sweet and agreeable smell that was soothing, while he performed his priestly duties, being pleasing to God and acceptable to his brethren. Christ Jesus, the true High Priest, filled with God’s spirit, breathed out always an influence of peace and unity to his brethren, his disciples, and he prayed earnestly for the attaining and perfecting of their unity in him, particularly at this end of the world. (John 17) It is like such fragrant ointment, that is, it is Christlike, for his brethren and their companions to abide in oneness of purpose, effort and service at the Theocratic organization.

<p><span class="font3">In spite of total war, Jehovah’s witnesses have stuck to their commission which they know they have from God. They do not swerve from specializing on making a clear statement of the truth to all nations. With Christlike boldness and plainness of speech and the widest publicity in spreading the truth, they go from house to house, city to city and country to country. Their steadfast efforts are to increase the Kingdom interests. Due to this it becomes true on an everwidening scale that if any persons have the Kingdom gospel veiled from their sight, it is not the responsibility of Jehovah’s witnesses, but is their own. The good news is not hid to the “other sheep”, whom Jehovah’s Good Shepherd is now hunting and rescuing to the side of salvation. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Hope of life from the dead is not for only those who are Christ’s as members of his body, the church. Other men besides Christ’s body-members are accounted in God’s sight as having done good in this life. Such ones are his approved faithful servants of old. They, having died before the calling to the heavenly kingdom was opened up to Jesus’ followers, do not attain to the first resurrection, but are promised a “better resurrection” that is, better than that of the other human dead in the graves. They will have a “resurrection unto life”. At the beginning of Christ’s thousandyear rule they will be his visible representatives upon the earth, “princes in all the earth.” Thus, neither as respects them does the abolition of death wait till the expiration of His reign. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">None therefore could justify himself in God’s sight by force of so-called “character building” or “respectable morality” or “charitable works” and other attempts at self-righteousness. Justification must be by faith in Christ’s blood. The justification that comes by faith must be justification as to the flesh. Christ Jesus being born immaculate as a human, he possessed the right to everlasting life on earth. By maintaining his blamelessness even to death as a martyr in this sinful world, he retained that right. But this life he willingly laid down, according to God’s purpose. When God raised him out of death as a spirit, Christ Jesus did not need any longer that right to everlasting human life. Hence, when he ascended into God’s presence, he presented it to be used in behalf of the needy ones on earth. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">7/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Although apparently aimed directly at the liberal democratic governments, this stream of onrushing re-ligious-action-Nazi-Fascist hordes was anti-Jehovah and against his kingdom by Christ Jesus. Hence it was launched by Satan’s demon organization against the remnant of God’s “woman” on earth, that by the overthrow of all democracy and liberal constitutions on earth it might sweep Jehovah’s witnesses and their good-will co-laborers from the surface of this globe and completely silence the preaching of “this gospel of the kingdom” by word of mouth and by printed page. This view of matters is no mere fantasy. The infallible Word of God is authority for it.

<p><span class="font3">Sowing discord is so easily done, by gossiping or talebearing, by starting rumors or by finding fault. A person may hold a high position in God’s organization and may think chiefly of using his office to make others think well of him. At the same time he tries to disparage others or create a poor opinion of them by looking around for things with which to find fault, with one purpose, to sow discord among the brethren. A very good example of this is found in the “evil servant” class, whom the Lord foretold as sure to arise at the end of the world, and who would smite fellow servants but would eat and drink with the drunken ones of this world. Whispering about a brother is to be avoided. If you think someone has done wrong, and if you want to say something about it, go direct to him. Do not start a whispering campaign.—Prov. 18:8.

Their testimony before rulers vindicates the work of the gospel preachers in that it proves they are inoffensive and harmless to worldly powers and are educating the people in life-saving knowledge and are God’s true servants and ambassadors of His King. Even with the Kingdom in operation since 1914 they do not try to make capital politically of that fact. They join in no radical revolutionary movements and do not plan or arrange to set up an earthly government of their own. They absolutely disavow such things. More than ever, they now strive to seek the kingdom of God first and to specialize on doing the one main thing of preaching its being set up.

It is an honor to bear the name, but the name does not exalt us before worldly men.

Hence the proud, haughty religious clergy are due for a fall into destruction at the battle of Armageddon. What such religionists consider honor, which honor they receive from their political and commercial allies and their religious flocks, is not true honor, because not from God. Such honor will fail. It will be no guarantee to uphold them from an early destructive fall. Those who receive the glorious treasure of service from the Universal Ruler and who then use such service privilege to His praise and the people’s good, acquire a true honor. It leads to further honor from God.

Because of their lacks and incompetencies and their little account according to the flesh, it is Christ Jesus that counts in their lives and that supplies and makes up for all that wherein they are short or deficient.

Unquestionably, at the reappearance of this abomination from the “bottomless pit” (Rev. 17:8-11), it will be most urgent for all seeing it and discerning the desolation that such anti-Kingdom abomination portends to flee without delay to the mountains of God’s kingdom for security and preservation. How will men know the way thither unless this gospel of the established Kingdom is preached to them?

So new ones were brought in, notably until 1931, and Jehovah God begot these consecrated persons and anointed them with the spirit which was outpoured. Thereby these came under the responsibility till death of being witnesses of Jehovah God and publishers of his kingdom under Christ.

These can witness the brother’s efforts at reconciling the offender and can add their weight to the admonition to him for his repenting and rectifying matters. “If any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him; let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.”—Jas. 5:19, 20.

Verily </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">now,</span><span class="font3"> in that twofold sense, it can be announced by us unitedly and with joy, “The Kingdom of God is nigh at hand,” and, “The kingdom of heaven is at hand.” (Luke 21:31) This is the Kingdom, the gospel of which shall be preached, as foretold and commanded, in all the inhabited earth for a witness unto all nations. This gospel preaching must be done now during this day of Jehovah, during this time of His grace between the “war in heaven” and the final battle of Armageddon, by the inserting of which break Jehovah has shortened the days of the great tribulation. For his elect’s sake he has shortened the days. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">9/1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Which of you by being anxious can add one cubit unto the measure of his lifef—Matt. 6:27, A.S.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The present is the time to serve the Lord, while your individual opportunity is here! You cannot add a cubit, not even an inch, for all your worrying or selfish planning. Hence make the most of your own present. Do not take chances and say, ‘According to Bible chronology it will be some years yet, and I shall have time to get into Jehovah’s royal service after I have grown some years older. Hence I will use the present for going after the same things as do the Gentiles. But in the distant tomorrow, or in the final cubit of my life-measure before the battle of Armageddon, ah, then I shall get in real earnest and give my full time, strength and means to the Lord’s service.’ That is the way of covetousness or selfish greed. Instead of a waiting upon or serving of the Lord, it is a making the Lord wait outside. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">9/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In God’s organization every member must perform his part or given duties. Otherwise, there is a disconnection and other members must for a time do extra duty trying to fill in for the lack of the member that failed of duty. No member must get in the way of other members in the doing of their given tasks. Else, there is a rubbing together and clashing of operations, and trouble follows until the member out of order has been adjusted or put back in his right place, doing his own special work. Thereby every member renders or contributes his peculiar service to the organization as a whole and makes for its getting of God’s work done, to His pleasing and honor. There is absolute need of holding fast to the head of the organization and thus holding together with one another.-Col. 2:19. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1/15</span></p>

Such honor means giving heed to the education, the instruction, coming from God the great Teacher through his </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">woman</span><span class="font3"> or organization. Doing so will keep the teachable son or member from turning to other organizations and being misled by such into sin and death: “to keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.” (Prov. 6:24) Such son will appreciate and abide by the fact that God his Father teaches all his children by one channel, his </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">woman. </span><span class="font3">This means he does not use creatures outside his organization to impart the truthful teaching and instruction. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Evidently the mixed multitude had joined with the Israelites in the passover celebration. This multitude, though not directly in the law covenant, nevertheless tasted its blessed effects and its wise and healthful provisions by sojourning with God’s covenant people and being subject to the same laws. This pictures that the earthly class of good-will persons today, while not in the new covenant nor partaking of the Memorial emblems, yet do, notwithstanding, receive manifold blessings through being obedient to the Theocratic organization of God’s spiritual Israelites. Being associated with these spirit-begotten sons of God in the new covenant, the “men of good-will” can not help but benefit indirectly, for God’s covenant provides generous treatment of them and also grand opportunities of service for them.

<p><span class="font3">What was the purpose of Jesus’ anointing while on earth? It was to commission him to act as God’s Spokesman and to preach the gospel of the coming Righteous Government. The prophecy of Isaiah 61:1, 2, which was then fulfilled primarily in him, said for him: “The spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me; because Jehovah hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek.” (A.S.P.) The point of this was that the anointed Jesus must be a preacher of the good news, he must be a faithful and true witness of Jehovah God. The anointed followers of Christ Jesus are made joint-heirs of Kingdom glory with him. But, while they are in the flesh, their anointing with God’s spirit lays upon them the obligation now to be Jehovah’s witnesses and to preach and bear witness concerning The Theocratic Government. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">As visible representatives of God’s kingdom among such “twelve tribes” after Armageddon, and as God’s appointed “princes in all the earth”, will be the faithful men of old, from Abel to John the Baptist. These men Jehovah God by his reigning King Christ Jesus will resurrect from the dead to perfect life on earth to constitute the visible ruling organization or symbolic “new earth” under the Theocratic Government of heaven. The “twelve tribes” of redeemed humankind have their beginning with the people of good-will who now accept Jehovah as God and Christ Jesus as King. Such ones are promised protection by the Higher Powers and will be carried alive through the battle of Armageddon into the regenerated world of righteousness.

<p><span class="font3">It is now a time of great temptation. The trial of integrity toward God is now very heart-searching and penetrating to those who want to please God. On our own human strength we cannot rely. There may be a readiness of mind in the right direction and indicating devotion to God; but the possessor of the right mental disposition or spirit is still in the flesh, which is subject to the weakness of all humans and which is prone to desire to shield and preserve itself. Also, the mind of God’s servant does not fully appreciate in advance the manner of the enemy’s attack or the greatness of the enemy’s pressure to be applied against him. Hence the need to watch and to lean wholly upon God, appealing in prayer to him for His strength to resist the temptation and to keep blameless toward him without falling.

<p><span class="font3">Because Jehovah’s witnesses did not lie down like dead fish under the supposed “higher powers” as back in 1918, but, because they obeyed God’s commandments first and carried on an uncompromising fight for God-approved liberty on the home front, therefore the “earth”, or more stable and anti-radical part of human society, got courage to take action. This “earth” opened its mouth by coming out with editorials and declarations for freedom of speech, press and worship and for constitutional rights. The earth rendered decisions in favor of such rights and liberty in the very highest courts of the nations. And thus the earth has met and absorbed the onslaught and swallowed up the flood and thereby helped the “woman” in this indirect way.

<p><span class="font3">By the end of the thousand years Christ Jesus will have reigned till he has put down and destroyed man’s last enemy, death, and its close attendant, hell or the grave. Destruction in gehenna, with Satan and all his organization, will be the fate of all those who fail to be steadfast in righteousness and fail to keep their blamelessness during his brief loosing. That wicked rebel against Jehovah’s universal domination was responsible for the death that came upon all men through Adam. (John 8:44) “And there shall be no more death,” at the end of the thousand years, because all survivors of the final test arising from what Satan does during his short release, will be counted worthy to attain the New World of righteousness, which is everlasting. They will be graciously favored with the blessed gift of the right to everlasting life from God through his King. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">4/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Even for a person of good-will to die now before Armageddon does not mean his labors in Jehovah’s witness work have been thrown away. An earthly ‘resurrection unto life for them that have done good’ most truly awaits such a faithful one, according to God’s Word. (John 5:28,29) The resurrection hope was not given as merely an incidental hope, to be viewed with indifference. It is an important feature of God’s all-excelling purpose. It bespeaks an astounding miracle of His almighty power, a triumph over his great enemy Satan and over death, and a vindication of God’s holy name and infallible Word. Facing death daily as we do, for the gospel’s sake, we should “comfort one another with these words” regarding the resurrection hope.—1 Thess. 4:18.

He is in the highest heavens, and treasures that descend from him are heavenly in origin. “O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable!” (Rom. 11: 33; Prov. 2:4-9) The treasures from Jehovah God are enduring, and are more precious than all the ill-gotten hoards of material wealth and goods that selfish men can heap up for themselves or can bestow upon those who serve and please them. The most precious treasure possible to be enjoyed by creatures on this earth is to be engaged in their Creator’s service, having a commission or ordination from him to serve. Not all men prize such treasure and seek it. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">5/1</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The day of Jehovah is a day of warfare against all his foes in heaven and in earth. The finishing act of this glorious day will be the binding of Satan by Jehovah’s mightiest Messenger or Angel, the King Christ Jesus. Thereafter will come the peaceful 1000-year reign over the earth by the “Prince of Peace” in behalf of all men of good-will. Christ’s reign’s following this day is like the consecutive reigns of David and his son King Solomon. The day of Jehovah corresponds with David’s turbulent reign of wars, putting down all enemies of the typical Theocracy and extending the boundaries of the Theocracy to the limits ordained by Jehovah God. The day of Christ’s 1000-year reign corresponds to the peaceful and prosperous reign of David’s son Solomon in the glory of his majesty and fullness of his wisdom. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span></p>

Their having the message is made possible because God causes the prophecies to be fulfilled concerning the reign of his beloved Son and concerning the blessings that such reign introduces for all “men of good-will”. Then God, by his active force or holy spirit, opens the understanding of his spirit-begotten remnant to discern the fulfillment of such prophecies. Thus God by his spirit interprets his own Word to his faithful servants on earth. “For God revealed them to us through his spirit, for the spirit fathoms everything, even the depths of God himself.”—1 Cor. 2:10, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Goodspeed; Moffatt. </span><span class="font3">W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">8/1</span></p>

It should be quietly laid before the representative members of the congregation, the ones that are charged with the responsibility for the spiritual welfare of the brethren and for directing their service to the Lord. The case recorded at Deuteronomy 21:18-21 illustrates the way of proceeding in an orderly, Theocratic way. According to this, the hearing of the case and the rendering of the decision should be confined to representative brethren, as pictured by the city elders, not elective elders, but elders who are such due to Christian knowledge and growth. Their decision must be according to Theocratic law. The congregation may hear about it and may concur in it and in the action due.

<p><span class="font3">The one begotten by God’s spirit is a new creature. Yet, while he is here on the earth, he still needs the cleansing merit of Christ’s sacrifice because he is still in the flesh which inclines to sin. Though he has a conditional right to life in heaven due to his Scripturally authorized hopes, he still has the fleshly human body and it is required of him to be faithful to the death of that human organism. One who remains a spiritual son down to death will not commit mortal sin, but his death will be for the vindication of God’s name. What sins he commits are to be attributed only to the sin-prone flesh in which he still operates. (1 John 5:16-18; Rom. 7:18-25) For such sins the justifying merit of Christ’s sacrifice still has power, as written at 1 John 1:7-10; 2:1,2.

<p><span class="font3">Such ones, whom the world calls foolish, weak, base, despised and of naught, are the ones Jehovah calls to be his preachers, in order “by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe”. He arranges it thus in order that the preacher may not glory in himself and also that no other creature should glory in the preacher by whom he hears the gospel preached. The preacher is not the thing that counts. The message he has been commissioned to preach is what counts and is what works to salvation, if believed. Those who desire wisdom that is from above will not despise the preacher because he goes preaching from house to house or by offering literature publicly on street corners. Instead, the meek ones will respect Jehovah, who has commissioned such preacher and in whose name the preacher comes, and they will attach importance to the message.

He would be with them always in a fuller sense than being with them by mere direction or fixation of his mind. The apostle Paul could be with the distant brethren merely by the turn of his thoughts to them and by prayers to God in their interest, and was thus with them in spirit. Jesus promised to be with his entire church down through the centuries and clear to the consummation of the world by means of what he called “the comforter”. He identified the comforter or paraclete as the spirit. He referred to the spirit as the active force of God, which is invisible to human eyes but which brings about God’s will and reveals itself in manifestations visible to the eyes of God’s servants. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Jehovah, the Creator of male and female, set up human marriage. He performed the first marriage on earth. He is also the One who arranges for the marriage of his beloved only begotten Son to a company of devoted creatures, those whose love for their Bridegroom surpasses the love of an earthly bride for her human spouse. The Son of God has looked forward with joy to his union with the bride his Father provides. He therefore likened the kingdom of heaven as above because in the king, his son and those who attend the wedding banquet we see illustrated the three principal things which enter into the making of this kingdom of heaven. Jesus there spoke of his own Father as the King. There could be no kingdom of heaven without Him, for Jehovah is the One that ordains it and is the source of its authority and dominion.

No hypocrisy will for ever hide where his heart is really centered, for in passage of time the person’s heart will expose itself in his course of life. The heart will begin to disclose its affections and show where the mind is centered. The heart will move the lips to action; “for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.” (Matt. 12:34,35) One whose heart’s devotion is set upon God’s kingdom will be proclaiming with the mouth and every power of expression the precious truths regarding it, and not be seeking after this world’s goods.

Their suggestions as to details of carrying on the Kingdom witness are to be welcomed and taken under consideration in the light of the Lord’s will. As these suggestions fit in with the Theocratic structure of the organization, such may be adopted. They may be used in the field work, acting as surveyors of the territory and aiding in the comfortable movement of Jehovah’s servants in the work.

This means that the remnant must get the revealed Kingdom message out to many peoples, nations, languages, and their rulers, before Armageddon. Jesus’ command just before ascending to heaven, to “go and teach all nations”, must now apply in a more pressing and immediate sense. Since 1918 Jehovah by his Interpreter at the temple, Christ Jesus, has unfolded his precious Word as due to be understood and has revealed many things regarding the nations, peoples, and rulers, and their destiny. By the greatest advertising campaign in the history of Jehovah’s consecrated people, his witnesses have proclaimed the revealed things of his Word.

To “men of good-will”, that is, to those who hear with hearing ears and who are athirst for righteousness and life, and who will to come to God through Christ and to slake their thirst with his life-giving gospel truth. Be it observed, though, that these are not only invited to drink, but also commanded to relay the invitation of the Spirit and the bride on to others, lest sueh perish in this day of judgment of the nations. The divine command to them is: “Let him that heareth say, Come.” They do not need to be anointed in order to come under this command. If they hear and drink, the Spirit’s exhortation applies to them.

But they looked to the infallible God for guidance, and they had this guidance by his spirit and his angels. Hence their decrees and instructions were given with authority and should be submitted to by Christians. It was respecting such governing body that the apostle Peter wrote to those within the Theocratic organization: “Submit yourselves to every ordinance [creation] of man for the Lord’s sake: whether it be to the king [Christ Jesus], as supreme [Head of the church]; or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.”—1 Pet. 2:13,14.

All these Nethinim were organized for the Lord’s service, and had their own overseers. Because they were reported and recognized as ministers of the house of God, they were relieved of payment of taxes by even the heathen emperors who controlled the restored remnant. They must therefore have been maintained from the temple treasury and from the Israelites’ tithes, which tithes were given to benefit, in part, the strangers or sojourners. This was the right of these Nethinim as strangers, and it must be maintained.—Deut. 26:12, 13; Ex. 30:14; Neh. 10: 32; 11: 21. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">12/1</span></p>

The consecrated one must abide in that chosen generation or race by carrying out his consecration to God. He must be faithful to God unto the death of his fleshly body, in order to do this. The need of being faithful in order to keep God’s approval and to be continued in his called and chosen congregation the apostle Peter drives home by showing how it can be done and saying: “Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall.&quot;—1 Pet. 2: 9; 2 Pet. 1:5-12. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span></p>

For the settlement of the controversy that rages over man’s integrity toward Jehovah’s universal domination He has bestowed this blessed service upon creatures in the flesh. This he has done to magnify his own power amid human weakness. In the hands of demonized destructive men, how frail are earthen pots!

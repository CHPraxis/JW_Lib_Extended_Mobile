<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>In Brief</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“All Dogs Go to Heaven”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ The foregoing is the sentimental title of a $2.50 book by Beth Brown, the advertisement of which contains the following blasphemous statements:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As you read “All Dogs Go to Heaven” you really get to know dogs—and once you know' dogs—^ou know people—and once you know people—you know the divine plan of the universe. And then somehow you get a new perspective on life—renewed faith and courage and hope. Ever hear dogs speak? These do. They speak to say that there is no death. There is only life in another form. Some little dog you’ve lost—is not really lost. He is always with you—wherever he is— wherever you are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To be sure*Almighty God warned the Jews that they must not bring the price of a dog into His house, for it would be an abomination (Deuteronomy 23:18); to be sure, the psalmist said, “For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me” (Psalm 22:16); to be sure, he prayed that he might be delivered from the power of the dog (Psalm 22: 20); to be sure, the prophet makes reference to the “dumb dogs . . . greedy dogs which can never have enough” (Isaiah 56:10,11); to be sure, the Lord Jesus Christ said, “Give not that which is holy unto the dogs” (Matthew 7:6); and the apostle Paul said, &quot;Beware of dogs” (Philippians 3:2); and the apostle Peter mentioned that “the dog is turned to his own vomit again” (2 Peter 2:22); and the apostle John said, “Without are dogs.” (Revelation 22:15) But none of these things would have any weight with the one who wrote Beth’s advertisement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Think! Isn’t it just a little bit raw, when God’s Word uses the dogs to picture the clergy, to have some money-mad book concern make the literal dogs give the lie to Almighty God by its representing the dogs as claiming that even dogs have what God alone inherently has, immortality?</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Volume XXVI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brooklyn, N, V., Wednesday, July </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">4,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1945 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number 573</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Industrious, Progressive Sweden</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font12">ACITUS mentions the Suiones of the Baltic. The bows and sterns of their ships were alike, and equally well suited for landing. No sails were used. There were no oarlocks for the huge oars. In the north the men were Svea or Swedes ; in the south they were Gota or Goths, and Gotaland, or Gothland, is the historical name for south Sweden. Moreover, Sweden’s largest island possession is called Gotland to this day. The Goths w’ere descended from the Swedes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Swedes and Goths, at war with one another for centuries, were migratory, restless, courageous, indomitable, and probably possess the purest Teutonic ■ blood in existence. They were demonworshipers, and when they chased .the Anglo-Saxons back into the British highlands they gave them the names of their gods by which to identify the days of the week. The ancient Swedes worshiped the sun on Sunday, the moon on Monday, Woden on Wodensday, Woden’s wife Frigg or Friga on Friday, their son Tyr or Zeus on Tuesday, and Thor, the god of thunder, on Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The center of demon worship was Upsala; there also the priests offered human' as well as animal sacrifices. Priests are like that. One of the sacred acts was to throw a poor mhn into a sacred well in the precincts of the temple. When the priests could mot recover his dead body, it was taken as a token that the wishes of the people would be fulfilled. The poor people had not yet caught the brilliant thought that, if they really wanted peace and happiness, what was needed vras that homebody should throw' all the priests into the well and then put the cover on the well. Upsala, 36,547 population, 50 miles north of Stockholm, is now the site of Sweden’s largest university.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the days of the Hanseatic League, Visby, now with 11,673 population, on the island of Gotland, was considered the wealthiest city of its size in the world. It then had 13,000 merchants, divided into 16 guilds. The elaborate rules of trade formulated by these guilds are the basis of the present admiralty laws of Great Britain and America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Lawsuits were strictly formal. If the evidence was obscure, one of the parties had to prove his case by oath. This oath was corroborated by a certain number of “trusted men”. Out of this curious institution a jury. was developed, whose business it was to acquit or condemn the accused. It was the business of the lagman (lawman, lawyer) to recite from memory the law of the province which applied to the case in hand. The practices of these vikings persist in the courts of the twentieth century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">One of the Lands of the Midnight Sun</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Russia, Siberia, Alaska, British North America, Greenland, Finland, Norway and Sweden are all lands of the midnight sun. The Swrndes are veiw prac- . tical. They say that if you are in Sweden June 21 and you wish to see the midnight sun, all you have to do is to go to Jokkmokk, Porjus, Harsprang, Galli-vare, Fjallasen, Kiruna or Abisko on the railroad that terminates at the famous ore port of Narvik, Norway, and you can see King Sol swing clear around the horizon without touching it. And they might pause to tell you that the best place to go would be Gallivare, where they have a great ore mine that has been the talk of the world. This ore, very rich, ’has been a great factor in the production of German iron and steel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The whole of Sweden is rising, with the north parts rising more rapidly than the south. The evident explanation is that the icecap was heavier id the north, heavy enough at one time to cause subsidence of the earth’s' crust, but as the ice deposited in Noah’s day gradually melted the earth returned to its former level. There are places on ’the coast of Sweden where forty or fifty tide marks may be counted one above the other, upon the rocks. These tide marks show that the water was once higher by seventy feet. The shores are indented by cliffs which formerly inclosed beaches that are now thirty, forty or fifty feet above the level of the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">About 56.5 percent of Sweden is covered with forests, largely spruce and pine, fir and birch. The northerly climate' is conducive to the slow growth and excellent quality of these, and on account of a careful program* of conservation and reforestation there has resulted a steady increase in the total stock of green timber available. Some single tracts of unbroken forest are as much as 80 miles long by 20 miles wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Before World War II upset everything, it was calculated that the annual yield of Swedish forests would make a hoop around the world one inch thick and 144 feet wide. To handle this lumber and take care of the output of its mines, Sweden has more miles of railway trackage in proportion to its population than any other European country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A Swedish invention enables the seasoning of wood artificially in two days. A log is placed in a cylinder, a centrifugal pump creates a vacuum, and out comes the sap from the entire log, including the heart. In 48 hours the lumber is ready for use; the cost is only about one dollar per thousand board feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Heart Is in the South</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Roughly 200 miles wide from east to west and 1,000 miles long from north to south, the heart of Sweden is in the southern 400 miles of its length, and is in the same latitude as the southern part of Alaska. Cutting this 400 miles in half is a magnificent system of lakes and canals from Gbteborg to Soderkbping. Several of the country’s important cities are on the shores of the two great lakes, Wenner and Wetter, that comprise essential parts of this “Gotha” transportation system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Stockholm, 570,771 population, noted for its beautiful sea approach, lies to the north and east of the system of water transportation last named. Located at the eastern terminus of Lake Malar, Stockholm was founded as a fortified port and has extended over numerous islands connected with one another and with the mainland by a network of bridges; hence its claim to the title “Venice of the North”. Lake Malar is remarkable for the .number of islands which so crowd its surface that it is hardly possible to find a square mile of open water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A trip through the Gotha canal, 360 miles long, takes days and is a very interesting experience, En route it requires seven hours to traverse Lake Wenner, and for two hours the steamer is out of sight of land. The net lift of the 74 locks of solid granite is 300 feet. The landscape throughout is the loveliest in Sweden; in places the route is through virgin forests of silver birches which overhang the stream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the middle of the journey Lake Wetter is traversed. Its behavior is singular: it. has periodic rises and falls, independent of the wetness or dryness of the season, and is subject to violent subterranean swells, emitting terrific sounds when covered with ice. The claim is made that Lake Wetter and the Boden See of Switzerland are connected. It is observed that on Lake Wetter mirages are frequently visible to many people and for hours at a time. These include marching armies of cavalry, infantry and artillery with banners and glittering weapons. Probably natural conditions are favorable to mirages and the demons make the most of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sweden and America and the War</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Of the foreign white stock in the United States, only Russia, Canada, Ireland and England have supplied more than the .1,301,390 that are traced to Sweden. Illinois, Minnesota, New York, California and Washington have large contingents. Swedes were the first settlers in Delaware, March 26, 1638, then called New Sweden. Swedes taught Americans how to build log houses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Swedish writers claim that it cost Sweden some $800 a minute, or over $1,000,000 a day, to maintain neutrality in the late European war. Sweden has not been visited by war for over 100 years, but came near getting into World War I and. missed getting into World War II by a narrow margin. It slipped from the path of neutrality in the summer of 1941 by permitting German troops to pass through Sweden from Norway to Finland. It has also permitted German troops to move between northern and southern Norway via the Swedish railroads which alone make possible such a trip. But this right was later withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To be sure, there are some Americans who hold that “the Swedes are utterly contemptuous of America”; that “there is not one strain of love in their hearts for America and never has been”, and that “Sweden, through its natural heritage of German blood, is now and always will be loyal to Germany”. To be sure, as early as May, 1944, there were 426 Swedish firms on Uncle Sam’s blacklist, alleged to be assisting the German war effort. And it is of record in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Americana</span><span class="font12"> that in 1917 the Swedish Foreign Office permitted German official messages from foreign countries to be sent as its own messages. Thus, the German charge d’affaires in Buenos Aires wrote to his then fuehrer in Germany that either the Argentine vessels should not be sunk at all or else they should be sunk without leaving any trace, and he sent this to his homeland in the Swedish government mailbag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But there are offsets. The 381 American airmen that have been forced down in Sweden are alleged to be having a good time, reading much, given great freedom of movement, and playing all sorts of games; though the Russians claim that when German planes were forced down their crews were not interned, but they were permitted to return to Germany. Definitely, when the Germans closed Oslo University and shipped the students off to Germany, and when the Gestapo seized the 7,000 Jews of Denmark, both the Swedish government and the Swedish newspapers let the Germans know that they resented it. Swedish ports in the Baltic and in the Bothnian gulf w<sup>T</sup>ere closed; the German minister to Stockholm was recalled and relations were near the breaking point. The Nazi-controlled Norwegian press countered by calling Sweden a “bastion of international Jewry and plutocracy”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Swedish Government</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In 1811 the Swedish parliament designated one of Napoleon’s field marshals, General Bernadotte, the son of a French lawyer, as crown prince; and his descendants are still on the throne. Napoleon advised him not to take the job, but he did, and, in the final coalition, lined up against his former chief. The royal palace at Stockholm, 348 by 372 feet in size, is a most imposing structure, and is right in the middle of everything, including street traffic, and the confusion of loading and unloading vessels. The king must be a Lutheran.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The princes are not permitted to occupy governmental positions. They are all millionaires and give .their time to science, sports, and art. Other nobles may run for office, the same as anybody 'else. They have no legal privileges. Pub-Ijc registration is in the hands of the clergy; that keeps things largely in their hands. Theoretically, all the clergy are ■ appointed by the king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">- All public officials, including schoolteachers,. must be Lutherans, and, by law, the Lutheran religion is taught in all schools. The country is divided into six bishoprics, 83 deaneries, and 482 parishes. The parishes are grouped into 24 provinces, each with its own government, responsible to the national government, the Rigsdag, one of the oldest of parliamentary bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Sweden has two houses of parliament; the upper chamber has 150 members, and the lower has 230 members. At the last election of the lower house 115 Social -Democrats were seated, 39 Conservatives, 36 Farmers’ Union, 25 People’s Party, and 15 Communists. To be a member of the upper house of the Rigsdag one must be 35 years of age, must have been for eight years the possessor of real property of the value of 50,000 kronor ($12,500) or have an income of 3,000 kronor annually. All persons 23 years of age may vote.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Almost No Crime</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There is almost no crime in Sweden, as compared with the horrid conditions prevalent in America. The Roman Catholic </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Register</span><span class="font12"> unwittingly explains:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For centuries Catholicism was forbidden there by law, priests were refused citizenship, and Catholics were banished—all this as late as 1911. Even today [1942] there are only about 5,000 Catholics in Sweden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Ration cards are a temptation in the direction of crime, but the Swedes have, all told, 90 or more ration cards, issued to govern purchases of food and clothing. Besides the regular ration cards, which apply to all persons, there are numerous special cards to take care of different classes and groups. </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">And there &gt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12">are fractional coupons, so that for a Swede to eat bread, meat, eggs, </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">butter, </span><span class="font12">or other rationed foods in a restaurant, he must surrender coupons to cover what he eats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Five percent profit is the amount which the liquor monopolies of Sweden may receive. There are 121 liquor control districts, with a separate company to each district; each must buy its supplies from one wholesale house. All concessions are granted by the county authorities. Stock in the liquor control companies may not be sold. Each reputable citizen may purchase one gallon per month, but must pass an examination to prove that he is financially and socially responsible. In restaurants liquor may be had only with hot foods, and not at all after midnight. People below par are limited as to the amount of liquor they may purchase; those wholly irresponsible may not have it at all. Police keep the liquor control companies posted as to who are responsible. The total prison population of Sweden is but 2,000, and.many jails house but two or three inmates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Sweden is divided into seven areas, in each of which there is a state conciliator who follows industrial relations in his territory from day to day; he is at work before as well as after a dispute arises, and frequently settles troubles and disputes before they arise. He carries facts from one side to the other and tries to bring about settlements before relations are harmed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The General Export Association maintains representatives in all lands and has a.great fund of information available to all inquirers. It has arranged large shipments of American and Canadian fur-bearing animals into Sweden, to populate the cut-over lands. Wild reindeer and bears are now protected in Sweden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Swedish engineers </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">are famous the </span><span class="font12">world over. John Ericsson, inventor of the screw propeller, and of the irohclad battleship, was employed as a surveyor on engineering works when he was seven years of age, and at twelve was in charge of the work of six hundred men. Swedish railways are electrified, and nearly all Swedish farms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1,100 Lakes; Hence Everybody Swims</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There are so many lakes in Sweden that it comes natural for Swedish boys and girls to learn to swim, and they take to the water like ducks. The nation goes in for athletics. Diplomas are awarded for superior swimming. Everybody can skate as well as swim. The winter sport is skiing or skimming over the country on snowshoes. A skillful skier can make a mile in two minutes. Ice-yachting and sailing are popular sports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In Sweden doctors more often recommend massage than medicine. They do not send bills to their patients, but depend upon their generosity. They receive an annual fee, with something extra in case of serious illness in the family. Electrical treatments of various sorts are much in vogue. Sick clubs are popular; the national government contributes 15 percent and the communes 25 percent of the clubs’ funds; when a member falls ill he collects 83c per day. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As a result of attention to their bodies the Swedes are rapidly growing taller and stronger. In a period of 87 years the average height of 21-year-old recruits increased from 5 feet 5 inches to 5 feet 8 inches. An item on the other side of the ledger is that the Swedes are the greatest coffee-drinkers in the world, averaging 600 cups each annually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Most Swedes are tall, robust, active, enterprising, with light hair, blue eyes and light complexion. As a result of their long winters, or perhaps in spite of them (nine months in the northern part and seven months in the southern) ■, they are unusually healthy, and no country furnishes more abundant evidences of longevity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Accused of Being Proud</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Swedes are accused of being the proudest people in Europe, one reason being that Sweden is the only nation in Europe that has never been invaded or had its boundaries changed by foreign powers. The children are taught to say yes and no and to mean it. Some give titles to nobody, not even the king, while others give titles to everybody, invariably giving their occupation every time they are mentioned. This creates a 'curious situation where people are constantly referred to as “Thora-daughter-of-Upholsterer Anderson”, or “Son-of-Or-ganist Nilsson”, or “Mr.-the-Wholesaledealer Smith”. A doctor’s wife is always a doctoress, and a colonel’s wife is a coIoneless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">About half the proper names in Sweden end in “son”, and half the space in city directories is monopolized by the families of Olson, Larson^ Anderson, Johnson, and Peterson. There are no colors in the nomenclature, no Whites, Greens, Blacks, Browns, or Grays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Swedish servants are admittedly the best in the world. This is because children are trained to the duties of the kitchen, as should be the case everywhere. Children are taught to save; the government opens an account with each child and puts two crowns to its credit to start it off. In Spain every other person is illiterate, the ideal of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. In Sweden only one in 500 is illiterate, the opposite ideal. Political uniforms are barred in Sweden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Prosperous and Progressive</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Just before World War II Sweden was written up as the then most prosperous country in the world. Practically all public utilities are owned either by the state or by the municipalities. This is as it should be. Americans have been deluded into thinking that they may own the sewers, because such are a constant expense, but they must not own other public utilities, because there is a chance for huge .profits and the people should be taught that only Big Business has the wisdom to know what to do with profit on a colossal scale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">&quot;There are comparatively few poor in Sweden. At the “people's kitchen” in the ^wintertime a man may get a substantial klinner for 9c, and a breakfast or supper tor 4c. It is not intended as a charity and nothing is given away. At some hotels a man and his wife are charged as persons if they occupy the same room. There is high respect for motherhood, ■both married and unmarried. It is regarded as a special service to the state. No Swedish woman who has been employed two years at the time of her marriage can be dismissed from her job owing to marriage, the birth of a child, or confinement. She will be allowed twelve weeks’ absence during confinement, and no signing away of her rights will be recognized by law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In every community there is a director of public relief, aided by a committee of representative citizens whose business it is to inquire into the needs of the unemployed and the popr. Hospital care for such is provided free of charge. There are also child welfare committees in every community, and committees to distribute funds to widowed and abandoned mothers. Old age and invalidity insurance is obligatory for every person between 16 and 66 years of age. When a man is unemployed he receives his unemployment pay check at the same window where he once received his wages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Divorces are granted by mutual consent and may be secured by either party after a separation of three yearsl Woman suffrage was granted in 1909, and more women vote than men. Sweden was the first country to recognize the equality of sons and daughters in the inheritance of property. The country is world-famous for its cleanliness. There are no slums. The “eight hours for a day’s work” law has been in operation for a quarter of a century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Real service for all the people is the rule. Grocery stores on wheels traverse the w’hole land, with full stocks of meats, vegetables, and other merchandise. About one-fourth of the population is represented by these traveling co-operative stores. The buses are everywhere. To mail a letter, meet the bus; the driver will stop anywhere to permit posting a letter in the letter box attached to his vehicle. The bus operates a rural express service, delivering promptly parcels ordered from town by telephone. If packages are numerous, the bus leaves town five minutes ahead of time, so that the run may be finished on time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The co-operatives manufacture electric lamps, shoes, and galoshes. They operate grist mills, elevators, and bakeries, and beautiful, hygienic and sanitary stores. They have helped to make Sweden a good place for the common people to work and to live in while looking to “the desire of all nations”, which is even now at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A Deer Rescues and Is Himself Rescued </span><span class="font12">♦ At Lake Lynn, near Uniontown, Pa., H. F. Beverage was out in a skiff, engaged in duck-hunting, when he saw a deer, a big eight-point buck, swimming. Rushing toward the deer, his skiff overturned, and, to save himself from drowning, he grabbed the buck’s horns and was hauled ashore. The deer escaped. That w’as in the fall of 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At the same lake, the same winter, the same man was walking on the shore when he saw an eight-point buck entrapped in the ice. He found a plank, slipped it under the exhausted animal, pushed it ashore and covered it with his mackinaw. While he was trying to figure out what to do next, the deer jumped to its feet and ran away. Of course, Mr. Beverage cannot swear that it was the identical animal that rescued him a few months earlier, but he thinks it was, and that is probably the case. In any event, it is a remarkable illustration of the proper relationship of men and wild animals.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">The Inter-Allied Information Committee in London is the source of the claim that by June, 1943, one-seventh of the Jews of the world had been exterminated by the maniacs that ruled Germany, A portion of the report published in the Vancouver </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Province</span><span class="font12"> says in a matter-of-fact way: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In Poland the Gestapo chief Himmler ordered his fellow criminals to exterminate half the Warsaw ghetto population within twelve months. Six to seven thousand were deported daily. A special “extermination squad” was trained in the Reich. Jews who were not deported were either shot or mass-murdered in large groups by electrocution or lethal gas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In two days, August 26 and 27 of last year (1942), the Germans herded 20,000 Jews together under pretext of re-registration and shot them at Lutzk in the conquered' Ukraine, while at Sarny, already the scene of a massacre of 18,000, they shot another 14,000. At Kiev and Dnepropetrovsk 60,000 were slain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Various Slaughterhouses</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There does not seem to be any gainsaying of the fact that various human slaughterhouses have been operated in Poland. The New York </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font12"> mentions 35,000 slain at Lwow, 15,000 at Stanisla-wow, 16,300 at Brzezany, 5,000 at Tarno-pol, and 2,000 at Zloctrow or Zloczow, It says there were </span><span class="font10">about 1,000 gassed daily from the townships of Kolo, Dabie, Izbica and others between November, 1941, and March, 1942, as well as 35,000 Jews in Lodz between January 2 and January 9 (1942). Two thousand “gypsies” were gassed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Dr. Henryk Strasburger, finance minister, of the one-time Polish government in exile, is authority for the statement that human slaughterhouses were functioning in 1942 in Kaunas (Lithuania, under German control) and at Belzec, 60 miles from Lwow, Poland. Giving details he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The method used is the following: The victims are ordered to strip naked ‘to have a bath’. They are then led to a barrack with a metal floor. This door is locked and an electric current turned on. They die in agony. When the current is turned off the bodies are loaded on cars and dumped into a mass grave. In addition to firing squads, electrocution and lethal gas, Poles are also packed into locked freight cars, 50 or 60 in a ear, and long trains of these ears are driven into the country and left on sidings where the people in them are left to die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New Leader</span><span class="font12"> mentions the death of a fellow Socialist in Poland and states ^incidentally that he was one of 7,000 shot kt a concentration camp at Palmiry, near Warsaw. The man shot was editor of a Socialist publication, and the story' is confirmed by the fact that the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New Lead' er</span><span class="font12"> is a Socialist publication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font12">what seems to be an extract from a 'letter of the archbishop of Canterbury published in the London </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font12"> and copyright 1942 by the Chicago </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News,</span><span class="font12"> occurs this statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">During the last fhree months 260,000 or 400,000 people living in the Warsaw ghetto have been liquidated and mass murders are proceeding over the whole country. There is no question of the validity of reports on which this declaration was based.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Slaughters Continued in 1943</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Polish government in exile announced in March, 1943, that all the Jews had been exterminated in the ghettos of five Polish towns not named in the foregoing, namely, Radomsk, Ujazd, Sobo-lew, Radzymin and Szczerzec. What , probably happens in such eases is that the occupying authorities suspect Jews of underground papers or sabotage, or else invent these excuses to explain* their annihilation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At Warsaw the editor of one of the underground papers had Gestapo callers. He slammed the door, inserted a notice of his death in the paper, had a small edition run off and smuggled out through a tunnel and distributed. It took all night for the Gestapo to capture the place, which they finally did by burning it to the ground. Inside of it they found four men and one woman—cremated. But the subscribers got their papers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Though the Jews seem to be the principal objects of extermination, the Poles themselves are often involved as in the following statement by the Polish minister of home affairs, issued in London July 26, 1943, and published in the New York </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font12"> the following day:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The entire population is being removed from the areas involved. A considerable percentage of them is shot on the spot. Small children are killed with a kick. Males from 14 years to 50 are deported to an unknown destination in sealed trucks. Children up to 13 years, women and all over 50, are deported to the Majdanek death camp, in the Lublin district, where they are slaughtered in masses in death chambers, as were the Jews before them. On July 2 and 5 (1943) two trains of thirty cars each, with 100 persons per car ran into Majdanek siding. Within a few hours on each of those days more than 3,000 persons were murdered in gas chambers. Such executions are taking place every day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The foregoing reports seem to have been made by responsible persons, and are susceptible of investigation. There is also at hand the New York </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span><span class="font12"> for September 28, 1943, with a story having a three-eolumn-wide headline “Charge Nazis Burn Civilians Alive” at Oswiecim, Poland. This was by an unnamed Polish spy disguised as a laborer. There is also a story in the California </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Jewish Voice</span><span class="font12"> (September 11, 1942) of a twelve-year-old Jewish boy in Bryansk, Russia, who stabbed and killed the German commander von Reichen for throwing his two-year-old sister into the fire of his burning home. And the boy escaped and reached the Russian lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">. These tales of horror ought to convince everyone that the demons are loosed, and that in a special sense the Devil and his cohorts are bent on doing everything they can to the dishonor of Jehovah’s name in the “short time” that they have left. The only safety for anybody at all is to be squarely and wholly on the Lord’s side, and to be wholly and completely immersed in His “strange work” now under way throughout the world—the proclamation of Jehovah’s kingdom as the only hope for man.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>The Knights of Columbus</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">W</span><span class="font12">HEN Christopher Columbus sailed into the beautiful Caribbean wa-</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">• ters</span><span class="font12"> that bathed this continent's shores, in the year 1492, it never entered his mind that men would in time name a secret society after him. Nor is it likely that such would have been the ease had they known the true nationality of Christopher. As school children we were taught that Columbus was born at Genoa, Italy. But in recent years it has been reported that he was really born in Portugal, and was by birth one of those hated and persecuted people called Tews, which circumstances Columbus concealed due to fear. These facts were not known when, in 1882, a few men met in New Haven, Connecticut, and founded a secret order. Tentatively those men called themselves “The Connecticut Catholic Order of Foresters”. Then another name, the “Sons of Columbus”, was suggested to give it an “American” flavor. This was finally changed to the now familiar name, the “Knights of Columbus”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Three years after the order was founded it established its first council outside of the state of Connecticut, in Westerly, Rhode Island, and from then on it rapidly expanded. By 1910 the order had local councils in every state and territory of the United States as well as in Canada, Newfoundland, Philippine Islands, Mexico, Cuba, and Panama, and was also making inroads into South American countries. By 1928 its membership had grown to the number of 700,000, with something like 2,500 councils. And it has for some time now been recognized as the leading Catholic layman's organization in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The laws and by-laws of the KC, as the order is often briefly termed, are so framed as to make the local councils subordinate to the supreme council, thus W’elding the whole organization together into an effective instrument in the hands of the Catholic Hierarchy of Authority. The order is divided into four degrees</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">JULY 4, </span><span class="font12">of ceremonial, teaching, as claimed, “charity, unity, fraternity, and patriotism.” After eighteen years from the time this Catholic layman’s order was founded the first instance of the fourth degree took place on February 22, 1900, in New York city when 1,200 were given this degree. Much contention has .developed over the so-called “oath” that is required of the fourth degreers. They themselves claim that no such oath is required, yet, from time to time others assert that those obtaining the fourth degree must bind themselves with strong papal vows. As late as November, 1944, such claims have been vigorously denied by the supreme council. Be that as it may, it is freely admitted that the Knights of Columbus are a secret order, their own law stating that any member ' “revealing to a person not a member of this Order any of the work, business or doings of his council or the order, shall be expelled”. All the meetings and sessions of the order are held in the strictest secrecy and only those that give the secret password are admitted. And, furthermore, their law says that any member who fails “to continue a practical Roman Catholic shall be expelled”. So then, oath or no oath, the results are the same and the aims of Catholic Action are accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On the surface it would appear that the Knights of Columbus are a benevolent, charitable, and educational fraternity of Christians made up of only the cleanest and sweetest characters. At their assemblies the order of business calls for an opening and closing prayer. However, there is no stipulation as to to which god the prayer is addressed, inasmuch as the Bible says there are many gods. (1 Corinthians 8:5) It is claimed that those who engage in the liquor business are excluded from membership and any member convicted “of a crime by a court of competent authority shall be expelled”. That sounds good,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">IX</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">but we wonder *if it is strictly enforced. We are particularly wondering about that notorious criminal, Judge Martin T. Manton, who was fined $10,000 and sent to prison for two years for “selling justice” over the bar to the tune of $186,000. He was one of those gilded ^Knights of Columbus, yet several years have silently slipped by and the world v has never heard of his being expelled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As a benevolent organization the . Knights of Columbus operates its own insurance department for its members, .and had some $288,304,000 worth of certificates in force on January 1, 1930. The purpose of such department is to furnish temporary financial aid to the families of the deceased members. The “temporary” need is understood to refer to the time when the priest comes around with the funeral bill, which is always a staggering figure to the bereaved ones. In this way the money never gets away, but merely circulates within dhe “church”. Great claims are made, too, that the KC is a charitable organization, with care being taken to • make it plain that such charity is not for the poor and needy of the earth, but is only for its own members and their families. Even care for orphans, in the way of homes and education, is not available to humanity in general but is restricted to Catholic orphans. In 1928 the Knights undertook the task of organizing Catholic youth in the seven different countries in which they operate into what was called the “Columbian Squires”. But such industry could hardly be classified as charitable, since there were ulterior motives behind the regimenting of the Catholic youth. And similar motives were back of the Knights’ efforts to make “Columbus Day” (October 12) a national holiday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">All these activities, however, are in the background. The main purpose of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has been and is to “make America Catholic”. And these chivalrous Knights, a creation of the Hierarchy, sally forth carrying the torch, and sword also, for the “church”. Says dhe </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia:</span><span class="font12"> “The purpose of the Society is to develop a practical Catholicity among its members, to promote Catholic education and charity . . . The Knights of Columbus • have done notable work in promoting Catholic education . . . The work of lectures to non-Catholics on questions of Catholic teaching and belief has always appealed to the spirit of the order, and of late years has been taken up with no little success.” Take note of the particular brand of “education” that they endeavor to promote, not free education, not education for life, not education in the Bible, not Christian education, but </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic</span><span class="font12"> education. To this end the order endows several scholarships in Catholic universities. It publishes a 52-page magazine known as </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Columbia,</span><span class="font12"> and also operates so-called “information bureaus”, such as “Religious Information Bureau” of St. Louis, Missouri.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Notwithstanding that many Catholics who have any prominence in politics are devout and faithful KC’s, yet as an organization their laws forbid activity in politics. This best serves'the interests of the Hierarchy. Like a professional safe-cracker that has many tools to do his different “jobs”, so also has the Hierarchy as it endeavors to “crack” American democracy. Some of their “tools” are used for crashing in the front, like Coughlin’s “Christian Front”. The Knights of Columbus, on the other hand, are of the quiet type that exerts its pressure from within the seams and cracks of democracy, very much in the same way as nitroglycerin is used in cracking open safes. Under the innocent label of “education” are found their sinister concoctions which are placed in strategic positions. They are compounded by a deft hand that has been drained by centuries of experience in the art of deception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the article “Blasphemy Against the Bible by a Cult” (see </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font12">No. .672) appeared a sample of the poi-</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">sonous mixture these KC apothecaries are feeding Americans. Therein the Knights of Columbus blasphemously called the Holy Bible the &quot;Book of Disunity’&quot;. With the same cunning and wicked intent as that old serpent the Devil manifested in the garden of Eden when he made void the word of God, this modern brood of reptiles likewise, with Jes-. uitic “arguments”, endeavors to besmirch and discredit God’s Word in the minds of honest Catholics and others. That article originally published in the St. Louis </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Post-Dispatch</span><span class="font12"> against the Bible is not an isolated case. Rather it is part of the Hierarchy’s “educational” program which is in reality a flood from coast to coast of Catholic propaganda intended to wash away the foundation of democracy. And the campaign is vigorously pushed by these papal Knights who strut themselves before'the people as self-appointed “educators”, claiming they have four “degrees” back of their name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Your Holy Father”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Chester Times</span><span class="font12"> (March 1,1945), under the title “Your Holy Father”, appeared the following article sponsored by the “Americus Council Knights of Columbus with Ecclesiastical Approbation”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Did you ever stop to think that our Holy Father, Pius XII, is the Shepherd of Christendom? You are one of the human family, and he is the shepherd of that family, the Chief Priest and Patriarch, appointed by Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“That’s what you think,” we hear you say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But hold on a minute. We don’t want to argue. We only want to explain what 400,-000,000 of us Catholics accept as fact, and you can check it with your own Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">St. Peter was Head of the Apostles. His name is mentioned more than 190 times in the Gospels and Acts: after him comes St. John, the Beloved Apostle, with only 29 mentions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As one might expect, Jesus made St. Peter head of His new Church: “Thou art Peter,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">JULY 4, 1945-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">and upon this rock, I will build My Church . . . And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">St. Peter’s powers passed to St. Limus, then to St. Cletus, then to St. Clement, and so on, through 261 men, to our present Holy Father, Pius XII—who is the only man living today claiming to be St. Peter’s successor. Think of that!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is true, even we have to admit that Pope Pius XII “is the only man living today claiming to be St. Peter’s successor”. And we &quot;think of that” as the most presumptuous and blasphemous claim made by any man. If it were not for the fact that &quot;400,000,000 of us Catholics” are deluded into believing this magnificent lie we would lightly consider it, even perhaps jest about it. You are invited to “check it with your own Bible”, but the Knights of Columbus were not too interested in your doing so and consequently failed to give- you the citations. Let us, therefore, help you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If you will turn to Acts 15:6-19; 21:18,19; 12:17, you will see the fallacy of the claim that “St. Peter was Head of the Apostles”. It was the apostle James, not Peter, who at least on some occasions presided at assemblies of the twelve. The apostle Paul wrote far more of the Greek Scriptures than Peter, even writing things that Peter found difficult to understand. (2 Peter 3:16) And on at least one occasion Paul had to rebuke Peter for not taking a proper stand on a certain matter. (Galatians 2:11-14) But when they say that Peter was head of the apostles because his name is mentioned 190 times, they stretch the argument to the breaking point and it snaps back at them—190 times Peter is mentioned, but not once is he spoken of or even inferred to be head of the apostles!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Another erroneous claim made in that article is that “Jesus made St. Peter head of His new Church”. And they</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">13</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">quote Matthew 16:18 as a supporting Scripture: “Thou art Peter [ (Greek) </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">petros,</span><span class="font12"> masculine gender], and upon this rock [(Greek) </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">petra,</span><span class="font12"> feminine gender] I&quot; will build my church.” If the “rock” mentioned in this text referred to Peter, <sub>%</sub> then of necessity it would have to be in I the masculine gender, the same as his ’name. But a careful reading of the preceding verses shows plainly that Jesus referred to himself as the “rock” upon which His church is built. If anyone knew what Jesus meant on that occasion - it surely was the apostle Peter himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">And so, later, when he wrote his epistle he left no room to doubt what Jesus meant. Peter testified that the church is not built upon himself but upon Christ Jesus. And you can 'check that with your Bible’, too!—1 Peter </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font12">: 4, 6-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To claim that Peter’s powers passed on down through the succession of the popes of Rome is an ignorant falsehood. There is absolutely no proof for this in the Bible. And when we turn to secular history we see,that all the facts contradict this statement flatly. The Catholic church was not established until Constantine’s day, 300 years after Peter. And as far as the office of pope is concerned, McClintock &amp;&nbsp;Strong’s </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Cyclopedia</span><span class="font12"> says (Vol. VII, page 629), “The first Pope, in the real sense of the word, was Leo I (440-471) [A.D.].” And what do you “think of that”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But hold, on, our “education” is not finished ; we read only half of that enlightening (?) article. It continues and says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If you are baptized, you belong to Christ’s Church, of which Pope Pius is the head; for in baptism, you gave your mind and heart to Jesus, who has passed His authority on earth to St. Peter and his successors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">You don’t recognize that authority? But it’s there, just the same, if the Bible is correct. And we Catholics accept it as the Word of God. True, a child may come to hate his own father, he may even run away from home, but the fact remains that he is a son of his father though he hate him; and his father has authority over him, though the child, be away from home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">So, the Holy Father,' when he defends the rights of men before tyrants, does not speak just for Catholics. He speaks for you, too. When he sends money for the relief of starving peoples, he does not dictate that his bread be given only to Catholics. It is for everyone in need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The whole human family has been entrusted to his care and that great family knows, as by instinct, that it has a powerful friend and a fearless advocate in the Holy Father of Christendom, Pope Pius XII—the Shepherd, not merely of 400,000,000 Catholics, but of all baptized Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We have heard of the tyrants Hitler, Mussolini and Franco; but have we ever heard of the “Holy Father” as defending the rights of men before such tyrants? We have heard of the pope’s signing. concordats with Mussolini, Hitler, and Franco; but have we ever heard of the pope’s renouncing such secret agreements as requested by peace-loving meh and women? No, we have never heard of that; but we have read that on March 29, 1945, Pope Pius XII attended the “Holy Thursday” mass together with the ambassadors of those German and Japanese tyrants! (See New York </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Times, </span><span class="font12">March 30, 1945.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Again, we have heard of starving ■ people, Catholics and others; but have we ever heard of the pope’s sending money for their relief? We have heard of starving people in Italy itself; but have we heard of the Vatican’s ever giving money or aid to feed them? No, we haven’t heard any startling news like that; but we have heard that in 1944 the American Relief for Italy, Inc., sent from America 7,186,100 pounds of “food, clothing and medical supplies valued, all together, at $8,314,487” for the alleviation of the suffeting of the pope’s own Italian Catholic children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">So there you have it: another sample of Catholic “education” as “sponsored by the Knights of Columbus with Ecclesiastical Approbation”, black for white, lies for truth. How 'manifest it is that the KC is engaged in a malicious eam-paign to deceive the gullible! Even their name is a deception. Instead of being chivalrous, defenders of truth and righteousness, they-are minions of the Devil, who is the father of lies. (John 8:44) Instead of being fighters for the freedom for which Columbus and America are . symbols the Knights of Columbus are straining every sinew to bring America into slavery and bondage to Rome. It is understandable, therefore, why this secret order “has the commendation of the entire Catholic Hierarchy, and special commendation from several popes&quot;. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">—Encyclopedia Americana,</span><span class="font12"> 1942 Ed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But, when pondering the malicious deeds of men in the earth today, and when our righteous indignation is inflamed because the wicked flourish, let us remember the words of. the psalmist: “Rest in Jehovah, and wait patiently for him-: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. For evil-doers shall be cut off; but those that wait for Jehovah [to take action], they shall inherit the land. For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and he shall not be.

<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Man—Why Put on Earth</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">W</span><span class="font12">HEN men braved the storms of the Atlantic ocean and landed upon American shores, they planted the flag ' of their respective rulers upon the land and claimed it. When a man flew over the region of the north pole and dropped the flag of his nation, he claimed title thereto in the name of his sovereign king. The laws adopted by the common consent of nations recognize the right to the possession of the land by reason of supposed discovery, to the ignoring of the rights of the original native inhabitants. Alienated from God, and disregarding His law, men speak of the earth and treat it as though it were man’s by right of discovery and occupancy. But, in truth and in fact, no right to possession exists by discovery. The class of ultraselfish ones, known as “rulers”, mark out a portion of the earth, claim it as their own, and use it as lords; while other men work the soil as their serfs and are permitted to exercise no right of claim or possession thereof. In reality, there is no such inherent right in man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">That man has no right to use the earth contrary to God’s way is shown by the declaration of God’s law: “The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine.” (Leviticus 25: 23) God has permitted man to take his own course. But when the proper relationship between man and God is understood and appreciated by man, the earth will be used for the common good of all mankind that lives. God is just. It therefore follows that no class will occupy the land by the exercise of injustice toward another class. “For the Lord [Jehovah] most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth. He shall choose our inheritance for us.”—Psalm 47: 2, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">From the creation of the earth God purposed that perfect man should 'fliave dominion” over it and its lower creatures. (Genesis 1:26,28) to “have dominion” means to have under foot and thus rule over, and the perfect first man, Adam, was made to exercise such dominion. One clothed w<sup>T</sup>ith authority is always subject to the one conferring that authority and must conform himself to the terms and conditions upon which his superior confers the authority. All power and authority will, by thorough analysis, be found to reside in Jehovah God. All power and authority rightfully exercised by perfect man must he exercised in harmony with Jehovah’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Expressing- His purpose in creating and putting man on earth, Jehovah God addressed His only begotten Son, His faithful and active Agent in the work of creation, and said: “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.” (Genesis 1:26) Then Jehovah and His Sori did so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The power of Jehovah knows no limitation. For Him to will a thing to be created means that it is certain to be done according to His will. Having determined to make man in His own image and likeness He proceeded to do so. That man was created for the earth and that the earth was created for man there is not the slightest room for doubt. Upon this point God’s will is expressed: “For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the Lord; and there is none else. I have made the earth, and created man upon.it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">and all their host have I commanded.” —Isaiah 45:18,12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Since the dominion of all things resides in Jehovah He could give it to whomsoever He might will. It is written (Psalm 24:1): “The earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.” , “The heaven, even the heavens, are the &quot;&nbsp;Lord’s: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.” (Psalm 115:16) Man, as well as the earth, belongs to Jehovah, because He created them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The authority of man to have dominion over the earth having been conferred upon man by Jehovah, man must exercise that authority and dominion in harmony with God’s will. When Adam was granted dominion, Hie duty and obligation devolved upon him to exercise such authority in harmony with his Creator. Adam was placed in the garden of Eden as its caretaker. He was not required to put forth laborious efforts to produce his food. Eden yielded freely all the food that was essential for his sustenance and for his pleasure. He was given control over the animals, the birds, and the fish; and these were to render and did render obedience to him. He was clothed with power and authority to produce his own kind. Had Adam exercised that Godgiven authority in harmorty with his Creator’s will he would have produced a perfect and happy family of children. God gave him the privilege to exercise his own faculties. He could willingly obey or disobey. This, however, did not at all relieve him from the obligation of being in harmony with Jehovah and exercising his authority in obedience to God’s holy will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Eden was a large district, larger than is generally supposed. It must have embraced a considerable area of land. Four rivers divided off from the river that flowed out from the garden and watered the land round about. Eden had beautiful groves which pleased the eye and produced food, and in it also were to be found all the precious stones and much fine gold. The garden portion of Eden was on the eastern side and the entrance was from the east. It was more beautiful than the other part of the district. It was in that garden that man was placed as the caretaker and where he found his pleasure and his enjoyment. The earth was for man, and the perfect man Adam was placed in a perfect home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The ecclesiastical teachers of religion, misrepresenting God and His Word, have led the people to believe that had perfect Adam remained a good and faithful officer of Jehovah God, then in due time God would have taken him to heaven. There is absolutely no evidence upon which to base such a conclusion. Adam had no promise of heaven. There never was a possibility, under any circumstances or conditions, of Adam’s going to heaven. He was strictly and purely for the earth. The earth alone was to be his everlasting home. Concerning this it is written (1 Corinthians 15:47): “The first man is of the earth, earthy.” Since the earth was made for the home of man he should not expect to find any promise of heaven for him, and there is not a word found in the Scriptures whereby Adam was promised heaven as a home. A proper understanding of this matter enables the student of God’s Word to have a clear understanding of what must be the final destiny of the human family, namely, eternal life on a perfected earth under the heavenly kingdom of Jehovah God by His Son Christ Jesus the King. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your masters; I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto</span><span class="font9"> me.—Jeremiah 27:4,5.</span></p>

The tidings were to the effect that a Theocratic assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses was held in India, December 27-31, 1944. In these days of restricted communication Jehovah’s people in one part of -the world ' often thirst for information concerning their fellow servants in distant lands,</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">In the very center of this large triangular country lie the Central Provinces, and the city of Jubbulpore. The numerous gorges in the neighboring rocks have been taken advantage of to surround the city with a series of small lakes which, shaded by fine trees and bordered by fantastic crags, add much beauty to the suburbs. The city itself is' fairly large and modern, consisting of the European civil and military sections as well as the usual conglomeration of buildings forming the Indian town common to the country. It is recognized as the educational and missionary center of the Hindi-speaking districts of the Central Provinces. Hence it was fitting that in this centrally located city of more than 1.10,000 Jehovah’s witnesses gathered for their five-day assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">of America is filled with good news. It gives account of many difficulties confronting the conventioners, and interestingly narrates how all were surmounted under the Lord’s direction. One of the most formidable problems was that of rooming accommodations. </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font12">this country, when sleeping quarters are needed for i out-of-tow’ners attending the assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses, and hotels are </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">unable </span><span class="font12">to meet the needs, a house-to-house canvass usually supplies all the accommodations required. </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">But </span><span class="font12">not so in India. The report reads: “The few hotels were quite put of reach of the majority of the Lord’s people attending the</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">assembly, and accommodations in private houses is a thing unheard of in this country, especially around the Christmas holiday season when children are home from school.” The problem was solved by the Witnesses’ getting a “hotel” of their own.

<p><span class="font12">able. Located in a large compound surrounded by trees, this beautiful building with its eleven classrooms provided ample living space. Its only drawback-no beds. Not a charpoy (Indian wooden-frame bed with woven-rope mattress) to be hired; everything taken by the military. Only on the day before the conven-tioners arrived did the problem dissolve. A local boarding school offered all the cots needed, free of charge. Out of the classrooms came school desks and in went the cots. The school had become a Theocratic dormitory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This same compound was used as meeting-place and cafeteria. In front of the school building was a large recreation field encircled by trees, and in this haven from the street noises so common in this land with its mania for religious festivals and ceremonies Jehovah’s witnesses gathered for true worship.

In this delightful setting the conventioners feasted upon the spiritual things brought to their attention through the various discourses. It was also in these pleasant surroundings that temporal food was provided, on two long lines of tables stretched out in the shade cast by fifty-feet-high bamboo trees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Speaking of some of the needs of the assembly and how these were met, the convention servant writes: “We got the offer of as many beds as we could wish, free of charge. We wished for a shamianah; one was offered us free of cost. A platform would be nice; just the thing wo wanted was offered us free. Plants for decoration—a person of good-will</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">19</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">offered us all we needed. Swimming baths for immersion, free again.

Not a thing that we asked Jehovah for, not a thing that we secretly wished for, but it was provided, and nearly always free. Just one thrill on top of another!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The program itself followed as closely as possible the one carried out four months previous in the United States, at Buffalo, New York. This one also took the same name, that is, “United Announcers’ Theocratic Assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses.” The same keynote address as used at Buffalo, “Seek Ye First the Kingdom,” sounded the theme of the Assembly. Immediately thereafter the short discourse “Song of Kingdom Service” introduced the new songbook, amidst . great rejoicings. Song sheets containing some of the new songs were distributed and all lifted voices in rousing Kingdom singing. Other discourses given at Buffalo had reached this far-off land through the medium of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font12">columns, and these were relayed to the eager ones seated under the shafnianah in Jubbulpore. Released, at the Assembly was their own cyclostyled edition of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Religion Reaps the Whirlwind.</span><span class="font12"> And to the unbounded joy of all present there was exhibited a copy of the new book, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Kingdom Is at Hand&quot;,</span><span class="font12"> with its </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Study Questions</span><span class="font12"> booklet. All these good things were evidence of Jehovah’s blessing upon His Indian witnesses, as well as those in other lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The lecture featured for the public was the same as that proclaimed at Buffalo, “The Kingdom of God Is Nigh.” Advertising presented its problems. Paper restrictions drastically limit the use of posters, and handbills are prohibited altogether. Cloth banners were therefore printed for information marchers to publicly exhibit upon their persons. A quantity of booklets were on hand</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">which had the back cover page blank, and on this space details of the public lecture were printed. Hence as the publishers distributed these booklet-hand-bins they spread a double-barreled shot of Kingdom information. Despite handicaps, the Theocratic announcers made khown to Jubbulporeans that “the kingdom of God is nigh”, and informed them of the public lecture clarifying the proclamation. But Jubbulpore, as all India, reeks with religion. It is difficult to see how they could have “more religion”. Nevertheless, some forty persons from the city attended the public discourse, in addition to the 110 regular convention attenders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Though this Assembly may strike some as very small, it was quite satisfactory for India. Traveling on India’s railroads is extremely irksome, even by first class; and few of the Lord’s “poor” could use this means. Most of them had to take the lower class accommodations; and the report at hand says one has to literally fight one’s way aboard the train, and chances of sleep on the long journeys are exceedingly slim. But those who came departed rejoicing, amply repaid for the time and effort and money expended. Four at the Assembly symbolized their consecration to the Lord by water immersion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">All the foregoing is good news from this far-off country. It shows Jehovah’s witnesses there are united in purpose with their fellow witnesses throughout the earth. As their numbers and energies and opportunities permit, they push the work of Kingdom announcement. They act upon Christ Jesus’ command: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole inhabited earth.” (Matthew 24:14, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.,</span><span class="font12"> margin) And certainly India, of all countries, is “inhabited earth”. In that comparatively small part of the earth’s surface some 320,000,000 people live 1 They comprise one-fifth of earth’s population 1 Hence the little band of witnesses there can surely appreciate Jesus’ words re-</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">garding a plenteous harvest but few laborers. Jehovah will duly answer their heartfelt prayer for more laborers. . —Matthew 9: 36-38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">- Shortage of Theocratic workers has not been the only handicap of the Indian &quot;&nbsp;Kingdom announcers. There are 220 ^■distinct languages in India. This problem 4 is worsened by widespread illiteracy. In these ignorant masses religion flourishes, and the deluded people worship anything and everything but Jehovah God. The 6,000,000 “Christians” in the land , are as steeped in demonism as the hundreds of millions of practitioners of Hinduism, Mohammedanism and Buddhism. As if the^e obstacles to efficient Kingdom preaching were not enough, the “god of this world” inspired the clamping on of a ban on importations of Kingdom literature, in 1941.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But regardless of demon-raised bar; riers, . Jehovah’s will as expressed through Jesus will be carried out, namely, 'The Kingdom gospel shall be preached.’ It shall b§ proclaimed to all nations, including India. Jehovah God is opening up country after country to His ‘disciplers of all the nations’. Ban after ban is falling, and soon the gospel of the Kingdom will be streaming into countries heretofore cut off from a full flow of Theocratic literature. What about India? On December 11, 1944, just sixteen days before the Indian version of the “United Announcers’ Theocratic Assembly”, it cast aside the ban on importation of Kingdom literature! This final victory flash caps the glad tidings coming out of India. Glory to God in the highest, who is opening up the whole inhabited earth to His Kingdom announcers.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>The Smell of Oil</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">S</span><span class="font12">OMETIME about the middle of February, 1945, President Roosevelt met King Ibn Saud, of Arabia, on a United States warship at the northern end of the Suez canal. It would be interesting to know what they talked about; it was probably about oil. The New York </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font12">had but little to say of this interview with one of the three kings that the president met (Farouk, of Egypt, and Selassie, of Ethiopia, being the other two), though there may be a hint in this sentence:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It ia customary in the, Arab world to exchange gifts and it may safely be assumed that King Ibn Saud and Mr. Roosevelt followed this tradition. However, possibly because of the fear of Congressional inquiries in Washington, nothing was officially released <sub>r</sub> on. this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A year before the meeting, there was a good deal of excitement in the United States about what was then called “The Arabian Oil Scandal”. Just to refresh your minds, what would you think of a group of millionaires that would urge the government to expend $165,000,000 in’ their behalf, and quite unnecessarily too, and, as soon as the storm of indignation broke, would rush into print and condemn the government for doing that very thing? That seems to have been done in the project to parallel existing oil pipe-lines from Iraq to Haifa in Palestine, with one of the parallel lines reaching over into Iran, the other side of Iraq.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Labor Action,</span><span class="font12"> New York, basing its opinion on remarks of the news commentator and columnist Drew Pearson, says that “the United States, along with Great Britain, is interested in buying off the Arab rulers at the expense of Jewish aspiration in Palestine”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Referring to the Arabian pipe-line Senator Voorhis, of California, pointed out to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">PM’s</span><span class="font12"> representative that the- Shell Oil Company, the Gulf Oil Company, the Standard Oil Company of California, the Socony-Vacuum Company and the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey would be the beneficiaries of the project; and that it was officials of the first four of these companies (but acting in their then capacities of government directors and advisers) that put the program across. And as soon as the decisions had been made, they all withdrew from government employment. Then, after they were safely back in their old oil company jobs, those saintly oil companies issued a “white paper” bawling the government out for doing such a rash thing. Thereupon, the New York </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font12"> which is always for the Big Moneyed crowd, be they white, black, ring-streaked or speckled, said solemnly (and the editorial may have been written by one of those same oil men, with his tongue in his cheek):</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The controversy that has arisen between Secretary Ickes and the oil companies places the administration in a situation which it must clarify. Why is it necessary to lay a pipe-line in Saudi Arabia at public expense? All authorities agree that, alarming though the inroads on our own reserves may be, the war can be won with the oil now available. In fact, the oil companies stoutly and perhaps mistakenly insist that our oil reserves are ample for more than the fifteen years now allotted to them. . . . Why should the administration insist on building the pipe-line at public expense? The cost, $165,000,000 as a maximum, is not so huge that it must of necessity come out of the treasury. If public money is thus to be invested the government inevitably goes into the oil business. Ameripan companies rightly protest. They are financially and technically able to build their own pipe-lines, pumping stations and refineries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Concerning this ungracious and ungrateful arrangement, Senator Voorhis said;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Under the agreement, the American people will not only expend a predictable sum of money on a pipe-line for the use of private ■ companies, but, much more important, they will assume international risks and face almost certain danger without acquiring thereby a single substantial compensation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In other words, in this instance the monkey uses the cat’s paws to pull the chestnuts out of the hot fire, and„ after grabbing and devouring the chestnuts, hits the cat a smart rap over the ears for doing or permitting such a thing to Ue dond with its paws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Readers will excuse drawing their attention to so small an amount as $165,000,000, in a day when everybody is talking in billions. Some have called this project “the worst scandal in .the history of the American oil industry”, and as that industry has always been a top-notcher for scandals, readers are entitled to have a look.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Some idea of the importance of oil in the present state of the world’s affairs is afforded by a little booklet (16 pages) put out by Standard Oil Company (New Jersey) wherein occurs the estimate that the energy provided by America’s output of petroleum is the equivalent of 36 able-bodied slaves for every man, woman and child in the United States; also, it takes two gallons of gasoline to carry a Flying Fortress one mile; also, and within two years of starting to do it, the oil industry was producing synthetically more rubber than the nation ever consumed in any yeUr of peace. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Jews think, and others also think for them, that it is unfortunate for their national hopes that oil was found in Arabia. The Bridgeport </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Post,</span><span class="font12"> referring to the agreement between the British and American governments, that the Jews might return to the land that was mandated to them, said pointedly and thoughtfully:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If the democracies of the world can thus make a solemn pledge to all the people of the world and then repudiate it because it seems at the moment convenient to do so, who will put faith in anything they say in the future? ,</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>“Dear Eddie” Lands in Rome</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">W</span><span class="font12">HEN a fellow gets boosted by the _ cow’s heels, one can’t always tell where he wjll land. Take “Eddie” for instance, better known, perhaps, as Paving 'Block Eddie or as just plain Ed Flynn. |le was boosted by the, cow’s heels just when it looked as if he were going to be United States’ ambassador to Australia at Mr. Roosevelt’s appointment. This move on the president’s part on behalf of “Dear Eddie” was called an insult to 'Australia and Roosevelt’s great political mistake. Such a furore was raised over the very suggestion of Boss Flynn’s appointment that the whole deal was called ■ off. But Eddie was a loyal son of the one and only “Holy Roman Catholic Church”, and that makes a big difference, regardless of how shady may be the background. What difference does it make to the Hierarchy whether Eddie paved a court at one of his country homes at public expense, using city labor and 8,000 city paving blocks? And what difference does it make to the Hierarchy that Eddie was the friend and employer of gangster Dutch Schultz, of the same “faith”? All that could be overlooked, or even “explained”. True, as the Pinehurst </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Outlook </span><span class="font12">said,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The objection to Flynn comes from men of all political parties, those on the right, the left and in the middle, who are striving to preserve an honorable nation. . . . Recognition by the president of the United States of men who have been leaders in political camps which serve to disintegrate the fundamental honesty of the nation is outrageous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But the Hierarchy and its friends only laugh at such protests. It has no use for protestants of any kind at any time. Eddie said he didn’t know about the paving blocks or about Dutch Schultz, though everybody else knew, and his excuse was accepted. But he didn’t become ambassador to Australia. There wasn’t a chance of his being approved by the Senate; so there was nothing for Roose-</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">24</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">yelt to do but withdraw the appointment. But he didn’t forget an old friend. The fuss about Eddie was allowed to die down. Most people have short memories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Comes now the Yalta conference, an occasion of some consequence. And who should appear at Yalta along with President Roosevelt but “Dear Eddie” ! As the president’s personal emissary he was present not only at Yalta, but also went on a private mission to Moscow for the president, and then went on to Rome, planning also.to visit Paris, London and the Fifth Army front.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Flynn, who let the cat out of the bag ahead of schedule on the occasion of his proposed appointment as ambassador to Australia, found it embarrassing to keep from saying things which he should not say to reporters in Rome. After a visit with the pope’s closest advisers, Flynn said, “I just went in to say ‘How do you do?’ ‘Glad to see you,’ and ‘Goodbye’.” He was just on a sort of “personal pilgrimage&quot;, but his audience with the pope was much longer than that astute politician (the pope, not Eddie) usually grants to those on “personal pilgrimage”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Various efforts were made by the Vatican and its organ </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Osservatore Romano</span><span class="font12"> to make Flynn’s visit seem unimportant. But it was apparent that Flynn was there to serve in the effort to bring Stalin and the pope together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The organ of Catholic Action in Rome said, “American co-operation in the great work of His Holiness to repair the ruins of the war is so important . . . that there must be very serious reasons for these high and providential contacts.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Anyway, Flynn having been at Yalta, at Moscow and other places, there is no doubt that the pope will learn quite a little from “Dear Eddie”, especially as his visits are supplemented by visits from Archbishop Spellman and Myron C. Taylor. Commentators seem to have said little about Flynn’s visit to Yalta,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">consolation </span><span class="font12">and his subsequent travels. One, however, said this: ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Don’t be surprised if in the next few days you learn that Prince Sapieha, of noted Polish lineage, the cardinal archbishop of Craeow, spiritual heart of ancient Poland, is named chief of the new Polish government. This is the government now being shaped at Moscow by Stalin. Flynn was there during the shaping. Above all else, the Vatican in its public statements has stressed the importance to the Holy See of the inhabitants of Catholic Poland and its concern over .their spiritual welfare under a regime dictated and controlled by the Communist powers of Moscow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The same commentator, John O’Donnell, remarked further:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The White House and State Department attitude, based on the accepted Roosevelt principle that the less the citizens of the Republic know about what’s going on the happier they will be, simmers down to this: Anyone, particularly any reporter, who asks questions about Ed Flynn’s mission to Moscow is a dirty so-and-so, fiddling around to no good purpose in the sacred zone of secret diplomacy as defined by F. D. R., and just making things tougher for Papa Franklin in his selfappointed mission to guide the destinies of the sons of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">And, finally, We suppose it would be entirely out of order for any taxpayer to ask ivho is paying Flynn’s expenses on this “personal pilgrimage”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>“Every Beast Is Mine”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font12">HE Creator has a personal interest in every creature. Not a sparrow falls to the ground that He does not know about it. And He knew about it before it fell, and provided for it. He is the real owner of all the beasts, as is apparent from the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine.-—Psalm 50; 10,11. </span><span class="font12">Man’s dominion over the lower animals is not an absolute dominion. It is a trusteeship. He is notified that “every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you” (Genesis 9:3), but is immediately warned that “the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat” (Gen-• esis 9:4), which is a solemn warning to him that he can go just so far and no farther with Jehovah’s property.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Vivisection Investigation League, 11 East 44th street (Room 708), New York city, objects to the mistreatment of dogs, and cites some evidence given by Dr. William Howard Hay before a Congressional Committee showing the unspeakable cruelty and inexcusable foolishness of the torturers;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Take the experiment, for instance, of shaving the dog and applying phosphorus to the surface of the skin. Phosphorus produces a progressive burn. It would burn right into the middle of the dog if it was left there long enough. This experiment was performed in search of a means to neutralize the burning effect of phosphorus, the idea being to find a means for treating burns in the army in future wars. Anyone who did not know that 25 years ago did not know his chemistry. We have always known what would neutralize the progressive activity of phosphorus; and, knowing that thing, they use it to relieve the dog and get objective evidence only, whereas if the laboratory worker had put a grain of phosphorus on the back of his hand he would have gotten subjective evidence in the burn and the neutralizing agency. That experimentation was useless because it was to prove something that was already well known, and it inflicted the most terrible tortures on the dog.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It was admitted by opponents of the bill that dogs have been roasted in chambers to death to see at what point of rising temperatures life will terminate. This is no criterion of the condition of man in equal temperatures, for the reason that man is supplied with skin, numerously distributed over the surface of which are pores for the purpose of evaporating water through the skin, and thus keeping the surface cool.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">These dogs were put in chambers with a YUfinite supply of moisture for the air to make the conditions comparable to those of the at-v mosphere, and the temperature gradually raised, and the dog observed through a win. dow as he suffered and died. The dog has to , radiate heat from his surface through his tongue and the lining of the mouth and throat and lungs. He does not perspire; he has no pores for that purpose. So that any information adduced through these cruel experiments could not be of any use to humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What Human Would Not Oppose It?</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>The Albigenses</span></h2>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font12">HE Albigenses (al”bi-jen'-sez) were a class of Christians existing in the south of France and who came more prominently to the fore when the pope decided to clean up on them once for all, in the twelfth century. The name is derived from the city of Albi, which was considered the center of the territory in which these believers lived. The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia</span><span class="font12"> and the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Britannica</span><span class="font12"> unite in calling them “heretics”, which means that they did not agree with the church. of Rome. They didn’t, for good reasons. Their descent is traced to the Paulicians of the third century. (See article on Paul of Samo-sata in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font12"> No. 648.) They have also been called Bulgarians, since they came into France by way of Bulgaria, either, to escape persecution or to carry on their work of preaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Becoming too numerous for the comfort of the pope, incongruously named &quot;Innocent III”, a crusade was formed to wipe them out at the beginning of the thirteenth century. But that is getting ahead of the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Albigenses were a simple people, who had no use for mere ceremony. They adhered to the plain teachings of the Gospels, which they held to be of preeminent authority, considering the Hebrew Scriptures or &quot;Old Testament” of less importance, a mistake which is still common among many today. What is told about these people in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia</span><span class="font12"> must be taken with a great deal of allowance for the well-known tendency of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to justify falsification when it serves their purpose. The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia,</span><span class="font12"> however, does say that &quot;the rise and spread of the new doctrine in southern France was favoured by various circumstances, among which may be mentioned . . . their contempt for the Catholic clergy, caused by the ignorance and the worldly, too frequently scandalous, lives of the latter; the protection of an overwhelming majority of the nobility, and the intimate local blending of national aspirations and religious sentiment”. -This indicates that the Albigenses did not see any particular reason for being dominated by the Italian Hierarchy, and were content to be simply decent simple folk who accepted the Scriptures without the addition of popeworship, image-worship, Mary-worship, and a dozen other kinds of worship, more or less. The Albigenses had much in common with the Waldenses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Many Protestant writers show’ that these Albigenses were free from the errors charged against them by the Romish persecutors. Hardwick, in his </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Middle Ages,</span><span class="font12"> p. 311, says: ‘AVhat these bodies held in common, and what made them equally the prey of the inquisitor, was their unwavering belief in the corruption of the mediaeval Church, especially as governed by the Roman pontiffs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It appears that the chief charge against the Albigenses, as against numerous other bodies of “heretics”, was that they did not accept the doctrine of -the “trinity”, which is nowhere mentioned in the Scriptures. In fact, for ifearly a thousand years, the persecutions of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy were directed against those who accepted Jesus’ own wmrds, “The Father is greater than I.” (Those interested in tracing these persecutions, and, the groups who suffered them, will be helped 'by consulting these studies as they have appeared in past issues of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation, </span><span class="font12">this being one of the series.) .</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Britannica</span><span class="font12"> says, significantly, “It is exceedingly difficult, however, to form any very precise idea of the Albigensian doctrines, as our knowledge of them is derived from their opponents. . . . What is certain is that, above all, they formed an anti-sacerdotal party in permanent opposition to the Roman Church, and raised a continued -protest against the corruption of the clergy of their time.” In destroying the writings and books of these Christians the Roman Hierarchy and its agents were free, according to its own motion, to lie about them more effectively. This has been its practice from earliest times, and even included the destruction of the history of the people that inhabited the Americas before the arrival of the Spanish invaders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Since, however, the Albigenses protested against the acknowledged corruption of the Roman clergy, they must have stood for an opposite ideal, which they associated with the teachings of God’s Word. It is therefore a logical conclusion that they w’ere honest, decent, unpretentious believers, holding to the truths of the Scriptures as far as they could understand them in those dark times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As already staled, under various pretexts a crusade was launched against the Albigenses. Beziers, the capital of one of the provinces, was taken by storm, and the Boman Catholic attackers massacred all the inhabitants, some <sup>n</sup>«ay 20,000, some 40,000. Catholics as Well (is Albigenses were murdered. “Kill them all; God will know his own,” said the pope’s legate. This has, of course, been denied; but when one considers how Catholics as well as others were indiscriminately murdered by the pope’s de-'votee Franco, in Spain, in the recent conflict there, it is easy to understand what happened in the south of France when the pope ordered the extermination of the Albigenses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The crusade became a war that spread over wide territories. The constancy of the Albigenses aroused the wonder of some of their opposers. “Tell me, holy father,” said one to Bernard, “how is this 1 They entered to the stake and bore the torment of the fire, not only with patience, but with joy and gladness. I wish your explanation [of] how these members of the devil could persist in their heresy with a courage and constancy scarcely to be found in the most religious of the faith [of Rome].”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Finally, when the flourishing civilization of the south of France had been well nigh obliterated, a peace w<sup>T</sup>as concluded in the treaty of Paris (1229), destroying the independence of the princes of the south, but not ending the so-called “heresy”, in spite of the wholesale massacres. The Inquisition took up where the “crusade” left off. It operated continuously in Albi and other towns during that entire century and a large part of the next. It finally succeeded in crushing the Albigenses. Hunted by the Hierarchy and deserted at last by the princes who had formerly favored them, the Albigenses were reduced to hiding in forests and mountains, meeting now and then in secret, but always in danger of death. Doubtless a remnant of them continued until the Reformation brought<sup>1 </sup>to them and the Waldenses a final release.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Presenting “This Gospel of the Kingdom”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Speaking Well Daily</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">iffpAKE with you words, and return X unto Jehovah: ... so will we render as bullocks the offering of our lips?’ (Hosea 14:2, AS’. I<sup>7</sup>.) This matches the expression of the apostle Paul at Hebrews 13:15: “Let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips.” Such sacrifices are not to be offered only at intervals, but continually. The speaking to God’s glory is to be performed daily. “So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.” “If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his {stake] daily, and follow me.” Early Christians taught daily in the houses of the people. (Psalm 61: 8; Luke 9:23; Acts 5:42) Hence the question of how to speak well daily becomes vitally important to the Theocratic minister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When speaking the Kingdom message to the people, look at them. As the minister speaks his facial expression should reflect the import of the message. He should portray enthusiasm, kindly interest, earnestness, and strong conviction. In other words, Jehovah’s ministers should have speaking countenances. The facial expression should show that the speaker believes what he is saying. Important also is pleasantness. The message is one of good news, and its gladsome truths should be proclaimed to the people with radiant joy. Smile, and be congenial. Not only should one’s face reflect emotions as he speaks, but as one listens his expression should change with his inner reactions. Poker faces have no place in everyday gospel-preaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Choice words become the Kingdom message. The best are none too good for framing in the minds of listeners the glorious Kingdom truths. This means watch grammar, apply in everyday conversation the rules learned in Theocratic ministry training. Glaring errors in grammar detract not only from the message but also from the messenger. Likewise the words chosen to present the truth should be in good taste, simple, understandable, refined. Coarse and vulgar expressions of the day avoid. Some slang after much usage becomes a reputable part of the English language, but until it is elevated to this position the Theocratic minister plays safe to shun it. It is very important that the above counsel as to grammar and choice of words be followed in daily conversation, for this reason: habits once formed are not easily broken. If slang-weakened language is used in the daily routine, when one gives a speech on the platform he will grope for acceptable words, and when he finds those words they will not be natural to him and he will seem to be “on parade”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the every day.conversations of house-to-house preaching poise is essential. If unforeseen circumstances arise the minister should not allow it to throw him off the track. If interruptions occur, accept them as the expected thing. If differences arise, do not lose all sense of balance. Keep your wits about you; watch your spirit or mental disposition under any unsettling conditions that arise. Above all, if one does become * vexed or angry he should not show it. This is the exception to the previously stated rule about showing your inner reactions. One very important point for gospel-preachers to remember, and one in which they often fall short, is not to plunge in at the outset and tell the other person he is all wrong. Take one main point and discuss it and let other major differences await another day for settlement. Do not contradict on every trivial matter. Do not adopt the attitude with the people that you are right and everyone else is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The point just mentioned about confining oneself to one main issue leads</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">into the next matter for discussion, namely, fixing the point. This means nothing more than to set the goal or aim of the conversation and then to order words accordingly. So doing one will al-<sub>f</sub> ways he “keeping his eye on the ball”, so \to speak. In door-to-door work and at ^back-calls it will be necessary to introduce this main point; in other words, to establish at the outset a point of contact. Determine the interests of the person being addressed, and' from this solid ground lead into the point at issue. This procedure is always followed by alert witnesses as they go from house to house. In making their presentation they watch the face of the householder to note reactions. If no response, change tactics. When a spark of interest is struck by some statement, follow that line of thought to lead into the fixed point. A Theocratic minister should not confine his witness to points that appeal to him alone. He should not get into a rut in his testimony and strike always with ’ the same blow. A versatile attack becomes fighters for the New World. They should be alert to catch the responses of the different individuals they address and capitalize upon the varied individual interests shown. Talk on Kingdom truths that seem to strike a responsive chord in the bosom of the hearer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">* Above all, servants of God should speak to the point. The Scriptures abound in counsel about sparing words and letting words be few’. They even go so far as to declare that a fool is known by a multitude of words and that fin many words there wanteth not sin’, especially if spoken in anger. (Proverbs 17: 27; 10:19; Ecclesiastes 5:2, 3) Words that convey no thought are worthless words. And the thought<sup>1</sup> expressed must.be brief and to the point. From the hearer's standpoint there are two outstanding reasons for avoiding wordiness. In the first place, it is vexatious to the hearer and stamps the speaker as boring. In the second place, a message can be hidden by words, words, words. Even if the speaker makes his point, if it has been weighed down unmercifully with excess word-baggage the hearer will have become so w'earied by the burdensome presentation that he will have no energy’to react enthusiastically. Keep the message on the “sword of the spirit” sharp and pointed. And know when to quit. Do not close a listening ear by abusing it. Remember, conversation is not lecturing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">And this brings us to a brief discussion of conversation manners. Pause, and thus give the other a chance to express himself. If one does all the talking the other will not listen. Learn to listen attentively, intelligently, and with patience. In order to be helpful one must listen. Why? Only by patiently listening first to the other’s errors can one find out wherein he can help. True, it will cost a little time, but it will be worth .while. Here is a tip: Reduce your interjections and you will shorten the other’s speech. Tnteejections induce the other to start anew’. Furthermore, your interjections will cause the other to believe you are having your share in the conversation. On the other hand, polite and attentive silence will suggest to him, “Now,-I should give the other person a chance.” Hence avoid interjections; wait, and your turn will come to express your reactions. There are limits to listening, however. Renjcmber that‘you are there to speak the truth, and you should not allow the other person to ramble on with irrelevant twaddle and idle rigmarole when you. should be preaching the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Public speaking from the platform has been defined as heightened conversation; therefore, everyday conversation is without the intensification required for delivery to a large audience, but it follows the same principles. It is merely a case of applying in everyday speaking with appropriate modification the same principles followed in platform speaking.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">O</span><span class="font12">N TWO separate occasions Jehovah’s witnesses tried to get the use of the Community clubhouse at Baton Rouge, La., for preaching the gospel of Jehovah’s kingdom, for which Jesus taught His followers to pray. The American Legion controls the clubhouse and, of course, was and is too “patriotic” to permit any group to use their clubhouse if such group puts the worship of Al-ipighty God ahead of worship of the flag. So the witnesses were refused on both occasions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But along came the St. Gerard Majella Roman Catholic Church and rented the clubhouse for Sunday evening, December 17, 1944, and broke seven laws, listed on the front page of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">State Times</span><span class="font12"> of Baton Rouge for December 20, 1944. The American Legion would not hear to the preaching of the gospel of Jehovah’s kingdom; no, sir, not a bit of it. But if you want to sell intoxicating liquors without a license, and on Sunday night, and to minors, and in the presence of</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>at Baton Rouge, La.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">minors, and if you want to operate lotteries and gambling apparatus illegally ajid in the presence of minors, and on Sunday night, w'hy, just address the Head Patriot of the American Legion, Baton Rouge, La., and tell him what you want and it will be all right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It should be explained, of course, that in the eyes of the Legion the 1921 Louisiana constitution, article 1928, forbid-dinggambling, is unpatriotic. It also considers unpatriotic the Louisiana Criminal Code, Act 43 of 1942, articles 90, 91 and 92, regarding lotteries, unlawful sales to minors and the sale of intoxicating liquors in the presence of minors. It considers null and void the Act of the Louisiana legislature, 1886, No. 18, that intoxicating liquors shall not be sold on Sunday, and it considers the supporting ordinances of Baton Rouge and East Baton Rouge as on a par with Almighty God’s Ten Commandments and therefore not worthy of obedience or respect by the great American Legion.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Communist bogeyman</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">♦ Most persons are familiar with the scriptures which say of the early church that “all that believed were together, and had all things -common’' (Acts 2:44), and that “the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.”—Acts 4: 32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now that the Russian people have tried the same experiment, and have given it up, and it is no longer an issue anywhere in the world, maybe a few things can be said on the tremendous propaganda against Communism which was waged by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Why did they do it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The answer is simple. The Hierarchy is for itself first, last, and all the time, and for the common people never, at any time. It always sides with the aristocracy if there is one; it sides with those that have the money, if there are such; it sides with those that have power, and never with the underdog. This is true in Spain, Argentina, and in every other country. In </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Germany Will Try It Again, </span><span class="font6">page 151, Sigrid Schultz explains:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If ever hypocrisy profited by gullibility on a gigantic scale, German hypocrisy did in rearming behind the general, blinding fear of Communism in the rest of the world. Behind, too, the allied fear that if pushed too far, the defeated colossus of Germany would join with the revolutionary colossus of Soviet Russia. Back of this curtain of fear, the Germans worked with impunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Quite probably the entire campaign of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy against Communism was to give Germany a chance to rearm and make its second attempt to grab the world.' All the Big Business crowd and all the Allied governments knew what Germany was doing in its armament factories while the pope was shrieking against Communism.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">When Hitler Lost the War</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">A</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">dolf Hitler, Jesuit-trained, vyis making rapid progress toward the re-establishment of the “Holy Roman Empire”. He, and his fellow Jesuits, had destroyed the German republic shortly after he became chancellor, January 30, 1933. They destroyed the Austrian republic when he entered Vienna, March 12, 1938. They destroyed the Czechoslovak republic when he entered Prague, October 1, 1938. They destroyed the Spanish republic when their man Franco entered Madrid, March 28, 1939. They destroyed the Polish republic when their armies entered Warsaw, September 27, 1939. They destroyed the French republic when they entered Paris, June 14, 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They lost the war, however (except as the pope may be able to induce a negotiated peace), when they invaded the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, June 22, 1941. For Hitler it was a fatal error. The Muscovite republic, with its area of 8,819,791 square miles, and its population of 192,695,710, is the largest country in the world, having, as it does, one-sixth of earth's land surface. It embraces almost every climate, many and great rivers, every mineral and other natural resource, almost every variety of timber, every character of cereal, vegetable and fruit lands. It has the stupendous total of 1,037,400,000 acres suitable for cultivation, of which one-eighth is under cultivation. It contains 49 recognized nationalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Except for the bellowings of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and the plutocrat press the United States has always gotten along nicely with Russia.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Things He Didn’t Know</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since he lost the war Hitler has complained that he did not know Russia was so well prepared to meet his attack. The reason why he did not know what was going on was that there were virtually no Roman Catholic priests in the country to keep him posted. Now all the world is aware that in ten years the output of Soviet industry has shown a sixfold increase. The state industries, which include all of the most important enterprises, account for more than 99.97 percent of the total industrial output of the country. The government drafts annually about 1,000,000 youths for industrial training, after which they work for the state for four consecutive years. There are 243,000 collective farms, operated by 18,800,000 households. That makes about 77 families, or, say, 400 persons, to a farm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Russians have a penchant for getting along with each other. Is there anything wrong about that? A few years ago Big Business, prodded along by Big Church, would have screamed “Bolshevism” clear across the top of the paper, in letters three inches high, if one had even dared to ask the question. Now they meekly admit that in the production of iron ore in 1938, the last year for which the figures are available, the largest producers were as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">France &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32,600,000 long tons</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">United States &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28,400,000 long tons</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">'' Russia &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26,000,000 long tons</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">jA.ll others together 74,000,000 long tons ' In t£e productibn of manganese in the same year Russia yielded 2,273,000 - metric tons out of a world total of - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5,200,000 tons.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. Within two years from the time Hitler hopped into Russia Uncle Sam had also arrived with $2,444,000,000 in lend-lease materials of all kinds, including plenty of 32-ounce kersey overcoating and overcoats for the Russian soldiers, and these had more to do with defeating the Germans on the cold eastern front than can be quickly imagined. It was one good-natured giant backing up another in a fight for the liberty of both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Disarmament Conference</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Several years ago, and, no doubt, you remember it well, there was a disarmament conference at Geneva. At that conference Maxim Litvinoff, now Soviet ambassador at Washington, but then acting as spokesman for the Russian people, made the suggestion that all the . armies and navies be disbanded. The proposal was sneered at and treated with contempt by International Murderers, Inc., who longed for the world to be once again where it is now. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After that conference the Russians trained a million youths in topography and map reading, a million and a half in the care of horses, and many thousands in the care of airplanes. They taught five million housekeepers, factory workers, school children and collectivist farmers how to put on gas masks, how to degasify rooms, how to gather debris after bomb explosions and how to extinguish fires started by incendiary bombs. The OGPU knew what was coming, and so did Stalin. That is why he offered to stand by Czechoslovakia when Chamberlain backed up International Murderers, Inc., at Munich. They divided Russia into eight industrial units, and six of the eight units they put in Asia, so as to have as much as possible to fall back on when the Germans should go over the top eastward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Finally the Germans came, but there were Russians in every forest and on every hilltop. As the tanks came along they were met with a barrage of bottles filled with benzine, with stoppers of tow or raw cotton soaked in the same fluid. With two bottles, one aimed at the front and one at the rear, and with the stoppers lighted just before they were thrown, a single Russian infantry battalion claims to have destroyed 100 tanks in a month, by putting the motor out of action or exploding the fuel tank.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Germans got within twenty miles of Moscow but never arrived. They were stopped by a flaming barrier of hay, straw and other combustibles. No soldier wants to walk into a huge fire; and they didn’t. Hitler was honest enough to admit that his men had run into unexpected and immeasurable difficulties, and that the Russians had far more equipment than he had imagined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Invisible Bridge</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the reasons why the Germans left several million men in Russia is that they were met with a combination of courage, resourcefulness and determination seldom equaled. An illustration of this was the successful building of an invisible bridge within 150 yards of German sentries, enabling tanks to cross a river and open an offensive where least expected. The bridge, with its top two feet under water, was put together at night by men standing chest deep in freezing water, and without the sound of a hammer. It takes a combination of brains and grit to do a thing like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After the Stalingrad siege was lifted, resulting in a loss to the Germans of 500,000 men and an immense booty in planes, tanks, guns, rifles, trucks and railroad cars, the Cossacks began riding again, and as they were in their home land, and are at home in the saddle, they made the retreat back across Russia a terrible experience for the disheartened Germans. Often the Cossacks rode 100 miles in a day to strike their blows. They penetrated where other troops could not go. In one instance 118 tanks were surrendered to the cavalry at one time. Tn 140 days after the retreat started the Russians drove the Germans back 435 miles, regained 185,328 square miles of territory and, when winter came, were halfway from Stalingrad to Berlin. It is best not to chase a bear into his den unless you have decided what to do if he turns around and starts in the other direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">CIO News</span><span class="font6"> reports that most of the workers in Russian factories are women; that they are flocking into the factories, freight yards and repair shops of railroads and steamers in astonishing numbers, and with a good degree of adaptability to their new duties as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The London </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Lancet</span><span class="font6"> tells how the Russian nurses have stood up to their job. They have helped to build hospitals, cut down trees, square timbers, make window frames, and dig foundations. The British surgeons marveled when they were taken to a forest, were passed through an entrance, and at length found themselves in a thousand-bed hospital with trees projecting through the roof. Most of this was the work of nurses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">En Route to Stalingrad</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Taganrog, when the Germans arrived on their way to Stalingrad, a woman bookkeeper volunteered to show the German commandant and his staff the best house in town. They moved into a well-furnished house for the night, and during that night the house was blown up, the 50 officers were buried in the wreckage, and the woman escaped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At both Kiev and Odessa, just before the Germans came in, the Russians planted time bombs, with fatal results to those who were present when they exploded. At Kiev fires were started which demolished tw<sup>T</sup>enty blocks in the center of the city, and at Odessa a single bomb killed fifty Axis army and navy officers. German officials expressed the belief that the bombs were exploded by radio impulses, which is not improbable. This would seem extremely likely to be the case in Odessa, where the bomb exploded four days after the Russians had removed from the city every man, woman and child, and every piece of military or industrial equipment that could be of any value to an invading army. By the way, the evacuation of Odessa in that manner on the single day of October 16, 1942, was in itself a very remarkable occurrence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In their retreat eastward the Soviet armies destroyed all waterworks, electric power stations and factories. Bridges, railways, houses and entire villages were obliterated in a belt sixty miles wide. The Germans found it almost impossible to get fuel to the front. The Russians let the tanks pass, then killed the drivers and set fire to the fuel. Some 37,000,000 fled with the Russian armies toward the Urals and the Volga. As the great dam at Dnepropetrovsk was blown up there were 3,500 around it trying to cross and follow the army; all these were killed by the explosion. The flood which followed raised the Water level of the Dnieper river fifteen feet, and this took the lives of 6,500 more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the Russians withdrew from Smolensk they left behind them only 20,000 people in what had been a city of 160,000 population. Fully ninety percent of the buildings had been reduced to smoking ruins. There were numerous instances in which bombers loaded an old plane with dynamite and sent it head on into the target. The bomber, of course, was killed with the explosion which followed the impact, but there is no way of standing off such an attack.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the first three months of the invasion the Germans lost a million men a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Soviet Palace, which was to have been 115 feet taller than the Empire Sjtate building, was demolished because the iron which would have been used in its construction was needed for the war. '■The Palace was to have had at its top a fe25-foot figure of Lenin, and thus would have been an idol on a stupendous scale. It is best that the thing'was never built.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">' Could Not Endure the Cold</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As the Germans got farther into ’Russia they found that they could not endure the cold. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hamburger </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Frem-</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">denblatt</span><span class="font6"> acknowledged that the German soldiers had endured hardships exceeding anything previously experienced; supply columns were unable to reach the front-line troops; the soldiers lost weight and many of them, reached a state of physical and mental collapse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not only could the soldiers not endure weather 57 degrees below zero, but before the roads froze up they were in such condition from the rains that automobiles went in to their hubs and could be pulled out only by teams of six to eight oxen. This called for more food, which they could not spare. But when one is out to rob his neighbor’s house, one cannot be too particular about how much it costs to get there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the effort to make the withdrawal from Russia palatable to the German people, who have been brought to ruin by this Jesuit misadventure, a German broadcast before the withdrawal made this statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Gray is the country, gray is the sky, everything gray and empty. With its aspect of forlornness, the whole country is frightening. The road to Moscow resembles one vast soaked sponge along which men, horses and lorries slog along painfully and strenuously, Slowly they move, dragging themselves step by step. Time after time they are bogged down. This is Russia. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But the country which looked so forbidding to the Germans looks good &gt;to those who make it their home and who are fighting for the right to live-along the lines of the four freedoms without asking any permits from either Hitler or Pacelli. An American officer who acted as an observer reports the patience of the Russian soldier as boundless; notes his endurance, good humor under hardship, capacity for fighting on an empty stomach and under difficulties, and his steadiness under defeat and adversity. Like other soldiers, the Russians need good officers, but they never get panic-stricken, and they can stand the cold better than any other soldiers on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Massacres of Civilians</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the fall of 1942, when the German invasion of Russia was under way, Prime Minister Churchill, in an address in Edinburgh, Scotland, said that the Germans shot 54,000 civilians, men, women and children, the day they entered Kiev. Readers, that is not war. That is demonism. That, is the foretold loosing of the demons among men in the last days of Satan’s empire on earth. And, without a question in the world, every regiment of Hitler’s soldiers that engaged in such devilish work had a “chaplain” along to encourage and bless the murderers. Mr. Churchill is usually very careful about his statements. In his book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">World Crisis,</span><span class="font6"> volume 4, page 75, written before this war, he is alleged to have said, by way of emphasizing the coming deluge;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bolshevist &quot;Red Lords” of Russia have killed: 28 bishops, 1,219 priests, 6,000 professional teachers, 9,000 doctors, 12,950 landowners, 54,000 officers, 70,000 policemen, 193,000 workingmen, 260,000 soldiers, 355,250 intellectuals and professional men, 815,000 peasants. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Fourteen months after Mr. Churchill made his declaration that on their way into Russia the Germans had, in the single city of Kiev, shot 54,000 civilians, including women and children, the Russians hanged four criminals in Kharkov for such crimes committed in that city. It is probable that the confessions which these men made before they were hanged were extorted by prison methods which reflect no credit upon those who obtained them,.but, anyway, here is what these men said just before they were executed:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mikhail Petrovich Bulanov, Russian chauffeur for the German Gestapo, testified that sick and starving children were mowed down with automatic guns as they cried, “Daddy, don't kill us, we want to live.” Russian children commonly address strangers as “daddy”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Police Corporal Reinhold Ratzlaw testified that he participated in the beating of Russians and in such tortures as pulling hair out of the men’s beards and sticking pins into the women; and he also operated an automobile in which Russians were put to death from carbon monoxide gas. He estimated 35,000 killed in Kharkov city and province in this manner; 35,000 at Kiev; 8,000 at Zhitomir; 4,000 at Lubni. He declared that in what he did he was carrying out the orders of his chiefs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hans Ritz, Nazi storm trooper, testified that he helped falsify documents which led to the execution of hundreds of innocent Russians, and that he himself, in fulfillment of his orders, took a gun and fired into the people. This information is in an Associated Press dispatch from London, published in the Baltimore </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sun,</span><span class="font6"> admittedly the most honest newspaper in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Demon Obsession Manifest</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another five months passed by and in May, 1944, came a report, published in the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font6"> of matters of which the Soviet Academy of Scientists took, note when, as physicians, or otherwise, they re-entered the cities from which the Germans had been expelled. As you read, ask yourself, Are these things the work of soldiers, or are they the work of demons, devils, that have taken possession of the minds and bodies of humans that have yielded themselves, as have Hitler and his associates, to their full control?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Arteinovsk, in pursuance of the planned extermination of the population of occupied territories, the head of the public health department forbade the townspeople to send food to prisoners * of war dying of starvation in his hospital, and when withdrawal became necessary nineteen public health centers of all sorts, including a children’s hospital, a children’s tuberculosis sanatorium, an infants’ home and eleven nurseries, were blown up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Stalino and four other Russian cities all medical schools and research institutions were plundered and destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Kremenchug camp for prisoners of war the food was purposely kept beneath the starvation level, so that the mortality rate from exhaustion and starvation was 300 a day. At this same camp twenty-one Russian physicians were stripped to their underclothes and forced to dig a pit. The filth from the camp latrines was then poured into the pit, and then the physicians themselves were driven into the pit and shot. In this camp, at another time, another Russian physician, Dr. Bulochnik, was beaten, his arms broken, his eyes gouged out with a pen, and his pelvis broken; this was done by Dr. Orland, the head doctor of the prisoners’ war camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Have You Had Enough?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Have you had enough to convince you that the Devil and the demons are loose, antj that they will stop at nothing? There is plenty more. At one time, in the same camp, eighty prisoners of war were shot, among them two university teachers. All the Jewish doctors in the occupied regions were shot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Especially devilish was the job done at the village of Gastogayevskaya. There the German police detained forty children, all of them under thirteen years of age, and pumped all the blood out</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">■ of them for their use in blood banks. Of course, all the children died. If you were a wounded soldier, dying for such devils as Hitler and his cronies, would you • want to live if you knew that some little boy or little girl had been robbed of life for you in such an unspeakably s-eontemptible and horrible manner?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">• j At Orel seventeen men were poisoned <sub>v</sub> with mustard gas, then hospitalized and frequently photographed so that, when the stage of gas warfare is reached, . &quot;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there will be at hand scientific data to</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;know how it is to be conducted to get</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘the most vicious results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Information Bulletin,</span><span class="font6"> of 8 or 16 pages, published three times weekly by ‘ the Russian Embassy at Washington, . gives endless information on, this horrible' subject. From these, two paragraphs are selected from recent issues:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the two and one-half years of German occupation 25,000 persons were shot or starved to death in Nikolayev. They were buried in common graves. Eyewitnesses state that about three months ago the Hitlerites tried to cover up their crimes. They opened up the graves, dragged out the bodies, poured petrol on them and set them on fire. For an entire month the heavy smell of burning flesh hung over the eity. Then the fascists shot all hostages and prisoners who had been forced to do this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">About 40,000 civilians were put to death by the Gestapo [at Krivoi Rog]; they were shot in gullies outside the town, near the coal pits and around the brick-kilns. Others were sent to Germany or left to rot in concentration camps. A large eamp for war prisoners was set up in the military area. Here behind two rows of barbed-wire Red army men and civilians were herded into dirty, ramshackle barracks. No medical help for the sick and wounded was available. Hunger, festering wounds, and filthy rags giving no protection against the cold brought slow death to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Russians Wish to Live</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Russians wish to live, and they would be more than human if they failed</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">to resent such things as just narrated. If you were a Russian, how would you have felt if you discovered the following document, which was found at Bryansk!—</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Order No. 15, Headquarters of the Hungarian Group of Occupation Troops. Indenti-fication marks for Soviet War Prisoners. Escaping Soviet war prisoners frequently discard their identification marks, thus rendering identification as Soviet prisoners impossible. To prevent this, the general staff of the German armed forces has ordered that the design of a sloping cross be burned on the underside of the left arm of the prisoner with lunar caustic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Russians have lots of friends in the Balkans, and when they came to the Carpathians their friends within the German lines lit a chain of beacons that guided them to the passes through which lay their access to the Hungarian plains beyond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Radio heckling has become a fine art. Some Russian who speaks German perfectly stands at attention when Goebbels or some other German propagandist puts out his product over the radio. The Russian knows the exact wave length of the station to which he is listening. At length the German speaker pauses for breath, and the instant he does so the listener is astonished to hear the comment, ‘Tt’s all lies!” or .“Do you expect people to believe that!” or “This fairy tale will be continued tomorrow” or some other equally devastating comment. The result is that the listeners of the Berlin broadcasts do not know what to believe; but they did not know it anyway, even before the new system of interruption and heckling was installed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The German noise gun turned out to be a flop. The soldiers facing the Nazi troops soon got to know the difference between real noise of battle and the same sounds when tremendously amplified and put on phonograph records. Moreover, the German soldiers were affected adversely by these tremendous noises put forth in their midst. The actual noise of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">battle is enough to quail the stoutest heart. It has been observed that frightened dogs find the noise so terrifying that they often jump into rivers and swim across them to get away from such devilish environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Stalin Is a Capable Man</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Stalin is a capable man. True, he studied for the priesthood, because he wanted an education; but that was the only way he could obtain it. He never helped to operate the religious racket. He knows when to act. He dissolved the Comintern at the right time. Everything in a sixth of the world belongs to the people as a whole. That is enough to satisfy any man, for a while at least. Through Orlemanski, after he had re-established the Russian Orthodox Church, he played hide-and-seek with the pope. No politician today leaves the biggest political racket entirely untouched, and Stalin as a politician is as clever as Churchill or Roosevelt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The smartest thing Stalin did as a politician was to solemnly announce to the world that hereafter the sixteen republics that go to make up Soviet Russia shall each raise its own army units and deal directly with other countries. By that adroit move the Finns, Letts, Poles and others have their fears dispelled, and feel as safe as Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand feel in relation to the British Commonwealth of Nations, or as the 48 states feel with respect to the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Teheran Stalin offered the toast:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Without American production, the United Nations could never have won the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Long before that, and a month before Pearl Harbor, Stalin startled his guests at a banquet in Moscow, at which British and American guests were present, when he raised his glass for a toast to President Roosevelt and said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">May God help him in his task.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the following address Stalin gives in temperate language a statement of why the Jesuits have lost out in their plans to grab the world:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There can be no doubt that the idea of defense of one’s country, for the sake of which our people are fighting, must produce and is actually producing in our army heroes who are cementing the Red army, whereas the idea of seizure and plunder of a foreign country, for the sake of which the Germans are actually waging war, must give rise and actually is giving rise in the German army to professional robbers deprived of any moral principles and the deterioration of the German army.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Secondly, advancing inland • into our country, the German army is getting far away from the German rear, is compelled to act in hostile surroundings, is compelled to create a new rear in a foreign country, which, moreover, is being undermined by our partisans, who are utterly disorganizing the supplies to the German army. This compels it to fear its own rear and kills its faith in the firmness of its position, at a time when our army, operating in its native surroundings, enjoys the uninterrupted support of its rear, is ensured of its supply of man power, munitions and foodstuffs and is firmly confident in its rear. That is why our army has turned out to be stronger than the Germans expected, and the German army weaker than could have been supposed judging from the boastful publicity of the German invaders.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Liberation, of France</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">W</span><span class="font6">HEN the dawn broke over France on the morning of January 1,1944, it'was to the masses of her people just another dark day. Not because the <sub>f</sub>eternal sun of our heavens failed to beam forth with its usual splendor, but rather because the thick clouds of the &gt;&nbsp;Conqueror hung so heavily over those once free people. For more than three </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">'r ~~</span><span class="font6"> years now this pall of slavish darkness i had covered the land. And, with the com-jng in of a new year with still no sign of deliverance from under the brutal totalitarian yoke, surely it must have seemed to the French people to be an exceptionally dark New Year’s Day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is impossible to describe the hardships and sweat, the toil and tears, the sorrow and suffering that these people of France had experienced. How long would their bodies ache from lack of the necessary things of life? Not many of her children over five years of age had milk, and as a whole the children . were attaining only 65 percent of their normal growth. Exorbitant prices due to the black market were the common thing. Shoes selling as high as 3,000 francs ($60) were things not uncommon. How long would their minds be fed on the husks of foreign propaganda? Paper used by the daily pre§s had shrunk from 300,000 tons in 1939 to 60,000 tons in 1944. How long would they groan under the cruel tortures of the German inquisition? Family life was far from normal for some 800,000 French civilians. Fathers and sons had been drafted and deported to work in Germany. The question that was muttered .under the breath of every freedom-loving Frenchman was, “How long before liberation comes?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No answer to these questions was heard for six months, until the explosions on the shores of Normandy, June 6. Events then moved fast, and it appeared to many that it would be but a question of weeks and France would again live and breathe as the free democracy she for four long years had hoped to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Four-Year Cost</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Totalitarian rule is expensive. The cost that France paid in indemnities for the support of such oppressive rule, as computed by the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font6">(October 29, 1944), is staggering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The French Government paid Germany and Italy a war indemnity totaling 946,000,000,000 francs ($18,920,000,000 at the present rate of exchange) during the four years of occupation, official estimates revealed today, an amount nearly six times as great as the total expenditures of the nation in World War I.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Even a high percentage of the locomotives and rolling stock of railroads' were requisitioned by the Germans and used in its campaigns in Russia. France, once a strong nation, had been weakened with sickness and death. Some figures on this appeared in the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font6">(June 15, 1944):</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A year ago deaths from tuberculosis were up 60 percent' over prewar levels. Doctors recorded that manual workers were below prewar weights by twenty to thirty pounds. One-third of the school children made no gain in weight in a year. Newborn babies weighed an average of less than six pounds. Since 1940 deaths have exceeded births by three or four times the prewar rate of 35,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The blood-chilling atrocities committed against the helpless French will never be itemized, but can be summed up by counting the graves of those unfortunate men and women who were executed-—75,000 or more!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Invasion of France</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The invasion of France by the Allied armies had a twofold purpose. First, the driving out of the demonic Nazi hordes, and, second, the alleviating of both the mental and physical agonies of the French people. The prosecution of the primary purpose progressed with the landings on the shores of France. The surge of battle quickly passed from west to east over that country. But it left in its wake a deplorable condition among the French populace. With inflation and black-market bandits robbing and pillaging the people on every hand, the struggle for existence continued. Francis Aldbam, writing in the Vancouver </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Province</span><span class="font6"> (October 27,1944), says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Inflation in France was started and deliberately encouraged by the Germans of the occupation. It was already rampant in Paris when the Provisional Government moved in. None knew better than the German that it is easier to start inflation than to stop it. Overcrowded Paris is today a fertile breeding ground of speculators and black marketeers. . . . Food and clothes and the simple comforts are disappearing from the markets as soon as they are placed on sale. One orange or a gallon of gasoline will command a price equivalent to $1.50. Cigarettes are anything up to $4 a packet. Until there are enough of these to go ’round, the black market will flourish, especially when the people have no faith in the value of their currency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another thing that aggravated the money situation was the fact that the Nazis before leaving flooded France with phoney American money bearing on it the forged signature of Morgenthau.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This chaotic financial condition, however, in no way affected the money-men of France, the high financiers. Seldom does such bracket of society suffer either under democratic or totalitarian rule. Why? Because they are always “patriotic”—patriotic to any thing or any cause that will further their interests. Says the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Weekly People </span><span class="font6">(September 16,1944):</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The German officers themselves took it for granted that all French capitalists were collaborators with German capitalism. The general report of American newspapermen in France is that of John Chabot Smith in the New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Herald Tribune</span><span class="font4"> on August 23: “The collaborators were mostly large property owners, whose leaders were Fascists who would stop at nothing.” And that of Carey Longmire in the New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Post,</span><span class="font4"> September 6: “The men of money were too often the collaborationists, and the people of France know it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">True, some of the financial collaborators are brought to trial, but, as a class, they escape the tribunals of retribution. It is a great mystery to most persons how the International Bankers of France could prosper under Nazi rule, and then not suffer from inflation along with their fellow-countrymen. Enlightening, therefore, it is to read Drew Pearson’s report in the Washington Merry-Go-Round:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Added details of State Department cooperation with Vichy leak out, and make sad reading. Latest chapter is how the big bankers in Paris knew in advance about the American landing in North Africa and transferred their funds there, 25 billion francs, or $350,000,000. After sneaking this sum out of France, the bankers, with aid of their friend U. S. Minister liobert Murphy, brought pressure to raise the exchange rate on the franc—and succeeded. This increased holdings of the State Department’s banking friends to $525,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since the fall of France, Germany has been taking over French property from Jews, labor unions and refugees who had fled. Preparing for a- long-term throttle-hold on France, they worked carefully, sought to avoid litigation in French courts after the war. They arranged details through certain French banks. Jewish, union and refugee property was ordered taken and given to the banks. Germans bought the property from the banks, paying in francs. But the francs were taken out of the “Occupation Francs” which the Bank of France paid to Germany every day, for cost of occupation; so actually the deals cost the Nazis nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The French bankers, permitted to keep the purchase price, amassed huge profits, which were transferred to North Africa before our landing. . . . Overnight, the French banking clique made $175,000,000!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">■ But, remember, there were only a few individuals who reaped this harvest. The masses had sunk down into a deplorable condition of poverty and want by the time the Allied armies reached Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;Military conquests and victories are not necessarily political ones. The driv-u.ing of the Germanic armies out of France , Iwas only part of the task of liberation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The secondary phase was the relief of ' the suffering of the multitudes and the restoration of peace and order. The . &quot;■ policy of the Allies was to turn this * difficult job over to the French people ‘themselves. Probably no greater task has ever been undertaken by the French than that of extricating themselves from the mire of political and ecclesiastical confusion in which they are now bogged down.. Internally, France is a mass of parties, sects, and cults, with a cross section showing streaks of communistic and atheistic strata. We see, therefore, that to unify and weld France into a strong and powerful nation is a colossal undertaking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Collaborationists</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The ones responsible, in a large part, for the four agonizing years were the collaborationists, French “Quislings”, Fascists, and “fifth columnists”. There can never be unity in France so long as this element is dispersed throughout its society. The problem, therefore, of first concern to the new French government was the rounding up and cleaning out of these traitors. Strange as it may seem to some, we find high on the list of conspirators the dignitaries of that age-old and “venerable” politicoreligious organization, the Roman Catholic Church. Not “small fry” like parish priests, by any means, but golddecked nuncios, red-capped cardinals, and purple-robed archbishops, men who are in constant touch with, and do the explicit bidding of the pope of Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was therefore sensational liberation news to read a two-column article appearing in the Columbus </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Citizen</span><span class="font6"> of September 9, 1944, In part, it reads: French to Request Cardinal to Resign</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Government Contends High Church Official Sided with Nazis in Paris</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Paris,</span><span class="font4"> Sept. 9.—While shots rang out in Notre Dame as Gen. De Gaulle and other French generals gathered to attend Paris’ first liberation ceremony, another drama was progressing in the sacristy of the great cathedral which may bring an upset in the hierarchy of the Catholic Church in France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was at that moment that Msgr. Beaussart, archbishop of Notre Dame, learned that when relations arc formally established between the new French government and the Vatican, the papal nuncio will be asked to request his resignation and that of Emmanuel Celestin Cardinal Suhard, archbishop of Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your correspondent is able to reveal this historic incident on the authority of Father Bruckberger, a Dominican priest of the French Forces of the Interior, who conducted services at Notre Dame on Saturday, Aug. 26, when Vichy militiamen attempted to assassinate Gen. De Gaulle and his colleagues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Father Bruckberger points out that the French church is divided between those who accepted the Vichy regime and collaboration with the Germans, and those who refused to have anything to do with the Germans officially. He describes both the cardinal’s and the archbishop’s activities during the German occupation as far exceeding their duties as leaders of the Catholic hierarchy in France. Official German services, he says, were held in Notre Dame with the archbishop officiating, with German priests participating, and with special pews reserved for the German high command. On more than one occasion, he says—and others confirm this—the church was closed to all but Germans. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This record of events, as set forth by Father Bruckberger, is a necessary background for the situation which will arise when the Vatican is requested to ask for the resignations of Cardinal Suhard and Msgr. Beaussart. Bruckberger emphasizes that the rift in the church is a matter of personalities. He, as a priest, believed it impossible to serve both his God and the Germans. To him, as</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">to many others, Vichy was synonymous with Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There you have it, a cardinal and an archbishop of the Roman Catholic Church “far exceeding their duties”, i.e., going out of their way to give comfort and succor to the German high command, who were directly responsible for the sorrow<sup>7</sup> and suffering inflicted by the Nazi army of occupation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Following closely on the heels of the •above news dispatch appeared this one in the Columbus </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Citizen</span><span class="font6"> (September 23, 1944):</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Catholic Church issue in France took a new angle Sunday when Cardinal Suhard of Paris stood beside Archbishop Francis J. Spellman of New York at a mass held for American troops at the Cathedral of Notre Dame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As reported, the French provisional government intends to make a formal request to the Vatican for the resignation of Cardinal Suhard and Msgr. Beaussart, auxiliary bishop of Paris, owing to their activities during German occupation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On Aug. 25, when Gens. De Gaulle, Jaeques-Philippe Leeler, Alphonse Juin and Joseph-Pierre Koenig attended a sbeeial Te Deum service at the cathedral, the Paris Resistance government prevented the cardinal from attending by throwing a police cordon around his residence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Both prelates are accused by French Catholics of going out of their way and exceeding their episcopal duties in their reception of the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the following Sunday, the cardinal held a special service in Notre Dame for American troops. The service was arranged between the cardinal and a U. S. Army chaplain who did not consult French authorities. This created an unfortunate impression among Resistance people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Last Saturday, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Combat,</span><span class="font4"> a Resistance newspaper, carried a strong editorial on the subject of the church. In the first paragraph the editor wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Although many prelates, like Msgr. Saliege of Toulouse, upheld the honor of their faith and of their country, a minority of dignitaries displayed, during the occupation, an attitude against the interests of the nation. In Paris, Cardinal Suhard was one of these.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The French recall that until Sunday, when he accompanied Archbishop Spellman to Notre Dame, the cardinal’s last big public appearance was at the funeral of Philippe Henriot, assassinated Vichyite minister of information. On that occasion he eulogized Henriot, who had called on the French to resist the Allies and to help the Germans. They find it unfitting that the same churchman should receive the Americans and an American archbishop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Free French found it “unfitting”, but the American archbishop, Spellman, didn’t. Rather suspicious, isn’t it, why an American archbishop who is the chief chaplain of the army and navy should be so chummy with an outright collaborationist, one whose last big public appearance was for the purpose of eulogizing Philippe Henriot? And wdio w'as Henriot? The Vancouver </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Province</span><span class="font6"> (June 30, 1944) tells us that he was the “Vichy minister of information, of the known and avowed Fascist extremists, the righthand man of Joseph Darnand, the ‘’Himmler of France’. He helped to send a million Frenchmen to work as Hitler’s slaves in Germany. He had contributed to the death of innumerable French patriots of the underground and had had complicity in the murder by the Gestapo of many innocent hostages”. This was the man whose hands were stained with innocent French blood, the man whom a cardinal and prince of the Catholic Hierarchy publicly praised and extolled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is not as easy as one might think to get rid of collaborationists who wear hideously long black skirts that cover up their true identity. And the French government found it out. Three months after the resignation of Cardinal Suhard was requested this distinguished gentleman was still in Paris. How does it come? A line in the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> (December 10, 1944) gives the answer: “Since the liberation of France there has been a quiet rapprochement between the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">episcopate and the Resistance movemerits.” No longer do we see this celebrated cardinal as a seditious collaborationist giving succor to the Nazi high command. No, he has changed his makeup and plays the role of a French patriot. Tie speaks out in favor of French ’Reforms, presumably the reforms urged ay the Resistance movement, in the v New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> (December 3, 1944) the report on this was published. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sub>r</sub> Emmanuel Celestin Cardinal Suhard, arch-</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font4"> bishop of Paris, spoke today in favor of those social changes that the French call “reforms of structure” and that have been urged by the Resistance movement and by the Catholic Democrats, who are strongly represented in the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Without specifying the character of reforms he advocated, the cardinal, writing in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Semaine Religieix.se,</span><span class="font4"> asked: “How could the church not view favorably what tends toward the disappearance of the proletariat? And since it appears that the proletariat is the direct product of the Liberal capitalist system, why may not the church desire that reforms of structure be applied to that system?” . . , ■ The cardinal said the church would encourage movements like the Catholic Action and Catholic Trade Unions and the employers’ associations in seeking a solution of this social problem “for the good of France, for the union of her sons and for the good of souls”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The cardinal couches his proposals in shady language, but still it is plain that he is in favor of tearing down the Liberal capitalistic system. He is heartily in favor of (French) Fascism. And furthermore, Suhard said, “the church would encourage movements like the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Action</span><span class="font6"> and Catholic Trade Unions” to do the job. We in America know what that means, for here we have seen these groups in action for the accomplishment of Jesuit Catholic aims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Suhard showed that this was more than a friendly gesture on his part and that he really meant business. He was willing to play ball with the new government, and he had his own ball team, a “new Catholic political group, called the Popular<sup>1</sup> Republican movement”. The article above mentioned from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font6">of December 3 continues:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At a meeting last Monday of the now Catholic political group, called the Popular Republican movement, a manifesto was adopted that spoke still more specifically of the kind of reforms these Catholic leaders desired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This movement “affirmed its revolutionary purpose”. It specified that the revolution it desired presupposed “transformations in the* structure of the state” and a “planned economy directed by a state freed from powers of money”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It presupposed, also, according to the manifesto, “the nationalization of key industries, of private monopolies and of credit” and the participation of trade unions in the direction of the nation’s economy and of industrial undertakings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This program, following on the lines of the program adopted last March by the National Council of Resistance in which the whole' range of parties from Catholics and Conservatives to Communists were represented, reflected the thought of those Catholics who arc most conspicuous now in the politics of France and who find much common ground between themselves and the Socialists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Gen. Charles de Gaulle, who is an ardent Catholic, said at Lille Oct. 1 that it was no longer possible “to permit those concentrations of interest called trusts” and that the state must take over the direction of the “great sources of common wealth”. This his government has done in taking steps toward the nationalization of mines producing two-thirds of the coal of France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is such a program and such measures as these that the phrase, “reforms of structure,” denotes in France today, and the cardinal doubtless used the phrase with full consciousness of the implication it bore for his readers. The cardinal long has been regarded as highly conservative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now, after tracing the snakelike maneuvers of these cunning ecclesiastics through the last six months of entangled French diplomatic underbrush, where</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">do we find the Catholic church in France at the end of 1944? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Business as Usual</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If you are a manufacturer and your salesman is in a fight with the customer because the customer doesn’t like your merchandise, all you have to do is to send around another salesman. At least this is the business policy of the Vatican, as we read in a recent IJ.P. dispatch:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Borne, Dec. 6 (U.P.)-—The Vatican has reached an agreement with the French Provisional Government by which Mgr, Valerio Valeri, papal nuncio in Paris, and several French bishops accused of collaboration with the Germans will retire and normal French-Vatican diplomatic relations will be reestablished, it was said authoritatively today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The French Government had demanded the recall of Mgr. Valeri on the ground that he was unacceptable because of his previous accreditation to the Vichy regime. The removal of certain bishops had also been demanded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Informants said that the Vatican had refused to accede to the French demand. However, they added, after long negotiation by Mgr. Pierre Theas with French officials, an agreement had been reached by which the prelates involved would voluntarily retire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mgr. Valeri will return here because “his mission has ended”, it was said, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">bishops will give up their dioceses. This will mean a diplomatic change by the Vatican from relations with Vichy to relations with the new French Government. The Vatican, it was said, will preserve its neutral position and the final result, it was hoped, will be entirely friendly relations between the Vatican and France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Gen. Chari es de G aulle had especially objected to Mgr. Valeri on the ground that he had been a friend of Marshal Henri-Phiiippe Petain, it was understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So you see everything is fixed up. The Vatican will continue to peddle its goods, wares and merchandise as it formerly did under German occupation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To the Frenchman in the street this seems like a complete somersault on the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">part of the Vatican, from Petain to De Gaulle in one flip. The fact is that such diplomatic intrigue is all in the day’s work at the “holy” city. The Papacy is the oldest, most crafty, tricky, sly, and slippery (or should we say slimy?) political organization in the world. She has for generations carried on her ' nefarious and illicit relations with the kings and potentates of the world. As a harlot has many paramours, who are among themselves deadly enemies, so likewise has this apostate and adulterous system whose headquarters are in Rome. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But what about these men recalled “unofficially” by the Vatican? What about the papal nuncio Valeri? Wilt he be reproved and disciplined for his collaboration with the Nazis and their puppet Petain? Traitors are usually court-martialed and decapitated in a hurry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the third anniversary of Pearl Harbor, December 7, when there was a burning desire for the punishment of traitorous criminals, Americans were shocked to read in the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times </span><span class="font6">of that date, in an article dealing with the recall of Valeri, the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Monsignor Valeri is expected to receive a much higher rank in papal diplomacy and has been mentioned as the next secretary of state. Cardinal Suhard, it is believed, will remain in Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Even those with a little sense of justice wonder why men like Henri Chamberlin, alias Lafont, Pierre Bony, and Paul Clavie, members of the French Gestapo, are brought before Paris courts of justice to answer for their heinous crimes while a dignitary guilty of atrocities against the French republic is given “a much higher rank in papal diplomacy”. And when we say the prelates of Rome are guilty of the worst atrocities we mean it. The hirelings of the French republic were guilty of embezzlement, theft, torture, rape, and murder, all of which deserve the full penalty and punishment of the law with-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">out mercy. These underlings were, comparatively speaking, only paupers in the practice of crime, for they were perpetrated against individuals. But what were the crimes of the Catholic HieT-' archy that eclipse such glaring atrocities <sub>r</sub> as those just mentioned? In addition to \those already mentioned there are a few more listed in the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> of <sup>v</sup> December 10, 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One churchman, Albert Dutoit, bishop of Arras, was arrested on a charge that, during </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font4"> the German occupation, he published in a ..church bulletin articles against the Allies and the Resistance forces. Another, Francois Au-vity, bishop of Mende, apologized in a public pastoral letter for having , advised French youths that it was a patriotic duty to accept forced labor in Germany. A third, Emmanuel Celestin Cardinal Su hard, archbishop of Paris, has defended himself in a pastoral letter and in the press against charges that he had supported the Vichy regime and-had acted as an intermediary when Pierre Laval returned to office two years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These charges sound mild and soft, but when we consider the far-reaching results of such </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">official</span><span class="font6"> fifth-column work it is apparent that not a few individuals were their victims, but rather we see that whole communities, yes, the whole nation had been beaten and tortured, raped and murdered, by reason of these gentlemen of the Gold and Red and Purple, who know only too well the art of refined crime in its highest form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Truly France has suffered untold miseries.-Nor is she yet delivered from the furnace of affliction. She’ has, of course, had the external German military heel removed from her neck. And relief, though limited, is reaching her in the way of food and clothing. Her monetary system is being repaired slowly, and her railroads are being reconditioned. But internally France is far from being restored to a nation of free . and happy people. The tenacious tenta- ' cles of the Papal system seem to encircle her tighter than ever. There are, however, forces within her veins that will continue to fight off this virulent disease. And it is hoped that some day the people of France ■will be for ever liberated.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In January, 1500, Vincente Yanez Pinzon, who had commanded the Nina on the first voyage of Columbus, saw land in the neighborhood of Cape St. Roque. Bound westward, he bore away to the west and north, following the prevailing winds and currents as far as the Orange Cape, the present extreme northern limit of Brazil. He was, therefore, the discoverer of the great estuary which forms the mouth of the Amazon. He named it the “Fresh-Water Sea”, because the great river freshens the open ocean far out of the sight of land, but he did not ascend, nor even see, the river proper. It is also claimed on good evidence that, six months before Pinzon, another Spanish navigator, Alonzon de Ojeda, accompanied by Amerigo Vespucci, had made the South American coast not far from Cape St. Roque; and that a month later still another, Diego de Lepe, did the same. None of these Spanish voyages produced any results. They were not reported until after the news of Cabral’s discovery had been solemnly promulgated to the courts of Europe, and were soon forgotten. The honor of making Brazil known to Europe belongs to Cabral just as certainly as that of discovering America does to Columbus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And so I put the facts before you, and if some day you should go to Brazil, please do not forget them.—John J. Vieira, Jr., California.</span></p><img src="g_E_19450131_files/g_E_19450131-2.png" alt="" style="width:196pt;height:75pt;">
<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Why the Righteous Suffer</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font6">T HAS pleased Almighty God to prepare the members of the kingdom of heaven under adverse conditions. The righteous sons of God have never been popular with this world. During the entire “Christian era”, so called, they have suffered much persecution. They have been counted as the offscouring among men. From what source could we reasonably expect persecution and adversity to come upon true Christians? From the Devil and his organization, of course. Why? Because God declared in Bden that there must be enmity between the seed of His “woman”, which seed is His Kingdom class, and the seed of the Serpent, which seed is the Devil’s organization. (Genesis 3:15) We are not left in doubt as to who constitutes the seed or children of the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Jesus Christ was on earth those who persecuted Him were religious scribes, Pharisees and priests, together composing the clergy of that day and claiming to be representatives of Jehovah God. They were hypocrites. Jesus said they were. That class exalted themselves, even as religious clergymen do today. They posed as men of great righteousness. To them Jesus said: “But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.” (Matthew 23:13,14) These same hypocrites claimed to be the sons of God; but Jesus plainly said to them: “Ye are of your father the devil.”—John 8:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is a period in world history known as the time of “The Inquisition”. In that period of time the ecclesiastical courts were organized in certain countries, and men were haled before these tribunals and charged with the crime of “heresy”. They were put through a mock trial and subjected to all manner of wicked torture to compel them to confess a senseless creed. Who was responsible for this cruel treatment of Christians? The clergy, who claimed to be the representatives of God and of Christ, but who in truth and in fact represented the Devil. They were hypocrites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But persecuting was not confined to the Roman Papal system. In due course the Protestants resorted to like persecution. Call to mind the “reformer” John Calvin, the father of the Presbyterians. He signed the death warrant of Michael ' Servetus and had him slowly roasted to death at the stake because he did not agree with the so-called “orthodox” doctrines of that religious system, such as “the trinity”. All the wicked persecution that has been inflicted upon Christ Jesus and His followers has been done by the clergy or at the instigation of the clergy, who hypocritically claim to represent the God of love and also His beloved Son Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Serpent, the Devil, the father of these religious systems, was the real inducing cause for such persecution. Those ecclesiastical systems, particularly the clergy and the principal ones of their flocks, are and ever have been a part of the world which is under the control of Satan the enemy. These have taught conflicting doctrines and have fought among themselves, until someone would come forward with the truth of God’s Word. Then they combine under the direction of their father the Devil to fight against such one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Persecution and sufferings are not to be desired by anyone. Everyone would rather dwell in peace and in happiness. Jesus and His true followers have been s-,persecuted because of their loyalty and 'J faithfulness -to God. This being true, and God being all powerful and being the very expression of love, why would He permit His beloved Son and His •• ~ faithful followers to suffer persecution ’ at the hands of the Devil and his seed * or representatives?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The answer is that God has not interfered with Satan’s pursuit of his course ' of willful wickedness. He has permitted . him to demonstrate his malignant disposition, and to reproach God and reproach everyone who has been faithful to God. Why? Because these persecutions would furnish the opportunities for the Lord Jesus and His faithful followers to prove their loyalty and faithfulness to ■ Jehovah and to prove the same under ■ the most adverse circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Concerning Jesus it is written: “Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to-save him from death, and was heard in that he feared; though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.” —Hebrews 5: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If a man prefers bodily ease and comfort and peace rather than the approval of God, then he will put himself in a condition to not be persecuted; and this he may do by proving disloyal and unfaithful to God. But he who would willingly suffer the most ignominious death in order to maintain his loyalty and faithfulness to God can be forever . trusted. Concerning Jesus it is written in that regard: “Being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things, in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”—Philippians 2:8-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus did the Foundation Stone, the Chief Corner Stone of God’s kingdom, become a tried and proved stone, as stated at Isaiah 28:16. Before God granted to the.Lord Jesus the exalted reward of being the Head of the Kingdom, He put Him to the most crucial test. Those who will be approved of God and become a part of the Kingdom must follow in the footsteps of Jesus, which includes their suffering for doing right. “For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.”—1 Peter 2: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why do genuine Christians suffer? Because God has chosen them out of the world and because they refuse to show allegiance to the Devil’s organization. On this Jesus said to His followers: “If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.” —John 15:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Like his Master and Exemplar, the Christian can bear persecutions for righteousness’ sake without developing a feeling of bitterness against his persecutors. He realizes that God permits it even as He permitted such upon the Lord Jesus, that the loyalty and faithfulness of the Christian may be tested. He relies upon the promises of Jehovah God and rejoices in the Lord and in His kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">♦ Last Saturday my son, who is ten years of age, walked into the office of one of the lumber companies here in Orland and presented the late </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font6"> “Thank you just the same, sonny,” said the man, “but 1 read those over at the hotel where T stay.” Well, there are only two hotels here, and one is the Royal Hotel, where, by permission, 1 place </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font6">every week.

<div>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">M</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">erle Leon Mills and Earl Robbins, trying to make a living in the evangelist business, were advertised for their meetings in Toledo as &quot;not in any way connected with Jehovah’s witnesses”. tThis is good news. Jehovah’s witnesses ^wouhLbe ashamed to be connected with </span><span class="font6"><sup>J</sup> any business that has brought such great dishonor to Jehovah’s name as the evan-- gelist racket. Mills and Robbins not only </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">4</span><span class="font6"> are represented in their advertising - matter as not identified with those living to honor Jehovah’s name but go out of their way to appeal to the ignorant, the biased and the religious with the silly statement that (no matter how conscientious others may be in obeying Deuteronomy 5:8,9) &quot;we are glad to be Americans and have the privilege of saluting our nation’s flag”. Does anybody remember where Jesus said He was glad to be a Roman and to salute the flag of the Roman empire? Or where Paul said it? Or Peter? Why all the modern craze to swing the arm? Who benefits by it? But in this case there is hope for a bigger collection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Are Mills and Robbins any better Americans for the arm-swinging? Their rightful place is in Milford, Ohio, down near Cincinnati. In that supposedly American town two boys were refused an education because they had reverence for the commandment of Almighty God above cited. Then, and for the same reason, the father of the boys was fired from his job. Then one of the boys tried to pay for an education by selling chickens; and the people, influenced by some traveling religious ignoramuses perhaps, refused to buy the chickens. So, if Mills and Robbins find it hard to make a living in Toledo by lying about Almighty God, here is a suggestion that they go into the chicken business in Milford, where all patriotic chickens must salute the flag or off come their heads.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">More and Similar Hypocrisy</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another reason for Mills and Robbins to head for the vicinity of Cincinnati is That R. J. Markham, of Hartwell, another suburb, advertises, among other things, “I believe that in God there are three divine persons.” This is in flat contradiction of the Holy Scriptures, &quot;There is but one God” (I Corinthians 8:6), &quot;No man hath seen God at any time” (John 1:18; 1 Timothy 6:16), and every other statement on the subject. Mr. Markham goes on, &quot;I believe that God the Son became man, without ceasing to be God,” There isn’t a syllable in the Bible to substantiate such an unreasonable statement. If it were true, what sense could anybody make of Jesus’ cry, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” (Matthew 27:46) Does Mr. Markham and do the Mills and Robbins firm think that Jesus was merely putting on a show? Do they honestly believe that the very first requirement of Christianity is that the would-be follower, the prospective fellow witness of the True and Faithful Witness (Revelation 1:5), is that he must believe “that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures”. —1 Corinthians 15: j.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It wouldn’t do for Mills and Robbins to take on jobs as guards at the Cleveland State Hospital, at the other end of the state. The Cleveland </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Press</span><span class="font6"> says that at that home (for people who have gone insane over the stuff that evangelists have tried to scream into them) &quot;in the last six months at least a dozen attendants have either personally beaten patients or encouraged others to do so”. So, one who aims to get through life by excessive arm-swinging should keep away from care of the insane. He might get written up if he tried to make a working combination of his eternal torture theories and his belief that one of the most important things on the earth is to swing the arms.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Industrious, Liberty-loving~Belgium</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font6">HE politicians learn something every few hundred years. Thus they noticed that a certain strip of land to the northeast of France is a favorite route of militarists bent on making millions of widows and orphans ; so the people living there had the hard luck of being made into a nation. Then they had their neutrality and inviolability guaranteed by Austria, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Prussia, and Russia, and the result is the same as it was before. See any history of 1870, 1914, or 1940. The Belgians themselves are a peaceful, peace-loving people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Belgium is the most densely populated country in Europe, with a population of 710 to the square mile. On its 11,775 square miles it has an industrious population of 8,386,553. By way of comparison, the four garden states of Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey and Maryland, in their 24,636 square miles, have 8,403,997 inhabitants. The Flemish, akin to the Netherlanders in language, live in the provinces of the north and east, along the border of the Netherlands; the Walloons, akin to the French, live in the provinces of the south and west, along the French border.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nearly all Belgians arc Roman Catholics. At first the “Church” insisted on running everything of an educational nature; then there was a revolt, and secular schools were the order of the day; but the loudmouthed and constant opposition of the bishops gradually ■wore the people out, and now all education is back where it ought never to have been, in the hands of those who hate it and fear it as they hate and fear nothing else. Some liberties have been retained: all religious marriages have to be preceded by civil marriages, and a portion of the salaries of ministers of all the sects operating in Belgium are defrayed by the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Agriculture the Basic Industry</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Belgium has plenty of light apd heavy industry; there are 500 square miles of coal fields, and the output of iron and steel runs to something like 12,000,000 tons a year; but agriculture is the basic industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But for the periodic raids of the Bismarcks, Hohenzollerns and Schickel-grubers, Belgium would be considered the model farm land of Europe, because it js so level and so fertile, and because the farmers know how to care for their crops. The fields are square and have their highest part in the center. The farm implement on which the greatest dependence is placed is the earliest and simplest of all, the spade. By an ingenious system of handling the earth, the result of the creating and removal of five crops is that the fields in the meantime have been dug to a depth of 18 inches and at the end of the period are in the same relative condition as when the five-year period of rotative digging and planting was started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Scientific Conservation of Manures</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Belgian cattle, instead of being grazed in fields, are fed in the barns on a succession of foods grown for the purpose. Every farmstead has a tank into which all the liquids of the cattle sheds are conveyed. This liquid manure promotes the growth of flax, one of the most valuable of all the Belgian crops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A private company has leased for 75 years the 6,422 miles of Belgian railways, and expects to electrify them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are 1,040 miles of navigable rivers and canals; so that means. for getting movable crops to market is ample.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tt is a surprise to learn that in this most thickly settled country in Europe there arg. extensive tracts of natural forest still sheltering wolves and wild boars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">I</span><span class="font6">T IS encouraging to know that there are some members of the human family who do not believe in clubbing the insane, and that they get better results without any clubs than do those who use 'i-them. In a little booklet entitled “They Risked for a Hard Job; CO’s at Work <sub>v</sub> in Meatal Hospitals”, published by the Plowshare Press, Room 414, 2 Stone street, New York 4, N. Y., Frank Olm-' ” stead says, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">* One objector assigned to the violent ward 'refused to take the broomstick offered by the Charge. When he entered the ward the patients crowded around asking, <sup>If</sup>Where is your broomstick?” He said he thought he would not need it. “But suppose some of us gang up on you?” The CO guessed they wouldn’t do that, and started talking about other things. Within two or three days the patients were seen gathered around the unarmed attendant, telling him their troubles. He felt much safer than the Charge who had only his broomstick for company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Francis was one of the three hundred patients in the big day-room. He would go into tantrums if he couldn’t get his own way, throw himself on the floor wailing and screaming, and would scratch and bite anyone who attempted to move or otherwise control him. There were great sores on his temples from his violent contacts with the cement floor. Sometimes another patient would inadvertently get in his w<sup>r</sup>ay and Francis would bite his car. This was no gentle bite. One patient had a piece of ear an inch long hanging down as a result of such an encounter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I tried earnestly but unsuccessfully to reach Francis. One of my hands still carries a scar from his scratching and he almost had my hand in his mouth more than once, grabbing it to try to bite it. No one on that shift was able to make any headway with him. Then came another shift that brought a CO who greeted Francis with a cheery word and an arm thrown around his shoulder. There were no tantrums all morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the short time at my disposal I tried pacifist techniques on a few patients. One was a prize fighter, whose friendship I soon won. He attached himself firmly to me, threatening to “clean up” anyone who offered to do me harm. There was not another 'fight in that ward for the rest of the day, for this was the man who caused most of the trouble. Every time he wanted to fight he was right at my elbow where I could talk him out of it.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Why Should the Church Wish to Be a Political State?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">(By a Catholic)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font6">HE National Council of Catholic Men is now substituting lay speakers on its “Catholic Hour”, instead of that eloquent Fascist, Fulton J. Sheen, and others of the clergy. A Mr. C. Manion, who is a very able speaker, now has the “mike”, and he gives fine talks on the Constitution, Bill of Rights, and all the good things we Americans enjoy, including free speech and religious liberty. From the way he talks it seems that declaration of independence and our “Sacred document” were copied from the Roman Catholic Church. That certainly is enough to make a horse laugh, when we Catholics, that is, those of us who think, know that, long before Mussolini or Hitler were ever thought of, fascism was the method of the Roman Catholic Church, and it has been ruled by a super-dictator ever since it took the administrative portion of the church away from the people who comprise and support the body, or the church, to be more specific, and became a political institution whose greatest ambition is to rule over all nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mr. Manion now uses the words “atheists” and “pagans”, who seek to * drive God out and replace Him with their social system to create a better world. You will notice the old Roman Catholic bogey “Bolshevik” and “Communists” has been used until it has no longer any terror in it; so they now substitute “atheists” and “pagans”. Maybe that is because the pope had one of the leading Italian Communists in audience recently and probably has found that Communists don’t have horns or a tp.il, that they are like democrats, republicans, or any other brand of political thought, and that they also believe in God in a practical way rather than with the - fumbling of beads, thumping the breast, sprinkling holy water all over themselves, and other outward signs which have nothing to do with God or ' the salvation of the soul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mr. Manion seems to be a very honest speaker and believes all he says. If he does, then that portion of the Constitution that no form of union of religious church and state is permitted is absolutely forbidden. If he (and all the clergy also) believes that portion is good enough for the United States, why should there be a Roman Catholic political church in Spain or any other country, or any form of state church, regardless of its denomination?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why should the Roman Catholic Church be a political state? Is it more glorified with God and Jesus Christ as political figures under the leadership of a dictator who assumes to be vicar of Christ? For any man who was elected by a “packed court” in true Fascist political fashion to assume that he is the vicar of Christ is blasphemy. He might just as well finish the job and say he is Christ. As a matter of fact, more homage is paid to this man, as well as his predecessors, than would be paid'to Christ if He were on earth. He would not expect it, nor would He have it. Well, the emperor of Japan is also a mystical figure, the direct “Son” of the Sun goddess, and there are those who believe that one, too 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What is Mr. Manion’s idea? Boes he want to sell us to the idea of accepting the Roman Catholic State to the further aggrandizement of its political ambition as a superstate? When we look at this political state and its record of the past and the way it lined up on the side of Fascism and Nazism and both these popes did everything they could to destroy the great ally, the Soviet Union, that should be enough for any person with an ounce of reason to have nothing to do with it.</span></p>

Then there were the ^Christian Fronters’ and others of the same stripe, all using the old boloney of “Americanism&quot;, putting up a good . ... argument, and they too turned out to <sub>;</sub> be pro-Nazi and pro-Fascist. Then came those K. of C. Hibernians and dther groups of the “Roman Catholic Action” persuasion who were lauding the “Savior” Franco, Edward Lodge Curran, Michael J. Ahern, and others too numerous to mention, all enemies of the Spanish Loyalists and the Soviet Union. The sin they had committed was that they removed the Catholic and Orthodox church from politics the same as it is in this country and as it should be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Restoration of the church and its corrupt Hierarchy to political power was the main reason for Ratti’s blessing of Butcher Franco and dubbing him “Savior” after he let Hitler and Mussolini try out the “blitz” on the “Spanish dogs”. And, of course, “Mussy” sent in his bill “for services rendered”. How much Ratti paid toward that bill nobody knows, but some money paid out by American Catholic suckers went toward it. The pope, like all the other “high” cockalorums, never has to make an accounting of expenditures.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The pope is only concerned in the Kingdom of G-od.” So we are given to understand. Well, why make it a political kingdom? Isn’t the political system corrupt enough without extending it to heaven? Next thing they’ll try to extend it to hell; and when that happens old Lucifer will throw up his hands in disgust! But the Vatican state seeks to be the super state over all nations, even heaven. Why not hand the whole business over to it and let it go at that?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What is needed is a “bolshevik” purge of the Roman Catholic church in Spain like the one in Russia. Can anyone say that would lessen the faith in Qod of the Spanish people any more than the purge of the Orthodox church did the Russians? Until the Roman Catholic church is purged of its political corruption it wall continue to be held in contempt by all thinking people regardless of its claimed charities.—J. R., Rhode Island.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The Statue Turned Black—Maybe</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">O</span><span class="font6">NE of the New<sup>r</sup>s Weekly publications, date of May 7, 1944, contains a story entitled “Poisoned—but a Statue Saved Him”. The story embraces a picture of a man kneeling at the feet of a statue the upper part of w’hich is ■white and the lower part jet black and underneath it these words, “When the Poisoned Man Kissed the Feet of the Snow-white Statue of the Savior He Was Miraculously Saved from Death as the Statue Gradually Became as Black as Coal.” The miracle is supposed to have happened near Mexico city in 1649. A man is supposed to have tried to poison his rival, but with the unexpected result advertised. It shows the straits in which the Devil and his crow’d are confined when they have to resort to such manifest swindles as this to keep the common people w’orshiping them instead of Almighty God, and causing them to trust in idolatry instead of in God’s Word. The claim is made that many Mexicans still bow to this image and kiss its feet, as they wmuld kiss the feet of the pope if they had the chance; and as they would be wrongly and unscripturally and blasphemously invited and encouraged to do.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Archbishop Spellman and the Pope</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">A</span><span class="font6"> WASHINGTON dispatch published in the St. Louis </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">PostDispatch</span><span class="font6"> mentions a letter dated July 21, 1941, addressed to William Dudley Pelley, in which Eugene N. Sanctuary, of New York, a retired army colonel, made the following statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The deal which you referred to about the delivery of the 1936 Catholic vote was made on a Pullman when Roosevelt, Farley, Mundelein, Gallagher, Paeelli (now Pope) and a congressman were present. I am sworn to secrecy about the name of the member of the House.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Archbishop Spellman was not in the Pullman at the time the deal was made. He was in Rome or the Vatican. Since he got the job of traveling all over creation at Uncle Sam’s expense he has often been at Vatican City, though there was no real need of his going there, for he was in daily communication with the pope by long-distance telephone before he became, in the words of that gentleman, “Military Vicar for all those serving in the armed forces of the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The. Roman Catholic Hierarchy has stepped things up considerably when, constituting, as they do, but 15 percent of the population, one man can be “Military Vicar” for the whole country, and get his title, not from America, but from Vatican City. But Paeelli is, no doubt, impressed by the many conversations he has had with Mr. Spellman, and the reports Spellman has given him of his conversations with those named above (some of them—Mundelein is dead) and with King George of England, Winston Churchill, Generals Clark and Alexander, and others of power and influence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Borrowing Trouble About the Pope</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After one of his earliest trips to see the pope Mr. Spellman said that death to the pope in his agony of suffering would be a mercy, but a few months later the American newspapermen saw the pope at the Vatican and made the remark that he looked surprisingly well. On July 23, 1944, so says a dispatch from Rome,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The archbishop entered the pontiff’s personal apartment at 5 p.m. and emerged at 8:30 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is a long interview to impose on a man that the archbishop has described in such lurid phraseology as “literally dying for peace”. Moreover, since Spellman is on Uncle Sam’s pay roll and traveling at his expense, he should spend his time with the soldiers (which he has done, too) and not spend so much time at the Vatican.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Reynolds Packard, writing about the above interview, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Vatican City, July 24—(UP) Pope Pius discussed with Archbishop Francis J. Spellman of New York yesterday a program which the pontiff hopes might bring the war in Europe to an end soon, it was learned today. The pontiff yesterday granted Spellman his second private audience since his arrival from New York last week. It took place in the pontiff’s apartment from 4:45 to 8 p.m.— one of the longest private audiences ever granted by the pope.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>John Chrysostom—Golden-mouthed and Golden-hearted</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">/YflfITE probably John’s mother, An-'Qf thusa, gave him to Jehovah before he was born, as Hannah did in the case of Samuel the prophet, and as every’ mother should do before the birth of every child with which she is blessed. John may have been the younger of her two children. Left a widow in her twentieth year, she so remained. But she had become the mother of the man that even the (Boman) </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia </span><span class="font6">states “is generally considered the most prominent doctor of the Greek church and the greatest preacher ever heard in a Christian pulpit”. He was first called Chrysostom (kris-os'tum) 143 years after his death. He lived A.D. 347-407, and was born at Antioch, Syria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Chrysostom has left behind him an unblemished reputation as a sound, moderate and practical servant of God, with which his gift of “extraordinarily rich, fervid and persuasive eloquence” is always associated. His father was a military man. His mother sent him to the best school of which she knew, that of the distinguished Libanius, the famous rhetorician of his day. While at this school Chrysostom made his consecration to the Lord, and was baptized at the age of 23. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Americana</span><span class="font6"> explains that, “in accordance with general usage of that time, he did. not receive baptism till he had attained maturity&quot;. Sprinkling is not baptism, and, anyway, nothing in the Scriptures justifies either the sprinkling or the baptism of anybody except on his own initiative, as an outward profession of the fact that he has made a covenant to do God’s will faithfully until the end of his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After his mother’s death, which occurred early, Chrysostom devoted six solid years to the study of the Bible, and had a good knowledge of the truth that it contained, and it is the fruit of these studies that went into his famous sermons. Of his own desire he remained an assistant </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(didkonos</span><span class="font6"> in G<sub>t</sub>reek) until he was about 35, and it was not until he was about 40 that he entered upon the preaching work that made him famous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Aot </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">After Promotion</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia</span><span class="font6"> is very fair and very generous in its admission that:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The usual preaching of Chrysostom consisted in consecutive explanations of Holy Scripture. To that custom, unhappily no longer in use, we owe his famous and magnificent commentaries, which offer us such an inexhaustible treasure of dogmatic, moral and historic knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Also, the shy admissions are made that “he seems to ignore private confession to a priest&quot; and “there is no clear and direct passage in favor of the primacy of the pope”. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An examination of the 600 written sermons which Chrysostom left behind him shows that he was an honest and earnest and intelligent student of God’s Word. Sixty-seven of the sermons are on Genesis, fifty-nine on the Psalms, ninety on Matthew’s Gospel, eighty-eight on John’s Gospel, fifty-five on Acts, thirty-four on Hebrews, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">- The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia</span><span class="font6"> makes this further statement regarding him:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[He was given the title of Chrysostom because of] his great natural facility of speech, which was extraordinary even to Greeks, [and] the abundance of his thoughts as well as the popular way of presenting and illustrating them, and, last but not least, the wholehearted earnestness and conviction with which he delivered the message which he felt had been given to him. Speculative explanations did not attract his mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Early in life Chrysostom could have been an overseer </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(episkopos</span><span class="font6"> in Greek), but McClintock and Strong’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Cyclopaedia </span><span class="font6">explains that when he was about to be constrained into that service at Antioch “he evaded the election by a sort of pious ruse and thrust it upon his friend Basilius”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However, he could not hide his light under a bushel, and manifestly the Lord did not wish it hidden. His fame as a preacher spread from Antioch to Constantinople, then the center of the Roman political and religious world,' and Arcadius, the Roman emperor, sent word . to the Antioch prefect that he should send Chrysostom on to Constantinople. There he made him a chief overseer, despite the fact that there were many contestants for the job, and Chrysostom himself had neither sought, desired nor expected it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Be Tried to Do Bis Duty</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Chrysostom tried to do his duty at New Rome, as it was then called. He cut down the official household expenses to a minimum; he deposed overseers for simony and licentiousness; he set the vagrant monks to doing useful work; he made the clergy give up their more or less virgin housekeepers; he made the merry widows of dead priests watch their steps; and when he had been there three years and the empress herself deprived a poor widow of her vineyard Chrysostom took the widow’s part and then learned quite clearly that the Devil’s organization is the Devil’s organization, and that one cannot wash off coal tar with ordinary soap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is no use in going into the details of what followed. The gang got after</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">his scalp, and, as the emperor was endowed with a wishbone instead of a backbone, Chrysostom was speedily banished, On the day that the decree of his banishment w%s published the common people of New Rome, to whom, month t^y month, Chrysostom had given all his income to help the sick and the poor, set fire to Jhe cathedral and the senate <sup>v</sup> house, and were so determined about it ■ that the troops in the city were unable --to 'control them, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">x Chrysostom was banished to a rugged place in the eastern part of Armenia; but even though here the gang that had got him out of the way were afraid he might return, so they conspired to have him moved still farther, away out to the edge of the-Caucasus, on the extreme boundary of the empire. The account says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the two soldiers who had to lead him caused him all possible sufferings; He was forced to make long marches, was exposed to the rays of the sun, to the rains and the eold of the nights. His body, already weakened by several severe illnesses, finally broke down. On 14 Sept. [A. D. 407] the party were at Comana in Pontus. In the morning Chrysostom had asked to rest there on account of the state of his health. In vain; he was forced to continue his march. Very soon he felt so weak that he had to return to Comana. Some hours later he died. His last words were, “Glory be to God for all things/’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The 242 letters of Chrysostom which have been preserved, most of which were written while he was in exile, “all breathe a noble Christian spirit, not desiring to be recalled from exile, convinced that there is but one misfortune-departure from the path of piety and virtue.” And, when one comes to think of it, departure from the integrity toward God is' the worst misfortune. Who is there that would say today that Jesus was not the real victor over His enemies even in the moments when He was enduring His greatest shame and sufferings?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">DO YOU DESIRE GOD’S APPROVAL?.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">His Word states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Study to shew thyself approved unto God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But you may ask;</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Practical Illustrations of Bodies of Talks (Part One)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">HN MANY words there are also divers -I- vanities,’ is a proverb recorded in Ecclesiastes 5:7. To attempt to speak upon a subject without first having a knowledge of that subject will result in nothing but many words. The same results will also be obtained from failing to assemble effectively material gathered upon a given subject. Because of this failure one may have excellent material for a talk and still not be understood clearly by those listening. .In order to be effective, material for a talk must be assembled properly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After the speaker has finished his research and has his material gathered, arranging this mass of disorganized material into a logical order can be done by analyzing it and determining what points should be listed in the outline of the talk as main headings. The remaining, subordinate points should be listed under their respective main headings. After this is accomplished, any matter not contributing to the development of the central theme of the talk should be eliminated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The arrangement of the body from there depends primarily upon the kind of speech to be given. G-enerally, speeches are of four kinds. The kind seldom or never used by Jehovah’s witnesses is that to merely entertain; and therefore more consideration will be given to the other three types: to inform or instruct, to convince, and to stimulate to action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Each type of talk requires a different style of arrangement to be effective, and how quick the audience will grasp the speaker’s points and how long they will remember them is governed by this arrangement. If at all possible one must show a definite relationship between the main points. One can easily remember a group of words showing definite relationship, such as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">cherubim, seraphim, archangel</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">angel;</span><span class="font6"> but try to remember four words having no relationship or connection, such as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon, creature, righteousness</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">spirit.</span><span class="font6"> As with words, so with points of a talk, interrelationship makes for quick grasping and long retention in one’s mind. Speech, then, must be arranged so that points are related and hence readily understood and easily remembered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Besides relation of ideas, the audience should be considered, that is, whether the audience is at all familiar with the subject and whether the audience is favorable or antagonistic. Obviously one would not use the same arrangement in a talk to a prejudiced gathering as he would in addressing those of the same faith. From the subject itself, the type of audience, and the purpose of the speech considered, the best arrangement can be chosen. Examples of some of the more common are here given:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One method familiar to everyone and often used is the chronological, method, which means an arrangement according to the order of time. It is the relating of events in the order in which they take place. This arrangement should be used where the time element exists, as in recounting historical events or telling of a simple story or narrative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Stephen, defending himself before a hostile council, resorted to use of the chronological method in the body of his talk wherein he reminded his hearers of historical events. He desired to call into use previous history in order to show the reason for the hope that was in him and also to put the responsibility of those opposing him upon their own heads by showing the parallel course of events in time past. Accordingly, he began by recounting the promise made to Abraham and highlighted Abraham’s experiences and followed this with the story of the twelve sons of Jacob and their moving to Egypt, and then the exodus of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">the Israelites under Moses and God’s dealings with Moses, and finally he brought the chronology of events up to his time after tracing the history of Israel up through the times of Joshua, David and Solomon. (Acts 7:1-53) Had Stephen not observed this chronology 'vin his discourse the talk would have packed coherence. This listing of events in order of time led up to his final argu-‘ ment. This method is used many times in the Bible, and is especially adapted to ” talks that are to interest or instruct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Another way to arrange material is 'division into classes or natural groups. Many subjects naturally fall into this method of arrangement. The subject </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">worship</span><span class="font6"> would naturally fall into “true” and “false worship”, Christianity and religion. The subject </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">world</span><span class="font6"> might be discussed as to the world that was before the flood, the postdiluvian world in which we live, and the world to come. This way of dividing the material into groups or classes is also most generally used in the informative or instructive talk. It is helpful when one wishes to bring out sharp contrasts. The entire subject can be. seen at a glance and thereby be covered with ease by breaking it down into natural divisions and discussing one thoroughly and then proceeding to the next.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The arrangements of material just suggested and considered are comparatively simple. The hardest and the one most often needed by Jehovah’s Kingdom publishers is that of logic, a connecting of proof in a rational, predetermined way. Arranging material logically requires a knowledge of the process of argumentation, proving each point as one progresses step by step until the climax is reached. Each point must be made crystal-clear in the mind of the audience before proceeding to the next point. If the audience misses one step in the argument the speaker is the only one that will reach the climax; the audience will have fallen by the way. The same would be true if the speaker allowed himself to get sidetracked from his subject. To use this method one . should state each fact at a time and then back up each fact with substantial proof before going into the next, the reason being shown throughout for the conclusion that has been reached. This is the type of arrangement well fitted to talks intended to convince or stimulate to action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A splendid example of a discussion arranged according to logic is the 15th chapter of 1 Corinthians. Practically the whole chapter is one in which one point is stated and proved and then another premise is advanced which is based upon that preceding conclusion. Note how the argument advances with each point based on a previously proved statement. The whole chapter builds up to the climax at verse 55, where the effect of the whole argument is tersely put, “0 death, where is thy sting! 0 grave, where is thy victory!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One other method of arrangement is to list main headings according to importance. The theory is to start with the least important and build up to the climax, the interest of the audience heightening as one progresses with the argument. This principle should be followed in the vast majority of cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If one were called upon to explain to a group of persons of good-will about the stand of Jehovah’s witnesses regarding saluting a flag, one might form the body of his talk by going from least to most important points as follows: (1) No harm is done others by refusing to salute the flag; (2) no benefits are derived from trying to force people to take part in the formalism; (3) the highest court and laws of this land recognize the right of Jehovah’s witnesses to decline taking part in the ceremony; and (4) to take part would be a violation of the Christian’s agreement to serve Jehovah and would result in his everlasting death. However, in speaking on the same subject before a hostile group of religionists one would start by giving the strongest reason first, in this ease No. 4, and then would pile up more detailed proof by giving evidence in Nos. 3, 2 and 1 in that order. To have another strong argument at the last one might add the strong Scriptural condemnation to opposers who try to force their idolatry upon Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Arranging from familiar to the unfamiliar, Or ACCORDING TO FAMILIARITY of the audience, is another method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In a talk to the general public designed to show the duplicity of religion in its unchaste practice of mixing in politics, it would be logical to start off the body of the talk by giving examples of common knowledge of religion’s dabbling in this world’s politics today. Then going into the more unfamiliar, one could cite and prove examples of the same course from history, telling of such things as the Inquisition and its use to subjugate serfdom under the mundane heel of kings; and after this one could go into the still more unfamiliar (to the general public) and show that the same improper course was taken by the religionists of Jesus’ day and that Jesus condemned and prophesied against such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Other examples of development of the body of a talk will be given in the next article of this series.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">T</span><span class="font6">HE Creator had a right to make baboons; they have some rights too, but not as many as you. When you look in the mirror you can be glad that your parents were not baboons. You would not wish a long nose, with immense nostrils at the end, and great canine teeth that would make you look like a dog. Mummies of baboons are often found in Egypt. Somebody was as foolish then as the evolutionists and clergy are now. The time spent in preparing those baboons for worship was worse than wasted. It was an insult to the Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Moving down to the Congo region. You would not wish to be a Cynocephalus Mormon, i.e., a mandrill baboon. If you were, you would have short legs, a stump of a tail, an enormous head, a crest of green hair on your forehead, a beard of orange-yellow color, a light-blue nose folded in ridges, and buttocks of bright scarlet. You would look like a walking advertisement for cosmetics. But you would have a mean disposition. So you are glad to move on south.</span></p>

A chacma is darkbrown, has long hair and a long tail, which is terminated by long, black tufts of hair. Its four legs are of nearly equal length. It goes on all fours. It dodges the forests. While willing to eat insects, worms, snails and such young birds or animals as it can catch, it specially enjoys the vegetables, fruits, etc., of the plantations. So it isn’t loved.</span></p>

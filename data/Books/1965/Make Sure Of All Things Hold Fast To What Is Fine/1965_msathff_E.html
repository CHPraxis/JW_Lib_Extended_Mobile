<h3><a name="bookmark83"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark84"></a>FOREWORD</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Make sure of all things; hold fast to what is fine.” That Is sound advlee. Those who follow it will not be misled. They will not fall into the trap concerning which all Christians are warned with the words: “Look out: perhaps there may be someone who will carry you off as his prey through the philosophy and empty deception according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary things of the world and not according to Christ.”—1 Thess. 5:21; Col. 2:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">But how can one “make sure of all things”? To what authority will one look for reliable information? To God's own written Word the Bible. Jesus Christ himself quoted from the Holy Scriptures as authoritative, and his apostle Paul wrote: “All Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.&quot; (2 Tim. 3:16, 17) It is to that same source of information that we go with confidence that what we will find will be, ‘not the word of men, but the word of God.'—1 Thess. 2:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">So if we want to know what is right doctrine, we must listen to God when he speaks to us through his written Word. If we want to know what reliable hope there is concerning the future, we must consult the prophetic Scriptures. And if we are confronted with personal problems and decisions, where can we find better advice than what God himself has provided for us in the Bible? This publication, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of ATI Things; Hold Fast to What Is Fine,”</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> can help you to locate the information that you need from the Bible and it can do it in a minimum of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">You will find that the material under each of the one hundred and twenty-three Principal Subjects is so arranged that it will be a delight for you simply to sit down and read it. In just a short time it will give you a rounded-out view of what the Bible itself has to say on the subject you have selected to read. It will sharpen your appreciation of important details and enable you to become acquainted with scriptures on the subject from many parts of the Bible.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Similarly, when visiting with others in their homes to discuss the Bible, you will find this book a ready source of information on almost any Scriptural topic that may come up. Since the main headings are arranged alphabetically, it is an easy thing to turn to the section of the book that considers the subject. Then, if time permits, start right in with the first subheading. Read it and at least one of the scriptures quoted under it; then consider the next subheading, and so on through the entire outline of material. Where additional proof is needed, read some of the other scriptures quoted under the subheading; an abundance of material has been provided, and the scriptures are so plain that they speak for themselves. This will provide a satisfying picture of just what the Bible has to say on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">However, if time is limited or the question raised involves only one aspect of the subject, select the specific subheading that provides the information desired. This can be located either by turning to the section that contains the scriptures on the subject and then quickly glancing at the logically arranged boldface subheadings, or you can consult the Index in the back of the book. There you will find listed, not only the one hundred and twenty-three Principal Subjects, but 234 additional related subjects, with page references.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When you have talks to prepare, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;Make Sure of AU Things; Hold Fast to What Is Fine?'</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> can also prove itself to be a great aid. Not only will its subheadings offer you a ready-to-use outline, but the wide selection of scriptures quoted will make it possible for you to have variety and freshness in your presentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Use of this book of scriptures will enable you to “make sure&quot; that what you believe is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">in harmony with God’s Word. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It will help you to &quot;make sure” that your decisions are in harmony with Bible principles. It will assist you to &quot;make sure” that when you tell others about God and his purposes you are imparting accurate information. Carry it with you. Use it often.</span></p>

There was a </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">stream </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of fire flowing and going out from before him. There were a thousand thousands that kept ministering to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand that kept standing right before him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 12:22 “You have approached a Mount Zion and a city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem. and myriads of angels.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt 26:53 “Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father to supply me at this </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">moment more </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">than twelve legions of angels?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Pet. 2:11 “Angels, although they are greater in strength and power, do not bring against them an accusation in abusive terms, not doing so out of respect for Jehovah.”</span></p>

In response Jesus said to him: 'Happy are you, Simon son or Jonah, because flesh and blood did not reveal It to you, but my Father who is In the heavens did. Also, i say to you, You are Peter [petros, meaning a piece of rock, a stone], and on this rockmass [pefra, meaning a mass of rock or a cliff] I wfil build my congregation, and the gates of Hades will not overpower It. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you may bind on earth will be the thing bound In the heavens, and whatever you may loose on earth will be the thing loosed in the heavens.’ Then he sternly charged the disciples not to say to anybody that he was the Christ.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Ancient Babylon Was Outstandingly Noted for Its Religion, in Opposition to Worship of Jehovah, the True God</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Gen. 10:8-16 “Cush became father to Nimrod. He made the start tn becoming a mighty one in the earth. He displayed himself a mighty hunter tn opposition to Jehovah. That Is why there Is a saying: 'Just like Nlm-rod a mighty hunter in opposition to Jehovah.' And the beginning of his kingdom came to be Babel [Babylon].”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Gen. 11:4-9 &quot;They now said: ‘Come on I Let us build ourselves a city and also a tower [a ziggurat, for religious worship] with Its top in the heavens, and let us make a celebrated name for ourselves . . . And Jehovah proceeded to go down to see the city and the tower that the sons of men had built. After that Jehovah </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">said</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">: ‘Look! They are one people and there is one language for them all, and this Is what they start to do. . . . Come now! Let us go down and there confuse their language that they may not listen to one another’s language.’ Accordingly Jehovah scattered them from there over all the surface of the earth . . . That is why its name was called Babel [Babylon], because there Jehovah had confused the language of all the earth, and Jehovah had scattered them from there over all the surface of the earth.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Dan. 5:1, 4, 17, 22, 23 &quot;Belshazzar the king . . . made a big feast for a thousand of his grandees . . .

Daniel was answering and saying before the king: . . . ■And as for you, his son Belshazzar . . . you have praised mere gods of silver and of gold, copper, iron, wood and stone, that are beholding nothing or hearing nothing or knowing nothing; but the God in whose hand your breath is and to whom all your ways belong you have not glorified.’ ”</span></p>

Do not be rendered inanimate through her error. For it is the time of vengeance belonging to Jehovah. . . . Get out of the midst of her, O my people, and provide each one bls soul with escape from the burning anger of Jehovah.. . , look! there are days coming, and I will turn my attention upon the graven images of Babylon.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Advantageous as is Babylon’s geographical position, other factors helped to make her a dominant city for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> long period. Throughout the whole history of Mesopotamia, ancient as well as modem, religion has played an Important part In giving prestige and power to a city. In Mesopotamia from the time of Hammurabi onwards the worship of Marduk was specially associated with Babylon. The priesthood acquired considerable power, and even the kings of Assyria found It politic to receive what was practically a coronation rite In Babylon.&quot;—The </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Britannica</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> (Chicago; 1946), Vol. 2, p. 841.</span></p>

Therefore we were buried with him through our baptism into his death, in order that, just as Christ was raised up from the dead through the glory of the Father, we also should likewise walk In a newness of life. For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we shall certainly also be united with him in the likeness of his resurrection . . . Moreover, if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Col. 2:12 “You were buried with him In his baptism, and by relationship with him you were also raised up together through vour faith in the operation of God, who raised him up from the dead.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Phil. 3:10, 11 &quot;So as to know him and the power of his resurrection and a sharing in his sufferings, submitting myself to a death like his, to see if I may by any means attain to the earlier resurrection from the dead.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 15:29 “What will they do who are being baptized for the purpose of being dead ones? If the dead are not to be raised up at all, why are they also being baptized for the purpose of being such?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Tim. 2:11, 12 &quot;Certainly if we died together, we shall also live together; if we go on enduring, we shall also rule together as kings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 8:17 &quot;We are also heirs: heirs indeed of God, but joint heirs with Christ, provided we suffer together that we may also be glorified together.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Baptism with Fire Means Destruction for God's Enemies</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 3:16 &quot;He will baptize you people with . . . fire.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 17:29, 30 &quot;On the day that Lot came out of Sodom it rained fire and sulphur from heaven and destroyed them all. The same way it will be on that day when the Son of man is to be revealed.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Not the same as baptism with holy</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> spirit</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 1:5 “John, indeed, baptized with water, but you will be baptized in holy spirit not many days after this.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 2:1-4 &quot;Now while the day of the festival of Pentecost was in progress they were all together at the same place, and suddenly there occurred from heaven a noise just like that of a rushing stiff breeze, and it filled the whole house in which they were sitting. And tongues as if of fire became visible to them . . . and they all became filled with holy spirit and started to speak with different tongues, just as the spirit was granting them to make utterance.” (See also Joel 2:28, 29.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Day” has various meanings</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Gen. 1:5 &quot;God began calling the light Day, but the darkness he called Night.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Gen. 2:4 “This Is a history of the heavens and the earth In the time of their being created, In </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the day that Jehovah God made </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">earth and heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Ex. 20:11 “In six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, the sea and everything </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">tha</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">t </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">i« </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in them, and he proceeded to rest on the seventh day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 17:26-30 “Just as It occurred in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of man: . . . Likewise, Just as It occurred in the days of Lot: . . . The same way it will be on that day when the Son of man is to be revealed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Pet. 3:8 “Let this one fact not be escaping your notice, beloved ones, that one day is with Jehovah as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">God proceeded to rest on seventh day; no indication the “day” had concluded</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Gen. 2:2, 3 “By the seventh day God came to the completion of his work that he had made, and he proceeded to rest on the seventh day from all his work that he had made. And God proceeded to bless the seventh day and make It sacred, because on it he has been resting from all his work that God has created for the purpose of making.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Ex. 20:11 “In six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, the sea and everything that is in them, and he proceeded to rest on the seventh day. That Is why Jehovah blessed the sabbath day and proceeded to make It sacred.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Day of God’s</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> rest continues, now nearly </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">6fi00 years</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 3:17, 18; 4:1 “With whom did God become disgusted for forty years? Was It not with those who slimed, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness? But to whom did he swear that they should not enter into his rest except to those who acted disobediently?” &quot;Therefore ... a promise Is left of entering Into his rest.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 4:3-11 “We who have exercised faith do enter Into the rest, just as he has said </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">[about 1500 B.C.E.}: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">‘So I swore In my anger, “They shall not enter into my rest,” ’ although his works were finished from the founding of the world. For In one place he has said of the seventh day as follows: ‘And God rested on the seventh day from all his works,' and again in this place: ‘They shall not enter into my rest? Since, therefore, it remains for some to enter into it, and those to whom the good news was first declared did not enter In because of disobedience, he again marks off a certain day by saying after so long a time in David’s psalm [about </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1000 B.C.E.}</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 'Today’; just as it has been said above: 'Today it you people listen</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to his own voice, do not harden your hearts? For if Joshua had led them into a place of rest, God would not afterward </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">[about 400 years afterward, in David’s time} </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">have spoken of another day. So there remains a sabbath resting for the people of God. For the man that has entered Into God’s rest has also himself rested from his own works. Just as God did from his own. Let us therefore do our utmost to enter Into that</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Wrong Conduct Starts with Wrong Desires</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jas. 1:14. 15 “Each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been accomplished brings forth death.”</span></p>

Yes, I do establish my covenant with you: No more will all flesh be cut off by waters of a deluge, and no more will there occur a deluge to bring the earth to ruin.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Confirmed and enlarged on at </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">various times</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Gen.</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> 12:7 “Jehovah now appeared to Abram and said: ‘To your seed I am going to give this land.’ ” (See also Deut. 34:4; </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pb.</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> 105:8-11.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Gen, 13:14-17 &quot;Jehovah said to Abram after Lot had separated from him: ‘Raise your eyes, please, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward, because all the land at which you are looking, to you and to your seed I am going to give it until time indefinite. And I will constitute your seed like the dust particles of the earth, so that, If a man could be able to count the dust particles of the earth, then your seed could be numbered. Get up, go about In the land through Its length and through its breadth, because to you I am going to give it.’ &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Gen. 15:18 “On that day Jehovah concluded with Abram a covenant, saying: ‘To your seed 1 will give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates.' ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Gen. 17:2-8,19 “ 'I will give my covenant between me and you, that I may multiply you very, very much,’ At this Abram fell upon his face, and God continued to speak with him, saying: ‘As for me, look! my covenant is with you, and you will certainly</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">become a father of a crowd of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nations. And your</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> name will not be called Abram any more, and your name must become Abra, ham, because a father of a crowd of nations I will make you. And I will make you very, very fruitful and will make you become nations, and kings will come out of you. And I will carry out my covenant between me and you and your seed after you according to their generations for a covenant to time indefinite, to prove my. self God to you and to your seed after you. And I will give to you and to your seed after you the land of your alien residences, even the entire land of Canaan, for a possession to time indefinite; and I will prove myself God </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> them.' To this God said: 'Sarah your wife is Indeed bear-ing you a son, and you must call hts name Isaac.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Gen, 22:15-18 &quot;Jehovah’s angel proceeded to call to Abraham the second time out of the heavens and to say: ‘&quot;By myself I do swear,&quot; is the utterance of Jehovah, &quot;that by reason of the fact that you have done this thing and you have not withheld your son, your only one. I shun surely bless you and I shall surely multiply your seed like the stars of the heavens and like the grains of sand that are on the seashore; and your seed will take possession of the gate of his enemies.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Christ is</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> principal seed </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> Abraham through whom blessings flow; anointed Christians are </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">secondary</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> part </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of seed</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">GaL 3:14, 16, 29 &quot;The purpose was that the blessing of Abraham might come to be by means of Jesus Christ tor the nations, that we might receive the promised spirit through our faith. Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to his seed, It says, not: </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">'And to seeds,’ as hi the case of many such, but as in the case of one: 'And to your seed,' who is Christ. Moreover, if you belong to Christ, you are really Abraham's seed, heirs with reference to a promise.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Obedience to Covenant of Circumcision Demonstrated Purity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Circumcision Outward Seal of Righteousness</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Gen. 11:9-11, 13, 14 &quot;God said further to Abraham: ‘As for you, you are to keep my covenant, you and your seed after you according to their generations. This is my covenant that you men will keep, between me and you men, even your seed after you: Every male of yours must get circumcised. And you must get circumcised In the flesh of your foreskins, and It must serve as a sign of the covenant between me and you. Every man bom in your house and every man purchased with money of yours must without fail get circumcised; and my covenant in the flesh of you men must serve as a covenant to time indefinite. And an uncircumcised male who will not get the flesh of his foreskin circumcised, even that soul must be cut off from his people. He has broken my covenant.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 4:11 “He received a sign, namely, circumcision, as a seal of the righteousness by the faith he had while In his uncircumcised state, that he might be the father of all those having faith while in uncircumcision, in order for righteousness to be counted to them.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Law</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> Covenant Made by Jehovah with Natural Israel</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Ex. 24:3, 8 “Then Moses came and related to the people all the words of Jehovah and all the judicial decisions, and all the people answered with one </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">voice </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">and said: ‘All the words that Jehovah, has spoken we are willing to do.’ So Moses took the blood and sprinkled it upon the people and said: ‘Here Is the blood of the covenant that Jehovah has concluded with you as respects all these words.' ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Ex. 34:27 &quot;Jehovah went on to say to Moses; ‘Write down tor yourself these words, because It Is In accordance with these words that I do </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">conclude a covenant </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">with you and Israel? ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Deut. 4:12, 13 “Jehovah began to speak to you out of the middle of the fire. The sound of words was what you were hearing, but no form were you seeing—nothing but a voice. And he proceeded to state to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform —the Ten Words, after which he wrote them upon two tablets of stone.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Given under awe-inspiring circumstances</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Ex. 19:18, 20 &quot;Mount Sinai smoked all over, due to the fact that Jehovah came down upon It in fire: and its smoke kept ascending like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain was trembling very much. So Jehovah came down upon Mount Sinai to th:; top of the mountain. Then Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went on up.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 12:18,19, 21 &quot;For you have not approached that which can be felt anQ which has been set aflame with fire, and a dark cloud and thick darkness and a tempest, and the blare of a trumpet and the voice of words; on hearing which voice the people Implored that no word should be added to them. Also, the display was so fearsome that Moses said: </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">'I am </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">fearful and trembling? ”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Ex. 31:18, 17 &quot;The sone of Israel must keep the sabbath, so as to carry out the sabbath during their generations. It is a covenant to time indefinite. Between me and the sons of Israel it is a sign to time indefinite.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Gat 3:19 “Why, then, the Law? It was added to make transgressions manifest, until the seed should arrive to whom the promise bad been made; and It was transmitted through angels by the hand of a mediator.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Did not produce righlemu </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">nation, because </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of fleshly </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">imperfection</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 8:3 “There being an Incapability on the part of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Law, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">while it was weak through the flesh, God, by sending his own Son In the likeness of sinful flesh and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 13:38, 39 &quot;Let it therefore be known to you, brothers, that through this One a forgiveness of sins Is being published to you; and that from alt the things from which you could not be declared guiltless by means of the law of Moses, everyone who believes Is declared guiltless by means of this One.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 9:31, 32 “Israel, although pursuing a law of righteousness, did not attain to the law. For what reason? Because he pursued It, not by faith, but as by Works/*</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Gal. 3:21, 22 &quot;Is the Law, therefore, against the promises of God? May that never happen! For If a law had been given that was able to give life, righteousness would actually have been by means of law. But the Scripture delivered up all things together to the custody of sin, that the promise resulting from faith toward Jesus Christ might be given to those exercising faith.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Led those with faith to Christ</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Gal. 3:24 &quot;Consequently the Law has become our tutor leading to Christ, that we might be declared righteous due to faith,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 10:4 “Christ is the end of the Law, so that everyone exercising faith may have righteousness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Embodied prophetic patterns</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 10:1 “Since the Law has a shadow of the good things to come, but not the very substance of the things, men can never with the same sacrifices from year to year which they offer continually make those who approach perfect.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">CoL 2:16, II “Therefore let no man judge you in eating and drinking or in respect of a festival or of an observance of the new moon or of a sabbath* for those things are a shadow or the things to come, but the reality belongs to the Christ.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 8:4, 5 “If, now, he were upon earth, he would not be a priest, there being men who offer the gifts according to the Law, but which men are rendering sacred service In a typical representation and a shadow of the heavenly things.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 9:1-9, 23, 24 “Into the second compartment the high priest alone enters once a year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of ignorance of the people. Thus the holy spirit makes it plain that the way into the holy place had not yet been made manifest while the first tent was standing. This very tent Is an illustration for the appointed time that is now here, and In keeping with It both gifts and sacrifices are offered. However, these are not able to make the man doing sacred service perfect as respects his conscience. Therefore it was necessary that the typical representations of the things in the heavens should be cleansed by these means, but the heavenly things themselves with sacrifices that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">better than such sacrifices. For Christ entered, not into a holy place made with hands, which is a copy of the reality, but Into heaven itself, now to appear before the person of God tor us.”</span></p>

He kindly forgave us all our trespasses and blotted out the handwritten document against us, which consisted of decrees and which was in opposition to us; and He has taken it out of the way by nailing it to the torture staked</span></p>

For the law code, 'You must not commit adultery, You must not murder, You must not steal, You must not covet,’ and whatever other commandment there is, Is summed up tn this word, namely, ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.' Love does not work evil to one’s neighbor; therefore love Is the law’s fulfillment.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Deut. 6:1 &quot;Now these are the commandment, the regulations and the judicial decisions that Jehovah your God has commanded to teach you, so as to do them in the land to which you are passing over there to take possession of It.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Bom. 2:28, 29 &quot;He is not a Jew who is one on the outside, nor is circumcision that which Is on the outside upon the flesh. But he is a Jew who is one on the inside, and his circumcision is that of the heart by spirit, and not by a written code. The praise of that one comes, not from men, but from God.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 11:25 &quot;This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Eph. 2:12, 13 &quot;You were at that particular time without Christ, alienated from the state of Israel and strangers to the covenants of the promise, and you had no hope and were without God in the world.

For If the code administering condemnation was glorious, much more does the administering of righteousness abound with glory. In fact, even that which has once been made glorious has been stripped of glory in this respect, because of the glory that excels it. For If that which was to be done away with was brought in with glory, much more would that which remains be with glory.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Replaced the law covenant</span></p>

On that day Jehovah concluded [“cut,” 1950 Ed., ftn.] with Abram a covenant, saying: 'To your seed I will give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates.' ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Covenants, or Binding Agreements, Were Frequently Made</span></p>

And he has despised an oath In breaking a covenant, and, look I he had given bls hand and has done even all these things. He will not make his escape.’ Therefore this is what the Lord Jehovah has said: ‘As I am alive, surely my oath that he has despised and my covenant that he has broken—I will even bring it upon his head.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;What is the source of the differences between individuals? This is a very general biological problem, for just as there are no two absolutely Identical persons, so there are probably no two Identical Individuals of any biological species. Part of this variation we recognized as environmental, and part we know Is inherited. . . . Every person is born with a certain genetic endowment Inherited by him in the egg and the sperm from which he arose. This endowment enables the Individual to survive under a certain range of environmental conditions. What, then, determines the path which the development of a person will take? The genetic endowment, the individual’s genotype, interacts with the particular environments—intrauterine, individual, family, group, class, regional, and national—in which the person Ilves his particular life. These Interactions determine the characteristics by which we know the person.”—</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Radiation,.

New excavations, far-reaching discoveries and. above all, more painstaking scientific research have combined to damage irreparably the old illusion of an evolutionary progression from ape-man to creative intellect. . . . early men . . . were neither brute beasts nor semiapes nor cretins. Hence the ineffable stupidity of all attempts to reconstruct Neanderthal or even Peking man. Exaggeratedly hirsute plaster figures of bestial mien glower savagely at us in museums all over the world, their features usually chocolate-brown in color, their hair wild and unkempt, their jaws prognathous and their foreheads receding —and this despite the fact that we have absolutely no idea what color Paleolithic man’s skin was or how his hair grew and virtually no idea of his physiognomy. The American authority T. D. Stewart rightly pointed out In 1948 the impossibility of reconstructing hair, eyes, nose, lips or facial expression. 'The probabilities are that the expression of early man was not less benign than our own,' he wrote. When a museum displays models of Peking man. Neanderthal man and modem Homo sapiens side by side, it encourages a conception of physical and intellectual development which is not in accord with the views of contemporary science. ... In point of fact. Homo sapiens has made his uninterrupted way down the millennia from the very beginning. There have been many varieties of the sapiens type, but the varieties and the forms of life which were distinct from the sapiens type from the first never merged with it and sometimes wandered ofi down the blind alleys which led to extinction.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Man, God and Magic</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> (New York. 1961), by Ivar Llssner, pp. 303-305.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Mutant genes are usually so deleterious in their action that they tend to kill the organism. When they are not positively lethal they are usually retrograde In direction, and hinder rather than help the organism to fulfil the functions of its existence. Such results are to be expected of accidental changes occurring in any complicated organization. A race, therefore, will tend gradually to undergo degeneration in any respect to which selection (natural or artificial) does not persistently weed out the degenerative mutations that continue to occur.”—</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Britannica</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1946), Vol. 22, p. 989.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“For some time much emphasis has been placed upon gene-mutations in the belief that these must have played a most decisive role in the evolution of species. There is little doubt that genemutations, and probably also chromosomal and other heritable deviations occurring within the reproductive cell, have always worked to diversify genetic content wtthln living populations. However, the relative rarity of these aberrant or mutant changes, together with their usually maladaptive and more often than not lethal effects upon development, does not incline us to assign to them an important role in the maintenance of group-sdaptabillty. ... It should be observed that the great importance currently attached to gene-mutations as a factor in evolutionary history Is in part the result of erroneous expectations initially aroused by their discovery (it was for some time believed that single mutations could suddenly originate new species, overnight so to speak), and In part a reflection of the experimental value which increasingly attaches to the mutant forms, these often being so strikingly deviant that the geneticist can use them as tracers of Unes of inheritance and descent, so that they reveal the movement of genotype in laboratory-bred or natural populations.”—</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Progress and Decline</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> by Prof. Hugh Miller, The Ward Ritchie Press (Los Angeles; 1963), p. 38.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">on reading it one finds data on genetic experiments, cytological studies, fossils from far and near, comparisons of skeletons, etc., showing slight changes in some species and great stability In others.

But if you continue showing favoritism, you are working a sin, tor you are reproved by the law as transgressors.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 12:4-10, 28 “Now there are varieties of gifts, but there is the same spirit ... to one there is given through the spirit speech of wisdom, to another speech of knowledge according to the same spirit, to another faith by the same spirit, to another gifts of healings by that one spirit, to yet another operations of powerful works, to another prophesying, to another discernment of inspired utterances, to another different tongues, and to another interpretation of tongues. And God has set the respective ones in the congregation, first, apostles; second, prophets; third, teachers; then powerful works; then gifts of healings; helpful services, abilities to direct, different tongues.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Proved new Christian system of things to be of God, aided</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">growth of</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> congregation to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">maturity</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 2:4 &quot;God joined in bearing witness with signs as well as portents and various powerful works and with distributions of holy spirit according to his will.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Eph. 4:11-16 &quot;And he gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelizers, some as shepherds and teachers, with a view to the training of the holy ones, for ministerial work, for the building up of the body of the Christ, until we all attain to the oneness in the faith and in the accurate knowledge of the Son of God, to a full-grown man, to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">measure of growth</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> that belongs to the f</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ulln</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ess of the Christ; in order that we should no longer be babes, tossed about as by waves and carried hither and thither by every wind of teaching by means of the trickery of men, by means of cunning in contriving error. But speaking the truth, let us by love grow up in all things into him who is the head, Christ. From him all the body, by being harmoniously joined together and being made to co-operate through every joint that gives what is needed, according to the functioning </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> each respective member in due measure, makes for the growth of the body for the building up of Itself in love.”</span></p>

But </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Peter stood up with the eleven and raised his voice.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">. Acts 8:14-18 &quot;When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they dispatched Peter and John to them; and these went down and prayed for them to get holy spirit. For it had not yet fallen upon any one of them, but they had only been baptized ta the name of the Lord Jesus. Then they went laying their hands upon them, and they began to receive holy spirit. . . . Simon saw that through the laying on of the hands of the apostles the spirit was given.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 10:44 “While Peter was yet speaking about these matters the holy spirit fell upon all those hearing the word.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 19:6 “When Paul laid his hands upon them, the holy spirit came upon them, and they began speaking with tongues and prophesying.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Miraculous gifts to be done away with when Christian congregation reached maturity </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the gift of prophesying and am acquainted with all the sacred secrets and all knowledge, and if I have all the faith so as to transplant mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. Love never fails. But whether there are gifts of prophesying, they will be done away with; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, It will be done away with. For we have partial knowledge and we prophesy partially; but when that which is complete arrives, that which is partial will be done away with. When I was a babe, I used to speak as a babe, to think as a babe, to reason as a babe; but now that I have become a man, I have done away with the traits of a babe.&quot;</span></p>

Many will say to me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and expel demons in your name, and perform many powerful works In your name?’ And yet then I will c</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">onfess</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> to them: I never knew you! Get away from me, you workers of lawlessness.”</span></p>

The sick man answered him: ‘Sir, I do not have a man to put me into the pool when the water is disturbed; but while I am coming another steps down ahead of me,' Jesus said to him: 'Get up, pick up your cot and walk.' With that the man Immediately became sound in health, and he picked up his cot and began to walk. . . .

Then he went back to the man of the true God, he with all his camp, and came and stood before him and said: ‘Here, now, I certainly know that there is no God anywhere in the earth but in Israel. And now accept, please, a blessing gift from your servant.’ However, he said: 'As Jehovah before whom I stand is living, I will not accept it.’ And he began to urge him to accept it, but he kept refusing.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“It is generally admitted that the designation of the 25th of December for the festival [Christmas], was first made about the</span></p>

For from the days of Augustine and Chrysostom down to our own times, we find many devout persons deprecating the heathenish manner In which the festival was kept, and labouring to give it a more Christian character.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt 2:1, 2, 7, 12, 13 &quot;After Jesus had been bom in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, look! astrologers from eastern parts came to Jerusalem, saying: ‘Where Is the one born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when we were in the east, and we have come to do him obeisance.’ Then Herod secretly summoned the astrologers and carefully ascertained from them the time of the star's appearing. However, because they were given divine warning in a dream not to return to Herod, they withdrew to their country by another way. After they had withdrawn, look! Jehovah's angel appeared in a dream to Joseph, saying: ‘Get up, take the young child and its mother and flee Into Egypt, and stay there until</span></p>

When they had heard the Ung, they went their way; and, look! the star they had seen when they were in the east went ahead of them, until it came to a stop above where the young child was. And when they went into the house they saw the young child with Mary Its mother, and, falling down, they did obeisance to it. They also opened their treasures and presented it with gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Most of the Christmas customs now prevailing in Europe, or recorded from former times, are not genuine Christian customs, but heathen customs which have been absorbed or tolerated by the Church. . . . The Saturnalia in Rome provided the model tor most of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">merry</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> customs of the Christmas time. . . . Christmas Inherited the general merriment in a more restrained form (excessive only in eating and drinking): games, giving of gifts (especially to children), abundance of sweetmeats and, as more ceremonious elements, burning of candles and bathing before the festival.”—</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Encyclopcedia of Religion and Ethics</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> (Edinburgh; 1911), edited by James Hastings, Vol. m, pp. 608, 609.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;From the first institution of this festival, the western nations seem to have transferred to it many of the follies and censurable practices which prevailed in the pagan festivals of the same season, such as adorning the churches fantastically, mingling puppet-shows and dramas with</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">worship, universal feasting and merrimaking, Christmas visits and salutations, Christmas presents and jocularity, and Christmas revelry and drunkenness.’ </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">__Institutes of Ecclesiastical History, Ancient and Modern</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> (New York; 1845), by John Von Mosheim (Translation by James Murdock), Vol. I, p. 280, footnote (12).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 2:15, 20 “So when the angels had departed from them into heaven, the shepherds began saying to one another: 'Let us by all means go clear to Bethlehem and see this thing that has place, which Jehovah has made known to us.’ Then the shepherds went back, glorifying and praising God for all the things they heard and saw, just as these had been told them.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Lent of Pagan Origin;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Not Commanded by Jesus</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;We may then fairly conclude that Irenseus about the year 190 knew nothing of any Easter fast of forty days. The same inference must be drawn from the language of Tertullian only a few years later. . . . And there is the same silence observable in all the pre-Nlcene Fathers, though many had occasion to mention such an Apostolic institution If it had existed.’’—The </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> (New York; 1910), Vol. IX, p. 152.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot; 'It ought to be known,’ said Cassianus. the monk of Marseilles, writing in the fifth century, and contrasting the primitive Church with the Church In his day, 'that the observance of the forty days had no existence, so long as the perfection of that primitive church remained Inviolate.’ Whence, then, came this observance? The forty days’ abstinence of Lent was directly borrowed from the worshippers of the Babylonian goddess. Such a Lent of forty days, ’in the spring of the year,’ Is still observed by the Yeaidis or pagan</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Devil-worshippers of Koordlstan, who have inherited it from their early masters, the Babylonians. Such a Lent of forty days was held in spring by the Pagan Mexicans, for thus we read in Humboldt, [Humboldt’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mexican Researches,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> vol. i, p. 404] where he gives account of Mexican observances: ‘Three days after the vernal equinox. . . . began a solemn fast of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">forty days</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> in honour of the sun.’ Such a Lent of forty days was observed in Egypt, as may be seen on consulting Wilkinson’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Egyptians</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> [vol. 1, p. 278]. This Egyptian Lent of forty days, we are Informed by Landseer, in his </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sabean Researches </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">[p. 112], was held expressly in commemoration of Adonis or Osiris, the great mediatorial god. . . . Among the Pagans this Lent seems to have been an indispensable preliminary to the great annual festival In commemoration of the death and resurrection of Tammus.”—</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Two Babyions </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(New York; 1957), by Alexander Hislop, pp. 104, 105.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Essentially, All Souls is the adaptation of an almost worldwide custom of setting aside a part of the year (usually the last part) for the dead. The Babylonians observed a monthly Feast of All Souls in which sacrifices were made by priests. The Greek commemorative feast of All Souls was held on the last day of the Anthesteria; the Ro-</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">mans celebrated theirs during the Parentaila which fell on Feb. 13-21, the end of the Roman year. The Buddhist Feast of the Dead is celebrated on April 15, the date of the death of Buddha and his attainment of Buddha-hood. In China and Japan the ceremony in honor of the dead is known as the Feast of Lanterns. In many Catholic countries the belief that the dead return on this day is so strong that food is left on the tables (Tirol, Italy) and people (France, Italy, Germany) still decorate the graves of their dead.&quot;—</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Funk &amp;&nbsp;Wagnails Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology and Legend </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(New York; 1949), Vol. 1, p. 38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“All Souls' Day, the day set apart in the Roman Catholic Church for the commemoration of the faithful departed. The celebration is based on the doctrine that the souls of the faithful which at death have not been cleansed from venial sins, or have not atoned for past transgressions, cannot attain the Beatific Vision, and that they may be helped to do so by prayer and by the sacrifice of the mass. . . . Certain popular beliefs connected with All Souls' Day are of pagan origin and immemorial antiquity. Thus the dead Eire believed by the peasantry of many Catholic countries to return to their former homes on All Souls’ night and partake of the food of the living.”—</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Britannica (New</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> York; 1910), 11th Edition, Vol. I, p. 709.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Denying Oneself Meat, or Other Food, on Certain Days Not</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 8:8 &quot;Food will not commend us to God; if we do not eat, we do not fall short, and, If we eat, we have no credit to ourselves.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Tim. 4:1-3 &quot;However, the inspired utterance says definitely that in later periods of time some will fall away from the faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Holidays paying attention to misleading Inspired utterances and teachings of demons, . . . forbidding to marry, commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who have faith and accurately know the truth.” See also Col. 2:20-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Holidays That Become Occasions of Revelry Shunned by</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">X Pet. 4:3 “The time that has passed by is sufficient for you to have worked out the will of the nations when you proceeded in deeds of loose conduct, lusts, excesses with wine, revelries, drinking matches, and Illegal Idolatries.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 1:25 “Those who exchanged the truth of God for the lie and venerated and rendered sacred service to the creation rather than the One who created, who is blessed forever.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 19:10 &quot;At that I fell down before his feet to worship him. But he tells me: ‘Be careful! Do not do that! All I am Is a fellow slave of you and of your brothers who have the work of witnessing to Jesus. Worship God.’”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Holidays</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 14:11-15 “The crowds, seeing what Paul had done, raised their voices, saying in the Lye-aonian tongue: &quot;rhe gods have become like humans and have come down to us!’ . . . However, when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they ripped their outer garments and leaped out into the crowd, crying out and saying: ’Men, why are you doing these things? We also are humans having the same infirmities as you do. and are declaring the good news to you, for you to turn from these vain things to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them.’ &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 12:21-23 &quot;On a set day Herod clothed himself with royal raiment and sat down upon the judgment seat and began giving them a public address. In turn the assembled people began shouting: ‘A god’s voice, and not a man's!' Instantly the angel of Jehovah struck him, because he did not give the glory to God; and he became eaten up with worms and espired,&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 8:34 &quot;Christ Jesus is the one who died, yes, rather the one </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">who was</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> raised up from the dead, who is on the right hand of God, who also pleads for us.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Ezek. 8:16, 17 “So he brought me to the inner courtyard of the house of Jehovah, and, look! at the entrance of the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, there were about twenty-five men with their backs to the temple of Jehovah and their faces to the east, and they were bowing down to the east, to the sun. And he went on to say to me; -Have you seen this, o son of man? Is it such a light thing to the house of Judah to do the detestable things that they have done here?’”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">His Followers</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">John 13:2-17 &quot;While the evening meal was going on . , . [Jesus] got up from the evening meal and laid aside his outer garments. And, taking a towel, he girded himself. After that he put watei into a basin and started to wash the feet of the disciples and to dry them off with the towel with which he was girded. . . . When, now, he had washed their feet and had put his outer garments on and laid himself down at the table again, he said to them: ‘Do you know what I have done to you? You address me, &quot;Teacher,&quot; and, &quot;Lord.” and you speak rightly, for I am such. Therefore, if I, although Lord and Teacher,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">washed your feet, you also ought to wash the feet of one another. For I set the pattern for you, that, just as I did to you, you should do also. Most truly I say to you, A slave is not greater than his master, nor is one that Is sent forth greater than the one that sent him. If you know these things, happy you are if you do them.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Phil. 2:7, 8 “He emptied himself and took a slave’s form and came to be in the likeness of men. More than that, when he found </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">self jn fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient as far as death, yes, death on a torture stake.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 18:9-14 “He spoke this illustration also to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and who considered the rest as nothing: 'Two mm went up into the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood and began to pray these things to himself, “O God, I thank you I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unrighteous, adulterers, or even as this tax collector, I fast twice a week, I give the tenth of all things I acquire.” But the tax collector standing at a distance was not willing even to raise his eyes heavenward, but kept beating his breast, saying, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“O</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> God, be gracious to me a sinner.&quot; I tell you, This man went down to his home proved more righteous than Chat man; because everyone that exalts himself will be humiliated, but he that humbles himself will be exalted.’&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 14:7-11 “He then went on to tell the Invited men an Illustration, as he marked how they were choosing the most prominent places for themselves. saying Co them: ‘When you are Invited by someone to a marriage feast, do not lie down tn the most prominent place. Perhaps someone more distinguished than you may at the time have been invited by him, and he that invited you and him will come and say to you, “Let this man have the place.” And then you will start off with shame to occupy the lowest place. But when you are invited, go and recline in the lowest place, that when the man that has Invited you comes he will say to you, “Friend, go on up higher.&quot; Then you will have honor in front of all your fellow guests. For everyone that exalts </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">himself</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> will </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">be</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> humbled and he that humbles himself will be exalted.’ ”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 12:16 &quot;Do not be minding lofty things, but be led along with the lowly things. Do not become discreet In your own eyes.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Prov. 29:23 “The very haughtiness of earthling man will humble him. but he that is humble in spirit will take hold of glory.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Prov. 16:18, 19 &quot;Pride Is before a crash, and a haughty spirit before stumbling. Better is it to be lowly tn spirit with the meek ones than to divide spoil with the self-exalted ones.&quot;</span></p>

And no one recalls to his heart or has knowledge or understanding, saying:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">And they began to say: &quot;This is your God. o Israel, who led you up out of the land of Egypt.&quot; When Aaron got to see this, he went to building an altar before It. Finally Aaron called out and said: 'There Is a festival to Jehovah tomorrow.’ Jehovah now said to Moses; ‘Go, descend, because your people whom you led up out of the land of Egypt have acted ruinously. They have turned aside in a hurry from the way I have commanded them to go. They have made a molten statue of a calf for themselves and keep bowing down to It and sacrificing to it ... So now let me be, that my anger may blaze against them and I may exterminate them.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Ki. 12:26-28, 30 &quot;Jeroboam began to say in his heart: ‘Now the kingdom will return to the house of David. If this people continues, going up to render sacrifices in the house of .Jehovah in Jerusalem, the heart </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">at </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">this people will also be bound to return to their lord, Rehoboam the king of Judah . . .' Consequently the king took counsel and made two golden calves and said to the people; ‘It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here is your God, O Israel, that brought you up out of the land of Egypt.’ And this thing came to be a cause for sin.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Was Forbidden God's People Israel</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Ex. 23:31-33 &quot;I will fix your boundary from the Red Sea to the sea of the Philistines and from the wilderness to the River; because i shall give Into your hand the Inhabitants of the land, and you will certainly drive them out from before yourself. You are not to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">conclude a covenant </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">with them or their gods. They should not dwell in your land, that they may not cause you to sin against me. In case you</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">should serve their gods, it would become a snare to you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Deut. 7:1, 3, 4 &quot;When Jehovah your God at last brings you into the land to which you are going so as to take possession of it, he must also clear away populous nations from before you ... And you must form no marriage alliance with them. Your daughter you must not give to his son, and his daughter you must not take for your son. For he will turn your son from following me, and they will certainly serve other gods; and Jehovah's anger will Indeed blaze against you, and he will certainly annihilate you in a hurry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Failure </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to keep clean from false religious rites led to divine disapproval</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Judg. 10:6, 7 &quot;The sons of Israel again proceeded to do what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah, and they began to serve the Baals and the Ashtoreth images and the gods of Syria and the gods of Sidon and the gods of Moab and the gods of the sons of Ammon and the gods of the Philistines. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">So they</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> left Jehovah and did not serve </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> At this Jehovah's anger biased against Israel.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Ps. 106:35-40 &quot;They went mingling with the nations and took Up l</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">earning</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> their works. And they kept serving their idols, and these came to be a snare to them. . . . And they got to be unclean by their works and kept having immoral Intercourse by their dealings. And the anger of Jehovah began to blaze against his people, and he came to detest his inheritance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jet. 44:2, 3 “This is what Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel, has said, 'You yourselves have seen all the calamity that I have brought In upon Jerusalem and upon all the cities of Judah, and here they are a devastated place </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">this</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> day, and in them there is no inhabitant. It is because of their badness that they did in order to offend me by going and m</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">aking</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> sacrificial smoke and rendering service to other gods whom they themselves had not known, neither you nor your forefathers.’ ”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Ki. 11:5, 6, 9 &quot;Solomon began going after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonlans and after MUcom the disgusting thing of th® Ammonites. And Solomon began to do what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah, and he did not follow Jehovah fully like David his father. And Jehovah came to be incensed at Solomon, because his heart had inclined away from Jehovah the God of Israel, the one appearing to him twice.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus Christ Condemned Religious Beliefs and Practices Not in Strict Accord with God's</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt 16:6, 12 “Jesus said to them: ‘Keep your eyes open and watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.’ Then they grasped that he said to watch out, not for the leaven of the loaves, but for the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Mark 7:6-9 “He said to them: &quot;Isaiah aptly prophesied about you hypocrites, as It is written, “This people honor me with their liDs, but their hearts are far removed from me. It is in vain that they keep worshiping me, because they teach as doctrines commands of men.” Letting go the commandment of God, you hold fast the tradition of men.’ Further, he went on to say to them: ‘Adroitly you set aside the co</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mmandm</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ent of God in order to retain your tradition.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt 23:5-7, 23, 27, 28 &quot;All the works they do they do to be viewed by men; for they broaden the scripture-containing</span></p>

They like the most prominent place at evening meals and the front seats in the synagogues, and the greetings in the market places and to be called Rabbi by men. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you give the tenth of the mint and the dill and the cummin, but you have disregarded the weightier matters of the Law, namely, justice and mercy and faithfulness. These things it was binding to do, yet not to disregard the other things. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you resemble whitewashed graves, which outwardly Indeed appear beautiful but inside are full of dead men’s bones and of every sort of uncleanness. In that way you also, outwardly Indeed, appear righteous to men, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">refused to acknowledge </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">spiritual </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">brotherhood</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> with </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">religious leaders of his day</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">John 8:42-44 “Jesus said to them: 'If God were your Father, you would love me, for from God I came forth and am here. Neither have I come of my own initiative at all, but that One sent me forth. Why is It you do not know what I am speaking? Because you cannot listen to my word. You are from your father the Devil, and you wish to do the desires of your father.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 23:29-33 “Woe to you. scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites 1 because you build the graves of the prophets and decorate the memorial tombs of the righteous ones, and you say, ‘If we had been in the days of our forefathers, we would not have been sharers with them in the blood of the prophets.'

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Mark 9:38-40 &quot;John said to him: ‘Teacher, we saw a certain man expelling demons by the use of your name and we tried to prevent him, because he was not accompanying us.' But Jesus said: 'Do not try to prevent him, for there is no one that will do a powerful work on the basis of my name that will quickly be able to revile me; for he that is not against us is for us.’ ’</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 11:20-23, 25, 26 &quot;There were some men of Cyprus and Cyrene that came to Antioch and began talking to the Greekspeaking people, declaring the. good news of the Lord Jesus. Furthermore, the hand of Jehovah was with them, and a great number that became believers turned to the Lord. The account about them got to the ears of the congregation that was in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barnabas as far as Antioch. When he arrived and saw the undeserved kindness of God, he rejoiced and began to encourage them all to continue in the Lord with hearty purpose. So he went off to Tarsus to make a thorough search for Saul and, after he found him, he brought him to Antioch. It thus came about that for a whole year they gathered together with them in the congregation and taught quite a crowd, and it was first in Antioch that the disciples were by divine providence called Christians.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Gal. 1:22 “But [Paul] was unknown by face to the congregations of Judea that were in union with Christ.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 16:4, 5 &quot;Now as they traveled on through the cities they would deliver to those there for observance the decrees that had been decided upon by the apostles and older men who were in Jerusalem. Therefore, indeed, the congregations continued to be made flrm in the faith and to increase in number from day to day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 19:8, 9 “Entering Into the synagogue, he spoke with boldness for three months, giving talks and using persuasion concerning the kingdom of God. But when some went on hardening themselves and not believing, speaking injuriously about The Way before the multitude, he withdrew from them and separated the disciples from them, daily giving talks in the school auditorium of Tyrannus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 12:4, 5 “Just as we have in one body many members, but the members do not ail have the same function, so we, although many, are one body in union with Christ, but members belonging Individually to one an-</span></p>

Many will say to me In that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and expel demons In your name, and perform many powerful works in your name?’ And yet then I wifi confess to them: I never knew you! Get away from me, you workers of lawlessness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Cor. 11:13-15 “Such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves Into apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for Satan himself keeps transforming himself into an angel of light.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Tim. 4:1-3 &quot;However, the inspired utterance says definitely that in later periods of time some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to misleading inspired utterances and teachings of demons, by the hypocrisy, of men who speak lies, marked in their conscience as with a branding iron; forbidding to marry, commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who have faith and accurately know the truth.&quot;</span></p>

Furthermore, many will follow their acts of loose conduct, and on account </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of these </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the way of the truth will be spoken of abusively. Also, with covetousness they will exploit you with counterfeit words. But as for them, the judgment of ancient times is not moving slowly, and the destruction of them Is not slumbering.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Cor. 11:3 &quot;But I am afraid that somehow, as the serpent seduced Eve by its cunning, your minds might be corrupted away from the sincerity and the chastity that are due the Christ.&quot;</span></p>

My reason Is that certain men have slipped in who have long ago been appointed by the Scriptures to this judgment, ungodly men, turning the undeserved kindness of our God into an excuse for loose conduct and proving false to our only Owner and Lord, Jesus Christ.&quot;</span></p>

He had gone to Jerusalem to worship, but he was returning and was sitting in his chariot and reading aloud the prophet Isaiah. Philip ran alongside and beard him reading aloud Isaiah the prophet, and he said: 'Do you actually know what you are reading?’ He said: ‘Really, how could I ever do so, unless someone guided me?’ And he entreated Philip to get on and sit down with him.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When Jesus said he </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">came to fulfill the Law, he referred both to Ten Commandments and to other parts of the Law</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">5:17,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 21, 23, 27, 31. 38 “Do not think I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I came, not to destroy, but to fulfill. You heard that it was said to those of ancient times, ‘You must not murder [Ex. 20:13]’ ... If, then, you are bringing your gift to the altar [Deut. 16:16, 17] . . . You heard that It was said, •You must not commit adultery.' (Ex. 20:14] Moreover it was said. ‘Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.' [Deut. 24:1] You heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye and tooth for tooth’ [Ex. 21: 23-25].”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Law that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">was brought to an end included the Tenth</span></p>

What, then, shall we say? Is the Law sin? Never may that become so! Really I would not have come to know sin if it had not been for the Law; and, for example, I would not have known covetousness If the Law had not said: ‘You must not covet’ [Ex. 20:17].”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Paul Shows Law Was Set Aside Along with Levitical Priesthood, Which Had Endured “to Time Indefinite” [Hebrew: </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">olam]</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> but Not Eternally</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Ex. 40:15 &quot;Their anointing must serve continually for them as a priesthood to time indefinite during their generations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 7:11. 12, 18, 19 “If, then, perfection were really through the Levitical priesthood, (for with it as a feature the people were given the Law,) what further need would there be for another priest to arise according to the manner of Melchizedek and not said to be according to the manner of Aaron? For since the priesthood is being changed, there comes to be of necessity a change also of the law. Certainly, then, there occurs a setting aside of the preceding commandment on account of its weakness and ineffectiveness. For the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing In besides of a better hope did, through which we are drawing near to God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Righteous Principles Embodied in the Law Not Abolished</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Gal. 5:14 &quot;For the entire Law stands fulfilled in one saying, namely: 'You must love your neighbor as yourself.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 5:21, 22, 27, 28 &quot;You heard that it was said to those of ancient </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">tim</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">es, ‘You must not murder; but whoever commits a murder will be accountable to the court of justice.’ However, I say to you that everyone who continues wrathful with his brother will be accountable to the court of justice; but whoever addresses his brother with an unspeakable word of contempt will be accountable to the Supreme Court; whereas whoever says, ‘You despicable fool!' will be liable to the fiery Gehenna. You heard that it was said, ‘You must not commit adultery.’ But I say to you that everyone that keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cod’s spirit moves Christians to godly conduct</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Gal. 5:18, 22, 23 “Furthermore, if you are being led by spirit, you are not under law. . . . the fruitage of the spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness, selfcontrol. Against such things there is no law.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 6:15-18 “What follows? Shall we commit a sin because we are not under law but under undeserved kindness? Never may that happen! Do you not know that if you keep presenting your-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Law selves to anyone as slaves to obey him, you are slaves of him because you obey him, either of sin with death in view or of obedience with righteousness in view? But thanks to God that you were the slaves of sin but you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which you were handed over. Yes, since you were set free from sin, you became slaves to righteousness.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Prophetic Patterns of Law Covenant Found Fulfillment in Jesus Christ and His</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Ministry</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 9:1-3, 9, 10, 24 “For its part, then, the former covenant used to have ordinances of sacred service and Its holy place upon this earth. For there was constructed a first tent compartment </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> which were the lampstand ' and also the table and the display of the loaves; and It is called ‘the Holy Place.' But behind the second curtain was the tent compartment called ‘the Most Holy.' This very tent is an illustration for the appointed time that is how here, and in keeping with it both gifts and sacrifices are offered. However, these are not able to make the man doing sacred service perfect as respects his conscience, but have to do only with foods and drinks and various baptisms. They were legal requirements pertaining to the flesh and<sup>-</sup> were imposed until the appointed time to set things straight. For Christ entered, not into a holy place made with hands, which Is a copy of the reality, but into heaven itself, now to appear before the person of God for us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 5:7 “Clear away the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, according as you are free from ferment. For, indeed, Christ our passover has been sacrificed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 10:8-10 “After first saying: 'You did not want nor did you approve of sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin offering'—sacrifices that are offered according to the Law—then he actually says: 'Look! I am come to do your will.’ He does away with what is first that he may establish what is second. By the said 'will' we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for ail time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Persons Insisting on Adherence to the Law Reject Christ</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Gal. 5:1-6 “For such freedom Christ set us free. Therefore stand fast, and do not let yourselves be confined again in a yoke of slavery. See! I, Paul, am telling you that if you become circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you. Moreover, I bear witness again to every man getting circumcised that he is under obligation to perform the whole Law. You are parted from Christ, whoever you are that try to be declared righteous by means of law; you have fallen away from his undeserved kindness. For our part we by spirit are eagerly waiting for the hoped-for righteousness as a result of faith. For as regards Christ Jesus neither circumcision is of any value nor is unclrcumcision. but faith operating through love</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Christians Not Under the Law, but Saved by Faith Through</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s Undeserved Kindness</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 6:14 “For sin must not be master over you, seeing that you are not under law but under undeserved kindness.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Eph. 2:8, 9 “By this undeserved kindness, indeed, you have been saved through faith; and this not owing to you, it is God’s gift. No, it is not owing to works, in order that no man should have ground for boasting.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Catholic Statement of Belief</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The Church intends the Mass to be regarded as a 'true and proper sacrifice’ ... As for special reference to the propitiatory character, the record of institution states expressly that the Blood of Christ is shed In the chalice ‘Unto r</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">emissi</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">on of sins.’ The chief source of our doctrine, however, is tradition, which from the earliest times declares the impetratory value of the Sacrifice of the Mass.”—</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Catholic Encyclopedia</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> (New York; 1911), Robert Appleton Co., VoL X, pp. 6, 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Mass Is the sacrifice of the New Law in which Christ, through the ministry of the priest, offers Himself to God in an unbloody manner under the appearances of bread and wine. . . . The Mass is the same sacrifice as the sacrifice of the cross because in the Mass the victim is</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Mark 12:25 “When they rise from the dead, neither do men marry nor are women given in marriage, but are as angels in the heavens.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 20:34-36 “Jesus said to them: ‘The children of this system of things marry and are given in marriage, but those who have been counted worthy of gaining that system of things and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage. In fact, neither can they die any more, for they are like the angels, and they are God's children by being children of the resurrection.' ” the same, and the principal priest is the same, Jesus Christ.. .. The most important part of the Mass Is the consecration, when Christ’s body and blood become really present on the altar and are offered to God by the priest In commemoration of Our Lord's death on the cross. . . . Our Lord wished that the sacrifice of Calvary should not be limited to one place or one time. He willed that all men should have an opportunity of assisting at the sacrifice of His body and blood. And so, on the night before His death He established the Sacrifice of the Mass, This was to be a renewal of Calvary, in the sense that the same body and blood that were offered on the cross were to be offered again.”—The </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New Baltimore Catechism.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus Offered Himself as Sacrifice Once, Never Needs “Renewal”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 9:24-28, Knox “The sanctuary into which Jesus has entered is not one made by human hands, is not some adumbration of the truth; he has entered heaven Itself, where he now appears in God’s sight on our behalf. Nor does he make a repeated offering of himself, as the high priest, when he enters the sanctuary, makes a yearly offering of the blood that is not his own. If that were so, he must have suffered again and again, ever since the world was created; as it is. he has been revealed once for all. at the moment when history reached its fulfilment, annulling our sin by his sacrifice. Man's destiny is to die once for all; nothing remains after that but judgement; and Christ was offered once for all, to drain the cup of a world's sins.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 7:25, 27 Dy “He is able also to save for ever them that come to God by him; always living to make intercession for us. Who needeth not dally (as the other priests) to offer sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, in offering himself.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 10:11, 12, 14-18, Dy “Every priest Indeed standeth dally ministering and often offering the same sacrifices which can never take away sins. But this man. offering one sacrifice for sins, for ever sitteth on the right hand of God. For by one oblation he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. And the Holy Ghost also doth testify this to us. For after that he said; And this is the testament which I will make unto them after those days, salth the Lord. I will give my laws in their hearts and on their minds will I write them:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">336</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and their sins and iniquities I will remember no more. Now, where there is a remission of these, there is no more an oblation for sin.&quot;</span></p>

For then they would have ceased to be offered: because the worshippers once cleansed should have no conscience of sin any longer. But in them there is made a commemoration of sins every year: For it is impossible that with the blood of oxen and goats sin should be taken away.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The story of the origin of our National flag parallels the story of the origin of our country.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“The star is a symbol of the heavens and the divine goal to which man has aspired from time immemorial; the stripe Is symbolic of the rays of light emanating from the sun.

Continuing In favor, they spread to the striped standards of Holland and the West India Company in the 17th century and to the present patterns of stars and stripes on the flags of several nations of Europe.

The flag Is venerated and worshiped, every moment of one’s life, with profound, pure and almost inborn sentiments of love. . . . The flag is worshiped, just as the Father-land is worshiped. . . . The flag is venerated, just as the Father-land is venerated, giving to it all of oneself and placing above one's own self even the sacrifice of one’s life. . . .

If they have persecuted me, they will persecute you also; if they have observed my word, they will observe yours also. But they will do all these things against you on account of my name, because they do not know him that sent me. But It is that the .word written In their Law stay be fulfilled, 'They hated me without cause.&quot;’</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Christian Attitude and Conduct When Undergoing Cruel</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Persecution</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Pet. 2:23 &quot;When he was being reviled, he did not go reviling in return. When he was suffering, he did not go threatening, but kept on committing himself to the one who judges righteously.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 7:59, 60 &quot;They went on casting stones at Stephen as he made appeal and said: 'Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.’ Then, bending his knees, he cried out with a strong voice: 'Jehovah, do not charge this sin against them.’ And after saying this he fell asleep in death.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 16:27-32 “The jailer, being awakened out of sleep and</span></p>

And he brought them outside and said: ‘Sirs, what must I do to get saved?’ They said: ‘Believe on the Lord Jesus and you will get saved, you and your household.’ And they spoke the word of Jehovah to him together with all those in his house.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Proper View of the Persecution Itself</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Phil. 1:27-29 “Only behave in a manner worthy of the good news about the Christ, . . . standing firm in one spirit, with one soul fighting side by side for the faith of the good news, and in no respect being frightened by your opponents.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Repeated calls necessary; message is urgent</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Isa. 6:9-11 “Go, and you must say to this people, 'Hear again and again, O men, . . .' At this I said: 'How long, O Jehovah?’ Then he said: ‘Until the cities actually crash In ruins, to be without an inhabitant.' ”</span></p>

Whoever drinks from the water that I will give </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> will never get thirsty at all, but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of</span></p>

These, then, are the ones alongside the road where the word is sown; but as soon as they have heard it Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them. And likewise these are the ones sown upon the rocky places: as soon as they have heard the word, they accept it with Joy. Yet they have no root in themselves, but they continue for a time; then as soon as tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, they are stumbled.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">John 6:65, 66 “So he went on to say: ‘This is why I have said to you. No one can come to me unless it Is granted him by the Father.’ Owing to this many of his disciples went off</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">John 4:40, 41 “When the Samaritans came to him, they began asking him to stay with them; and he stayed there two days. Consequently many more believed on account of what he said.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 17:33, 34 &quot;Thus Paul went out from their midst, but some men Joined themselves to him and became believers, among whom also were Dionysius, a judge of the court of the Areopagus. and a woman named Damaris, and others besides them.&quot;</span></p>

Augustine In Ps. xxxvll, n. 3, speaks of the pain which purgatorial fire causes as more severe than anything a man can suffer In this life, . . . Gregory the Great speaks of those who after this life 'will expiate their faults by purgatorial flames’, and he adds ‘that the pain will be more Intolerable than any one can suffer in this life’. Following in the footsteps of Gregory, St. Thomas teaches that besides the separation of the soul from the sight of God. there Is the other punishment from fire. ... St. Bonaventure not only agrees with St. Thomas but adds that this punishment by fire is more severe than any punishment which comes to men In this life. . . . Scripture and the Fathers command prayers and oblations for the departed, and the Council of Trent In virtue of this tradition not only asserts the existence of purgatory, but adds 'that the souls therein detained are aided by the suffrages of the faithful and principally by the acceptable sacrifice of the altar’ ...

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Apocrypha refers to praying for the dead in view of resurrection hope, not to secure deliverance from purgatory</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Teaching Is Based on Tradition of Men</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The Catholic doctrine of purgatory supposes the fact that some die with smaller faults for which there was no true repentance, and also the fact that the temporal penalty due to sin is at times not wholly paid in this life.

If there be no belief in the power of prayer to afford solace to those who as yet are excluded from the sight of God? . . . prayers for the dead and the existence of a place of purgation are mentioned in conjunction in the oldest passages of the Fathers, who allege reasons for succouring departed souls.”—The </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> (New York; 1911), Vol. xn, p. 576.</span></p>

Is it not the flock that the shepherds ought to feed? . . . The sickened ones you have not strengthened, and the ailing one you have not healed, and the broken one you have not bandaged. and the dispersed one you have not brought back, and the lost one you have not sought to find, but with harshness you have had them In subjection, even with tyranny. . . . Here I am against the shepherds, and I shall certainly ask back my sheep from their hand and make them cease from feeding my sheep, and the shepherds will no longer feed themselves; and I will deliver my sheep out of their mouth, and they will not become food for them.”' ”</span></p>

Hence when you go making gifts of mercy, do not blow a trumpet ahead of you, just as the hypocrites do . . . that they may be glorified by men. Truly I say to you, They are having their reward in full. But you, when making gifts of mercy, do not let your left hand know what your right Is doing, that your gifts of mercy may be tn secret; then your Father who is looking on in secret will repay you. Also, when you pray, you must not be as the hypocrites; because they like to pray standing tn the synagogues and on the corners of the broad ways to be visible to men. Truly I say to you. They are having their reward In fuIL&quot;</span></p>

Therefore his fellow slave fell down and began to entreat him, saying, •Be patient with me and I will pay you back.’ However, he was not willing, but went off and had him thrown into prison until he should pay back what was owing. When, therefore, his fellow slaves saw the things that had happened, they became very much grieved, and they went and maria clear to their master all the things that had happened. Then his master summoned him and said to him, ‘Wicked slave, I canceled all that debt for you. when you entreated me. Ought you not, in turn, to have had mercy on your fellow slave, as I also had mercy on you?’ With that his master, provoked to wrath, delivered him to the jailers, until he should pay back all that was owing.

So the one that had received five talents came forward and brought five additional talents, saying. ■Master, you committed five talents to me; see, I gained five talents more.’ His master said to him. ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things. I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’ Next the one that had received the two talents came forward and said, 'Master, you committed to me two talents; see, I gained two talents more.’ His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things. I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.' Finally the one that had received the one talent came forward and said, ‘Master ... I grew afraid and went oft and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.’ In reply his master said to him, ‘Wicked and sluggish slave, you knew, did you, that I reaped where I did not sow and gathered where I did not winnow? Well, then, you ought to have deposited my silver monies with the bankers, and on my arrival I would be receiving what Is mine with interest.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“To begin with the real ground of the military crown, I think we must first Inquire whether warfare is proper at all for Christians. . . . Shall it be held lawful to make an occupation of the sword, when the Lord proclaims that he who uses the sword shall perish by the sword? And shall the son of peace take part in the battle when it does not become him even to sue at law? And shall he apply the chain, and the prison, and the torture, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">rha</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> punishment, who is not the avenger even of his own wrongs? . . . And shall he keep guard before the temples which he has renounced? . . . Shall he carry a flag, too, hostile to Christ? ... Of course, if faith comes later, and finds any preoccupied with military service, their case is different, as In the instance of those whom John used to receive for baptism, and of those most faithful centurions. I mean the centurion whom Christ approves, and the centurion whom Peter Instructs: yet, at the same time, when a man has become a believer, and faith has been sealed, there must be either an immediate abandonment of it, which has been the course with many; or all sorts of quibbling will have to be resorted to in order to avoid offending God, and that is not allowed even outside of military service. . . . Nowhere does the Christian change his character.” Tertulllan, “The Chaplet,” or &quot;De Corona,&quot; </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Ante-Nicene Fathers,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> edited by Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson, Vol. IIT (Grand Rapids, Mlchj 1957), pp. 99, 100.</span></p>

Stand firm, therefore, with your Joins girded about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness, and with your feet shod with the equipment of the good news of peace. Above all things, take up the large shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the wicked one’s burning missiles. Also, accept the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, that is, God’s word.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Ps. 119:1-7 &quot;Happy are the ones faultless in their way, the ones walking In the law of Jehovah.

No; for with evil things God cannot be tried nor does he himself try anyone. But each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when It has been accomplished, brings forth death.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Gen. 3:1-6 “Now the serpent . . . began to say to the woman: 'Is it really so that God said you must not eat from every tree of the garden’’ At this the woman said to the serpent: ‘Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat. But as for eating of the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden. God has said, &quot;You must not eat from it, no, you must not touch it that you do not die.&quot;' At this the serpent said to the woman: ’You positively will not die.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Some Among Men Continue to Prefer Unrighteousness</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">John 3:19 “Now this is the basis for judgment, that the light has come into the world but men have loved the darkness</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 1:29-32 &quot;Filled as they were with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, injuriousness, being full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malicious disposition, being whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, Insolent, haughty, self-assuming, inventors of Injurious things, disobedient to parents, without understanding, false to agreements, having no natural affection, merciless. Although these know full well the righteous decree of God, that those practicing such things are deserving of death, they not only keep on doing them but also approve those practicing them.’’</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Rother than </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">destroy Satan at once, Jehovah has allowed time to settle for</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> all time the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">issues raised, to magnify his own name and power</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 9:14, 17, 20, 22-24 &quot;What shall we say, then? Is there injustice with God? Never may that become so! For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: 'For this very cause I have let you remain, that in connection with you I may show my power, and that my name may be declared in all the earth.' O man, who, then, really are you to be answering back to God? Shall the thing molded say to him that molded It, 'Why did you make me this way?' If, now, God, although having the will to demonstrate his wrath and to make his power known, tolerated with much long-suffering vessels of wrath made fit for destruction, in order that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory, n</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">amel</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">y, us, whom he called not only from among Jews but also from among nations, what of it?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Job 1:9-12; 2:4-6 &quot;Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘Is it for nothing that Job has feared God? Have not you yourself put up a hedge about him and about his house and about everything that he has all around? The work of his hands you have blessed, and his livestock Itself has spread abroad in the earth. But, for a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch everything he has and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.' Accordingly Jehovah said to Satan: ‘Look! Everything that he has is In your hand. Only against him himself do not thrust out your hand!’&quot; “But Satan answered Jehovah and said: ‘Skin in behalf of skin, and everything that a man has he will give in behalf of his souL For a change, thrust out your hand, please, and touch as far as his bone and his flesh and see whether he will not curse you to your very face.’ Accordingly Jehovah said to Satan: 'There he is in your hand! Only watch out for his soul itself!’” (See also Luke 23:31.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Eccl. 8:1 “The wisdom of a man Itself causes his face to shine, and even the sternness of his face is changed for the better.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Godly wisdom is a protection </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and a guide in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the ways of life</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Eccl 7:12 “Wisdom is for a protection the same as money is for a protection; but the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom itself preserves alive its owners.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Prov. 2:10-13 “When wisdom enters into your heart and knowledge itself becomes pleasant to your very soul, thinking ability Itself will keep guard over you, discernment Itself will safeguard you, to deliver you from the bad way, from the man speaking perverse things, from those leaving</span></p>

Say to wisdom; ‘You are my sister'; and may you </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">call </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">understanding itself ‘Kinswoman,’ to guard you against the woman stranger, against the foreigner who has made her own sayings smooth-”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Prov. 8:11 “For wisdom Is better than corals, and ail other delights themselves cannot be made equal to it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Job 28:12, 15-19 “But wisdom —where can it be found, and where, now, is the place of understanding? Pure gold cannot be given in exchange for it, and silver cannot be weighed out as its price. It cannot be paid for with gold of Ophir, with the rare onyx stone and the sapphire. Gold and glass cannot be compared to it, nor is any vessel of refined gold an exchange for it. Coral and rock crystal themselves will not be mentioned, but a bagful of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">wisdom is</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> worth more than one f</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ull</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> of pearls. The topaz of Cush cannot be com-for even with gold in Its purity.” Worldly Wisdom, Leaving God</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Out of Account, Is Harmful</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 1:19, 2® “it is written: ‘I will make the wisdom of the wise men perish, and the Intelligence of the Intellectual men I will shove aside.' Where is the wise man? Where the scribe? Where the debater of this system of things? Did not God make the wisdom of the world foolish?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 1:22, 23 “Although asserting they were wise, they became foolish and turned the glory of the incorruptible God into something like the image of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed creatures and creeping things.&quot;</span></p>

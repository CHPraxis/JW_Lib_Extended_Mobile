<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Letters to the Corinthians</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE apostle Paul is deeply concerned about the spiritual welfare of the congregation in Corinth. He has heard that there are dissensions among the brothers there. Immorality is being tolerated. The congregation has also written Paul, inquiring about certain matters. So about 55 C.E., when he is in Ephesus during the course of his third missionary journey, Paul writes the first of his two letters to the Corinthians.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The second letter, apparently written only a few months after the first, is a follow-up letter. Since conditions both inside and outside the congregation in first-century Corinth correspond in many ways to our times, the message of Paul’s letters to the Corinthians is of great value to us.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 John 5:19</a>) Hence, he is spoken of as being handed over to Satan.

The Greek word used for “as often as” means “whenever” or “every time that.” Therefore, Paul was saying that every time anointed Christians partake of the Memorial emblems, once a year on Nisan 14, they are “proclaiming the death of the Lord.” They do this “until he arrives,” that is, until he receives them into the heavens by a resurrection.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/52:4:14-52:4:17" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 Thess. 4:14-17</a>.</p>

However, he did not allow any weakness or fear he might have had to interfere with the carrying out of his God-given ministry. Likewise, we should not permit unusual circumstances to hold us back from declaring the good news of God’s Kingdom. We can confidently look to Jehovah for help as did Paul.</p>

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">Paul tells the Corinthians that they should “kindly forgive and comfort” a repentant wrongdoer who has been rebuked.

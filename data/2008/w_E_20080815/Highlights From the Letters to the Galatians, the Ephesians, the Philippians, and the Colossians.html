<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Letters to the Galatians, the Ephesians, the Philippians, and the Colossians</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">UPON hearing that some Christians were being deflected from pure worship by Judaizers, the apostle Paul writes a powerful letter “to the congregations of Galatia.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:1:2-48:1:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gal. 1:2</a>) Written sometime during 50-52 C.E., the letter contains direct counsel and strong exhortation.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Some ten years later while in Rome as a “prisoner of Christ Jesus,” Paul writes to the congregations in Ephesus, in Philippi, and in Colossae, giving them sound advice and loving encouragement. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:3:1-49:3:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eph. 3:1</a>) We today can benefit by paying attention to the message of the Bible books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Since Judaizers craftily seek to discredit Paul, he defends his apostleship by providing certain autobiographical details. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:1:11-48:2:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gal. 1:11–2:14</a>) Counteracting their false teachings, Paul makes the point: “A man is declared righteous, not due to works of law, but only through faith toward Christ Jesus.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:2:16-48:2:16" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Gal. 2:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Christ ‘released by purchase those under law’ and set them free to enjoy Christian freedom, says Paul. He strongly admonishes the Galatians: “Stand fast, and do not let yourselves be confined again in a yoke of slavery.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:4:4-48:4:5" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Gal. 4:4, 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:5:1-48:5:1" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 5:1</a>.</p>

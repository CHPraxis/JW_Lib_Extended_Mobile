<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“Jesus of Nazareth . . . is easily the dominant figure in history.”<wbr />—H. G. Wells, English historian.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">“Christ stands . . . solitary and alone among all the heroes of history.”<wbr />—Philip Schaff, Swiss-born theologian and historian.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">WHO qualifies to be called the greatest man who ever lived? How should a man’s greatness be measured? By his military genius? His physical strength? His mental prowess? Or should it be measured by the extent that his words and deeds affect people and by the example he sets for them?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Note what historians, scientists, scholars, writers, political leaders, and others<wbr />—past and present—<wbr />have said about the man from Nazareth, Jesus Christ:</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“It would require much exotic calculation, however, to deny that the single most powerful figure<wbr />—not merely in these two millenniums but in all human history—<wbr />has been Jesus of Nazareth.”<wbr /><strong>—Reynolds Price, American writer and Bible scholar.</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“A man who was completely innocent offered himself as a sacrifice for the good of others, including his enemies and became the ransom of the world. It was a perfect act.”<wbr /><strong>—Mohandas K. Gandhi, political and spiritual leader of India.</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“As a child, I received instruction both in the Bible and in the Talmud. I am a Jew, but I am enthralled by the luminous figure of the Nazarene.”<wbr /><strong>—Albert Einstein, German-born scientist.</strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">“Jesus Christ, to me, is the outstanding personality of all time, all history, both as Son of God and as Son of Man. <em>Everything He ever said or did has value for us today, and that is something you can say of no other man, alive or dead.”<wbr /></em><strong>—Sholem Asch, Polish-born essayist as quoted in <em>Christian Herald; </em>italics theirs</strong>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">“For thirty five years of my life I was, in the proper acceptation of the word, nihilist, a man who believed in nothing. Five years ago my faith came to me. I believed in the doctrine of Jesus Christ and my whole life underwent a sudden transformation.”<wbr /><strong>—Count Leo Tolstoy, Russian novelist and philosopher.</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">“[Jesus’] life is the most influential ever lived on this planet and its effect continues to mount.”<wbr /><strong>—Kenneth Scott Latourette, American historian and author.</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">“Shall we suppose the evangelic history a mere fiction? Indeed, my friend, it bears not the marks of fiction. On the contrary, the history of Socrates, which nobody presumes to doubt, is not so well attested as that of Jesus Christ.”<wbr /><strong>—Jean-Jacques Rousseau, French philosopher.</strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Clearly, if anyone deserves to be our model in life, it is Jesus Christ. Paul, a learned man of the first century chosen by Jesus to be His follower and to speak about Him to the nations, urges us to <em>“look intently” </em>at Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:12:2-58:12:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:9:3-44:9:3" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Acts 9:3</a>) What can Jesus teach us about how to live? How can his life benefit you?</p>

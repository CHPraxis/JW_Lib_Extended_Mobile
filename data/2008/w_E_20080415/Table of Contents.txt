Purpose of Study Articles
Study Articles 1, 2  PAGES 3-11
These two study articles help us to identify “valueless things,” things that could distract us from serving Jehovah. They highlight dangers that could easily ensnare us, and they give us many reasons for looking to Jehovah for guidance in all things.
Study Articles 3, 4  PAGES 12-20
The first of these two study articles shows young people how the Bible can help them when they have to make life-changing decisions. The second gives them sound Scriptural guidance on such matters as what to bear in mind when thinking of getting married or starting a family.
Study Article 5  PAGES 21-5
The final study article contains a thought-provoking discussion of the book of Ecclesiastes. It highlights the things that really matter in life, contrasting them with the things that are promoted in this world.

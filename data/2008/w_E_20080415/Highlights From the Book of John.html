<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Book of John</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">JOHN<wbr />—“the disciple whom Jesus used to love”—<wbr />is the last person to write an inspired account of Christ’s life and ministry. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:21:20-43:21:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 21:20</a>) Written about 98 C.E., the Gospel of John repeats very little of what is stated in the other three Gospels.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The apostle John wrote his Gospel with a definite objective in mind. Concerning the things that he recorded, he says: “These have been written down that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God, and that, because of believing, you may have life by means of his name.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:20:31-43:20:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 20:31</a>) Its message is indeed of great value to us.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:1:1-43:11:54" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>John 1:1–11:54</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Upon beholding Jesus, John the Baptizer confidently announces: “See, the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:1:29-43:1:29" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 1:29</a>) As Jesus travels through Samaria, Galilee, Judea, and the land east of the Jordan<wbr />—preaching, teaching, and performing powerful works—<wbr />‘many people come to him and put faith in him.’<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:10:41-43:10:42" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 10:41, 42</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">One of the most outstanding miracles that Jesus performs is the resurrection of Lazarus. Many put faith in Jesus when they see a man who has been dead for four days come to life. The chief priests and the Pharisees, however, take counsel to kill Jesus. Hence, Jesus departs and goes to “the country near the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:11:53-43:11:54" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 11:53, 54</a>.</p>

Therefore, the unnamed disciple is evidently the Gospel writer John.</p>

According to the historian Josephus, that work began in the 18th year of Herod’s reign, or in 18/17 B.C.E. The temple sanctuary and other main structures were constructed in eight years. However, the work on the temple complex continued down to and beyond the Passover of 30 C.E., when the Jews said that it took 46 years to build it.</p>

The man whom Jesus cured had been sick for 38 years because of inherited imperfection. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:5:1-43:5:9" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 5:1-9</a>) What Jesus meant was that now that the man had been shown mercy, he must follow the way of salvation and willfully sin no more lest something worse than sickness should befall him. The man could become guilty of committing an unforgivable sin, deserving of death with no resurrection.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:12:31-40:12:32" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 12:31, 32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:12:10-42:12:10" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Luke 12:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:26-58:10:27" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> Heb. 10:26, 27</a>.</p>

They ‘pass over from death to life’ in that the condemnation of death is lifted from them, and they are given the hope of everlasting life because of their faith in God.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:4:3-60:4:6" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:3-6</a>.</p>

For Jesus’ followers, ‘having life in themselves’ means entering into the very fullness of life. Anointed Christians enter into it when they are resurrected to heavenly life. Faithful ones with an earthly hope will experience the fullness of life only after they pass the final test that will occur right after the end of the Millennial Reign of Christ.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:15:52-46:15:53" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:52, 53;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:20:5-66:20:5" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> Rev. 20:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:20:7-66:20:10" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 7-10</a>.</p>

On one occasion in the year 32 C.E., however, Jesus told his apostles: “One of you is a slanderer.” Possibly, at that point Jesus noticed in Judas Iscariot a “beginning,” or start, of a wrong course.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:6:66-43:6:71" data-bid="18-1" class="b">John 6:66-71</a>.</p>

Although Jesus was just beginning his ministry, he was fully aware of the hour, or the time, for his assigned work, including his sacrificial death. Not even a close family member such as Mary could be allowed to interfere with his doing the divine will. We should serve Jehovah God with similar determination.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:1-43:3:9" data-bid="20-1" class="b"><strong>3:1-9</strong></a><strong>. </strong>The example of Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews, teaches us two lessons. First, Nicodemus showed humility, insight, and awareness of his own spiritual need, recognizing a lowly carpenter’s son as a teacher sent by God. Humility is needed by true Christians today. Second, Nicodemus held back from becoming a disciple while Jesus was on earth. Perhaps this was due to fear of man, attachment to his position in the Sanhedrin, or love for his riches. From this we can learn a valuable lesson: We must not allow such leanings to hold us back from ‘picking up our torture stake and continually following Jesus.’<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:9:23-42:9:23" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Luke 9:23</a>.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">As the Passover of 33 C.E. nears, Jesus returns to Bethany. On Nisan 9, he comes to Jerusalem, riding upon the colt of an ass. On Nisan 10, Jesus comes to the temple again. In answer to his prayer for his Father’s name to be glorified, a voice out of heaven says: “I both glorified it and will glorify it again.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:12:28-43:12:28" data-bid="28-1" class="b">John 12:28</a>.</p>

In the Greek language, in which John’s Gospel was written, the word for “helper” is in the masculine gender, but the term for “spirit” is neuter. In recording Jesus’ statement, John therefore used the masculine pronoun, such as “he” or “him,” when referring to what the helper would do. The neuter pronoun “it” was employed when reference was made to what the spirit of the truth would accomplish.</p>

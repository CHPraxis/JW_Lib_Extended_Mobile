New Special Assembly Day Program
The theme of the special assembly day program for the 2009 service year is “Keep Watching the Ministry . . . , That You Fulfill It,” based on Colossians 4:17. As Christians, we take that exhortation seriously. Our aim is to fulfill our ministry faithfully, even as Jesus did. (John 17:4) The apostle Paul too set a sterling example for us in this regard. He was determined to finish his course in the ministry.​—Acts 20:24.
The circuit overseer’s part will show how various publishers are overcoming challenges in their ministry. Then the talk “Cultivate What You Have Planted” will highlight how we can truly help those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life.” (Acts 13:48) The visiting speaker will first discuss 2 Corinthians 6:1-10, verse by verse, in the talk “How We Recommend Ourselves as Ministers.” In the afternoon, he will address the audience on the theme “Highly Esteem Your Ministry.” You will no doubt draw encouragement from the parts “Young and Old Enjoy the Ministry” and “Youths Who Fulfill the Ministry.” Those who wish to symbolize their dedication by water baptism at one of the upcoming circuit events should inform the presiding overseer as soon as possible. A feature of all our assemblies and conventions is consideration of The Watchtower. Bring your copy to be studied the week of the special assembly day.
In watching that we fulfill our ministry, we strive to make sure that other interests and activities do not overshadow what Jehovah has entrusted to us. The Scriptural encouragement provided by means of this special assembly day program should help all of us to appreciate what we need to do to maintain the right focus and to take stock of our ministry with a view to accomplishing it fully.

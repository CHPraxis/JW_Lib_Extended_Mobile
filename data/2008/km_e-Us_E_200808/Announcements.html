<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>August: </strong><em>Worship the Only True God. </em>If the congregation does not have this book in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus on hand that you can use. If that is not possible, offer an appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock. If a Bible study is started, it is recommended that the <em>Bible Teach </em>book be studied. <strong>September: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>Make a special effort to start Bible studies on the initial call. When householders already have this publication, show how they can benefit from it by briefly demonstrating a Bible study. <strong>October: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. Where interest is shown, present and discuss the tract <em>Would You Like to Know More About the Bible? </em>with a view to starting a Bible study. <strong>November: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>Make a diligent effort to start Bible studies.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Congregations should begin requesting the <em>2009 Calendar of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Examining the Scriptures Daily​—2009, </em>and the <em>2009 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses </em>with their next literature request. A listing of the languages in which these items are available will appear in the “Announcement to All Congregations,” which is mailed to all congregations each month.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ The elders are reminded to follow through on instructions given on <a class="xt" data-xtid="12" href="jwpub://p/E:1991286/5:213-22:257">pages 21-23 of the April 15, 1991, <em>Watchtower</em></a> regarding any disfellowshipped or disassociated ones who may be inclined toward becoming reinstated.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ To assist blind and visually impaired publishers and interested persons who use Braille notetakers or computers with screen readers, a provision has been made to supply electronic files of transcribed Braille text of <em>The Watchtower </em>for personal use. Available files include public and study editions of <em>The Watchtower </em>in Grade 2, or contracted, English Braille and study editions of <em>The Watchtower </em>in Grade 1, or noncontracted, French and Spanish Braille. The files will be sent by e-mail to those requesting them. Those desiring to receive Braille text files of <em>The Watchtower </em>should ask the congregation secretary to send a letter to Watchtower, 1000 Red Mills Road, Wallkill, NY 12589-3299, Attention: Braille Desk. The letter should contain the person’s name and home address, the name or type of electronic device used, his e-mail address, and whether he reads English, Spanish, or French Braille. If he cannot receive e-mail, the e-mail address of someone who can receive and transfer files to him should be given.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ On August 28-30, 2008, an inventory will be taken of all literature on hand at Wallkill Bethel. Because of this, no congregation literature requests will be processed for pickup during those days.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">How is it possible to stand firm against those who fiercely oppose true worship? How can we defeat the forces that constantly try to pull us back into the ungodly world? The circuit assembly program for the 2009 service year will answer these vital questions. The theme is “Keep Conquering the Evil With the Good.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:21-45:12:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rom. 12:21</a>) Consider what is in store.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The district overseer will deliver the talks “Fortified to Conquer the Evil With the Good,” “Beware of Overconfidence!,” “All Evil Soon to End!,” and “Strengthening Our Faith to Conquer the World.” The circuit overseer will address us on the themes “Now Is the Season to Stay Awake!,” based on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:11-45:13:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Romans 13:11-13</a>, and “Do Not Show Yourself Discouraged in the Day of Distress,” based on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:24:10-20:24:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 24:10</a>. We also look forward to the circuit overseer’s part “Giving Attention to the Needs of the Circuit.” Another stirring feature will be the part “Can You ‘Be at This Ministry’​—By Pioneering?” The first of two symposiums is entitled “Stand Firm Against the Devil’s Crafty Acts.” It will help us to identify and reject the sly machinations of the Devil in the fields of technology, entertainment, and education. The symposium “Acquire Power to Resist in This Wicked Day” will show us how to apply more fully the inspired counsel found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:10-49:6:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">There is a direct connection between conquering evil at its source and preaching the Kingdom message. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:17-66:12:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rev. 12:17</a>) No wonder Satan relentlessly attacks Jehovah’s Witnesses! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:10-23:43:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isa. 43:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:43:12-23:43:12" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 12</a>) But the Devil will fail miserably because we are determined to “keep conquering the evil with the good.” Make definite arrangements to benefit fully from all four sessions of this circuit assembly.</p>

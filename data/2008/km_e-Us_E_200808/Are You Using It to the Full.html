<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>“I can’t wait to use it in the field!” That is what one sister wrote after reading <em>The Watchtower </em>of January 1, 2008. Have you considered some of the regular features of the public edition, and have you found ways to make good use of them in your field ministry?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>“What We Learn From Jesus”: </strong>Perhaps you have found this feature to be helpful in starting Bible studies. If you have not done so already, try reading the title of the article to the householder and then call attention to what Jesus said about the matter, as related in the first paragraph. When initial interest is shown, endeavor to continue the discussion by using the subheadings, which are set out as thought-provoking questions. Invite the person to comment on the question. Briefly explain any related pictures, and move on to the next paragraph. You may be able to cover the first half of the article on the initial call and then discuss the second half when you return. Be prepared to continue the study in the <em>Bible Teach </em>book.</p>

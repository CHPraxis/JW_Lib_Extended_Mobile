Announcements
▪ Literature offer for August: Worship the Only True God. If the congregation does not have this book in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus on hand that you can use. If that is not possible, offer an appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock. If a Bible study is started, it is recommended that the Bible Teach book be studied. September: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Make a special effort to start Bible studies on the initial call. When householders already have this publication, show how they can benefit from it by briefly demonstrating a Bible study. October: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Where interest is shown, present and discuss the tract Would You Like to Know More About the Bible? with a view to starting a Bible study. November: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Make a diligent effort to start Bible studies.
▪ Congregations should begin requesting the 2009 Calendar of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Examining the Scriptures Daily​—2009, and the 2009 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses with their next literature request. A listing of the languages in which these items are available will appear in the “Announcement to All Congregations,” which is mailed to all congregations each month.
▪ The elders are reminded to follow through on instructions given on pages 21-23 of the April 15, 1991, Watchtower regarding any disfellowshipped or disassociated ones who may be inclined toward becoming reinstated.
▪ To assist blind and visually impaired publishers and interested persons who use Braille notetakers or computers with screen readers, a provision has been made to supply electronic files of transcribed Braille text of The Watchtower for personal use. Available files include public and study editions of The Watchtower in Grade 2, or contracted, English Braille and study editions of The Watchtower in Grade 1, or noncontracted, French and Spanish Braille. The files will be sent by e-mail to those requesting them. Those desiring to receive Braille text files of The Watchtower should ask the congregation secretary to send a letter to Watchtower, 1000 Red Mills Road, Wallkill, NY 12589-3299, Attention: Braille Desk. The letter should contain the person’s name and home address, the name or type of electronic device used, his e-mail address, and whether he reads English, Spanish, or French Braille. If he cannot receive e-mail, the e-mail address of someone who can receive and transfer files to him should be given.
▪ On August 28-30, 2008, an inventory will be taken of all literature on hand at Wallkill Bethel. Because of this, no congregation literature requests will be processed for pickup during those days.

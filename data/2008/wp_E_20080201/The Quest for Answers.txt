The Quest for Answers
“Having solved the question of ‘how’ to make a living, having surrounded ourselves with once unthinkable luxuries—air-conditioned comfort, CD quality sound, and fresh fruit year round—we are left to wonder ‘why’ we live. Why run this rat race? What’s the point?”—David G. Myers, professor of psychology at Hope College, Holland, Michigan, U.S.A.
HOW would you answer the questions raised by this professor? Some may wonder if it is even worth spending time searching for the answers. However, trying to ignore such questions is like trying to ignore a pebble in your shoe—you can continue walking, but your journey will be an unhappy one.
If you have ever wondered whether there is more to life, you are not alone. According to the World Values Survey, one of the largest studies of human values ever conducted, a growing number of people in many countries are thinking about the “meaning and purpose of life.”
If you are to gain genuine peace of mind, you need to find the answers to three big questions.
Where did we come from?
What is the purpose of life?
What does the future hold?
Where can you find reliable answers to these important questions? Rather than offering speculation or philosophy, the following pages will present the answers found in God’s Word, the Bible. We invite you to open your copy of the Bible and find out for yourself what it says.

“It Is Simply Wonderful!”
▪ That is how the director of a marriage survey described the book The Secret of Family Happiness. A couple who had participated in the survey gave him a copy of the book and explained that their study of it had helped them to prepare for marriage.
The survey director wrote to thank the couple for the “wonderful gift” they had sent him. He then expressed his hope that couples like them could teach others “what it takes to make marriages strong and healthy.” He was confident that publications like The Secret of Family Happiness would help the couple deal with differences that might arise. The director noted that this couple has the advantage of a strong faith and reliance on God’s help.
The director explained that he had put the book on his desk and that he shows it to his students when they ask for advice about marriage. “I had never seen this particular book,” he concluded, “and it is simply wonderful!”
The Secret of Family Happiness has benefited thousands of couples around the earth. It can also help you to put into practice Bible principles that can make your family life more enjoyable.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Your Sense of Taste</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Bite into your favorite food, and immediately your sense of taste is activated. But just how does this amazing process work?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Consider: </strong>Your tongue<wbr />—as well as other parts of your mouth and throat—<wbr />includes clusters of skin cells called <em>taste buds. </em>Many are located within papillae on the surface of the tongue. A taste bud contains up to a hundred receptor cells, each of which can detect one of four types of taste<wbr />—sour, salty, sweet, or bitter.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Spicy is in a different category altogether. Spices stimulate pain receptors<wbr />—not taste buds! In any event, taste-receptor cells are connected to sensory nerves that, when stimulated by chemicals in food, instantly transmit signals to the lower brain stem.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Taste, however, involves more than your mouth. The five million odor receptors in your nose<wbr />—which allow you to detect some 10,000 unique odors—<wbr />play a vital role in the tasting process. It has been estimated that about 75 percent of what we call taste is actually the result of what we smell.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Scientists have developed an electrochemical nose that uses chemical gas sensors as an artificial olfaction device. Nevertheless, neurophysiologist John Kauer, quoted in <em>Research/<wbr />Penn State, </em>notes: “Any artificial device is going to be extremely simplistic in comparison to the biology, which is wonderfully elegant and sophisticated.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">No one would deny that the sense of taste adds pleasure to a meal. Researchers are still baffled, though, by what causes people to favor one type of taste over another. “Science may have many of the basics of the human body down,” says <em>Science Daily, </em>“but our sense of taste and smell are still somewhat of a mystery.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>What do you think? </strong>Did your sense of taste come about by chance? Or is this evidence of design?</p>

<div id="fn1" class="fcc"><p id="p10" data-pid="10">In recent years some scientists have added umami to the list. Umami describes the unique salts of glutamic acid. One of them is, among others, the flavor enhancer monosodium glutamate.</p></div>

March 22, 2008—A Day to Remember
The evening before he died, Jesus passed a loaf of unleavened bread and a cup of wine to his apostles and instructed them to eat and drink. He also told them: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”—Luke 22:19.
This year the anniversary of this event falls on Saturday, March 22, after sunset. Jehovah’s Witnesses around the world will be gathered on this special night to observe this Memorial in the manner Jesus commanded. You are most warmly invited to join us as an observer. Please check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the exact time and place of the meeting.

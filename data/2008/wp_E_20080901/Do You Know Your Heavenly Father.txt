Do You Know Your Heavenly Father?
HOW well do you know your father? This question may seem strange if you grew up in a loving family. ‘Of course I know him well!’ you may reply. Yes, most people know what their father likes and dislikes, how he reacts in certain situations, and how he cares for the family.
Still, there might have been times when you were surprised to see a totally unexpected facet of your father’s personality. For instance, a son may know his father as a quiet and mild person—until an emergency occurs. Suddenly, he sees his father as determined and firm in protecting his family.
How about our Creator? Concerning him, we are told: “By him we have life and move and exist.” (Acts 17:28) We owe God our life; in that sense he is Father to all who are living. (Isaiah 64:8) Perhaps that is how you feel about God, and that is good and proper. There is, however, much more about him for us to know and to discover—to our benefit and delight.
Your feelings toward your earthly father and your respect for him depend on how well you know him. Similarly, the better you know God, the more personal your relationship with him becomes. God can help you through life’s trials and pitfalls if you get to know him well and learn to do his will.
What kind of person is God? How should his qualities affect your feelings toward him? Does knowing him place certain responsibilities on you? You will find the answers to these questions in the following article.

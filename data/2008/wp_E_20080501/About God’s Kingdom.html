<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="ss"><strong><em>What is God’s Kingdom?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">God’s Kingdom is a government that will rule the whole earth. Jesus said: “You must pray, then, this way: . . . ‘Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.’”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Daniel 2:44</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong><em>Who will be the rulers of God’s Kingdom?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jesus was born to be the Ruler of God’s Kingdom. An angel told Jesus’ mother: “Jehovah God will give him the throne of David his father, and he will rule as king.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:30-42:1:33" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 1:30-33</a>) Additionally, Jesus chose some of his followers to rule with him. He said to his apostles: “You are the ones that have stuck with me in my trials; and I make a covenant with you, just as my Father has made a covenant with me, for a kingdom.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:22:28-42:22:29" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 22:28, 29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:7:27-27:7:27" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Daniel 7:27</a>) A total of 144,000 of Jesus’ followers will rule along with him.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:5:9-66:5:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 5:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:14:1-66:14:1" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 14:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong><em>Where will the government be located?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">God’s Kingdom will rule from heaven. Jesus said to his disciples: “If I go my way and prepare a place for you [in heaven], I am coming again and will receive you home to myself, that where I am you also may be. . . . I am going my way to the Father.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:14:2-43:14:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 14:2, 3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:14:12-43:14:12" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:7:13-27:7:14" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Daniel 7:13, 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong><em>What will God’s Kingdom do about evil?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Jesus will cleanse the earth of wicked people. Jesus said: “When the Son of man [Jesus] arrives in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit down on his glorious throne. And all the nations <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another . . . And these [wicked ones] will depart into everlasting cutting-off, but the righteous ones into everlasting life.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:25:31-40:25:34" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 25:31-34,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:25:46-40:25:46" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 46</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong><em>Who will live on earth as subjects of the Kingdom?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Jesus said: “Happy are the mild-tempered ones, since they will inherit the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:5-40:5:5" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 5:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Psalm 37:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:72:8-19:72:8" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 72:8</a>) The earth will be filled with people who are even now learning to love one another. Jesus said to his followers: “I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:13:34-43:13:35" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 13:34, 35</a>.</p>

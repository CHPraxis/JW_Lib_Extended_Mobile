<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The situation seemed hopeless. About three million men, women, and children were trapped on the west bank of the Red Sea! Enraged and humiliated by the Ten Plagues that Jehovah had brought upon the Egyptians, Pharaoh and his military force rushed forward like hungry lions eager to pounce upon some helpless prey. The Israelites were terrified. “Do not be afraid,” cried Moses, “stand firm and see the salvation of Jehovah. . . . Jehovah will himself fight for you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:14:13-2:14:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ex. 14:13, 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In an awe-inspiring display of power, Jehovah delivered his people by parting the Red Sea. How often Jehovah has rescued his people in the face of supposedly impossible odds! Today Jehovah continues to fight for his servants, as you will see in the many experiences contained in this <em>Yearbook. </em>May the yeartext for 2008, quoted above, strengthen your faith in all of Jehovah’s promises and fortify your trust in his loving direction.</p>

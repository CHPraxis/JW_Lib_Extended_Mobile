<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE following report for the past service year is not simply a compilation of cold facts. Rather, it is a reflection of the love and devotion of godly men, women, and children throughout the earth. Yes, this report provides insight into the sacrifices made by our brothers and sisters, showing the effort and resources expended to preach the good news “to the most distant part of the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:8-44:1:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 1:8</a>) Such sacrifices, whether large or small, are precious to Jehovah God and his Son, Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:50:14-19:50:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 50:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:1-42:21:4" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Luke 21:1-4</a>) The annual report also reminds us that this lifesaving work can only be done “on the strength that God supplies.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:11-60:4:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:11</a>) Hence, as you meditate on the report and the experiences that follow, may you “go on acquiring power in the Lord and in the mightiness of his strength.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:10-49:6:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eph. 6:10</a>.</p>

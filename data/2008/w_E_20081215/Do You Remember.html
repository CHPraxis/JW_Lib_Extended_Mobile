<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">As with a spoken language, to speak the “pure language” fluently, we need to listen carefully, imitate fluent speakers, memorize the names of Bible books and some Bible verses, repeat things we learn, read aloud, analyze the grammar, or pattern of truth, work at progressing, assign study times, and practice “speaking” the pure language.<wbr />—8/15, pages 21-25.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>• What are some things involved in knowing what God is like?</strong></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/21:4:12-21:4:12" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Eccl. 4:12</a>) When applied to marriage, it includes the husband and wife, two strands, who are intertwined with the central strand, God.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Letters of John and of Jude</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">LIKELY written in 98 C.E. from Ephesus, the three letters of the apostle John are among the last of the books making up the inspired Scriptures. The first two letters encourage Christians to keep walking in the light and to fight against the encroachment of apostasy. In the third one, John not only speaks of walking in the truth but also encourages Christian cooperation.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In his letter written from Palestine, probably in 65 C.E., Jesus’ half brother Jude warns fellow Christians about wicked ones who had slipped into the congregation, and he gives advice about how to resist bad influences. Paying attention to the message of the three letters of John and of Jude’s epistle can help us to remain strong in the faith despite obstacles.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Intended for the entire association of those in union with the Christ, John’s first letter provides sound counsel designed to help Christians take their stand against apostasy and remain firm for the truth and for righteousness. He stresses the need to keep walking in the light and in love and by faith.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“If we are walking in the light as [God] himself is in the light,” John writes, “we do have a sharing with one another.” And since God is the Source of love, the apostle says: “Let us continue loving one another.” While “the love of God” moves us to “observe his commandments,” we conquer the world through “our faith” in Jehovah God, his Word, and his Son.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:1:7-62:1:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 John 1:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:4:7-62:4:7" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 4:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:5:3-62:5:4" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 5:3, 4</a>.</p>

On the basis of that sacrifice, God could extend mercy, and he could pardon the sins of those who exercise faith in Jesus.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 3:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:6:23-45:6:23" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Rom. 6:23</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:13:34-43:13:34" data-bid="7-1" class="b">John 13:34</a>) He refers to it as “old” because Jesus gave it over 60 years before John penned his first inspired letter. Thus, the believers have had it “from the beginning” of their lives as Christians. The commandment is also “new” in that it goes beyond ‘loving one’s fellow as oneself’ and calls for self-sacrificing love.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:19:18-3:19:18" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Lev. 19:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:15:12-43:15:13" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> John 15:12, 13</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:4:2-62:4:2" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 John 4:2</a>) Deceivers do not confess this coming in the flesh.

We Are Overturning Strongly Entrenched Things
1 For centuries, using false teachings and deception, Satan has built barriers in the hearts and minds of many people. He has propagated such doctrines as the Trinity, the immortality of the soul, and hellfire. He promotes doubt about the existence of a Creator and skepticism about the authenticity of the Bible. Racism and nationalism are other formidable barriers to the light of truth. (2 Cor. 4:4) How can we overturn such strongly entrenched beliefs?​—2 Cor. 10:4, 5.
2 Emotions Involved: Long-held religious beliefs often involve a person’s deepest emotions. Some have held to erroneous beliefs since childhood. To help such ones, we need to speak in a way that demonstrates respect for their viewpoint.​—1 Pet. 3:15.
3 We can dignify such individuals by allowing them to explain what they believe and why. (Jas. 1:19) Perhaps they hold to the belief that the soul is immortal because they have lost loved ones in death and long to see them again. Or they may celebrate holidays because they cherish the opportunities these afford to be with their family. Listening to their expressions will give us insight into their feelings and help us to respond in an effective manner.​—Prov. 16:23.
4 Imitate Jesus: Jesus provided an excellent example for us when he responded to questions from a man versed in the Law. Jesus did not give direct answers, which the man may have rejected because of cherished beliefs. Instead, Jesus referred to the Scriptures, invited him to express his view, and helped him to reason by means of an illustration.​—Luke 10:25-37.
5 Strongly held false religious beliefs are in no way equal to the truth of God’s Word. (Heb. 4:12) By patiently appealing to the heart, we may be able to help people to reject falsehood and embrace the truth that can set them free.​—John 8:32.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>July: </strong><em>Keep on the Watch! </em>If the congregation does not have this brochure in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus on hand that you can use. If that is not possible, offer another appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock. <strong>August: </strong><em>Worship the Only True God. </em>If the congregation does not have this book in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus on hand that you can use. If that is not possible, offer an appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock. If a Bible study is started, it is recommended that the <em>Bible Teach </em>book be studied. <strong>September: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>Make a special effort to start Bible studies on the initial call. When householders already have this publication, show how they can benefit from it by briefly demonstrating a Bible study. <strong>October: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. Where interest is shown, present and discuss the tract <em>Would You Like to Know More About the Bible? </em>with a view to starting a Bible study.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Since August has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ Starting in September, circuit overseers will give the public talk entitled “Walk in the Way of Integrity.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ The branch office does not fill individual publishers’ requests for literature. The presiding overseer should arrange for an announcement to be made <em>each month </em>before the congregation monthly request for literature is sent to the branch office, so that all interested in obtaining personal literature items may advise the brother handling literature. Please keep in mind which publications are special-request items.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ The annual inventory of all literature on hand should be taken on or as close as possible to August 31, 2008. This inventory is similar to the actual count taken monthly by the literature coordinator. The secretary of the coordinating congregation should supervise the inventory. He and the presiding overseer of the coordinating congregation should verify the quantities for accuracy. <em>Please submit your inventory via the jw.org Web site no later than September 6. </em>Additional information will be forthcoming.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ The <em>Bible Teach </em>book should be used to start and conduct Bible studies rather than the <em>Require </em>brochure. The <em>Require </em>brochure may continue to be placed in the field ministry until supplies are depleted.</p>

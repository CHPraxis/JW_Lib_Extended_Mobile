<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>January: </strong><em>Keep on the Watch! </em>Congregations that do not have a supply of such brochures may offer any 192-page book printed on paper that discolors or any book published prior to 1991 with the exception of <em>Creation, Mankind’s Search for God</em>, and <em>Young People Ask</em>. <strong>February: </strong><em>Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? </em>As an alternative offer, you may use <em>The Secret of Family Happiness</em>. <strong>March: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>Make a diligent effort to start Bible studies. <strong>April: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. A special effort will be made to visit newly interested ones who attended the Memorial or the special public talk but who are not actively associated with the congregation. The purpose of such visits should be to start a home Bible study with those who have not yet accepted one.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Since March has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ Starting in February, and no later than March 2, the new public talk for circuit overseers will be “Where Can You Get Help in Times of Distress?”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ Congregations should make appropriate arrangements to observe the Memorial this year on Saturday, March 22, after sundown. Although the talk may start earlier, the passing of the emblems <em>should not begin until after sundown. </em>Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. Each congregation should try to hold its own Memorial observance. However, this may not always be possible. Where a number of congregations normally use the same Kingdom Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the use of another facility for that evening. Where possible, we suggest a minimum of 40 minutes between the programs so that all may benefit fully from some association after the Memorial. Consideration should also be given to traffic conditions and parking, including the dropping off and picking up of passengers. The body of elders should decide what arrangements would be best locally.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ Congregation secretaries should make sure that they have a pioneer appointment letter (S-202) for each regular pioneer in the congregation. If they do not, please inform the branch office in writing.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ Beginning the week of August 4, 2008, we will study <em>Live With Jehovah’s Day in Mind </em>at the Congregation Book Study.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ For those who wish to make donations to the worldwide work electronically, a set of instructions is available to explain this arrangement. For further information, call (718) 560-5000 or write to Watchtower, Attn: Treasurer’s Office, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201-2483.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">▪ U.S. Selective Service regulations require that all men under the age of 26 who are (1) citizens and have reached 18 years of age or (2) noncitizens who move to the United States must register within 30 days. From the time a man registers until he turns 26, he must notify Selective Service within ten days of any change of address. Compliance with this law is a Christian’s obligation to the superior authorities. Elders should remind those to whom this applies or will soon apply of their duty to register.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">▪ A packet of legal material is available to assist publishers who are involved in lawsuits over child custody and visitation matters in which our religion is under attack. The packet should be requested by the <em>body of elders only </em>in a case in which it is evident that the publisher’s religious beliefs will be at issue. For those facing secular issues on child custody or visitation, helpful information can be found in <a class="xt" data-xtid="15" href="jwpub://p/E:101997881/1-4:393$p/E:101997882/$p/E:101997883/"><em>Awake! </em>of December 8, 1997, pages 3-12;</a> in <a class="xt" data-xtid="18" href="jwpub://p/E:101988760/1-4$p/E:101988761/$p/E:101988762/$p/E:101988763/"><em>Awake! </em>of October 22, 1988, pages 2-14;</a> and on the chart found in <a class="xt" data-xtid="22" href="jwpub://p/E:101991282/26:93-29:84"><em>Awake! </em>of April 22, 1991, page 9</a>.</p>

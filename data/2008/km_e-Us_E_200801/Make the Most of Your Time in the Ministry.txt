Make the Most of Your Time in the Ministry
1 There is certainly much to be accomplished in our ministry, and the time left is reduced. (John 4:35; 1 Cor. 7:29) With good organization and advance planning, we can make the most of the time we have scheduled for the ministry.
2 Be Prepared: Before going to the meeting for field service, make sure that you have the literature you will need and have your presentation well in mind. After the meeting is closed with prayer, go directly into the field. This will allow you and those working with you to accomplish as much as possible in the time available for field service.
3 If you are assigned to conduct the meeting for field service, begin on time. Keep the meeting brief​—no more than 10 to 15 minutes. Before you dismiss the group, make sure that each one knows where and with whom he is going to work.
4 While in the Ministry: Once the meeting for field service ends, do not linger unnecessarily, but begin making your way to the territory. If you anticipate having to leave the territory early, perhaps you can arrange for your own transportation so that the rest of the group does not have to leave early. When working with a group, be considerate of the others who may be waiting for you to finish a discussion. That could involve withdrawing tactfully from a person who is argumentative or arranging to call back on one who is interested.​—Matt. 10:11.
5 When making return visits, you can avoid unnecessary travel by caring for calls in one neighborhood before going to another. It may be possible to telephone certain individuals to make sure that they will be home. (Prov. 21:5) If you anticipate a lengthy visit, arrangements can be made for those in your group to preach nearby or to make another return visit.
6 We are living in the time of a great spiritual harvest. (Matt. 9:37, 38) Soon the work will end. Therefore, our desire should be to make good use of our time while in the ministry.

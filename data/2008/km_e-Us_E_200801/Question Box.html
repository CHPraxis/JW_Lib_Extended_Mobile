<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ <strong>What two publications should be studied with interested ones?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The <em>Bible Teach </em>book is our main tool for starting and conducting Bible studies. While there is no objection if another publication, such as an appropriate tract, is used to start a study, efforts should be made to switch to the <em>Bible Teach </em>book as soon as possible. Exceptional results have been obtained by using the <em>Bible Teach </em>book to start studies.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Once the <em>Bible Teach </em>book has been completed and the student is making progress, the <em>Worship God </em>book should then be studied. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:7-51:2:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Col. 2:7</a>) Page 2 explains that book’s purpose: “The Bible urges all who love God to ‘grasp mentally . . . [the] height and depth’ of his precious truths. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:3:18-49:3:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ephesians 3:18</a>) To that end, this book has been prepared. We hope that it will help you to grow spiritually and to be better equipped to walk the narrow road leading to life in God’s righteous new world.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If the student qualifies for baptism before completing both books, the study should continue until the second book is finished. Even though the student is baptized, the conductor may count the time, the return visit, and the Bible study. A publisher who accompanies the conductor and participates may also count the time.</p>

Overcoming Teenage Depression
STUDENTS taking an English course in Mexico were asked to prepare a talk on a subject of their choice. Maritza explains: “I had been going through a period of depression, and the series of articles ‘Help for Depressed Teens,’ in Awake! of September 8, 2001, had helped me. So I used the information in the magazine, and my talk was graded excellent. Afterward, I gave the students and the teachers a copy of that series.”
Two years later, while engaging in the Christian ministry, Maritza visited a student who was taking the same English course. To Maritza’s surprise, the student showed her a copy of the Awake! series on teenage depression. It seems that the teacher values it so much that she gives each of her students a copy!
More information on teenage depression can be obtained in the book Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work. Its chapters include “Why Don’t I Like Myself?,” “Why Do I Get So Depressed?,” and “How Can I Make My Loneliness Go Away?” You may request a copy by filling in the accompanying coupon and mailing it to the address shown on the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.

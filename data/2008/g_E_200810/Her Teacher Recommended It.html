<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Where can young ones find sound counsel and guidance? Thirteen-year-old Cheren, in Italy, enjoyed the book <em>Questions Young People Ask<wbr />—Answers That Work. </em>Recently, she had the opportunity to share her enthusiasm with her classmates.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I am in eighth grade,” she explains, “and in class we had been discussing problems unique to adolescents. One day my teacher approached me, saying she had heard that our publications provide help for young people. She asked me if I could get her some material. So I gave her the <em>Young People Ask </em>book.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“A few days later, she used the book, focusing a class discussion on chapter 10, entitled ‘How Important Are Looks?’ She even assigned homework based on the ‘Questions for Discussion’ at the end of the chapter. She said, ‘This book has been written so well, it’s a shame you don’t all have a copy.’</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“I said that I would provide copies for any who were interested, and 16 classmates asked for them. When I delivered the books, even students who initially said they weren’t interested changed their minds and now wanted one!”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The <em>Young People Ask </em>book also has such chapters as “Why Do I Get So Depressed?,” “How Do I Know If It’s Real Love?,” “Why Say No to Drugs?,” and “How Can I Control My TV Viewing Habits?” You may request a copy by filling in the accompanying coupon and mailing it to the address shown on the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">What book, do you think, really lives up to the above description? A woman in Colorado, U.S.A., received the brochure entitled <em>A Book for All People, </em>which describes what the Bible contains and why it is an important book for everyone to read today. In a brief note expressing thanks for the brochure, she wrote:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Simply enjoyed it. Read it to the finish. Just could not stop reading it. It brings out all the highlights of God’s Word, providing a beautiful understanding of how the Bible and science agree. The brochure tells how the Bible was translated so all people could read it and also how it has survived.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Indeed, the Bible is the most remarkable book ever written, having a greater circulation than any other book in history. Even though the Bible was completed some 2,000 years ago, it is scientifically accurate and its teachings are a practical guide for modern-day living.</p>

A Book for All People
What book, do you think, really lives up to the above description? A woman in Colorado, U.S.A., received the brochure entitled A Book for All People, which describes what the Bible contains and why it is an important book for everyone to read today. In a brief note expressing thanks for the brochure, she wrote:
“Simply enjoyed it. Read it to the finish. Just could not stop reading it. It brings out all the highlights of God’s Word, providing a beautiful understanding of how the Bible and science agree. The brochure tells how the Bible was translated so all people could read it and also how it has survived.”
Indeed, the Bible is the most remarkable book ever written, having a greater circulation than any other book in history. Even though the Bible was completed some 2,000 years ago, it is scientifically accurate and its teachings are a practical guide for modern-day living.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Book of Acts</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE Bible book of Acts provides a comprehensive history of the establishment of the Christian congregation and its subsequent expansion. Written by the physician Luke, it presents a dynamic account of Christian activity over a period of some 28 years<wbr />—from 33 C.E. to 61 C.E.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The first part of Acts is primarily about the activity of the apostle Peter, and the latter part is about that of the apostle Paul. By using such pronouns as “we” and “us,” Luke indicates that he was present when certain events occurred. Paying attention to the message of the book of Acts will heighten our appreciation for the power of God’s written Word and his holy spirit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>) It will also move us to be self-sacrificing and will build up our faith in the Kingdom hope.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>PETER USES “THE KEYS OF THE KINGDOM”</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:1:1-44:11:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Acts 1:1–11:18</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">After receiving the holy spirit, the apostles give a bold witness. Peter uses the first of “the keys of the kingdom of the heavens” to open the door of knowledge and opportunity for Jews and proselytes who “embraced his word” to enter the Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:16:19-40:16:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 16:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:5-44:2:5" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Acts 2:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:41-44:2:41" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 41</a>) A wave of persecution scatters disciples, but this results in expansion of the preaching work.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Upon hearing that Samaria has accepted the word of God, the apostles in Jerusalem dispatch Peter and John to them. By opening up the Kingdom opportunity to the Samaritans, Peter uses the second key. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:8:14-44:8:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 8:14-17</a>) Perhaps within a year of Jesus’ resurrection, an amazing transformation takes place in Saul of Tarsus. In 36 C.E., Peter uses the third key, and the free gift of the holy spirit is poured out upon uncircumcised people of the nations.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:10:45-44:10:45" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 10:45</a>.</p>

Nevertheless, they desired to remain there longer in order to learn more about their new faith and to bear witness to others. To help such ones, some Christians sold their property, and the funds were distributed to the needy.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:5:34-44:5:39" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>5:34-39</strong></a><wbr /><strong>—How could Luke know what Gamaliel had said in a closed session of the Sanhedrin? </strong>There are at least three possibilities: (1) Paul, formerly a student of Gamaliel, informed Luke; (2) Luke consulted a sympathetic member of the Sanhedrin, such as Nicodemus; (3) Luke received this information through divine inspiration.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">In 44 C.E., Agabus comes to Antioch, where Barnabas and Saul have been teaching “for a whole year.” Agabus foretells “a great famine,” which takes place two years later. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:11:26-44:11:28" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Acts 11:26-28</a>) “After having fully carried out the relief ministration in Jerusalem,” Barnabas and Saul return to Antioch.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:13:1-44:13:4" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Acts 13:1-4</a>) In 48 C.E., they return to Antioch, “where they had been entrusted to the undeserved kindness of God.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:14:26-44:14:26" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Acts 14:26</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Some nine months later, Paul (also known as Saul) selects Silas as his companion and sets out on his second tour. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:15:40-44:15:40" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Acts 15:40</a>) Timothy and Luke join Paul along the way. Luke stays in Philippi as Paul continues on to Athens and then to Corinth, where he meets Aquila and Priscilla and spends a year and six <span id="page32" class="pageNum" data-no="32" data-before-text="32"></span>months. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:18:11-44:18:11" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Acts 18:11</a>) Leaving Timothy and Silas in Corinth, Paul takes Aquila and Priscilla with him and sails away for Syria early in 52 C.E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:18:18-44:18:18" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Acts 18:18</a>) Aquila and Priscilla accompanied him as far as Ephesus, where they remained.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">After spending some time in Syrian Antioch, Paul embarks upon his third tour, in 52 C.E.

After being arrested, he gives a fearless witness before the authorities. In Rome, the apostle is placed under house arrest for two years (c. 59-61 C.E.), and from there he finds ways to preach about the Kingdom and teach “the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:28:30-44:28:31" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Acts 28:30, 31</a>.</p>

However, this incident apparently had a good outcome in that it led to Sosthenes’ conversion to Christianity. Later, Paul speaks of Sosthenes as “our brother.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:1:1-46:1:1" data-bid="34-1" class="b">1 Cor. 1:1</a>.</p>

Moreover, the Scriptures are silent as to whether the vow was made before or after Paul’s conversion or if he was starting or ending the vow. Whatever was the case, the taking of such a vow was not sinful.</p>

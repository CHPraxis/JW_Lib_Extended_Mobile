<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses consists of dedicated men who are anointed servants of God. They act as representatives of the faithful and discreet slave class, which has the responsibility of providing spiritual food and giving direction and impetus to the Kingdom-preaching work throughout the earth.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:45-40:24:47" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 45-47</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Governing Body meetings are held each week, usually on Wednesday. This enables these brothers to work together in unity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:133:1-19:133:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ps. 133:1</a>) The members of the Governing Body also serve on various committees. In caring for Kingdom interests, each committee has its area of oversight, as briefly outlined below.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ COORDINATORS’ COMMITTEE: This committee is made up of the coordinator of each of the other Governing Body committees and a secretary who is also a member of the Governing Body. It makes sure that all the committees operate smoothly and efficiently. It also concerns itself with major emergencies, persecutions, disasters, and other urgent matters affecting Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ PERSONNEL COMMITTEE: The brothers on this committee have been entrusted with oversight of the arrangements for the personal and spiritual welfare and assistance of Bethel family members earth wide. This committee oversees the selecting and inviting of new members of Bethel families and handles questions regarding their Bethel service.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ PUBLISHING COMMITTEE: This committee supervises the printing, publishing, and shipping of Bible literature worldwide. It has oversight of printeries and properties owned and operated by the various corporations used by Jehovah’s Witnesses. This committee arranges for the best use of funds donated for the worldwide Kingdom work.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ SERVICE COMMITTEE: Those on this committee have oversight of the preaching work and matters affecting congregations, pioneers, elders, and traveling overseers. It supervises the preparation of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>and calls in Gilead School and Ministerial Training School students, later giving them postgraduate assignments.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ TEACHING COMMITTEE: This committee oversees the instruction provided at assemblies, conventions, and congregation meetings. It arranges spiritual programs for Bethel family members and has oversight of various schools, such as Gilead School and the Pioneer Service School, as well as of the development of audio and video programs.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">▪ WRITING COMMITTEE: It is the responsibility of this committee to supervise the putting of spiritual food into written form for publication and distribution to fellow believers and the general public. This committee answers Bible questions and approves such material as drama scripts and talk outlines. It also oversees the translation work done worldwide.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The apostle Paul likened the congregation of anointed ones to a human body and emphasized the important places occupied by all members as well as their interdependency, love, and cooperation in doing God-given work. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:12:4-45:12:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rom. 12:4, 5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:12:12-46:12:31" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 12:12-31</a>) The Head, Jesus Christ, supplies the body members with what is needed for good cooperation, coordination, and spiritual nourishment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:4:15-49:4:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eph. 4:15, 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:2:19-51:2:19" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Col. 2:19</a>) In such respects, the Governing Body is organized to take the lead as Jehovah directs them by holy spirit.</p>

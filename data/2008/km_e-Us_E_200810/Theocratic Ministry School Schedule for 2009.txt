Theocratic Ministry School Schedule for 2009
INSTRUCTIONS
During 2009 the following will be the arrangements for conducting the Theocratic Ministry School.
SOURCE MATERIAL: New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures [bi12], “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial” (1990 Edition) [si], Learn From the Great Teacher [lr], and Reasoning From the Scriptures (1989 Edition) [rs].
The school should begin ON TIME with remarks of welcome and then proceed as outlined below. After each part, the school overseer will introduce the next part.
HIGHLIGHTS FROM BIBLE READING: 10 minutes. For the first four minutes, a qualified elder or ministerial servant should consider Scriptural points from the weekly Bible reading. The exception to this will be when the weekly Bible reading begins with the opening chapter of a Bible book. On such occasions, material for the first four minutes should be taken from the “All Scripture” book. For example, the first five chapters of Genesis will be considered the week of January 5, so the speaker should select a few key points from the introductory paragraphs on the book of Genesis as found in the “All Scripture” book. He should apply the material in a way that will be beneficial to the congregation. Whether discussing the weekly Bible reading or points from the “All Scripture” book, the principal objective is to help the audience to appreciate why and how the information is of value. The speaker should be careful not to exceed the four minutes allotted for the opening portion. He should ensure that six minutes are set aside for the audience to offer brief comments of 30 seconds or less on what they have appreciated in the weekly Bible reading. The school overseer will then dismiss the students who are assigned to other classrooms.
ASSIGNMENT NO. 1: 4 minutes or less. This is a reading to be given by a brother. The student should read the assigned material without giving an introduction or a conclusion. The school overseer will be especially interested in helping students to read with understanding, fluency, proper sense stress, modulation, appropriate pausing, and naturalness.
ASSIGNMENT NO. 2: 5 minutes. This will be assigned to a sister. The student will either be given a setting or may select one from the list appearing on page 82 of Benefit From Theocratic Ministry School Education. The assigned theme should be used and be applied to an aspect of field service that is realistic and practical for the local territory. When no references are indicated as source material, the student will need to gather material for this part by doing research in our publications. The school overseer will be particularly interested in the way the student develops the material and the way she helps the householder to reason on the Scriptures and to understand the key points of the presentation. The school overseer will assign one assistant.
ASSIGNMENT NO. 3: 5 minutes. This may be assigned to a brother or a sister. The student should develop the assigned theme. When no references are indicated as source material, the student will need to gather material for this part by doing research in our publications. When assigned to a brother, this part should be given as a talk with the Kingdom Hall audience in mind. When a sister is given this part, it should always be presented as outlined for Assignment No. 2. Please note that themes with an asterisk next to them should always be assigned to brothers to develop as talks, and whenever practical, an elder or a ministerial servant should be used.
COUNSEL: 1-2 minutes. The school overseer will not announce in advance the speech quality that a student is working on. After Assignments No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3, the school overseer will offer positive observations on an aspect of the presentation that was commendable, drawing attention to specific reasons why it was effective and referring frequently to the Ministry School textbook. According to the need of each student, additional constructive counsel may be given privately after the meeting or at another time.
TIMING: No part should go overtime, nor should the remarks of the counselor. Assignments No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 should tactfully be stopped when the time is up. If brothers handling highlights from the Bible reading go overtime, they should be given private counsel. All should watch their timing carefully. Total program: 30 minutes.
COUNSEL FORM: In Ministry School textbook.
AUXILIARY COUNSELOR: The body of elders may select a capable elder, if one is available in addition to the school overseer, to handle the assignment as auxiliary counselor. If there are a number of elders in the congregation, then a different qualified elder may care for this assignment each year. The auxiliary counselor’s responsibility will be to give private counsel, if needed, to brothers who present Bible highlights. It is not necessary that he offer counsel after each of such talks by fellow elders or by ministerial servants.
THEOCRATIC MINISTRY SCHOOL REVIEW: 20 minutes. Every two months, the school overseer will conduct a review. It will be preceded by highlights from the Bible reading as outlined above. The review will be based on material considered in the school during the preceding two months, including the current week. If your congregation has a circuit assembly or the visit of the circuit overseer during the week of the Theocratic Ministry School Review, then the review should be postponed one week and Assignments No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 of the following week’s schedule should be used. No changes should be made in the schedule of the weekly Bible reading or the presentation of Bible highlights.

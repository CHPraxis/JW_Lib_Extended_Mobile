<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa"><strong>NOTE: </strong>A Service Meeting will be scheduled in <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>for each week during the summer months. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the “Guided by God’s Spirit” District Convention. Where appropriate, use 15 minutes on the last Service Meeting before attending the convention to repeat counsel and reminders from this month’s insert that apply locally. A month or two following your convention, set aside 15 to 20 minutes on a Service Meeting (perhaps using a local needs portion) for a review of points from the convention that the publishers have found to be helpful in the ministry. The service overseer should handle the review. Invite the audience to comment on how they are applying or plan to apply that information in their ministry.</p>

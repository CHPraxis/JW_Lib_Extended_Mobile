<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>April and May</strong>: The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. A special effort should be made to visit newly interested ones who attended the Memorial or the special public talk but who are not actively associated with the congregation. The purpose of such visits should be to start a home Bible study with those who have not yet accepted one. <strong>June: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>Make a diligent effort to start Bible studies. <strong>July: </strong><em>Keep on the Watch! </em>If the congregation does not have this brochure in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus on hand that you can use. If that is not possible, offer another appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Beginning in April, district convention badge cards for 2008 will automatically be included with literature shipments. It will not be necessary to request these. If additional badge cards are needed by the congregation, these should be requested using the jw.org Web site or, if that is not possible, by submitting the <em>Literature Request Form </em>(S-14). Plastic badge card holders must be requested for any in the congregation who desire them.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ Congregation secretaries should maintain an adequate supply of the forms <em>Application for Regular Pioneer Service </em>(S-205) and <em>Application for Auxiliary Pioneer Service </em>(S-205b). These may be requested by using the jw.org Web site or, if that is not possible, by submitting the <em>Literature Request Form </em>(S-14). Maintain at least a one-year supply. Before sending regular pioneer application forms to the branch office, make sure they are completely filled out.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ Since the operating hours of the Bethel switchboard have changed, it is no longer possible to call the branch office from 11:55 a.m. on Saturday to 8:00 a.m. on Monday, eastern time, to obtain information regarding Kingdom Hall locations and meeting times. Publishers should consider their needs for such information in advance and call the branch office during regular working hours (on weekdays from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. and on Saturdays from 8:00 a.m. to 11:55 a.m.). Or some may choose to consult an electronic telephone directory on the Internet. Congregation secretaries should confirm that their Kingdom Hall information is accurately listed in the local telephone directory.​—See the June 1996 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>Question Box.</p>

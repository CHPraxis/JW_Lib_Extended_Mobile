<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Letters to Titus, to Philemon, and to the Hebrews</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">SOME time after being released from his first imprisonment in Rome in 61 C.E., the apostle Paul visits the island of Crete. Noting the spiritual condition of the congregations there, he leaves Titus behind to strengthen them. Later, likely from Macedonia, Paul writes a letter to Titus to guide him in his duties and to give apostolic backing to his work.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Earlier, shortly before his release from prison in 61 C.E., Paul wrote a letter to Philemon, a Christian brother living in Colossae. It is a personal plea to a friend.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In about 61 C.E., Paul also wrote a letter to the Hebrew believers in Judea, which shows the superiority of Christianity over the Jewish system. All three letters contain valuable counsel for us.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">After providing guidance for the making of “appointments of older men in city after city,” Paul counsels Titus to “keep on reproving [the unruly] with severity, that they may be healthy in the faith.” He admonishes all in the congregations in Crete “to repudiate ungodliness . . . and to live with soundness of mind.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/56:1:5-56:1:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Titus 1:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/56:1:10-56:1:13" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 10-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/56:2:12-56:2:12" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 2:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Paul gives further counsel to help the brothers in Crete to remain spiritually healthy. He instructs Titus to “shun foolish questionings . . . and fights over the Law.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/56:3:9-56:3:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Titus 3:9</a>.</p>

To a person whose thinking is in harmony with God’s standards, such things are clean. It is the opposite with someone whose thinking is distorted and whose conscience is defiled.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

They are ‘made new by holy spirit’ because they have become “a new creation” as spirit-begotten sons of God.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:5:17-47:5:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Cor. 5:17</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Philemon is commended for being an example in “love and faith.” His being a source of refreshment to fellow Christians has given Paul “much joy and comfort.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/57:1:4-57:1:5" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Philem. 4, 5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/57:1:7-57:1:7" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 7</a>.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Setting an example for all overseers, Paul handles the sensitive matter about Onesimus by giving, not an order, but exhortation “on the basis of love.” He tells Philemon: “Trusting in your compliance, I am writing you, knowing you will even do more than the things I say.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/57:1:8-57:1:9" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Philem. 8, 9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/57:1:21-57:1:21" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 21</a>.</p>

Likely, Onesimus also stole from his master to finance this 900-mile <strong>[1,400 km] </strong>journey. Indeed, he was useless to Philemon. In Rome, though, Onesimus was helped by Paul to become a Christian. Now a spiritual brother, this formerly “useless” slave became “useful.”</p>

<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">To prove that faith in Jesus’ sacrifice is superior to works of Law, Paul highlights the excellency of Christianity’s Founder, his priesthood, his sacrifice, and the new covenant. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:3:1-58:3:3" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Heb. 3:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:7:1-58:7:3" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 7:1-3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:7:22-58:7:22" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> 22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:8:6-58:8:6" data-bid="25-4" class="b"> 8:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:9:11-58:9:14" data-bid="25-5" class="b"> 9:11-14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:9:25-58:9:26" data-bid="25-6" class="b"> 25, 26</a>) This knowledge certainly must have helped Hebrew Christians to deal with the persecution that they suffered at the hands of the Jews.

<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">How important is faith under the Christian arrangement? “Without faith it is impossible to please [God] well,” writes Paul.

However, from the start of Satan’s course of wickedness in Eden, his lies have caused death because Adam sinned and passed sin and death on to the human family. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Rom. 5:12</a>) Furthermore, Satan’s earthly agents have persecuted servants of God to the point of death, even as they did Jesus. But that does not mean that Satan has limitless power to kill anyone he wants. If that were so, he would no doubt have wiped out Jehovah’s worshippers long ago. Jehovah protects his people as a group and does not <span id="page32" class="pageNum" data-no="32" data-before-text="32"></span>allow Satan to exterminate them.

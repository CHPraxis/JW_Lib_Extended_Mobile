<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Though less than an inch in length <strong>[2 cm]</strong>, the bombardier beetle is noted for its unique defense mechanism. When threatened, the insect sprays boiling, foul-smelling liquid and steam from its posterior, warding off spiders, birds, and even frogs.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Consider: </strong>This beetle is equipped with “a pair of glands which open at the tip of [its] abdomen.” Each of these has a reservoir that stores an acidic compound and hydrogen peroxide as well as a reaction chamber filled with enzymes dissolved in water. To protect itself, the insect can squeeze the solution from the reservoirs into the reaction chambers to trigger a chemical reaction. The result? Noxious chemicals, water, and steam<wbr />—at a temperature of about 212 degrees Fahrenheit <strong>[100°C]</strong>—<wbr />are sprayed onto an attacker. The chambers are less than a sixteenth of an inch <strong>[less than 1 mm] </strong>long, yet the beetle can change the speed, direction, and consistency of its toxic spray.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Researchers have studied the bombardier beetle to learn how to develop more effective and ecologically-sound mist systems. They have discovered that the beetle not only uses one-way inlet valves to allow chemicals into the reaction chambers but also has a pressure-relief valve to expel them. Engineers hope to use spray technology based on the bombardier beetle in car engines and fire extinguishers, as well as in medical drug-delivery devices, such as inhalers. Professor Andy McIntosh of the University of Leeds, England, says: “Nobody had studied the beetle from a physics and engineering perspective as we did<wbr />—and we didn’t appreciate how much we would learn from it.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>What do you think? </strong>Did the bombardier beetle’s complex system of valves, combustion, and explosion develop by chance? Or was it designed?</p>

Cured by “a Very Old Book”
▪ One of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Brazil, South America, was calling on people at their homes when she met a lady who told her that her mother-in-law had been cured by a book. Curious, the Witness asked what book it was. “It’s a very old book,” the lady said, and she brought out her son’s well-worn copy of My Book of Bible Stories.
The woman explained that her mother-in-law had suffered from depression and had been so afraid of death and of being in the dark that she wouldn’t leave her bed. The lady’s son had obtained the Bible Stories book and began to read it to his grandmother. The grandmother became so encouraged and built up by what her grandson read that she was freed from her problem.
The Witness relates: “When I told the lady that the book was printed by Jehovah’s Witnesses and that I could obtain a new copy for her, she asked me to bring two of them—one for her mother-in-law and one for herself. When I delivered the books, she asked for more. In time, she obtained 16 copies of the book for her friends!”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ One of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Brazil, South America, was calling on people at their homes when she met a lady who told her that her mother-in-law had been cured by a book. Curious, the Witness asked what book it was. “It’s a very old book,” the lady said, and she brought out her son’s well-worn copy of <em>My Book of Bible Stories.</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The woman explained that her mother-in-law had suffered from depression and had been so afraid of death and of being in the dark that she wouldn’t leave her bed. The lady’s son had obtained the <em>Bible Stories </em>book and began to read it to his grandmother. The grandmother became so encouraged and built up by what her grandson read that she was freed from her problem.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Witness relates: “When I told the lady that the book was printed by Jehovah’s Witnesses and that I could obtain a new copy for her, she asked me to bring two of them<wbr />—one for her mother-in-law and one for herself. When I delivered the books, she asked for more. In time, she obtained 16 copies of the book for her friends!”</p>

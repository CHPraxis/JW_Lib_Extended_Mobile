<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>God’s Word abounds with spiritual treasures that we cherish. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:12:6-19:12:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 12:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:11-19:119:11" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 119:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:14-19:119:14" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 14</a>) On a particular occasion, Jesus used illustrations depicting different aspects of the Kingdom, and then he asked his disciples: “Did you get the sense of all these things?” Upon receiving an affirmative reply, he said to them: “That being the case, every public instructor, when taught respecting the kingdom of the heavens, is like a man, a householder, who brings out of his treasure store things new and old.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:1-40:13:52" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 13:1-52</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Bible truths that we learned when we first began studying can be viewed as old treasures. By means of our progressive personal study of the deeper things of God’s Word, we find other Bible truths, which to us are newfound treasures. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:7-46:2:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Cor. 2:7</a>) Also, through “the faithful and discreet slave,” we come to understand new treasures.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:45" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>We highly esteem these spiritual treasures, old and new. This moves us to seek to receive training and gain experience as instructors of God’s Word, generously sharing with others precious truths we have learned.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>Learn From Jesus’ Example: </strong>Demonstrating how he felt about these treasures, Jesus went to great lengths to share them with others. Even when he was tired, he did not stop bringing treasures out of his “storehouse.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:6-43:4:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 4:6-14</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Jesus’ love for those in a poor spiritual condition motivated him to share the life-giving treasures of God’s truths. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:13-19:72:13" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 72:13</a>) He felt pity for those with spiritual hunger and was moved to “teach them many things.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:34-41:6:34" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mark 6:34</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup><strong>Imitate Jesus: </strong>When we highly esteem the treasures we have, we will, like Jesus, be eager to show people spiritual gems directly from the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:1-20:2:5" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Prov. 2:1-5</a>) Although at times we may be tired, we will speak about Scriptural truths with heartfelt enthusiasm. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:6:34-41:6:34" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Mark 6:34</a>) Our deep appreciation of the treasures we have will move us to extend ourselves in the ministry, always seeking to have a fuller share.</p>

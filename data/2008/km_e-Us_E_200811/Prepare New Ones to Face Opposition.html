<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>When individuals begin studying the Bible and ‘desire to live with godly devotion,’ they become special targets of Satan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:12-55:3:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:12</a>) Opposition can come from workmates, schoolmates, or neighbors. It can be especially trying when well-meaning relatives oppose new ones.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:21-40:10:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 10:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:3:21-41:3:21" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Mark 3:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Opposition Foretold: </strong>New ones must understand that persecution is to be expected and that it is an indication of their becoming genuine disciples of Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:20-43:15:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 15:20</a>) At times, opposition from others may be due to misconceptions about Jehovah’s Witnesses. Keep in mind that great joy comes from being dishonored for being a follower of Jesus and for obeying God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:27-44:5:29" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 5:27-29,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:40-44:5:41" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 40, 41</a>) Assure new ones of Jehovah’s loving support. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:27:10-19:27:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 27:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:29-41:10:30" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Mark 10:29, 30</a>) Maintaining their integrity puts them on Jehovah’s side of the issue of universal sovereignty.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Prov. 27:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Role of Accurate Knowledge: </strong>Impress upon your Bible students the importance of continuing to take in accurate knowledge despite the trials they may be facing. Through opposition, Satan tries to prevent what they are learning from taking root in their figurative heart. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:23-20:4:23" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Prov. 4:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:13-42:8:13" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Luke 8:13</a>) They must keep taking in accurate knowledge of God’s Word so as to become firmly rooted in the faith.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:1:2-19:1:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 1:2, 3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:6-51:2:7" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Col. 2:6, 7</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>Need for Endurance: </strong>In any trialsome situation, endurance is essential and can produce fine results. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:16-42:21:19" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 21:16-19</a>) When new ones endure opposition, they benefit themselves and others. They experience Jehovah’s ability to bless richly those who faithfully endure.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:12-59:1:12" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Jas. 1:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>The apostle Paul rejoiced in the spiritual progress of his brothers in Thessalonica. He thanked God for them, many of whom he had aided into the truth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:1:3-53:1:5" data-bid="11-1" class="b">2 Thess. 1:3-5</a>) We too can experience the same joy and satisfaction if we prepare our Bible students to face opposition and endure.</p>

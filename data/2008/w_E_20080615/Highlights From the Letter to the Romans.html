<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Letter to the Romans</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">ABOUT 56 C.E., while on his third missionary journey, the apostle Paul arrives in the city of Corinth. He has come to know of differences in viewpoint between Jewish and Gentile Christians in Rome. Desiring to bring them into complete unity in the Christ, Paul takes the initiative to write them a letter.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In that letter to the Romans, Paul explains how humans are declared righteous and how such individuals should live. The letter enriches our mind with the knowledge of God and his Word, stresses God’s undeserved kindness, and exalts Christ’s role in our salvation.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>DECLARED RIGHTEOUS<wbr />—HOW?</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:1:1-45:11:36" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Rom. 1:1–11:36</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,” writes Paul. “It is as a free gift that they are being declared righteous by [God’s] undeserved kindness through the release by the ransom paid by Christ Jesus.” Paul also says: “A man is declared righteous by faith apart from works of law.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:3:23-45:3:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rom. 3:23, 24,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:3:28-45:3:28" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 28</a>) Through faith in “one act of justification,” both anointed Christians and members of the “great crowd” of “other sheep” can be “declared righteous”<wbr />—the former for life in heaven as joint heirs with Christ and the latter as God’s friends, with a view to surviving “the great tribulation.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:18-45:5:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 5:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Rev. 7:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:14-66:7:14" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="4-4" class="b"> John 10:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:2:21-59:2:24" data-bid="4-5" class="b"> Jas. 2:21-24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:25:46-40:25:46" data-bid="4-6" class="b"> Matt. 25:46</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“Shall we commit a sin because we are not under law but under undeserved kindness?” asks Paul. “Never may that happen!” he answers. “You are slaves . . . , either of sin with death in view or of obedience with righteousness in view,” Paul explains. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:6:15-45:6:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rom. 6:15, 16</a>) “If you put the practices of the body to death by the spirit, you will live,” he says.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:8:13-45:8:13" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rom. 8:13</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:1:24-45:1:32" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>1:24-32</strong></a><wbr /><strong>—Did the degradation described here apply to the Jews or to the Gentiles? </strong>Although the description could fit either group, Paul was specifically referring to the apostate Israelites of old. Even though they knew God’s righteous decree, “they did not approve of holding God in accurate knowledge.” They were thus reprehensible.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:3:24-45:3:25" data-bid="8-1" class="b"><strong>3:24, 25</strong></a><wbr /><strong>—How could “the ransom paid by Christ Jesus” cover “the sins that occurred in the past” before it was paid? </strong>The first Messianic prophecy, recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a>, found fulfillment in 33 C.E. when Jesus was put to death on a torture stake. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:3:13-48:3:13" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Gal. 3:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:3:16-48:3:16" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 16</a>) The moment Jehovah uttered that prophecy, however, the ransom price was as good as paid from his viewpoint, for nothing can prevent God from fulfilling what he purposes. So on the basis of the future sacrifice of Jesus Christ, Jehovah could forgive the sins of descendants of Adam who exercised faith in that promise. The ransom also makes possible a resurrection of those of pre-Christian times.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:24:15-44:24:15" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 24:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:6:3-45:6:5" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>6:3-5</strong></a><wbr /><strong>—What is meant by baptism into Christ Jesus and baptism into his death? </strong>When Jehovah anoints followers of Christ with the holy spirit, they are united with Jesus and become members of the congregation that is the body of Christ, he being the Head. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:12:12-46:12:13" data-bid="13-1" class="b">1 Cor. 12:12, 13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:12:27-46:12:27" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:1:18-51:1:18" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> Col. 1:18</a>) This is their baptism into Christ Jesus. Anointed <span id="page30" class="pageNum" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span>Christians are also “baptized into [Christ’s] death” in that they live a life of sacrifice and renounce any hope of everlasting life on earth. Their death, therefore, is a sacrificial one, as was Jesus’ death, though their death does not have ransoming value. This baptism into Christ’s death is completed when they die and are resurrected to life in heaven.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:7:8-45:7:11" data-bid="14-1" class="b"><strong>7:8-11</strong></a><wbr /><strong>—How did ‘sin receive inducement through the commandment’? </strong>The Law helped people to realize the full range, or scope, of sin, making them more conscious of being sinners. Consequently, they saw themselves as sinners in more ways, and more people were exposed as sinners. It can thus be said that sin received inducement through the Law.</p>

By having a zealous share in the Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work, we can help others find God to be true.</p>

Branch Letter
Dear Kingdom Publishers:
An announcement presented during morning worship on Monday, February 4, 2008, brought enthusiastic applause. It read: “Over the past weekend, presiding overseers have arrived from various congregations throughout the United States. They are now at Patterson to attend the first class of the School for Congregation Elders.”
Students enjoy upbuilding association with the Bethel family. They also attend morning worship each day, as well as the Bethel family Watchtower Study on Monday evening. A highlight of the school occurs on the last day when special lectures are delivered by a member of the United States Branch Committee and a member of the Governing Body.
Many expressions of appreciation have been received from the elders who have attended. One brother commented: “Being at Bethel for a week was so encouraging!” Another wrote: “I now feel heartened to fulfill my responsibilities with a renewed sense of zeal.” The present curriculum covers various aspects of the responsibilities of presiding overseers and will enable them to serve the needs of the congregation more effectively. (Acts 20:28) We rejoice in this loving provision and look forward to meeting the brothers who have yet to attend.
Your brothers,
United States Branch Office

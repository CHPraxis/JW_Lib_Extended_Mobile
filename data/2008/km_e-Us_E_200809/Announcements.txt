December: The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. If individuals say they have children, offer Learn From the Great Teacher.
▪ Since November has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.
▪ The special public talk for the 2009 Memorial season will be given during the week of April 20, 2009. The subject of the talk will be announced later. Those congregations having the visit of the circuit overseer or an assembly that weekend will have the special talk the following week. No congregation should have the special talk before April 20.
▪ Congregations should begin requesting bound volumes of The Watchtower and Awake! for 2008, Watch Tower Publications Index 2008, and Watchtower Library​—2008 Edition on CD-ROM with their next literature request. A listing of the languages in which these items are available will appear in the “Announcement to All Congregations,” which is mailed each month. Please note that Watchtower Library​—2008 Edition is a provision for members of the congregation and is made available only through the congregation. Publishers who make extensive use of Watchtower Library and no longer use bound volumes should consider whether they need to request the bound volumes.
▪ Someone designated by the presiding overseer should audit the congregation’s accounts for the months of June, July, and August. The same person should not be used for consecutive audits. When the audit is complete, an announcement should be made to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.​—See Instructions for Congregation Accounting (S-27).
▪ The Annual Congregation Property Documents Review Work Sheet (TO-33) and Safety Inspection Work Sheet (TO-34) are to be completed each September. Copies of the completed forms should be promptly provided to the body of elders for each congregation that meets in the Kingdom Hall as well as to the Regional Building Committee. If corrective actions are needed, the elders should care for these. When the circuit overseer visits the congregation, he will review both work sheets.
▪ If you are admitted to a hospital and want visiting local elders and, in larger cities, elders serving on a Patient Visitation Group to have access to your name, what must you do? When identifying yourself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, you should also explain that you are willing to have a minister of Jehovah’s Witnesses visit you. A federal law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), protects your privacy, but with your consent, the law allows for the elders to learn of your admission and provide spiritual encouragement.

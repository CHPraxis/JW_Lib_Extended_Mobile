“Reap Blessings Through Jehovah’s Spirit-Guided King”
▪ “Man has dominated man to his injury.” That statement, found in the Bible at Ecclesiastes 8:9, aptly describes the history of human rulership. Can we do better? Or is the pattern of the past the template for the future? Those questions will be discussed in the public discourse to be delivered at the 2008/2009 “Guided by God’s Spirit” District Conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses. The talk, entitled “Reap Blessings Through Jehovah’s Spirit-Guided King,” will focus on the one person who will rule with true justice and love—Jesus Christ, who gave his life in our behalf.—Matthew 20:28.
What makes Jesus different from all other rulers? God’s prophet Isaiah answers: “Upon him the spirit of Jehovah [God] must settle down, the spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the spirit of counsel and of mightiness, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Jehovah; and there will be enjoyment by him in the fear of Jehovah. And he will not judge by any mere appearance to his eyes, nor reprove simply according to the thing heard by his ears. And with righteousness he must judge the lowly ones, and with uprightness he must give reproof in behalf of the meek ones of the earth.”—Isaiah 11:2-4.
Does that description appeal to you? If so, you are invited to attend the public address at one of the hundreds of district conventions that will be held around the world beginning this month. To find the location nearest you, contact Jehovah’s Witnesses in your area or write to the publishers of this magazine at one of the addresses listed on page 5. The March 1, 2008, issue of our companion magazine, The Watchtower, lists convention locations in the United States.

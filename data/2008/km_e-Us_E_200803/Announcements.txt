Announcements
▪ Literature offer for March: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Make a diligent effort to start Bible studies. April and May: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. A special effort will be made to visit newly interested ones who attended the Memorial or the special public talk but who are not actively associated with the congregation. The purpose of such visits should be to start a home Bible study with those who have not yet accepted one. June: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Make a diligent effort to start Bible studies.
▪ Congregations should release the latest issues of The Watchtower and Awake! as soon as they are received. This will allow publishers to become familiar with the contents before offering the magazines in field service.
▪ Someone designated by the presiding overseer should audit the congregation’s accounts for the months of December, January, and February. The same person should not be used for consecutive audits. When the audit is complete, an announcement should be made to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.​—See Instructions for Congregation Accounting (S-27).
▪ The theme for the 2008 district conventions is “Guided by God’s Spirit.” The April issue of Our Kingdom Ministry will furnish helpful detailed information for finalizing your personal plans for attending all sessions of this three-day convention. If you need to request time off from your employment in order to be present all three days, do not hesitate to do so.
▪ Immediately after the Memorial, the total attendance and number of partakers should be submitted to the branch office using the jw.org Web site. If this is not possible, a letter may be sent. When multiple congregations meet together, only one congregation should submit the total attendance figure.
▪ It is important that groups of 20 or more planning to visit the United States branch office facilities at Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill first correspond by mail with the Central Tour Desk at 100 Watchtower Drive, Patterson, NY 12563-9204.

▪ Literature offer for December: The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. If individuals say they have children, offer Learn From the Great Teacher. January: What Does the Bible Really Teach?

February: Offer one of the following, as available: Is There a Creator Who Cares About You?, The Secret of Family Happiness, or The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s? March: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Make a diligent effort to start Bible studies.
▪ The video program The Bible​—Mankind’s Oldest Modern Book will be considered at a Service Meeting in March. If needed, copies of the DVD The Bible​—A Book of Fact and Prophecy—​On DVD, which contains this program, should be requested through the congregation as soon as possible.
▪ Please note that the Memorial for the year 2010 will be on Tuesday, March 30, after sundown. This advance notice is given so that brothers may make necessary reservations or contracts for available halls when there are several congregations using the Kingdom Hall and other facilities must be found. In such instances, the elders should have an agreement with the management ensuring that there will be no disturbances from other activities in the building so that the Memorial observance can proceed in a peaceful and orderly manner.
▪ The Memorial invitations for 2009 in the primary language of each congregation will soon be sent. If other languages are spoken in your territory and you would like a supply of invitations in those languages, these should be requested as soon as possible by using the jw.org Web site or, if that is not possible, by submitting the Literature Request Form (S-14). A listing of the languages in which Memorial invitations are available will appear in the “Announcement to All Congregations,” which is mailed each month. Please request only those languages needed for your territory.
▪ As a reminder, all congregations should notify the branch office of their meeting times as they will be on January 1. If this has not been done, the congregation secretary should immediately do so by using the jw.org Web site or, if that is not possible, by sending a letter.
▪ The presiding overseer should arrange for the congregation’s accounts to be audited for the months of September, October, and November. The same person should not be used for consecutive audits. When the audit is complete, an announcement should be made to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.​—See Instructions for Congregation Accounting (S-27).
▪ The secretary of each congregation holding title to property should review paragraphs 42-44 in the form entitled Information Regarding Ownership of Kingdom Halls (TO-36). Even after real-estate tax exemption has been obtained, an annual filing is required in some states. Check carefully with your local tax assessor’s office to confirm whether any action is required. All taxes and assessments are to be paid within the time provided. If any tax or assessment is questioned, promptly follow through on the matter so that either it is removed or a proper challenge is filed within the applicable time limit.

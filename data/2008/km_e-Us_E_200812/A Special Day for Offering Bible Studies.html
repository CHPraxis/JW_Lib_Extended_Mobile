<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Beginning in January, each congregation will designate one weekend every month, perhaps the first one, to concentrate on offering Bible studies. This would be either a Saturday or a Sunday, according to what is best locally. On that day if householders decline to accept such an offer, publishers may still offer the <em>Bible Teach </em>book or place the latest magazines. All elders and ministerial servants should arrange to have a full share in this activity and assist publishers to start Bible studies.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>The Congregation Service Committee will determine on which weekend a day will be set aside to offer Bible studies. Periodic reminders should be given so that publishers can prepare and put forth special effort to offer Bible studies from house to house and when visiting those who previously showed interest.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>How to Prepare: </strong>We can find suggestions for starting Bible studies in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:202006003/">January 2006 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>insert</a> and on <a class="xt" data-xtid="2" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989202/26:137-36:131">page 12 of the <em>Reasoning</em></a> book. Some may choose to use a tract, such as <em>Would You Like to Know the Truth? </em>Also, <a class="xt" data-xtid="3" href="jwpub://p/E:202007285/1-12">page 3 of the August 2007 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry</em></a> gives suggestions for starting Bible studies when visiting those who accepted the magazines. Elders and ministerial servants will be scheduled to conduct a brief 10- to 15-minute meeting for field service, during which one or two practical suggestions for starting Bible studies should be discussed or demonstrated.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Of course, not everyone will accept a Bible study or continue their study over an extended period. This should not cause us to hold back, since it is Jehovah who is drawing sheeplike ones to his organization. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:44-43:6:44" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 6:44</a>) Our responsibility is not just to sow seeds of truth but also to cultivate and water what has taken root, and that includes studying the Bible with righthearted ones. By so doing, we exercise the privilege of being God’s fellow workers.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:9-46:3:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:9</a>.</p>

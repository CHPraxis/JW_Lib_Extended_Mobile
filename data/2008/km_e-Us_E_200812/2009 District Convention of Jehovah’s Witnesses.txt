2009 District Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses
 1. (a) What blessings will we enjoy by attending all three days of the district convention? (b) What plans should we make now?
1 All of us look forward to the 2009 district convention and the new opportunities to gather with fellow praisers of Jehovah, who are “conscious of their spiritual need.” (Matt. 5:3) With Jehovah’s day fast approaching, we urge each one to be in attendance for all three days so as to benefit fully from the warm Christian fellowship as well as the spiritual encouragement to stand firm in the faith. (Zeph. 1:14) Let teachers and employers know that the convention is an essential part of your worship. Courageously make your plans early and seek Jehovah’s blessing; you can be sure of his support.​—Isa. 50:10.
 2. What international flavor might we anticipate even if we have not been invited to attend an international convention?
2 International Conventions: Since these conventions will be held in a limited number of countries and cities, only those assigned should attend. Our cooperation with this arrangement will prevent overcrowding. (1 Cor. 14:40; Heb. 13:17) However, a good number of district conventions will have an international flavor, since many missionaries, Bethelites in foreign service, and international servants will be attending a convention in their home country.
 3. How can we manifest Christian love to some in our congregation?
3 Helping Others Attend: Do some in your congregation need assistance to attend the convention? When you help others to do so, you are “keeping an eye, not in personal interest upon just your own matters, but also in personal interest upon those of the others.”​—Phil. 2:4.
4, 5. If circumstances require that you attend a convention other than the one to which your congregation is assigned, how should you proceed?
4 Obtaining Information: To reduce telephone calls to the branch office regarding convention dates and locations, please first consult the March 1, 2009, issue of The Watchtower or your congregation secretary for the information you need.
5 If you will attend a convention other than the one to which your congregation is assigned, you may obtain a Recommended Lodging List by writing to the rooming headquarters’ address, located on the back of the current Special Needs Room Request form. These forms will soon be sent to congregation secretaries. To receive a reply, be sure to include a stamped, self-addressed envelope with your letter.
 6. What is the procedure to follow when a publisher with special needs requests assistance with accommodations?
6 Special Needs: When a publisher requests assistance in obtaining accommodations, the Congregation Service Committee should determine if the publisher qualifies to submit a Special Needs Room Request form. They should review the guidelines on the form and in the December 14, 2008, letter addressed to all bodies of elders before the congregation secretary sends the form to the Rooming Department.
 7. (a) How may we proceed with making a hotel reservation? (b) What reminders will assist us in keeping a good reputation with hotel management? (See box “Rooming Instructions.”)
7 Making Your Hotel Reservation: The Recommended Lodging List of available hotels will be posted on the information board at the conclusion of your Service Meeting for the week of January 5. Before making your hotel reservation, carefully review the box “Rooming Instructions.” When making your hotel reservation:
▪ Call hotels during daytime business hours using the phone numbers on the list.
▪ Inform the hotel that you are attending the convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
▪ Provide the dates you will check in and check out.
▪ If all rooms are booked, call another hotel on the list.
▪ Make your reservation, and request a confirmation number.
▪ Make your deposit within ten days by credit card, check, or money order. If a deposit is made by check or money order, write the confirmation number on the front. Never send cash.
 8. How can we assist all to obtain a hotel room at a reasonable rate?
8 We realize that some may have their own preference regarding hotels. However, when we use hotels not listed on the Recommended Lodging List or accept a rate higher than what is listed, we undermine the rooming arrangement. Please do not reserve rooms that you do not plan to use or cancel a hotel reservation at the last minute in order to use a different hotel. By cooperating with this arrangement, you will assist everyone to obtain a hotel room at a reasonable rate.​—1 Cor. 10:24.
 9. What should be our primary concern as we prepare for and attend the 2009 district convention?
9 Works That Glorify God: When we demonstrate the fruitage of the spirit in all our affairs, giving particular attention to our speech and demeanor when dealing with hotel staff and others in the convention city, we add to the good reputation of Jehovah’s people and avoid stumbling others. (1 Cor. 10:31; 2 Cor. 6:3, 4) May your attendance and conduct glorify God in such ways at the 2009 district convention!​—1 Pet. 2:12.

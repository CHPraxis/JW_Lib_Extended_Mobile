<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="qu"> 1. How did the apostle Paul and Jesus teach others?</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[9]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>The apostle Paul endeavored to ‘reason from the Scriptures.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:2-44:17:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 17:2, 3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:19-44:18:19" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 18:19</a>) In so doing, he imitated Jesus, who frequently quoted the Scriptures and used illustrations to help his listeners understand God’s will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:1-40:12:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 12:1-12</a>) The book <em>Reasoning From the Scriptures </em>has been designed to help us do the same.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[11]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Overcoming Conversation Stoppers: </strong>Why not anticipate the conversation stoppers that may arise in your territory and take a few minutes before preaching to review <a class="xt" data-xtid="31" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989203/2:1051-58">pages 16-21</a> for a potential reply? Will some householders likely be Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, or Muslims? If so, the information on <a class="xt" data-xtid="32" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989203/53:143-70">pages 21-24</a> will be helpful.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="qu"> 4. How may we use the <em>Reasoning </em>book when a question or a controversial subject is raised?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[12]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>Answering Questions: </strong>The <em>Reasoning </em>book can also assist us when a question or a controversial subject is raised. You may simply tell the person that you would like to show him something interesting that you have on the subject and take out your <em>Reasoning </em>book. Since the subjects are listed in alphabetical order, turn to the main heading that you think will have the information you need. Then scan the questions in boldface type. If you do not quickly see what you are looking for, turn to the index at the back. Once you find the appropriate information, read it directly from the publication. If you are discussing a specific scripture, you may find what you need on <a class="xt" data-xtid="33" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989281/1-114">page 445</a> under “Scriptures Often Misapplied.”</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[13]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong>Other Uses: </strong>Some keep a copy of the <em>Reasoning </em>book at their job or at school to help them answer questions such as, ‘Why don’t you celebrate holidays?’ Youths have found the information under the headings <a class="xt" data-xtid="34" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989218/">“Creation”</a> and <a class="xt" data-xtid="35" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989226/">“Evolution”</a> helpful in preparing school reports.

The <em>Reasoning </em>book also has helpful information for those preparing talks and conducting meetings for field service.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[14]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>When preaching, our goal is not to win arguments; neither is it simply to convey information. We want to reason skillfully from the Scriptures. As we make good use of the <em>Reasoning </em>book, we show that we are paying constant attention to our teaching.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:16-54:4:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:16</a>.</p>

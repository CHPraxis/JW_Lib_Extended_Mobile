<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ A woman’s father died when she was only 12 years old. For many years thereafter, she struggled with anxiety and depression. In a letter to the Canada branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses, she explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I didn’t find comfort until I read the brochure <em>When Someone You Love Dies </em>and it walked me through the grieving process. I still cry when I think of how much I miss my father. But since reading, meditating, praying, and allowing myself to cry as I read the brochure and scriptures, I don’t hurt as much as I used to, and I can now find comfort in God’s promises.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I hold the words and scriptures on the pages of this brochure dear to my heart, as they were instrumental in gluing together my broken heart. I feel whole again. I recommend this brochure as the best guide through the grieving process.”</p>

Guidance Through the Grieving Process
▪ A woman’s father died when she was only 12 years old. For many years thereafter, she struggled with anxiety and depression. In a letter to the Canada branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses, she explained:
“I didn’t find comfort until I read the brochure When Someone You Love Dies and it walked me through the grieving process. I still cry when I think of how much I miss my father. But since reading, meditating, praying, and allowing myself to cry as I read the brochure and scriptures, I don’t hurt as much as I used to, and I can now find comfort in God’s promises.
“I hold the words and scriptures on the pages of this brochure dear to my heart, as they were instrumental in gluing together my broken heart. I feel whole again. I recommend this brochure as the best guide through the grieving process.”

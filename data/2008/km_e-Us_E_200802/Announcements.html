<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>February: </strong><em>Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? </em>As an alternative offer, you may use <em>The Secret of Family Happiness</em>. <strong>March: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>Make a diligent effort to start Bible studies. <strong>April and May</strong>: The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. A special effort will be made to visit newly interested ones who attended the Memorial or the special public talk but who are not actively associated with the congregation. The purpose of such visits should be to start a home Bible study with those who have not yet accepted one.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Since March has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ The secretary and the service overseer should review the activity of all regular pioneers. If any are having difficulty meeting the hour requirement, the elders should arrange for assistance to be given.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ The special public talk for the 2008 Memorial season will be entitled “Who Is Qualified to Rule Mankind?” See the related announcement in the October 2007 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry.</em></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ The secretary should see that the Regional Building Committee is kept up-to-date on the status of all baptized publishers who have submitted <em>Kingdom Hall Volunteer Worker Questionnaire </em>(S-82) forms. When there are adjustments in a volunteer’s status, such as when one moves or is appointed as a ministerial servant or an elder, a new form should be filled out promptly and submitted. If a volunteer’s mailing address or telephone number changes or if he is no longer approved as a volunteer worker, the elders should immediately inform the Regional Building Committee by letter. The completed forms in the congregation file should be made available for the circuit overseer’s review when he visits the congregation.</p>

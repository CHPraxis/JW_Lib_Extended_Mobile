<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="qu">1, 2. What reasons do we have to remember the ransom with appreciation?</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[9]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>In obedience to Jesus’ command, Christians around the world will meet after sundown on Saturday, March 22, 2008, to commemorate the death of Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:19-42:22:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 22:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:11:23-46:11:26" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 11:23-26</a>) We are moved to do so out of deep appreciation for all that was accomplished on that date 1,975 years ago. By maintaining perfect integrity through a painful death on a torture stake, Jesus sanctified his Father’s name, providing the ultimate answer to Satan’s taunts.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:11-18:1:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 1:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Prov. 27:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[9]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Jesus’ shed blood validated the new covenant, enabling imperfect humans to be adopted as God’s sons with the prospect of ruling with Christ in his heavenly Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:31:31-24:31:34" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jer. 31:31-34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:14:24-41:14:24" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Mark 14:24</a>) Furthermore, the depth of God’s love for mankind was clearly manifested in the giving of his dearly loved Son in sacrifice, as Jesus himself had explained to Nicodemus.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 3:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="qu"> 3. How will those attending the Memorial benefit?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[10]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Invite Others: </strong>The January issue of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>suggested making a list of acquaintances and extending personal invitations. Have you started inviting those on your list? Are you making arrangements to share fully in the campaign that will begin on March 1 to invite people to the Memorial? Those attending will hear Scriptural information that can build faith in the ransom, which in turn leads to everlasting life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:17-45:10:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rom. 10:17</a>.</p>

Considering the important events that occurred during the final days of Jesus’ earthly life will help you to prepare your heart for the Memorial observance. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:7:10-15:7:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezra 7:10</a>) Prayerfully meditating on these Bible accounts will deepen your appreciation for the love of Jehovah and his Son in providing the ransom.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:143:5-19:143:5" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 143:5</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Letters of James and of Peter</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">NEARLY 30 years after Pentecost of 33 C.E., the disciple James<wbr />—a half brother of Jesus—<wbr />writes a letter to “the twelve tribes” of spiritual Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:1-59:1:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jas. 1:1</a>) His objective: to exhort them to be strong in faith and to show endurance when facing trials. He also provides counsel to correct disturbing conditions that have developed in the congregations.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Just prior to Roman Emperor Nero’s campaign of persecution in 64 C.E., the apostle Peter writes his first letter addressed to Christians, encouraging them to stand firm in the faith. In his second letter, penned soon after the first, Peter encourages his fellow believers to pay attention to God’s word and warns them about the coming of Jehovah’s day. Indeed, we can benefit from paying attention to the messages of the letters of James and of Peter.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>GOD GIVES WISDOM TO THOSE “ASKING IN FAITH”</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:1-59:5:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Jas. 1:1–5:20</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“Happy is the man that keeps on enduring trial,” writes James, “because on becoming approved he will receive the crown of life.” To those who “keep on asking in faith,” Jehovah grants wisdom needed to endure trials.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:5-59:1:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jas. 1:5-8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:1:12-59:1:12" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 12</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Faith and wisdom are also needed by those who “become teachers” in the congregation. After identifying the tongue as “a little member” capable of ‘spotting up the whole body,’ James warns of worldly tendencies that can damage one’s relationship with God. He also outlines the steps anyone spiritually sick should take in order to recover.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:3:1-59:3:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jas. 3:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:3:5-59:3:6" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 5, 6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:5:14-59:5:15" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 5:14, 15</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:14:12-45:14:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Rom. 14:12</a>) Is this not one reason to make mercy a dominant quality in our lives?</p>

However, these divinely inspired words are possibly based on the general thought behind such scriptures as <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:6:5-1:6:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Genesis 6:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:8:21-1:8:21" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 8:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:21:10-20:21:10" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> Proverbs 21:10</a>; and <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:5:17-48:5:17" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Galatians 5:17</a>.</p>

The individual helping the sinner in this way will also “cover a multitude of [that one’s] sins.”</p>

Therefore, we should not nurture wrong desires by dwelling on them.

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Peter reminds his fellow believers of their “living hope” of an inheritance in heaven. “You are ‘a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation,’” Peter tells them. After giving specific counsel on subjection, he exhorts all to be “like-minded, showing fellow feeling, having brotherly affection, tenderly compassionate, humble in mind.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:1:3-60:1:4" data-bid="21-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:2:9-60:2:9" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 2:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:3:8-60:3:8" data-bid="21-3" class="b"> 3:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Since “the end of [the Jewish system of] things has drawn close,” Peter counsels the brothers to ‘be sound in mind and vigilant with a view to prayers.’ He tells them: “Keep your senses, be watchful. . . .

However, baptism itself does not save us. Salvation is actually “through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.” The baptismal candidate must have faith that salvation is possible only because Jesus died a sacrificial death, was resurrected, and “is at God’s right hand,” having authority over the living and the dead. Baptism founded on such faith is what corresponds to ‘eight souls being safely carried through the water.’</p>

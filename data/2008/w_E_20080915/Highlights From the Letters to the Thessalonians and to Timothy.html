<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Letters to the Thessalonians and to Timothy</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE new congregation in Thessalonica has experienced opposition ever since it was formed when the apostle Paul visited there. So when Timothy<wbr />—perhaps in his 20’s—<wbr />returns from there with a good report, Paul is moved to write the Thessalonians a letter to commend and encourage them. Likely composed late in 50 C.E., that letter is the first of Paul’s inspired writings. Shortly thereafter, he writes the Christians in Thessalonica a second letter. This time, he corrects an erroneous viewpoint held by some and exhorts the brothers to stand firm in the faith.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">About ten years later, Paul is in Macedonia and Timothy is in Ephesus. Paul writes to Timothy, encouraging him to stay in Ephesus and carry on spiritual warfare against false teachers inside the congregation. When a wave of persecution is unleashed upon Christians in the wake of a fire that ravages Rome in 64 C.E., Paul writes his second letter to Timothy. It is the last of his inspired writings. We today can benefit from the encouragement and counsel given in these four letters of Paul.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Paul commends the Thessalonians for ‘their faithful work, their loving labor, and their endurance.’ He tells them that they are his ‘hope and joy and crown of exultation.’<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/52:1:3-52:1:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Thess. 1:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/52:2:19-52:2:19" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">After encouraging the Christians in Thessalonica to comfort one another with the resurrection hope, Paul states: “Jehovah’s day is coming exactly as a thief in the night.” He counsels them to “stay awake” and keep their senses.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/52:4:16-52:4:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Thess. 4:16-18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/52:5:2-52:5:2" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 5:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/52:5:6-52:5:6" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 6</a>.</p>

They “meet the Lord” Jesus in the invisible heavenly realm. To experience this, though, they first need to die and be resurrected as spirit creatures. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:6:3-45:6:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rom. 6:3-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:15:35-46:15:35" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 1 Cor. 15:35,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:15:44-46:15:44" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 44</a>) Christ’s presence has already begun, so anointed Christians who die today do not remain dead.

Instead of simply praying that the congregation be preserved, he prayed for the preservation of its “spirit,” or mental disposition. He also prayed for its “soul,” its life, or existence, and for its “body”<wbr />—the composite body of anointed Christians. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:12:12-46:12:13" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Cor. 12:12, 13</a>) The prayer thus highlights Paul’s intense concern for the congregation.</p>

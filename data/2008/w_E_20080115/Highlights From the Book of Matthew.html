<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Book of Matthew</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE first person to write a thrilling account of Jesus’ life and ministry is Matthew<wbr />—a close associate of Jesus Christ and a onetime tax collector. Originally written in Hebrew and later translated into Greek, the Gospel of Matthew was completed about 41 C.E. and serves as a bridge connecting the Hebrew Scriptures to the Christian Greek Scriptures.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Apparently intended primarily for a Jewish audience, this moving and meaningful Gospel portrays Jesus as the promised Messiah, the Son of God. Paying close attention to its message will strengthen our faith in the true God, his Son, and His promises.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>“THE KINGDOM OF THE HEAVENS HAS DRAWN NEAR”</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:1:1-40:20:34" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Matt. 1:1–20:34</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Matthew highlights the Kingdom theme and Jesus’ teachings, even though doing so means deviating from presenting matters in strict chronological order. For example, the Sermon on the Mount is related early in the book, although Jesus delivered it about halfway through his ministry.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">During the course of his Galilean ministry, Jesus performs miracles, gives ministerial instructions to the 12 apostles, denounces the Pharisees, and relates Kingdom illustrations. Then he departs from Galilee and comes to “the frontiers of Judea across the Jordan.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:19:1-40:19:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 19:1</a>) Along the way, Jesus tells his disciples: ‘We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be condemned to death, and on the third day he will be raised up.’<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:20:18-40:20:19" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 20:18, 19</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:3:16-40:3:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>3:16</strong></a><wbr /><strong>—In what way were ‘the heavens opened up’ at the time of Jesus’ baptism? </strong>This seems to indicate that Jesus’ memory of his prehuman existence in heaven returned to him.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:21-40:5:22" data-bid="6-1" class="b"><strong>5:21, 22</strong></a><wbr /><strong>—Is giving vent to anger more serious than harboring it? </strong>Jesus warned that a person who harbors smoldering wrath against his brother is committing a serious sin. However, giving expression to wrath by speaking a word of contempt is more serious, making one accountable to a court higher than the local court of justice.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:48-40:5:48" data-bid="7-1" class="b"><strong>5:48</strong></a><wbr /><strong>—Is it really possible for us to be “perfect, as [our] heavenly Father is perfect”? </strong>Yes, in a relative sense. Jesus was here discussing the subject of love, and he told listeners to imitate God and be perfect, or complete, in their love. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:43-40:5:47" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 5:43-47</a>) How? By expanding it to include their enemies.</p>

Rather, rifts are caused by the position taken by unbelieving family members. They may choose to reject or oppose Christianity, bringing about divisions in the family.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:12:51-42:12:53" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Luke 12:51-53</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:11:2-40:11:6" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>11:2-6</strong></a><wbr /><strong>—If because of having heard God’s voice of approval John already knew that Jesus was the Messiah, why did he ask if Jesus was “the Coming One”? </strong>John might have asked this in order to get a personal <span id="page30" class="pageNum" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span>confirmation from Jesus. More than that, though, John wanted to know if there was to be “a different one” who would come with Kingdom power and fulfill all the hopes of the Jews. Jesus’ answer showed that there was to be no successor.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:6:16-48:6:16" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Gal. 6:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:4-66:7:8" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Rev. 7:4-8</a>) The apostles to whom Jesus was speaking were going to be part of spiritual Israel, not judges of its members. Jesus made ‘a covenant with them for a kingdom,’ and they were to be ‘a kingdom and priests to God.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:22:28-42:22:30" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Luke 22:28-30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:5:10-66:5:10" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Rev. 5:10</a>) Those of spiritual Israel are to “judge the world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:6:2-46:6:2" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Cor. 6:2</a>) Hence, “the twelve tribes of Israel,” whom those on the heavenly thrones judge, evidently represent the world of mankind who are outside that royal, priestly class, as pictured by the 12 tribes on Atonement Day.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:16:1-3:16:34" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Lev., chap. 16</a>.</p>

He uses “the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one’s means of life” to tempt us. Nevertheless, applying Scriptural principles will help us to remain faithful to God.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/62:2:16-62:2:16" data-bid="19-1" class="b">1 John 2:16</a>.</p>

The second call extended from the time of the outpouring of the holy spirit at Pentecost 33 C.E. to 36 C.E. Both calls were directed only to the Jews, Jewish proselytes, and Samaritans. However, the third call was issued to the people from the roads outside the city, that is, to the uncircumcised Gentiles, beginning in 36 C.E. with the conversion of the Roman army officer Cornelius and continuing into our day.</p>

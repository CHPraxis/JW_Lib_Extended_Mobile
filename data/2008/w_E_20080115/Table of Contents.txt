Purpose of Study Articles
Study Articles 1-3  PAGES 4-17
These three study articles will strengthen your determination to continue sharing in the Christian ministry. They will remind you of why you need to be zealous, show you how to improve your “art of teaching,” and encourage you by demonstrating that many are still responding to the preaching work.
Study Articles 4, 5  PAGES 20-28
These two study articles discuss in depth the hope that true Christians have. Whether you hope to make your home with Christ in the heavens or to live forever on earth under Kingdom rule, the articles will greatly strengthen your appreciation for Jehovah’s loving-kindness and unsearchable wisdom.

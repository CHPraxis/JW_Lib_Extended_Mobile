<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ “Layer upon layer of perfectly ordered structures.” That is how Professor Luke Lee of the University of California, U.S.A., describes the compound eye of many insects.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Consider: </strong>The compound eye of certain insects, such as the honeybee and the dragonfly, is made up of multiple optical units, each of which points in a different direction. The images produced by the individual lenses combine to create a wide mosaic view that is superb at detecting movement.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Scientists are exploring ways to mimic the compound eye of insects in order to make high-speed motion detectors and ultrathin multidirectional cameras. These could have a variety of applications. One use would be medical<wbr />—for example, to peer inside the stomach. This proposed medical device is described as a “tiny system” that can be swallowed by the patient. Once inside the stomach, the device would gather information through its compound eye and then communicate it wirelessly.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">A team of bioengineers has already developed an artificial compound eye with more than 8,500 lenses that fit into a space no larger than a pinhead. This technology, however, pales in significance when compared with the compound eye found in the insect world. The dragonfly, for instance, has about 30,000 optical units in each eye!</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><strong>Ask yourself: </strong>‘Did this optical marvel, the multifaceted eye of insects, come about by chance? Or was it designed?’</p>

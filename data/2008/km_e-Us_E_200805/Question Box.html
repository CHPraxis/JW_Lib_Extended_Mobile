<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When the Creator, Jehovah, founded the earth, “the morning stars joyfully cried out together, and all the sons of God began shouting in applause.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:38:7-18:38:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Job 38:7</a>) These angelic sons of God desired to praise Jehovah for his outstanding work of creation, which was a new manifestation of his wisdom, goodness, and power.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It is a fine thing for us to express heartfelt appreciation for the efforts of our brothers and for the material they present. For example, we normally applaud talks and presentations at special gatherings, such as assemblies and conventions. The parts presented there have required additional time and effort to prepare. Our applause shows appreciation not only for the hard work of the speaker but also for the instruction that Jehovah provides through his Word and organization.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 48:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:47" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Matt. 24:45-47</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">What about applauding parts presented on the Theocratic Ministry School and Service Meeting? There are no rules forbidding applause if it is done spontaneously, such as after a student has completed his first school assignment. However, applause could easily become perfunctory and lose its meaning. Therefore, we normally do not applaud each presentation.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">While we might not applaud for most parts on the Theocratic Ministry School and Service Meeting, there are other ways that all of us can express appreciation for the instruction and for the efforts of those who present parts. We can do this by remaining alert and paying close attention to the speakers. And after the meeting, it is often possible personally to express appreciation for their efforts.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:15-49:1:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Eph. 1:15, 16</a>.</p>

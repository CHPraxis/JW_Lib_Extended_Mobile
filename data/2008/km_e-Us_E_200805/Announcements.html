<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>May: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. A special effort will be made to visit newly interested ones who attended the Memorial or the special public talk but who are not actively associated with the congregation. The purpose of such visits should be to start a home Bible study with those who have not yet accepted one. <strong>June: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>Make a diligent effort to start Bible studies. <strong>July: </strong><em>Keep on the Watch! </em>If the congregation does not have this brochure in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus on hand that you can use. If that is not possible, offer another appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock. <strong>August: </strong><em>Worship the Only True God. </em>If the congregation does not have this book in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus on hand that you can use. If that is not possible, offer an appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock. If a Bible study is started, it is recommended that the <em>Bible Teach </em>book be studied.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Bodies of elders should review the July 6, 2006, letter regarding disaster preparedness and ensure that they have up-to-date contact information for each publisher. In disaster-prone areas, additional emergency contact information should be obtained. Of course, in addition to emergency situations, it is helpful when publishers communicate with their Congregation Book Study overseer or another elder if they will be away for extended periods, such as when traveling on vacation or business, during a hospital stay, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ Please take note that there will be no special invitation handbill advertising the 2008 district convention. However, we are planning for a significant global campaign in the near future. Further details regarding that arrangement will be provided later.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ Whenever personal travel plans include attending congregation meetings, an assembly, or a district convention in another land, your request for information regarding dates, times, and locations must be directed to the branch office that oversees the work in that land. Addresses of branch offices are listed on the last page of the current <em>Yearbook.</em></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ Donations for the worldwide work that are made by check at district conventions should be made payable to “Christian Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses.”  Donations for the worldwide work that are sent directly to the branch office should be made payable to “Watchtower.” The branch office’s financial address is Watchtower, c/o Treasurer’s Office, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ It is necessary for the branch office to maintain an up-to-date record of addresses and telephone numbers for all presiding overseers and secretaries. If there is a change at any time, the Congregation Service Committee should complete, sign, and send a <em>Presiding Overseer/​Secretary Change of Address </em>(S-29) form to the branch office promptly. This includes any changes in telephone area codes.</p>

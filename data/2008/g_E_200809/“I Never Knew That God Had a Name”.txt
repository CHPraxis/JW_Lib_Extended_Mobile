“I Never Knew That God Had a Name”
▪ A woman said these words after reading the book What Does the Bible Really Teach? “But it makes sense,” she added. “When I looked up God’s name in my Bible, it was right there!” She explained: “I have never read a book about the Bible that was so helpful and easy to understand!”
The Bible Teach book not only shows that it was God’s original purpose for earth to be a paradise but also makes clear how that purpose will be fulfilled. The book reveals the vital role that God’s Son, Jesus Christ, has in accomplishing this purpose. It provides the Bible’s explanation of why we grow old and die, why God has allowed suffering, and how God’s Kingdom will provide relief from all suffering.
Although the Bible Teach book has been available for just three years, over 79 million copies have already been printed in 220 languages. You may request a copy by filling in the accompanying coupon and mailing it to the address provided here or to an appropriate address on page 5 of this magazine.

SECTION 6
Your Parents
Parents have the benefit of hindsight. They’ve already navigated the maze of physical and emotional changes that are part of adolescence. Ideally, they should be in the best position to guide you through the maze. Sometimes, though, parents can seem to be part of the problem​—not the solution. For example, you might face one of the following challenges:
□ My parents never stop criticizing me.
□ My dad or mom is addicted to drugs or alcohol.
□ My parents are always arguing.
□ My parents have separated.
Chapters 21-25 will help you deal with these and other problems.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>How Can I Protect Myself at School?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="si"><strong>Mark the following statements true or false:</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="si"><strong>1. Bullying involves only incidents of physical harm.</strong></p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><span id="page122" class="pageNum" data-no="122" data-before-text="122"></span>TERROR is a daily experience for millions of youths who are bullied at school. “The 15-minute bus ride became a torture that seemed to last for hours as my tormentors progressed from verbal abuse to physical mistreatment,” says a youth named Ryan. Other youths are sexually harassed. “A very popular boy cornered me in the hallway and started touching me inappropriately,” says young Anita. “Asking him in a nice way to keep his hands to himself didn’t work. He didn’t think I really meant it.”</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Some teens are even hounded online by their classmates. Are you a victim of mistreatment? If so, what can you do about your plight? Plenty! But first, let’s separate the myths from the facts by examining the statements made at the outset of this chapter.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sm"> <strong>1. False. </strong>Most bullies use their mouths, not their fists. Threats, insults, sarcasm, and ridicule can be forms of bullying.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sm"> <strong>2. False. </strong>Even a “compliment” with sexual overtones, an obscene joke, or ogling can constitute sexual harassment.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sm"> <strong>3. True. </strong>Those who bully and harass can be of either gender.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sm"> <strong>4. False. </strong>You <em>can </em>take measures to stop the mistreatment. Let’s see how.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>How to Beat a Bully​—Without Using Your Fists</strong></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Some bullies want to provoke you just to see how you’ll react. But the Bible gives this wise advice: “Do not hurry <span id="page123" class="pageNum" data-no="123" data-before-text="123"></span>yourself in your spirit to become offended.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:9-21:7:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:9</a>) The fact is, ‘returning evil for evil’ could add fuel to the fire and lead to further problems. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:17-45:12:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Romans 12:17</a>) How, then, can you beat a bully <em>without </em>using your fists?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb"><strong>Take a lighthearted approach. </strong>If a taunt is simply an attempt at humor, try to laugh it off instead of getting offended. “Sometimes it’s just a matter of not taking aggressive statements so seriously,” says a boy named Eliu. If a bully sees that his words have little effect, he may stop the harassment.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"><strong>Use mildness. </strong>The Bible says: “An answer, when mild, turns away rage.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:1-20:15:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:1</a>) A kind reply is what the bully least expects, and it can defuse a tense situation. True, keeping coolheaded when under attack takes self-control. But it’s always the better course. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:29:11-20:29:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 29:11</a> says: “All his spirit is what a stupid one lets out, but he that is wise keeps it calm to the last.” Mildness is a sign of strength. The mild person isn’t easily thrown off balance, while the bully is often insecure, frustrated, or even desperate. For good reason, the Bible states: “He that is <span id="page124" class="pageNum" data-no="124" data-before-text="124"></span>slow to anger is better than a mighty man.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:16:32-20:16:32" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 16:32</a>.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb"><strong>Protect yourself. </strong>If a situation seems out of control, you may need to find an ‘escape route.’ <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:14-20:17:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:14</a> says: “Before the quarrel has burst forth, take your leave.” So if violence appears imminent, walk or run away. If escape is impossible, you may need to ward off violence the best way you can.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"><strong>Report it. </strong>Your parents have a right to know about what’s happening. They can also give you practical advice. For example, they might suggest that you speak to a school official, such as a guidance counselor, about the matter. Be assured that parents and school officials can handle the matter discreetly, so as not to get you into further trouble.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">The bottom line? A bully can’t win if you refuse to play his game. So don’t get sucked into the flames of his anger. Instead, take control of the situation by employing the foregoing suggestions.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="ss"><span id="page125" class="pageNum" data-no="125" data-before-text="125"></span><strong>Coping With Sexual Harassment</strong></p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">If you’re being sexually harassed, you have every right to feel angry! The question is, What can you do about it? Plenty! Here are a few suggestions.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb"><strong>Firmly refuse sexual advances. </strong>Aggressors may assume that a halfhearted no really means yes​—or at least maybe—​unless you convince them otherwise. So let your no mean no. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:37-40:5:37" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 5:37</a>) If you giggle or act coy, even out of initial embarrassment, it could send the wrong message to the harasser. Be firm and direct. <em>That is your best defense!</em></p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb"><strong>Make a scene. </strong>Young Anita says of her harasser: “I had to embarrass him in front of his friends by loudly <span id="page126" class="pageNum" data-no="126" data-before-text="126"></span>telling him NOT to touch me that way!” The result? “All his friends laughed at him. He was very cold for a while, but a few days later, he apologized for his behavior and later even defended me when someone else tried to bother me.”</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb"><strong>If words don’t work, walk away. </strong>Better yet, run. And if escape isn’t possible, you have the right to fend off molestation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:22:25-5:22:27" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 22:25-27</a>) Says one Christian girl, “When a boy tried to grab me, I punched him just as hard as I could, and I ran!”</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb"><strong>Tell someone. </strong>“That’s what I finally had to do,” admits 16-year-old Adrienne. “I asked my parents for advice on the situation when a boy I thought of as a good friend just wouldn’t leave me alone. The more I protested, the more persistent he became, almost as if it were <span id="page127" class="pageNum" data-no="127" data-before-text="127"></span>a game.” Adrienne’s parents had practical advice that helped her cope with the problem. No doubt your parents can help you too.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">Having to deal with bullying or sexual harassment is no fun. But always remember this: Christian youths need not be helpless victims of bullies; neither should they tolerate or be allured by the advances of a harasser. By taking the steps mentioned, you can deal with these challenges.</p>

<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="sc">  <strong>Don’t flirt. </strong>It’s an open invitation to harassment. The Bible asks: “Can you carry fire against your chest without burning your clothes?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:6:27-20:6:27" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Proverbs 6:27</a>, <em>Today’s English Version</em>) The fact is, flirting is playing with fire.</p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="se">  <strong>Watch your association. </strong>It will be assumed that your values match those of your friends. A young girl named Carla says, “If you hang around with ones who give in to the remarks or who enjoy the attention, then you will get harassed too.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:33-46:15:33" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>.</p>

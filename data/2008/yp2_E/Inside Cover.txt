Dear Reader:
Wise King Solomon wrote: “Rejoice, young man [or woman], in your youth, and let your heart do you good in the days of your young manhood, and walk in the ways of your heart and in the things seen by your eyes.” (Ecclesiastes 11:9) When you are young, life can be so interesting and exciting, and we want you to enjoy it. However, we encourage you to do so in a way that pleases Jehovah God. Never forget that he can see what you are doing with your life and will judge you accordingly. How wise it is, then, to follow Solomon’s further advice: “Remember, now, your Grand Creator in the days of your young manhood.”​—Ecclesiastes 12:1.
It is our earnest prayer that the information in this publication will help you to withstand the pressures and temptations facing today’s youth and will show you how to make decisions that are in harmony with God’s will. By doing so, you will make Jehovah’s heart rejoice.​—Proverbs 27:11.

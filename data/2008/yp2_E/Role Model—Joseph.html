<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Joseph is faced with a <strong>serious situation. </strong>His master’s wife has repeatedly implored him to have sex with her. Now she’s trying again! But Joseph isn’t tempted. In fact, his <strong>reply is resolute. </strong>“How could I commit this great badness and actually <strong>sin against God?” </strong>he says to her. When she challenges his refusal​—even grabbing hold of him—​Joseph isn’t embarrassed to flee. In fact, <strong>he runs </strong>out of the house! Joseph shows himself to be a man of <strong>moral integrity.​</strong>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:39:7-1:39:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Genesis 39:7-12</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">You too may be confronted with a situation in which someone wants you to give in to your sexual urges. Resisting isn’t merely a matter of willpower. It starts with a desire to <strong>please your Creator, </strong>Jehovah God. You see, Joseph had sexual desires, just as you do. However, it was unthinkable for him to satisfy those urges in a way that would offend his Creator. In the same way, you need to <strong>be convinced </strong>that moral uncleanness offends God and that it ultimately leads to heartache. So strive to <strong>develop and maintain </strong>the moral integrity that Joseph displayed.</p>

Role Model​—The Poor Widow
Jesus is watching the rich drop contributions into the temple treasury chest. In the crowd he notices a needy widow who donates “two small coins of very little value.” (Luke 21:2) Jesus praises her act of generosity. Why? Because the others had donated “out of their surplus, but she, out of her want, dropped in all of what she had, her whole living.”​—Mark 12:44.
Do you have the same priorities as this woman did? Are you willing to spend your time and money in serving God? Like the needy widow, you can donate toward the maintenance of places of worship. You can also spend your time and money helping others learn about Jehovah God. Jehovah noticed and appreciated the small amount the widow gave in his service. God will also appreciate and help you if your top priority is to do his will.​—Matthew 6:33.

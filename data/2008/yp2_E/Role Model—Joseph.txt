Role Model​—Joseph
Joseph is faced with a serious situation. His master’s wife has repeatedly implored him to have sex with her. Now she’s trying again! But Joseph isn’t tempted. In fact, his reply is resolute. “How could I commit this great badness and actually sin against God?” he says to her. When she challenges his refusal​—even grabbing hold of him—​Joseph isn’t embarrassed to flee. In fact, he runs out of the house! Joseph shows himself to be a man of moral integrity.​—Genesis 39:7-12.
You too may be confronted with a situation in which someone wants you to give in to your sexual urges. Resisting isn’t merely a matter of willpower. It starts with a desire to please your Creator, Jehovah God. You see, Joseph had sexual desires, just as you do. However, it was unthinkable for him to satisfy those urges in a way that would offend his Creator. In the same way, you need to be convinced that moral uncleanness offends God and that it ultimately leads to heartache. So strive to develop and maintain the moral integrity that Joseph displayed.

Role Model​—Paul
The apostle Paul is realistic about his feelings. He candidly admits: “When I wish to do what is right, what is bad is present with me.” Paul is a good person at heart. “I really delight in the law of God according to the man I am within,” he writes. What’s the problem then? Paul says: “I behold . . . another law warring against the law of my mind and leading me captive to sin’s law that is in my members.” Paul’s failings don’t make him happy. “Miserable man that I am!” he exclaims.​—Romans 7:21-24.
Do your mistakes cause you to feel miserable? If so, remember that even Paul felt that way at times. But Paul also knew that Christ died for people like him, leading him to exclaim: “Thanks to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!” (Romans 7:25) Paul viewed the ransom as a personal gift. He wrote: “The Son of God . . . loved me and handed himself over for me.” (Galatians 2:20) When you feel down, reflect on the ransom. And if your failings discourage you, never forget that Christ died for sinners, not for perfect people.

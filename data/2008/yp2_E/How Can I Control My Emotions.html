<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>How Can I Control My Emotions?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span id="page219" class="pageNum" data-no="219" data-before-text="219"></span>WHAT do you think​—is fire good or bad? You probably would say that the answer depends on the circumstances. On a cold winter night, logs burning in a fireplace can provide much-needed warmth. That’s good. Uncontrolled, however, the flames can quickly spread and destroy the entire house. That’s bad.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It’s similar with your emotions. When controlled, they’re beneficial, enabling you to develop warm friendships. Unrestrained, your emotions can be destructive, not only to you but also to those around you.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">As an adolescent, you may at times find yourself overwhelmed by anger or sadness. How can you control those emotions? Let’s discuss them one at a time.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>Defusing Anger</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">It isn’t easy to deal with the hurt and pain that arise when you’re a victim of mistreatment. Some in that position lose their self-control. In fact, the Bible speaks of people who are “given to anger” and “disposed to rage.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:22:24-20:22:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 22:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:29:22-20:29:22" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 29:22</a>) This is no trivial matter. Uncontrolled anger can cause you to take action that you’ll later regret. So how can you control your emotions when you’ve been mistreated?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">First, analyze the situation squarely, and see if you can settle the matter in your heart.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:4:4-19:4:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 4:4</a>) Remember, paying back “injury for injury” will just make matters worse. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:5:15-52:5:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 5:15</a>) <span id="page220" class="pageNum" data-no="220" data-before-text="220"></span>After thinking the matter over and praying about it, you might find that you’re able to let go of resentment. Once you do that, you will reduce its hold on you.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:8-19:37:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 37:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">But what if the hurt just won’t go away? The Bible says that there is “a time to keep quiet and a time to speak.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:7-21:3:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 3:7</a>) Can you approach the person who hurt you? If that’s not advisable, you might benefit by talking to your parents or a mature friend about how you feel. If someone is purposely trying to harass you, make a special effort to be kind to that one. <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1102008128/41-61">The chart on page 221</a> can help you to think up additional responses to situations that until now may have made you react impulsively.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">By all means, pray to Jehovah, and ask him to help you avoid building up resentment toward the individual who hurt you. Remember this: Although you can’t change what happened, you <em>can </em>change your reaction to what happened. If you let yourself be consumed with resentment, you become as helpless as a hooked fish. You allow someone else to lead your thinking and emotions. Wouldn’t <em>you </em>rather be the one who is in control?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:19-45:12:19" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Romans 12:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><span id="page222" class="pageNum" data-no="222" data-before-text="222"></span><strong>Coping With Sadness</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">“Recently I have been moody and overly self-critical,” says 16-year-old Laura. “I get no joy out of life. I cry myself to sleep.” Like Laura, many young people feel overwhelmed by the pressures of life. What about you? Demands from your parents, friends, and teachers; the physical and emotional changes of puberty; or the feeling that you’re a failure because of some minor shortcoming​—these things may leave you feeling miserable.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Some young people even resort to self-injury to relieve anguish.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span> If you’ve fallen victim to such a habit, try to discern the reason. For example, self-injury is often a way of coping with some form of stress. Is there a situation​—perhaps with regard to your family or friends—​that is causing you distress?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">One of the best ways to deal with troubled feelings is to talk to a parent or a mature member of the Christian congregation who could prove to be one who is “born for when there is distress.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:17:17-20:17:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 17:17</a>) Liliana, 16, confided in some adult Christian sisters. “Since they are older than I am,” she says, “their advice is sound. They have become my friends.”<span data-fnid="3" class="fn">c<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="3"></span></span> Dana, 15, says that she gained a measure of relief by increasing her share in the Christian ministry. “It was the best thing I could have done,” she says. “In fact, it was the happiest time of my life!”</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><span id="page223" class="pageNum" data-no="223" data-before-text="223"></span>Above all, if you’re sad and depressed, don’t neglect prayer. The psalmist David, who was no stranger to adversity, wrote: “Throw your burden upon Jehovah himself, and he himself will sustain you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:55:22-19:55:22" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 55:22</a>) Jehovah knows about your suffering. More than that, “he cares for you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:7-60:5:7" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:7</a>) If your heart condemns you, remember that ‘God is greater than your heart and knows all things.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:20-62:3:20" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 John 3:20</a>) He understands even better than you do <em>why </em>you’re distressed, and he can lift your emotional burdens.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">If sadness persists, it could be that you suffer from a health disorder, such as depression.<span data-fnid="4" class="fn">d<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="4"></span></span> If that’s the case, it <span id="page224" class="pageNum" data-no="224" data-before-text="224"></span>would be good for you to get a medical checkup. Ignoring the situation would be like turning up the volume of a car radio to drown out a knocking noise in the engine. It’s far better to address the matter. Really, there’s no need to be ashamed of your condition. Many youths who suffer from depression and related disorders are being helped through treatment.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Remember, your emotions are like fire. When controlled, they’re beneficial; when unrestrained, they’re destructive. Do your best to keep your emotions in check. True, on occasion you will likely say or do things that you later regret. But be patient. In time, you’ll learn to control your emotions so that your emotions do not control you.</p>

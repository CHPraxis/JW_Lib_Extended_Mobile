Role Model​—David
David loves music. He’s a gifted musician and a talented songwriter. He even makes his own instruments. (2 Chronicles 7:6) David is so skilled that the king of Israel summons him to perform in the royal court. (1 Samuel 16:15-23) David accepts. But he doesn’t become conceited, nor does he allow music to dominate his life. Rather, he uses his talents to praise Jehovah.
Do you love music? You may not be a talented musician, but you can still imitate David’s example. How? By not letting music dominate your life or induce you to think and act in ways that dishonor God. Instead, use music to enhance your enjoyment of life. The ability to create and enjoy music is a gift from God. (James 1:17) David used this gift in ways that pleased Jehovah. Will you do the same?

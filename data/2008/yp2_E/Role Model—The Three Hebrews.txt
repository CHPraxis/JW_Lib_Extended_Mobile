Role Model​—The Three Hebrews
Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah stand on the plain of Dura, near Babylon. All around them people bow to the ground before a giant image. Despite pressure from their peers and threats from the king, these young men remain resolute. Respectfully but firmly they tell Nebuchadnezzar that their decision to serve Jehovah is not negotiable.​—Daniel 1:6; 3:17, 18.
These men were youths when exiled to Babylon. Their faithfulness while young​—refusing to eat foods that may have been forbidden by God’s Law—​prepared them to face difficult challenges later in life. (Daniel 1:6-20) They knew from experience that obeying Jehovah was the wise course. Are you similarly resolved to stick to God’s standards despite pressure from your peers? If while you’re young you learn to obey Jehovah in what might seem to be small matters, you will be better prepared to remain faithful when you face big challenges later in life.​—Proverbs 3:5, 6; Luke 16:10.

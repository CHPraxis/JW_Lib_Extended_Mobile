Role Model​—Lydia
Although she is a new believer, Lydia takes the initiative to show hospitality to Paul and his companions. (Acts 16:14, 15) As a result, she has the privilege of enjoying the company of these disciples. After Paul and Silas are released from prison, where do they go? Right back to the home of Lydia!​—Acts 16:40.
Like Lydia, can you take the initiative to get to know others? How can you do so? Start small. Work on talking to one person at a time. You could make it a goal to start a conversation with one person each time you attend a Christian meeting. Try to smile. If you don’t know what to say, ask questions or share something about yourself. Be a good listener. In time, you may be inclined to say more. People often respond to sincere words that are kind and pleasant. (Proverbs 16:24) Because of her friendly and hospitable nature, Lydia was blessed with good friends. If you imitate her example, you will be too!

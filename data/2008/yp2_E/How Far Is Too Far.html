<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="s6">□ True</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="s6">□ False</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">NO DOUBT you’ve thought about this subject a lot. After all, if you’re dating someone, it can be difficult to know where to draw the line when expressing affection. Let’s address the three true-or-false statements above and see how God’s Word helps us to answer the question, “How far is too far?”</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn"><span id="page43" class="pageNum" data-no="43" data-before-text="43"></span>● <strong>It’s always wrong for two people who are dating to touch each other, under any circumstances.</strong></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><strong>False. </strong>The Bible doesn’t condemn legitimate, clean expressions of affection. For example, the Bible tells the story of a Shulammite girl and a shepherd boy who were in love. Their courtship was chaste. Yet, they evidently exchanged <em>some </em>displays of affection before they married. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:1:2-22:1:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Song of Solomon 1:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:2:6-22:2:6" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 2:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:8:5-22:8:5" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 8:5</a>) Today some couples who are seriously contemplating marriage may likewise feel that some chaste expressions of affection are appropriate.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">However, a dating couple must exercise extreme caution. Kissing, embracing, or doing anything that causes arousal can lead to sexual misconduct. It’s all too easy, even for a couple with honorable intentions, to get carried away and engage in sexual immorality.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:5-51:3:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Colossians 3:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn">● <strong>A couple who refrain from sexual intercourse can still be guilty of fornication.</strong></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><strong>True. </strong>The original Greek word translated “fornication” (<em>por·neiʹa</em>) has a broad meaning. It describes all forms of sexual relations outside of marriage and focuses on the misuse of the sexual organs. Thus, fornication includes not only intercourse but also acts such as masturbating another person, as well as engaging in oral sex or anal sex.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><span id="page44" class="pageNum" data-no="44" data-before-text="44"></span>Furthermore, the Bible condemns more than just fornication. The apostle Paul wrote: “The works of the flesh are manifest, and they are fornication, uncleanness, loose conduct.” He added: “Those who practice such things will not inherit God’s kingdom.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:19-48:5:21" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Galatians 5:19-21</a>.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">What is “uncleanness”? The Greek word covers impurity of any kind, in speech or action. Surely it would be unclean to allow one’s hands to stray under another person’s clothing, to remove another’s clothing, or to caress another’s intimate areas, such as the breasts. In the Bible the caressing of the breasts is associated with the pleasures reserved for married couples.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:5:18-20:5:19" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 5:18, 19</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"> Some youths brazenly defy godly standards. They <em>deliberately </em>go too far, or they greedily seek out numerous partners with whom they can practice sexual uncleanness. Such ones may be guilty of what the apostle Paul called “loose conduct.” The Greek word for “loose conduct” means ‘outrageous acts, excess, insolence, unbridled lust.’ Surely you want to avoid coming to be “past all moral sense” by giving yourself over to “loose conduct to work <span id="page45" class="pageNum" data-no="45" data-before-text="45"></span>uncleanness of every sort with greediness.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:17-49:4:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:17-19</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sn">● <strong>If a dating couple don’t take sexual liberties, they can’t really be in love.</strong></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"><strong>False. </strong>Contrary to what some may think, taking improper sexual liberties doesn’t deepen a relationship. Rather, it tears down mutual respect and trust. Consider Laura’s experience. “One day my boyfriend came over when my mother wasn’t home, supposedly just to watch TV,” she says. “At first he just held my hand. Then all of a sudden, his hands started to wander. I was afraid to tell him to stop; I thought he would get upset and want to leave.”</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">What do you think? Did Laura’s boyfriend really care for her, or was he just seeking selfish gratification? Is someone who tries to draw you into unclean behavior really showing that he loves you?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">When a boy pressures a girl into violating her Christian training and conscience, he breaks God’s law and undermines any claim that he genuinely loves her. Furthermore, a girl who willingly gives in allows herself to be exploited. Worse yet, she has committed an unclean act​—perhaps even fornication.<span data-fnid="2" class="fn">b<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="2"></span></span>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:9-46:6:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:9, 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="ss"><span id="page46" class="pageNum" data-no="46" data-before-text="46"></span><strong>Set Clear Boundaries</strong></p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">If you’re dating, how can you avoid inappropriate displays of affection? The wise course is to <em>set clear boundaries in advance. </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:10-20:13:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Proverbs 13:10</a> says: “With those consulting together there is wisdom.” So discuss with your partner what expressions of affection are appropriate. Waiting until you’re in some emotion-charged romantic setting before establishing ground rules is like waiting until your house is on fire before installing an alarm.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Granted, such a sensitive discussion can be difficult​—even embarrassing—​especially in the early stages of courtship. But establishing boundaries can do much to prevent serious problems from developing later on. Wise <span id="page47" class="pageNum" data-no="47" data-before-text="47"></span>boundaries can be like smoke detectors that sound an alarm at the first hint of fire. Furthermore, your ability to communicate in these matters may also serve as an indicator of how much potential the relationship has. In fact, self-control, patience, and unselfishness are the foundation of a satisfying sexual relationship in marriage.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:7:3-46:7:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 7:3, 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">True, holding to godly standards isn’t easy. But you can trust Jehovah’s advice. After all, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:17" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Isaiah 48:17</a>, he describes himself as “the One teaching you to benefit yourself, the One causing you to tread in the way in which you should walk.” Jehovah has your best interests at heart!</p>

Don’t deceive yourself into thinking you can solve the problem alone. “I’d pray, ‘Help us not to do it again,’” confessed one youth. “Sometimes it would work, but a few times it didn’t.” Therefore, talk to your parents. The Bible also gives this good advice: “Call the older men of the congregation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:14-59:5:14" data-bid="12-1" class="b">James 5:14</a>) These Christian shepherds can give counsel, advice, and reproof so that you can get your relationship with God back on track.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Jesus is watching the rich drop contributions into the temple treasury chest. In the crowd he notices a needy widow who donates <strong>“two small coins </strong>of very little value.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:2-42:21:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 21:2</a>) Jesus praises her act of generosity. Why? Because the others had donated “out of their surplus, but she, out of her want, dropped in all of what she had, her <strong>whole living.”​</strong>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:44-41:12:44" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Mark 12:44</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Do you have the same priorities as this woman did? Are you willing to spend your time and money in serving God? Like the needy widow, you can donate toward the <strong>maintenance </strong>of places of worship. You can also spend your time and money <strong>helping others </strong>learn about Jehovah God. Jehovah noticed and appreciated the small amount the widow gave in his service. God will also appreciate and help you if your <strong>top priority </strong>is to do his will.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 6:33</a>.</p>

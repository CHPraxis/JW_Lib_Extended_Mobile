<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Although she is a new believer, Lydia <strong>takes the initiative </strong>to show hospitality to Paul and his companions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:14-44:16:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 16:14, 15</a>) As a result, she has the privilege of enjoying the company of these disciples. After Paul and Silas are released from prison, where do they go? Right back to the home of Lydia!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:40-44:16:40" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 16:40</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Like Lydia, can you take the initiative to get to know others? How can you do so? <strong>Start small. </strong>Work on talking to one person at a time. You could make it a goal to <strong>start a conversation </strong>with one person each time you attend a Christian meeting. Try to smile. If you don’t know what to say, <strong>ask questions </strong>or share something about yourself. Be a <strong>good listener. </strong>In time, you may be inclined to say more. People often respond to sincere words that are kind and pleasant. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:16:24-20:16:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 16:24</a>) Because of her friendly and hospitable nature, Lydia was blessed with <strong>good friends. </strong>If you imitate her example, you will be too!</p>

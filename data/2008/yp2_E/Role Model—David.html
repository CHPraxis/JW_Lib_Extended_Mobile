<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">David loves music. He’s a <strong>gifted musician </strong>and a talented songwriter. He even makes his own instruments. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:7:6-14:7:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 7:6</a>) David is so skilled that the king of Israel summons him to <strong>perform in the royal court. </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:16:15-9:16:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Samuel 16:15-23</a>) David accepts. But he <strong>doesn’t become conceited, </strong>nor does he allow music to dominate his life. Rather, he uses his talents to praise Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Do you love music? You may not be a talented musician, but you can still <strong>imitate David’s example. </strong>How? By not letting music dominate your life or induce you to think and act in ways that dishonor God. Instead, use music to <strong>enhance your enjoyment </strong>of life. The ability to create and enjoy music is a <strong>gift from God. </strong>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:17-59:1:17" data-bid="3-1" class="b">James 1:17</a>) David used this gift in ways that pleased Jehovah. Will you do the same?</p>

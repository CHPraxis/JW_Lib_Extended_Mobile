<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Hezekiah is at a <strong>crossroads </strong>in his life. At just 25, he’s the king of Judah. What kind of king will he be? Will he allow the <strong>bad example </strong>of his father, King Ahaz, to influence him? Right up to his death, Ahaz had been an <strong>unrepentant apostate. </strong>He promoted pagan worship and even burned at least one of Hezekiah’s brothers on a pagan altar. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:28:1-14:28:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 28:1-4</a>) However, Hezekiah doesn’t permit his father’s hypocritical conduct to sour him on the worship of Jehovah, nor does he feel doomed to repeat his father’s mistakes. Instead, Hezekiah keeps <strong>“sticking to Jehovah.”​</strong>—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:18:6-12:18:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Kings 18:6</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Does one of your parents mock the worship of Jehovah? Is he or she abusive or a slave to some bad habit? If so, you <strong>don’t have to repeat </strong>your parent’s mistakes! Hezekiah didn’t let his sad family background ruin his life. In fact, he became such a good king that “after him there proved to be no one like him among all the kings of Judah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:18:5-12:18:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Kings 18:5</a>) Like Hezekiah, you can make a <strong>success </strong>of your life despite difficult family circumstances. How? Keep “sticking to Jehovah.”</p>

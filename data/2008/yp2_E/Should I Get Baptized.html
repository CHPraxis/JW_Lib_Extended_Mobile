<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Should I Get Baptized?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="si"><strong>Mark the following statements true or false:</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="si"><strong>Baptism is a requirement for Christians.</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="s6">□ True</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="s6">□ False</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="si"><strong>The main purpose of baptism is to protect you from giving in to sin.</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="s6">□ True</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="si"><strong>Baptism puts you in line for salvation.</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="s6">□ True</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="s6">□ False</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="si"><strong>If you’re not baptized, you’re not accountable to God for your actions.</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="s6">□ True</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="s6">□ False</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="si"><strong>If your friends are getting baptized, that means you’re ready for baptism too.</strong></p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="s6">□ True</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="s6">□ False</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">IF YOU’RE living up to God’s standards, cultivating a friendship with God, and talking to others about your faith, it’s only natural for you to be thinking about baptism. But how do you know if you’re ready for that step? To help answer that question, let’s consider the true-or-false statements above.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn"><span id="page305" class="pageNum" data-no="305" data-before-text="305"></span>● <strong>Baptism is a requirement for Christians.</strong></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb"><strong>True. </strong>Jesus directed that his disciples be baptized. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>) In fact, Jesus himself submitted to baptism. To follow Christ, you need to be baptized when you’re mature enough to make that decision and have a genuine desire to do so.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sn">● <strong>The main purpose of baptism is to protect you from giving in to sin.</strong></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"><strong>False. </strong>Baptism is a public symbol of your dedication to Jehovah. Your dedication isn’t a cold contract that restrains you from doing things that you would secretly like to do. Rather, you dedicate your life to Jehovah because you <em>want </em>to live by his standards.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sn">● <strong>Baptism puts you in line for salvation.</strong></p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"><strong>True. </strong>The Bible says that baptism is an important step to gaining salvation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:21-60:3:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:21</a>) This doesn’t mean, though, that baptism is like an insurance policy that you buy to protect yourself in case disaster should strike. You get baptized because you love Jehovah and want to serve him forever with your whole heart.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:12:29-41:12:30" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mark 12:29, 30</a>.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sn"><span id="page306" class="pageNum" data-no="306" data-before-text="306"></span>● <strong>If you’re not baptized, you’re not accountable to God for your actions.</strong></p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb"><strong>False. </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:17-59:4:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">James 4:17</a> states: “If one knows how to do what is right and yet does not do it, it is a sin for him”​—baptized or not. So if you know what’s right and you’re mature enough to take a serious look at your life, perhaps this is the time to talk matters over with a parent or another mature Christian. In that way, you can learn how to progress toward baptism.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sn">● <strong>If your friends are getting baptized, that means you’re ready for baptism too.</strong></p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb"><strong>False. </strong>The decision to be baptized needs to come from your own willing heart. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:3-19:110:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Psalm 110:3</a>) You should be baptized only when you’re fully aware of what being one of Jehovah’s Witnesses involves and when you’re <span id="page310" class="pageNum" data-no="310" data-before-text="310"></span>sure that you’re ready to take on this responsibility.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:5:4-21:5:5" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 5:4, 5</a>.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="ss"><strong>A Life-Altering Step</strong></p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">Baptism is a life-altering step that leads to many blessings. At the same time, it entails a serious responsibility​—that of living up to a personal dedication you’ve made to Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">Are you nearing that point? If so, you have good reason to be happy. What lies before you is the greatest privilege of all​—that of serving Jehovah wholeheartedly and living in a way that shows that you’re truly dedicated to him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:36-40:22:37" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 22:36, 37</a>.</p>

<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sc"><strong>Questions Often Asked About Baptism</strong></p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sc"><strong>What does baptism symbolize? </strong>Being immersed and raised up means that you have died to a self-seeking course and are now made alive to do Jehovah’s will.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="se"><strong>What does it mean to dedicate your life to Jehovah? </strong>It means to give up ownership of yourself, promising to put the doing of God’s will ahead of all else. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:24-40:16:24" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matthew 16:24</a>) It’s fitting that you make a formal dedication in prayer to Jehovah sometime before your baptism.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="se"><strong>What should you be doing with your life before baptism? </strong>You should be living in harmony with God’s Word and talking to others about your faith. You should be cultivating a friendship with God through prayer and study of his Word. You should be serving Jehovah because <em>you </em>choose to do so​—not because others are pressuring you.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="se"><strong>Is there a certain age by which you should be baptized? </strong>Age is not the primary factor. Still, you should be old enough​—and mature enough—​to understand the meaning of dedication.</p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="se"><strong>What if you want to get baptized but your parents say you should wait? </strong>Perhaps they’d like you to gain more experience in Christian living. Value their advice, and use this time to grow in your friendship with Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:2:26-9:2:26" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Samuel 2:26</a>.</p>

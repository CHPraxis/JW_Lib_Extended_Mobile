<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>At times, we may feel that our territory has been worked repeatedly and thoroughly with minimal response. Yet, there are compelling reasons for us to keep preaching.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 28:19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>For a Witness: </strong>Jesus foretold that Kingdom preaching would be a significant part of the composite sign of “the conclusion of the system of things” and that it would be done “for a witness to all the nations.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 24:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 14</a>) When people observe us engaging in preaching the Kingdom good news, a powerful witness is given. After we leave the area, some people may talk about our visit for hours or for days, even if they did not listen to the message. Appreciating the reasons for our ministry helps us to persevere. We are pleasing Jehovah by having a share in fulfilling Bible prophecy by giving a witness and sounding a warning message.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:1:6-53:1:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Thess. 1:6-9</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Perseverance Needed: </strong>Because people have so many distractions and so many demands on their time, perseverance is required of us when we endeavor to further their interest. One woman was called on every week for a year before she decided to invite the Witnesses into her home for a Bible discussion. She liked what she heard so much that she accepted a Bible study, began attending meetings, and soon expressed a desire to get baptized.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>World conditions are changing rapidly, and so are people. Many who rejected our visit in the past may now embrace the refreshing hope we share. If only one person responds favorably to the Kingdom message, our perseverance will have been worth it.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Worldwide, more and more people are “sighing and groaning over all the detestable things that are being done.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:9:4-26:9:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezek. 9:4</a>) Kingdom fruitage proves that those who are righteously disposed are responding to the Kingdom message. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:2-23:2:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 2:2, 3</a>) Therefore, let us continue to preach without letup by lovingly persevering in “bringing good news of something better.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:7-23:52:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isa. 52:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:42-44:5:42" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Acts 5:42</a>.</p>

Announcements
▪ Literature offer for June: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Make a diligent effort to start Bible studies. July: Keep on the Watch! If the congregation does not have this brochure in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus on hand that you can use. If that is not possible, offer another appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock. August: Worship the Only True God. If the congregation does not have this book in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus on hand that you can use. If that is not possible, offer an appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock. If a Bible study is started, it is recommended that the Bible Teach book be studied. September: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Make a special effort to start Bible studies on the initial call. When householders already have this publication, show how they can benefit from it by briefly demonstrating a Bible study.
▪ Since August has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.
▪ Someone designated by the presiding overseer should audit the congregation’s accounts for the months of March, April, and May. When this has been done, an announcement should be made to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.​—See Instructions for Congregation Accounting (S-27).
▪ It is recommended that applications for regular pioneer service be submitted to the branch office at least 30 days before the requested start date. The congregation secretary should review the forms to make sure that they are complete. If applicants cannot recall the exact date of their baptism, they should estimate the date and keep a record of it. The secretary should note this date on the Congregation’s Publisher Record (S-21) card.
▪ Since January 2008, audio files of The Watchtower and Awake! in English and Spanish have been made available at the Web site www.jw.org. Many prefer downloading these audio magazines, which become available before the CD or MP3 discs arrive in the congregations. Whenever a download is made, the organization does accrue a charge. However, this distribution is more economical than manufacturing and shipping discs. Therefore, publishers who download the magazines are encouraged to cancel their order for CD or MP3 discs with the magazine servant. Audio programs in additional languages will progressively become available through www.jw.org.
▪ The branch facilities in Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, will be closed on the following dates: September 13, 2008 (Gilead graduation); October 4, 2008 (annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania); March 14, 2009 (Gilead graduation); and May 8-9, 2009 (spring cleaning). There will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on those dates.

The silversmith Demetrius had incited a riot. He and fellow craftsmen made silver shrines of the goddess Artemis, and their profitable business was threatened because Paul’s preaching work caused many of the city’s residents to forsake idol worship. The mob dragged Aristarchus and Gaius into the theater and kept shouting: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” Aristarchus and Gaius probably expected to die, but the city recorder quieted the crowd.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:19:23-44:19:41" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Acts 19:23-41</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Book of Mark</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE Gospel of Mark is the shortest of the four Gospels. Written by John Mark some 30 years after the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, it is a fast-moving, action-packed account of Jesus’ three-and-a-half-year ministry.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Evidently intended for non-Jews, particularly the Romans, the book of Mark presents Jesus as the miracle-working Son of God who carries on a vigorous preaching campaign. The emphasis is on what Jesus did rather than what he taught. Paying attention to the Gospel of Mark will strengthen our faith in the Messiah and motivate us to be zealous proclaimers of God’s message in the Christian ministry.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>THE GREAT GALILEAN MINISTRY</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:1:1-41:9:50" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Mark 1:1–9:50</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">After covering the activity of John the Baptizer and Jesus’ 40 days in the wilderness in just 14 verses, Mark begins an exciting report of Jesus’ Galilean ministry. The repeated use of the expression “immediately” lends a sense of urgency to the account.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:1:10-41:1:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Mark 1:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:1:12-41:1:12" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 12</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In less than three years, Jesus completes three preaching campaigns in Galilee. Mark presents the account mostly in chronological order. The Sermon on the Mount is omitted, as are many of Jesus’ longer discourses.</p>

Because he was on hand as King-Designate, God’s Kingdom had drawn near. Righthearted people could then respond to his preaching work and take steps that would bring them God’s approval.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:42:1-23:42:4" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isa. 42:1-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:8:4-40:8:4" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Matt. 8:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:9:30-40:9:30" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 9:30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:12:15-40:12:21" data-bid="6-4" class="b"> 12:15-21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:16:20-40:16:20" data-bid="6-5" class="b"> 16:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:5:14-42:5:14" data-bid="6-6" class="b"> Luke 5:14</a>) An exception was the case of the formerly demon-possessed man in the country of the Gerasenes. Jesus told him to go home and report the matter to his relatives. Jesus had been entreated to go away from that area, so he would have had very little or no contact with the people there. The presence and the testimony of a man to whom Jesus had done a good deed could serve to counteract any negative talk about the loss of the swine.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:5:1-41:5:20" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Mark 5:1-20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:8:26-42:8:39" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Luke 8:26-39</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:1-58:10:1" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Heb. 10:1</a>) As the Law stipulated, the Sabbath came after six days of work, and Jesus performed many of his cures on that day. This foreshadowed the peaceful rest and other blessings that mankind will experience under the Thousand Year Reign of Christ after the end of Satan’s oppressive rulership. Therefore, the King of that Kingdom is also “Lord of the sabbath.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:12:8-40:12:8" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 12:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:6:5-42:6:5" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Luke 6:5</a>.</p>

Ancient <span id="page29" class="pageNum" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>tradition has it that Mark’s close associate, the apostle Peter, was the source of much of Mark’s information.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:5:13-60:5:13" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:13</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/41:6:41-41:6:44" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Mark 6:41-44</a>) If they had grasped the greatness of power that Jesus had been given, they would not have been so amazed when he miraculously walked on water.</p>

He makes it clear that the Pharisees “practiced fasting,” that corban is “a gift dedicated to God,” that the Sadducees “say there is no resurrection,” and that the temple was “in view” from “the Mount of Olives.” Since the genealogy of the Messiah would be of interest mainly to the Jews, he leaves it out altogether. Mark thus provides an example for us. We should take into consideration the background of our listeners when we engage in the Christian ministry or give talks at congregation meetings.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:4:26-48:4:26" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Gal. 4:26</a>) From then on, Jesus’ disciples were nearer and dearer to him than his fleshly relatives were.

A follower of Christ must be prepared to “disown himself,” that is, to deny himself and say no to selfish desires and ambitions. He should be willing to “pick up his torture stake”<wbr />—to suffer, if need be, or be shamed or persecuted or even put to death for being a Christian. And he must <span id="page30" class="pageNum" data-no="30" data-before-text="30"></span>“continually follow” Jesus, conforming to His pattern of life.

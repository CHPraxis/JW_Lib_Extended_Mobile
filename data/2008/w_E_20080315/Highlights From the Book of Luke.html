<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Book of Luke</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">MATTHEW’S Gospel is understood to have been written primarily for the Jewish reader, and Mark’s Gospel, for the non-Jewish. However, the Gospel of Luke was intended for people of all nations. Written about 56-58 C.E., the book of Luke is a comprehensive account of Jesus’ life and ministry.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">With the eye of a caring and careful physician, Luke traces “all things from the start with accuracy” and covers a period of 35 years<wbr />—from 3 B.C.E. to 33 C.E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:3-42:1:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 1:3</a>) Nearly 60 percent of the material in Luke’s Gospel is unique.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">After relating details about the birth of John the Baptizer and of Jesus, Luke tells us that John began his ministry in the 15th year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, that is, in the spring of 29 C.E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:3:1-42:3:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 3:1, 2</a>) Jesus is baptized by John in the fall of that year. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:3:21-42:3:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Luke 3:21, 22</a>) By 30 C.E., ‘Jesus returns into Galilee and begins to teach in their synagogues.’<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:4:14-42:4:15" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 4:14, 15</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Jesus sets out on his first preaching tour of Galilee. He tells the crowd: “Also to other cities I must declare the good news of the kingdom of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:4:43-42:4:43" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 4:43</a>) He takes along with him Simon the fisherman and others. He says: “From now on you will be catching men alive.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:5:1-42:5:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Luke 5:1-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:4:18-40:4:19" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Matt. 4:18, 19</a>) The 12 apostles are with Jesus during his second preaching tour of Galilee. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:8:1-42:8:1" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Luke 8:1</a>) On the third tour, he sends forth the 12 “to preach the kingdom of God and to heal.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:9:1-42:9:2" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 9:1, 2</a>.</p>

Others asked “by signs” what he wanted to name the child but not because Zechariah was deaf. He very likely heard what his wife had said about naming their son. Perhaps others inquired of Zechariah about this by making a sign or a gesture. The fact that only his speech needed to be restored indicates that Zechariah’s hearing had not been affected.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:13-42:1:13" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Luke 1:13,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:18-42:1:20" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 18-20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:60-42:1:64" data-bid="14-3" class="b"> 60-64</a>.</p>

A Most Unusual Friendship
AS REPORTED in the “Sunday Times” of Johannesburg, almost every morning Dr. Arthur Wright of Durban dons mask, snorkel and flippers and dives into the sea.
One day he set up a most unusual friendship with an octopus, whom he called Okkie. His own description follows, as quoted in the “Sunday Times”:
“I came across Okkie one late summer afternoon about four years ago. He was lazing outside his rock home. My first thought was to bring him back alive for the Durban Oceanarium. . . .
“Okkie immediately began waving his tentacles, as if in greeting, then to my great surprise he reached for a newly-cleaned arabica shell and extended it in my direction with one of those incredible feelers of his. I was delighted. And of course, completely disarmed. I decided to leave Okkie where he was.
“During the days that followed I thought quite a lot about Okkie. So I called again. Sure enough, I got the same happy greeting. And the same gift of a shell. The next time I passed by, Okkie was more generous. There were two shells. Over the months I built up quite a large collection from Okkie.
“Then one day I happened along and, to my sorrow, there was no Okkie. I called back several times. But still no Okkie. I felt very sad. What could have happened to him? Maybe he had grown too large for his home. Maybe some predator had taken him. Or maybe he, too, had been fired with adventure, seeking new waterways. Who can say? I only know I was conscious of a great loss.”

Respecting Others’ Individuality
In his book You Are Extraordinary, Roger J. Williams, professor of biochemistry, discusses the many ways in which each human is a unique individual and states: “People are sometimes prone to accept and take for granted their own individuality, but are blind to the individuality of others—a blindness that cannot persist if we are to live together. We must use common sense and consideration in expressing our own individuality. If any one of us becomes too much intoxicated with his own individuality, it will be a good antidote for him to know that others possess a high degree of individuality, too.”

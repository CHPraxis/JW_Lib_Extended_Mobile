Written Reviews for Children
Reviews are acknowledged as a valuable teaching tool. That is why, every few weeks, Jehovah’s Witnesses have a written review in their Theocratic School. This provides opportunity for students to examine how much they are learning and remembering. But what about the young children? The reviews are generally too difficult for them.
A Witness in Illinois (U.S.A.) writes: “Lately, for the little ones, we’ve been making up our own written review papers based on ‘My Book of Bible Stories.’ The children think it’s great. It gives them something to do during written review time, and it lets us see how much they’re learning.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In El Salvador, two special pioneers (full-time Kingdom proclaimers) were assigned to witness in a town high in the hills. One of their neighbors there was a staunch Roman Catholic who daily attended Mass. On one occasion, this lady got very sick and the pioneer girls heard her groans. Immediately, they went to her aid, and, while helping her, they gave a short witness. The woman had not been interested in Bible truth, but her attitude was different from that day onward.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This woman compared the kindness of the pioneers with the actions of another neighbor​—a lady with whom she went to Mass each day. Although this Catholic neighbor knew about the woman’s illness, she had not bothered to visit her and offer help.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">However, the kindness shown by the pioneers had quite an effect. The woman accepted the offer of a Bible study, conducted by one of the pioneers, and encouraged her two daughters to participate in it. One of the daughters encountered opposition from her husband, but love for Jehovah gave her the strength to continue making spiritual progress. In time, the mother and the two daughters were baptized as Christians.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The wife of the opposed man took advantage of opportunities to witness to him, and the pioneers also spoke to him in a kind and friendly manner. Some time later, the man and his wife moved to another area. There he studied the Bible and began declaring the “good news” to others. In fact, he himself started Bible studies with various interested persons. Both he and these Bible students were learning at the same time. Eventually, he and two individuals with whom he conducted studies took the step of undergoing baptism at a district assembly.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">These fine developments all had their start with one kind act. How appropriate it is for Christians to follow the counsel to ‘clothe themselves with kindness’!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:12-51:3:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Col. 3:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A report from the Dominican Republic tells about an army officer whose family was on the verge of a breakup. He was sent to France, but, because of financial difficulties, the man found it necessary to send his family to the United States. Soon, however, the man became intimately involved with other women. He states:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“After a while I realized that I was not doing what was right and my conscience began to bother me. So I also went to the United States. There I prayed to God for help.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I heard about meetings being held in a place near home. So I took my wife and younger children to this place. It was a Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Soon a study was started with us and I progressed rapidly. As I began to learn from the Bible about family life, I put those things into practice. Our disunited family soon became united. We became Kingdom publishers, and now we are back home here in the Dominican Republic, happy and contented.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">At one time, this man was domineering and not very humble. Now, however, he is a Christian serving humbly in one of the congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Santo Domingo.</p>

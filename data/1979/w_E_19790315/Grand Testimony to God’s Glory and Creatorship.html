<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">MANY people who question whether there is a God blind themselves to the evidence that he does exist. Because certain things happen daily, even persons who believe in God may not view these ordinary occurrences as testimony to God’s glory and Creatorship. The inspired psalmist, however, stands out in sharp contrast with such persons. He saw in the repetition of very common things a piling up of evidence that unmistakably declared the glory of the Most High.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="ss"><strong>TESTIMONY OF THE VISIBLE HEAVENS</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The psalmist wrote: “The heavens are declaring the glory of God; and of the work of his hands the expanse is telling. One day after another day causes speech to bubble forth, and one night after another night shows forth knowledge. There is no speech, and there are no words; no voice on their part is being heard. Into all the earth their measuring line has gone out, and to the extremity of the productive land their utterances. In them he has set a tent for the sun, and it is like a bridegroom when coming out of his nuptial chamber; it exults as a mighty man does to run in a path. From one extremity of the heavens is its going forth, and its finished circuit is to their other extremities; and there is nothing concealed from its heat.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:1-19:19:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 19:1-6</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In this poetic way, the psalmist David indicated that the visible heavens​—sun, moon and stars—​declare God’s glory. The <span id="page6" class="pageNum" data-no="6" data-before-text="6"></span>great number of heavenly bodies, their orderly, dependable movements and the beneficial purpose that they serve provide grand testimony to a God of wisdom, power and benevolence. A God who has so well arranged the visible universe must be infinitely wise and powerful. When we consider, for example, how dependent on the sun life on earth is, we must conclude that the Maker of the sun deeply cares about living things. In revealing certain admirable qualities of Jehovah God, the visible heavens are indeed declaring his glory.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The testimony concerning God’s glory and Creatorship is not limited to what can be seen in the heavens during the course of one day or one night. One day after another day and one night after another night present the same testimony. Just one 24-hour display of the sun, moon and stars would provide a marvelous witness concerning the Creator. But <em>each </em>day this testimony can be read in the skies above. So it is as if this witness is continually bubbling forth or effervescing by day and, during the night, the visible heavenly bodies are likewise providing knowledge concerning Jehovah’s glory and Creatorship.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The witness given is, of course, a silent one. But in no part of the earth has this particular testimony not been provided. It fills the earth, as if measuring lines had been cast in every part of this planet.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The psalmist speaks of the sun’s having a tent in the visible heavens. Correspondingly, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:22:14-18:22:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 22:14</a> speaks of the heavens arching over the earth like a “vault.” Also, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:22-23:40:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:22</a> speaks of God as “the One who is stretching out the heavens just as a fine gauze, who spreads them out like a tent in which to dwell.” Inside this figurative “tent” the sun moves daily like a nomad. Because of its brilliance, the sun is appropriately compared to a bridegroom coming out of his nuptial chamber specially arrayed for the occasion, and, like a mighty man running a race, it pursues its “circuit” through the heavens. Since the sun sheds its light on every part of the earth from the area of its rising to its setting, everything on earth benefits from its warmth or heat. There are no exceptions to this.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>GOD’S LAW BEARS WITNESS</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The witness concerning Jehovah’s glory and Creatorship is not limited to what can be observed in the visible heavens. According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:14-1:1:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 1:14</a>, one of the reasons for the existence of the heavenly luminaries is that they “serve as signs and for seasons and for days and years.” So they have provided the means for calculating days and years, have guided men at sea and have been the means for determining the proper time for certain agricultural operations. But the heavenly luminaries are not the means that God has provided to guide men in making vital moral decisions. The Most High has provided his commands, and these, too, testify to his glory.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The psalmist David continued: “The law of Jehovah is perfect, bringing back the soul. The reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy, making the inexperienced one wise. The orders from Jehovah are upright, causing the heart to rejoice; the commandment of Jehovah is clean, making the eyes shine. The fear of Jehovah is pure, standing forever. The judicial decisions of Jehovah are true; they have proved altogether righteous. They are more to be desired than gold, yes, than much refined gold; and sweeter than honey and the flowing honey of the combs. Also, your own servant has been warned by them; in the keeping of them there is a large reward.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:7-19:19:11" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 19:7-11</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">David was here referring to God’s law given through Moses. It was perfect, without flaw, fully measuring up to the purpose for which it had been provided. That <span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>law could bring back the soul or the individual in the sense that obedience to it brought a reviving of his being and promoted his welfare.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">All the reminders included in God’s law were trustworthy. They could safely be followed as a guide for life. Though inexperienced and unsure of himself, the person who heeded God’s reminders would act wisely, avoiding a course leading to ruin.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">The orders or particularized rules set forth in the Mosaic law were upright, that is, in full harmony with principles of righteousness and justice. By conducting himself in harmony with the conviction that God’s orders are upright, a person would gain an inward happiness, a joy of heart.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">Being pure, clean, without any undesirable trait, the commandment of Jehovah makes the eyes radiant with clearness of vision. It enables a person to avoid moral error and to follow an upright course.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">A wholesome fear or a deep respect toward the Creator is manifest by obeying his commands. Such a fear is pure. It does not debase an individual as did the dread of false deities, whom their worshipers viewed as being angry and demanding to be appeased by human sacrifices. A wholesome fear of God is what the Law taught. Such a fear will continue to be expressed by Jehovah’s devoted servants. It is, therefore, a fear that stands forever.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">God’s law consisted, in part, of judicial decisions. These were true, dependable, stable, being firmly founded on divine procedures of justice. In every respect those judicial decisions were righteous. Since the judicial decisions are from God and wholly beneficial, it is most desirable to have them in one’s mind and heart. They are more valuable than material riches​—gold. To persons who allow themselves to be guided by them, they are sweeter than honey. These judicial decisions warn against a person’s taking a wrong course, strengthening his determination to resist temptation. Adherence to them is rewarding in that such obedience promotes the highest good of the individual. He shuns a course of life that would be emotionally, physically and mentally injurious.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Truly a law so helpful and beneficial as the one given to the Israelites furnishes eloquent testimony regarding a wise, just and loving God.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="ss"><strong>HELP PROVIDED FOR GOD’S SERVANTS</strong></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Additional testimony concerning the Creator is found in the help that he provides for his imperfect servants. As is evident from <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:0-19:19:14" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 19</a>, David very much appreciated God’s law. However, he also realized that as an imperfect man he needed the aid of his Maker in conducting himself aright. This is clear from the concluding portion of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:0-19:19:14" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 19</a>. We read: “Mistakes​—who can discern? From concealed sins pronounce me innocent. Also from presumptuous acts hold your servant back; do not let them dominate me. In that case I shall be complete, and I shall have remained innocent from much transgression. Let the sayings of my mouth and the meditation of my heart become pleasurable before you, O Jehovah my Rock and my Redeemer.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:12-19:19:14" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 19:12-14</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">David realized that as an imperfect man he might commit sins of which he was not even aware. So he asked to be forgiven the transgressions that might have been hidden from him. Then, when his imperfect flesh might prod him to take a wrong course, he very much wanted God’s help. He desired that Jehovah restrain him from high-handed, presumptuous deeds. He wanted to be held back from having presumptuous acts become the dominant course of action for him. If he had indulged his sinful flesh, he would <span id="page8" class="pageNum" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>have come under the control or domination of sin. He wanted, instead, to be complete in his devotion to the Most High. To the extent possible, he desired to be found “innocent from much transgression.” Therefore, he prayed that his appeal for help, stemming from the “meditation” stimulated by the heart, be found pleasurable before his God. In times of danger and distress David relied on Jehovah as on a solid rock. He also regarded Jehovah as his Redeemer, the One who could save him from the clutches of wicked men as well as from his slipping into sin.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Thus, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:0-19:19:14" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 19</a> forcefully points to the combined witness of creation, the written law contained in the Bible and divine help given to upright ones as something revealing the existence of the Most High. This testimony should move us to want to be found approved by him. Yes, may the ‘meditation of our heart’ prove pleasurable to him as we continue to look to Jehovah God to direct our steps aright.</p>

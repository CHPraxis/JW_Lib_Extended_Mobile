Making Your Family Life Happy
“For a wife to be dearly loved, more is required than mere submission under her husband’s headship. He could have a horse or a dog that is well trained and submissive.”
That’s the kind of candid observations you’ll find in the book Making Your Family Life Happy, as it points the reader to the best guide of all, the Bible.
Husbands, wives, children, even those in “the twilight years,” are dealt with realistically, and Biblically. Pocket size, hard cover, 192 pages, only 35 cents (U.S.), postpaid.
Please send this 192-page book. I enclose 35c (U.S.).

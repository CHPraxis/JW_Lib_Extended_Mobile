Known for Honesty
Honesty is a Christian requirement. Appropriately, then, the apostle Paul wrote: “Carry on prayer for us, for we trust we have an honest conscience, as we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things.” (Heb. 13:18) Such honesty is noted by others and is beneficial, as illustrated by the following experience from France.
A Christian businessman encountered some difficulties because of the current economic crisis. In this regard, he stated:
“As a manufacturer, I sometimes have trouble paying bills at the end of the month due to business difficulties. Thus, at the end of August 1977, I was obliged to ask a dealer to postpone my paying a considerable sum. It was a large foreign firm and was strict about settling bills on time. The financial director turned down my request and asked the local agent to claim the amount immediately. I had already witnessed to this agent, who told the director that he knew me very well and that I was trustworthy. However, no argument was of any use.
“He then added that I was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. The reply was: ‘In that case, it’s different! Grant him the postponement he requests.’ Since then, the agent has been to see me and has explained the whole thing. He showed me a photocopy of a letter that the director had sent to the firm’s headquarters. On the letter was this comment: ‘One of Jehovah’s Witnesses—Favorable opinion.’”
This Witness settled his debt after the postponement and still has excellent business relations with this firm. Of course, Christians do not follow the course of honesty just to secure some material advantages. But their good reputation for honest words and deeds does not go unnoticed.

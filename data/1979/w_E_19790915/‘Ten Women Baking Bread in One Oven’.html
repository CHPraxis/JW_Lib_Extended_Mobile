<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">ONE of the calamities to come upon Israel for unfaithfulness is set forth at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:26:26-3:26:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Leviticus 26:26</a> in these words: “Ten women will then actually bake your bread in but one oven.” Under normal conditions, each woman would need an oven for doing the necessary baking. However, the words of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:26:26-3:26:26" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Leviticus 26:26</a> pointed to the time when there would be so little food available that one oven would be sufficient to handle all the baking that 10 women could do.</p>

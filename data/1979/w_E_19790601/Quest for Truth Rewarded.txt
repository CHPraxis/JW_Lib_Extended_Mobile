Quest for Truth Rewarded
In Ireland some people have been seeking Jehovah’s Witnesses to inquire about Bible truth. For example, in one case a Witness placed a booklet with a woman who read it and passed it on to her husband. Some two weeks later, this man came to the home of the Witness and told his wife: “Your husband gave my wife a booklet. I’ve read it, and it’s the truth. I would like to talk to your husband. I’ve been looking for him for the past two weeks.”
The man explained that he was very interested in the Bible. In fact, from reading a Catholic Bible he said that he knew God’s kingdom was coming. “What I would like to know is this,” said the man, “is there a place for me in this kingdom?”
Arrangements were made for the Witness couple to visit the inquirer and his wife. During the visit, a long Bible discussion took place. On the following Sunday, the interested couple and their family attended a public talk at the Kingdom Hall, and this led to a regular home Bible study. Within a short time, the truth-seeking family had removed objects of false religious devotion from their home and were making fine spiritual progress.

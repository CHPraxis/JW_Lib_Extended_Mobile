<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sn"><strong>17 min: </strong>Loving Help Available. Discussion by elder. Modern-day elders are much like Paul, who had many activities and matters occupying his time. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:28-47:11:29" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Cor. 11:28, 29</a>) Yet, how did he feel about his weighty load in behalf of his brothers? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:12-54:1:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Tim. 1:12</a>) Elders today feel the same and are grateful for the privilege of helping all spiritually. While accomplishments, at times, may not be as much as desired, there is the same determination that Paul expressed in spite of pressures.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:7-47:4:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:7, 8,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:16-47:4:16" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 16</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Likewise, have some elders give suggestions on what they have found helpful to accomplish shepherding either in homes, at meetings or in field service. Conclude with encouragement that as elders continue shepherding work, we can all work together in the same spirit manifested by the Corinthian congregation during the relief effort for the needy in Judea.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:8:8-47:8:12" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Cor. 8:8-12</a>.</p>

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">(5 min.) Talk by chairman. What does it mean to listen when Jehovah speaks? It means to obey the things that God has written in his Word.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:31-44:20:32" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 20:31, 32</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">(25 min.) Discussion based on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:17-44:20:28" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Acts 20:17-28</a>. Read verses and then ask the questions. (1) Read vss. 17-19. How did Paul show his concern for the brothers? (2) Read vs. 20. What did Paul mean when he said “from house to house”? (3) Is it applicable to us today? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:10-41:13:10" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> Mark 13:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:16-46:9:16" data-bid="11-3" class="b"> 1 Cor. 9:16</a>; see <a class="xt" data-xtid="3" href="jwpub://p/E:1979524/34-38"><em>w79 </em>7/15 p. 18, pars. 16-18</a>.) (4) Read vs. 24. How can we copy Paul’s example? (5) Read vss. 25-27. In what way can we be free from being bloodguilty? (6) Read vs. 28. What can elders do to help us to continue to listen to Jehovah?</p>

<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sn"><strong>23 min: </strong>Hold Fast Your Hope Without Wavering. Talk to be handled by an elder. Please cover the following points: Hope is indispensable to Christians. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:13-45:15:13" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Rom. 15:13</a>) Enables Christians to endure with rejoicing, no matter what conditions may be. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:12-45:12:12" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rom. 12:12</a>) Hope closely allied with love. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:10-46:3:15" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:10-15</a>) We never want to lose tight grip on hope. Right foundation needed. Some, however, have become weak, lacking fire-resistant qualities. Some have allowed their worship, including field service, to become routine, not motivated by deep love of neighbor and Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:39-40:22:39" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 22:39</a>) Weakened ones have allowed ideas and qualities to be built into them that are like burnable materials. Some do not have a strong relationship with Jehovah. Endurance results in divine approval. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:58-46:15:58" data-bid="16-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:58</a>) There is a need for our faith to be tested. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:2-59:1:4" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Jas. 1:2-4</a>) Urgent need for all of us to go on bearing fruit, increasing in accurate knowledge, being made powerful in order to endure.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:10-51:1:11" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Col. 1:10, 11</a>.</p>

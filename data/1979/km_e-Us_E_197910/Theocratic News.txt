◆ Nicaragua: The brothers are in good spirits and are resuming their meetings and their preaching and teaching work. Throughout the period of violence, only three of our brothers lost their lives. Many were rendered homeless, but since they were for the most part tenants, the major loss was in the looting and destruction of their possessions. As to transportation, there is very little. Most buses are destroyed, roads are only now being repaired, and gasoline is very scarce. However, things are quickly being restored to order under the new government. Missionaries are returning to their assignments in the country after being away for a short time. And, happily, adequate arrangements are now being made to supply the urgent needs of the brothers.
◆ New peaks of publishers in June: Italy had 77,774 sharing in the preaching work. Spain reached 40,485 publishers; Zaïre, 20,365 and Japan, 49,879. Japan thus had an average of six regular and seven auxiliary pioneers for each congregation.

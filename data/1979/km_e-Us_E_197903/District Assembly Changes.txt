District Assembly Changes
The 1979 district assemblies listed as “tentative” in the February 1, 1979, issue of The Watchtower and February Our Kingdom Service are now definite, with the exception that the two assemblies and circuits listed to attend East Rutherford, N.J., have been changed to one assembly at East Rutherford, N.J., on July 26-29.

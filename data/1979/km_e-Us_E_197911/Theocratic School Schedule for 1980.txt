Theocratic School Schedule for 1980
INSTRUCTIONS
During 1980 the following will be the arrangement when conducting the Theocratic School.
TEXTBOOKS: The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, The Watchtower [w], Awake! [g], Bible Topics for Discussion [td], and the books “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial” [si], Commentary on the Letter of James [cj] and My Book of Bible Stories [my] will be the basis for assignments.
The school will begin with song and prayer and remarks of welcome, and then proceed as follows:
ASSIGNMENT NO. 1: 20 minutes. This should be handled by an elder if possible, or, when necessary, by a qualified ministerial servant. When based on the Commentary on the Letter of James this should be a question-and-answer discussion, using the questions provided at the end of each chapter and the cited scriptures as time permits. A brother who reads well may be assigned in advance to read the paragraphs. The objective should be not only to aid understanding, but to focus attention on how the material can be applied to the specific needs of the congregation. All will need to make careful advance preparation to benefit fully from this discussion. If there are any points for improvement that the school overseer has in mind in connection with this assignment, he can discuss this after the meeting with the one who has handled this part.
When based on “All Scripture Is Inspired of God and Beneficial” this assignment should be delivered as an instruction talk, with a specific theme. Once again the objective is not just to summarize the material, but rather to focus attention on the practical value of the information, highlighting what will be most helpful to the congregation. There will be no oral review of the instruction talk.
HIGHLIGHTS FROM BIBLE READING: 6 minutes. This should be handled by the school overseer, or another qualified elder assigned by him. This should not be just a summary of the assigned reading. After giving a brief overall view of the assigned chapters, help the audience to appreciate why and how the information is of value to us. To the extent possible include the audience in the discussion. Any highlights from the chapter on which the No. 2 talk is based could be discussed after that talk has been given. Following this, the students will be dismissed to their various classrooms.
TALK NO. 2: 5 minutes. This is a Bible reading of the assigned material to be given by a brother. The reading assignments are usually short enough to permit the student to present brief explanatory information in his opening and concluding remarks, and even at intermediate points. Historical background, prophetic or doctrinal significance and application of principles may be included. All the assigned verses should actually be read. The material may be presented as a talk to the congregation, or a boy may read it to his father or to another qualified older brother who may then use questions to draw comments from the boy on the value of the material.
TALKS NOS. 3 and 4: 5 minutes each. These talks will be assigned to sisters whenever possible. When delivering one of the talks, the student may be either seated or standing. One assistant will be scheduled by the school overseer, but additional assistants may be used. Settings could include situations arising at home, in the field service, in the congregation or elsewhere. The sister giving the talk may either initiate the conversation to establish the setting or have her assistant(s) do so. Not the setting but the material should be given prime consideration.
TALK NO. 5: 5 minutes. Assigned preferably to a brother with some experience. This should be a talk to the entire audience. While giving his talk from notes, the speaker, when he thinks it fitting, may read quotations or pointed excerpts from the assigned material. It will usually be best for the speaker to prepare his talk with the Kingdom Hall audience in mind, so that it will be truly informative and beneficial to those who actually hear it. However, if the material lends itself better to another practical and suitable setting, the speaker may choose to develop his talk accordingly.
REMARKS: After each student talk (Nos. 2 through 5), the school overseer will have two minutes to highlight informative and practical points that the students may not have included in their presentations. These remarks should be meaningful, emphasizing points that will be helpful to the brothers in their homelife, at school, on the job, within the congregation or while out in the field service. Occasionally, questions can be put to the audience on points in the assigned material that can be applied.
COUNSEL: This will always be given privately after the meeting, and should not be neglected. (See Question Box, Our Kingdom Service May 1978.) More than two minutes may be used as advisable.
PREPARING TALKS: Where the material makes it possible, talks should follow a well-developed theme. Choose a theme that will allow for the best coverage of the material in the allotted time. Prepare all talks with the points in mind to be considered next on the Speech Counsel slip.
TIMING: No talk should go overtime. Neither should the remarks by the school overseer. Talks Nos. 2 through 5 should tactfully be stopped when the time is up. If the school overseer assigns someone to give the “stop signal,” that one should be advised as to the importance of doing this whenever a talk goes overtime. If a brother handling assignment No. 1 goes overtime, he should be given private counsel. All should watch their timing carefully.
WRITTEN REVIEWS: Periodically, a written review will be given. In preparation, review principally the material in cj, si and my and complete the scheduled Bible reading. Only the Bible may be used during this thirty-minute review. The balance of the hour will be devoted to a discussion of the questions and answers. Each student will check his own paper and, in reading off all the answers, the school overseer will concentrate on the more difficult questions, helping all to understand the answers clearly. If, for some reason, local circumstances make it necessary, the written review may be used a week later than what is shown on the schedule.
LARGE AND SMALL CONGREGATIONS: Congregations with a school enrollment of 75 or more students may wish to arrange for additional groups of students to deliver the scheduled talks before other counselors. Rotate the students to the various halls. Where it is necessary, sisters may take any student talk, presenting it to someone else, as outlined for Talks Nos. 3 and 4.
ABSENTEES: The entire congregation can show appreciation for this school by being present, when possible, at every weekly session, by preparing their assignments well, and by participating in question sessions. It is hoped that all students will view their assignments conscientiously. If a student is not present when scheduled, a volunteer may take the assignment, making whatever application he feels qualified to make on such short notice. Or, the school overseer may cover the material with appropriate audience participation.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">“HOLY ACTS OF CONDUCT”: Accurate knowledge and faith needed to be ‘holy in conduct.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:2-60:2:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Pet. 2:2, 3</a>) Not a matter of personal choice but a command. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:1:15-60:1:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Pet. 1:15, 16</a>) What is “loose conduct”? (Licentious, wanton, vulgar, shameless conduct. See <a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:1973685/33:79-38$p/E:1973686/1-5:181"><em>w73 </em>9/15 p. 574</a>.) What could be its effect on the congregation? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:1-61:2:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Pet. 2:1-3</a>) One who practices such is worse off than before learning truth. Also stumbles others.

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">“DEEDS OF GODLY DEVOTION”: One with godly devotion will revere what is holy, appreciate sacred things. Jesus was first human to develop godly devotion fully since Adam lost it in Eden. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:16-54:3:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Tim. 3:16</a>) Godly devotion urgent now since system soon to end. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:12-61:3:12" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Pet. 3:12</a>) Keep Jehovah’s day “close in mind” by our attitude, speech and preaching activity. Godly devotion not passive but active. Shown by one’s fully accomplishing ministry. Remember, benefits will come now and in future. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:8-54:4:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:11-56:2:13" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Titus 2:11-13</a>) Conclude by stressing need for all to make personal application.</p>

(See article on page 7.) (2) When we associate together, how could the suggestions on “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:201979401/">Encouraging One Another to Be Strong in Faith</a>” affect our conversations?

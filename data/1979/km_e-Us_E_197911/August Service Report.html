<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">August registered a 3-percent increase in publishers over last year’s average. In addition to more time being spent in spreading the Kingdom message, 159,107 more return visits were made and 22,576 more home Bible studies were conducted than in August 1978. It was most encouraging to see 896 new regular pioneers during the month. May we all continue to press forward with greater determination to make known our living hope.</p>

Public Talks for January
We are pleased to announce that during the month of January 1980 we will have four public talks based on the new book Choosing the Best Way of Life. The titles for these talks and the chapters of the book that they are based on are listed below:
1. Sticking with the Right Choice (Chapters 1-4)
2. Following Christâ€™s Example in Submission (Chapters 5, 6)
3. Maintaining Fine Conduct Even When Suffering (Chapters 7, 8)
4. What Will Help to Keep Us Strong? (Chapters 9-11)
There will be no outlines provided by the Society for these talks. Assigned speakers should develop their own outlines for these 45-minute talks. They can use the chapter headings and subheadings in developing the main points. The speakers will want to adhere closely to the material in the book as they deliver their talks. By sticking to the material in the book they will help the brothers to become more familiar with some of the main points in the publication. This, in turn, will equip the brothers to feature the book when it is offered in the field service.
We are confident that all in the congregations will benefit from these talks that will help us to get the highlights of the new book, Choosing the Best Way of Life, in mind. With good preparation, elders having the privilege of delivering these talks will have a fine opportunity to teach and spiritually stimulate the brothers. Thus all will be better equipped to use the material on First and Second Peter found in this new book.

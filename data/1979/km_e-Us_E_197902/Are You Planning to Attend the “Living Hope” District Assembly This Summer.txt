Are You Planning to Attend the “Living Hope” District Assembly This Summer?
All of us have vivid memories of the “Victorious Faith” conventions of last summer. Are you ready now to attend one of the “Living Hope” assemblies in the summer of 1979? When you receive the February 1, 1979, Watchtower (English) you will notice on page 31 that over 90 “Living Hope” District Assemblies are being scheduled in the continental United States for the coming year. In order to assist you in making arrangements to attend, you will find listed below in date order each assembly city and the circuits recommended to attend each.
There are a number of cities where two or three assemblies are being held in succession and so we are recommending that the brothers in the circuits listed in the chart below attend during the particular week indicated, to the extent possible, to ensure adequate seating for everyone.

Those circuits in the above chart marked with an asterisk (*) may have some congregations located a little closer to another assembly city, but it would be best, if possible, to attend the assembly indicated so there will be plenty of room.
Where the above chart indicates that a portion of a circuit attend a particular assembly, such as 1⁄2 or 1⁄4, and so forth, it simply means that those living in the part of the circuit closest to that assembly would attend where indicated, but the rest of the circuit would attend another assembly closest to them as shown elsewhere on the list.
ROOMING: During April the Society will be sending a supply of Room Request forms to each congregation for obtaining hotel, motel and private home accommodations through the assembly organization. These Room Request forms will contain the rooming headquarters address for each assembly and other pertinent information needed for requesting rooms. Please fill out the Room Request form very carefully and give it to the Assembly Coordinator in your congregation. He will then check, sign and send it directly to the assembly city rooming address (NOT to the Society) no earlier than eight weeks ahead of the date of the assembly that you have selected. This will be in ample time for you to receive your rooming assignment prior to the assembly. If you receive a rooming assignment and later have to change your plans and cannot accept it, please send word immediately (1) to the name and address on your rooming assignment and (2) to the assembly rooming department so that the room may be reassigned.
TO THE BODY OF ELDERS: After receipt of this insert, we suggest that the elders meet briefly before the next service meeting to determine which city and dates your congregation is to attend by locating the circuit or portion thereof that your congregation is in as of the end of February on the above circuit list. Then please read the insert to the congregation at that service meeting and the next Watchtower study, announcing the city and dates recommended by the Society. Emphasize any points that would be helpful to the publishers and interested ones. There is no reason to read the entire chart to the congregation. Your congregation is in one of the circuits listed in the chart and the one reading the insert should read the dates and the assembly that the Society recommends you attend. Also, please underline on the above circuit list the recommended assembly city and dates your congregation is to attend and post the insert on the information board for the benefit of the congregation.
We look forward to seeing you and your family as well as your interested ones at this faith-strengthening “Living Hope” District Assembly this summer and know it will prove to be a rich spiritual blessing to all of you. Plan now to attend all four days so as to fully enjoy the fine program that has been arranged.

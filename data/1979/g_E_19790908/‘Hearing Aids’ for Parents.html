<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Listening to the Great Teacher is a unique book for parents and children. The stories are designed in a way that encourages you to ask your child questions. This, in turn, encourages your child to become more involved and to learn to think. Equally important, it helps you to hear how your child really feels about things.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sc">DO YOU like to hear stories?—Well, then, I’m going to tell you one about a man who told better stories than anyone else who has ever lived on earth. His name is Jesus Christ.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sc">  He lived on this earth almost two thousand years ago. That is a long time ago. It is long before your grandmother or grandfather were born. And it is long before men had cars or trains or radios or other things of today.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sc">  When Jesus told a story it made a person think. If a person thought about it long enough, what Jesus said could even change the way the person felt about things. It could change the person’s whole view of life. And everything that Jesus said was true.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sc">  Jesus knew more than any other man. He was the best teacher who ever lived. We learn many things from other persons. But we can learn the most important things from Jesus.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sc">  One reason that Jesus was such a great teacher is because he listened. He knew how important it is to listen. But to whom did Jesus listen? Who taught him?—Jesus’ Father did. And Jesus’ Father is God.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sc">  Before coming to earth as a man, Jesus had lived in heaven with God. So Jesus was different</p>

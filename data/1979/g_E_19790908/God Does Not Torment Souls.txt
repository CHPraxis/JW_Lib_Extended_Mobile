God Does Not Torment Souls
Religions have long taught that the souls of the wicked are tormented in a fiery hell. But the Bible does not teach that.
Learn what hell is and what the Bible says about the condition of the dead. Read the chapters “What Happens to Us When We Die” and “God Does Not Torment Souls” in the book Good News—to Make You Happy. Hard bound, 192 pages, only 50 cents (U.S.).
Please send, postpaid, the book Good News—to Make You Happy; I enclose 50c (U.S.)

‘Attitude of Early Christians’
In his book The Ancient World, Willis Mason West wrote: “The attitude of the Christians toward society added to their unpopularity. Because Christ had preached peace, many of them refused to join the legions, or to fight, if drafted. This seemed treason, inasmuch as a prime duty of the Roman world was to repel barbarism. Moreover, the Christians were unsocial; they abstained from most public amusements, as immoral, and they refused to illuminate their houses or garland their portals in honor of national triumphs.”

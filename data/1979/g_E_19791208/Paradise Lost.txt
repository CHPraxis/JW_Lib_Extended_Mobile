Paradise Lost
Many persons have worn out or given away to a friend their copy of the book From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained. Since 1958, over 15 million copies of the book have been printed.
Since the Paradise book may not be available after current supplies run out, we encourage you to order your replacement copy now, if you desire one.
Still other persons have never had the opportunity to read this illustrated, large-print and easy-to-understand Bible narrative. It starts with the loss of paradise by Adam and Eve and climaxes in the regaining of paradise after Armageddon.
So whether you want a new Paradise book, or you want to obtain one for the first time, please use the coupon below.
Please send me, postpaid, the 256-page hard-cover book From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained. I enclose 75 cents (U.S.).

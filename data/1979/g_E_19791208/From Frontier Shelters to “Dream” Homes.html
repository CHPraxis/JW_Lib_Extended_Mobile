<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">By “Awake!” correspondent in Canada</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A NEW generation of log structures is capturing the attention of an increasing number of people in Canada. This renewed interest has prompted the erection of “dream” homes, community halls, public libraries, museums and even a few Kingdom Halls of Jehovah’s Witnesses—all constructed with logs.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Why this resurgence of interest in log structures? There are several contributing factors. Many are attracted simply by the natural beauty of the logs. Also, economic factors have caused some to take a serious look at log construction. For others, who desire a return to nature, a log home expresses their rejection of the concrete and plastic world that has engulfed them.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong><em>Brief History</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The history of the development of log building in Canada helps us to appreciate that log structures are by no means necessarily just shacks. For example, in 1605 at Port Royal, Nova Scotia, skilled axmen constructed a large log home that French architects had designed and that became French explorer Samuel de Champlain’s “Habitation.” It was such a lovely home <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>that a visit today to the rebuilt replica of it might well start you dreaming about the one that you would like to build.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In later years, other craftsmen contributed further to the development of log buildings in Canada. For example, Scandinavian immigrants brought with them refined knowledge and skills. Unlike the French style, which held that vertical posts should carry structural weight, Scandinavian style called for structural weight to be carried mainly by horizontal logs. Instead of having vertical posts at the corners into which logs were tenoned, Scandinavians lapped and notched the intersecting logs, having their ends protrude past the corners.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">What is claimed to be the largest log building in the world was constructed in 1930 at a site between Ottawa and Montreal. “Le Chateau Montebello,” a Canadian Pacific Railroad hotel, has a central hexagonal hall that measures 30 m (98 ft.) across, with an impressive stone fireplace reaching 20 m (66 ft.) high. From this central hall six dwelling areas radiate outward like six spokes of various sizes, containing 200 rooms and suites for guests. The 3,500 builders who worked on the project fitted some 10,000 logs in place and completed the project in a remarkable four months’ time. The finished structure has an overall length of about 136 m (446 ft.), and is three stories high. What a magnificent log structure it is!</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Ingamo Hall at Inuvik, north of the Arctic Circle, in the Northwest Territories, is a recently completed log building that maintains these traditions. A four-year construction project, this Indian-Eskimo community center has been so masterfully put together by two log craftsmen (using Finnish building techniques) that it is a challenge to try to slide a piece of paper between the logs.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">One more modern-day example is the attractive Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses at Masset, in the Queen Charlotte Islands in British Columbia, one of several log Kingdom Halls in Canada. Some of its logs are 15 m (49 ft.) long!</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Projects like these are establishing the credibility of log building as a modern construction practice. Many are coming to the realization that the new-generation log home need not be just a log cabin with a dirt floor, drafty walls and a leaky sod roof. The new breed of dedicated log <span id="page14" class="pageNum" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>builders has been promoting old but refined log-building methods combined with modern construction technology, making the log “dream” home a comfortable reality today.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong><em>Should You Build a Log Home?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">The current enthusiasm for log structures perhaps raises an interesting question for you. Should you build a log home?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">There are many factors that need to be considered realistically. One cannot overemphasize the need for careful planning. There are several ways of going about it. A few people have painstakingly dismantled existing log houses and reassembled them on new foundations and with new roofs. Some choose the option of ordering a “packaged” log home and then putting the prefabricated pieces together themselves. Still others prefer a hand-fitted log home. Due to the excellence of workmanship required for a satisfactory log home of this kind, many have found it wise to hire a professional log builder. But there is room for a word of caution here, too. One should know beforehand the abilities of the craftsman. Examine closely his previous work.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">For those who would like to enjoy the work of their own hands, here are a few practical suggestions:</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><em>Time: </em>There is a general tendency to underestimate what it will cost in terms of time. For example, skilled log builders sometimes can place only two to four logs a day. What could an unskilled person accomplish?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><em>Money: </em>Some also tend to underestimate the financial cost. Since there are so many variables (from the availability and price of the logs to optional features such as fireplaces), the cost of each home should be carefully calculated in advance.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">And from the standpoint of construction here are some more tips:</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><em>Safety: </em>Because each log will weigh hundreds of kilograms, extreme caution must be used when handling them. The use of log-building tools, such as the power chainsaw, axes and other sharp cutting tools, also calls for extra safety. Wear eye protection and rubber-soled, steel-toed shoes. Never proceed with any operation till you have a sure footing and your work area is clear of obstructions and spectators. Always think in terms of safety so as to avoid turning your project into a nightmare because of a serious accident.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><em>Foundation: </em>Due to the extra weight of logs, a heavier foundation is required. Whereas standard frame walls of a 102-m<sup>2 </sup>(1,100-sq.-ft.) house might weigh 3,600 kg (4 tons), the walls of a log house would weigh approximately 12,700 kg (14 tons). To prevent settling and to satisfy building inspection departments, a steel-reinforced foundation wall, 25 cm (10 in.) thick, with a 61-cm (24-in.) footing might be required. These figures would change with varying soil conditions.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="ss"><strong><em>Selection and Preparation of Logs</em></strong></p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Many problems can be avoided by choosing reasonably straight logs with little taper. Size, too, is important for home construction. Logs with 35- to 43-cm (14- to 17-in.) butts and 25- to 30-cm (10- to 12-in.) tops provide good appearance, structural strength and sufficient insulation. Different varieties of trees may be used, but professional log builders seem to prefer pine, spruce, fir or cedar.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">The best time to cut logs is in the winter when the sap is low and the logs can be skidded on the snow, reducing damage. Peeling off the bark is best left until the logs are ready to be used. Indeed, some experts feel that logs are best used soon so as to allow them to “cure” in place in the building. If they must be stored, they should be piled straight and kept off the ground to allow for air circulation and to keep them away from moisture. When the <span id="page15" class="pageNum" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>logs are in place, wood preservatives can be applied.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong><em>Fitting and Notching</em></strong></p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Once you have your logs selected, on the site and peeled, the next step is the erection of the walls. This requires planning, resourcefulness, ability, hard work and care. Each log must be selected carefully and fitted into place. One common method of placing logs involves careful “scribing”—fitting each log to the one below it and notching the corners where the logs intersect.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">A very important factor to consider is the settling that takes place while logs “cure.” When installing doors and windows and any frame partitions or stairs, extra vertical space must be provided equal to about 6.25 cm per m (3/4 in. per ft.) of height. Framing must not be fastened directly to the logs but be secured to a vertical member “floating” in a groove in the logs. If this is not done, serious problems may develop as the logs settle.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">If you wish to do your own building, it would be wise, if possible, to take advantage of any courses of instruction offered or to arrange to work alongside someone who is proficient in these skills.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="ss"><strong><em>Insulation</em></strong></p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Log walls provide good insulation if they are properly constructed and of large enough logs. For example, a wall constructed of tapered logs with 25-cm (10-in.) tops and properly fitted has an insulation R factor approximately 20 percent higher than a 5 by 10 cm (2 by 4 in.) frame wall with nine cm (three and a half in.) of fiberglass insulation. Of course, it would be even higher if larger logs were used and the underside of each log were grooved so that resilient insulation could be hidden between the logs.</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Another plus for log walls is their heat-retaining capacity. The type of wall described earlier has about five times the ability to hold heat that frame walls have. This contributes to a more constant temperature and, hence, a more comfortable living condition. The same principles for insulating the roof and floor apply as in standard construction; otherwise the insulating advantages of log construction will be lost.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="ss"><strong><em>Plumbing and Wiring</em></strong></p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">An area where foresight saves a great deal of work later on is in making provision for installations such as plumbing and electrical wiring to be done while the logs are being put in place. Care in concealing these services presents a more pleasing appearance.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">It should be obvious that much is involved in the construction of a log home. Perhaps you could first construct a toolshed or similar small structure. In doing so you would gain skill in log work and would only have to live <em>with </em>your mistakes and not <em>in </em>them. You would also be in a better position to determine whether your new “dream” home should be built of logs or not.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">While declaring the “good news” from house to house, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses in El Salvador spoke kindly to two young girls. When the mother returned home, her daughters told her about the kind visitor and what she had said. The mother was a member of an evangelical religion and believed in faith healing, since she thought her young son had been healed through prayer. She had never listened to the Witnesses, but decided that she would do so in the future because one of them had treated her little girls so kindly.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">So when another Witness called, this woman invited her into the home and asked many questions. This led to a Bible study, and soon the woman was attending Christian meetings. But she kept going to her own church as well. Then her son again became ill, and she wondered: “Should I take him to church to be healed or not?” She happened to meet a Witness on the street and told him about her problem. He explained that she should not go on “limping upon two different opinions.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/11:18:21-11:18:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Ki. 18:21</a>) She did not take her son to the church to be healed, but he recovered. Today she is a baptized Christian. Indeed, kind words spoken by a Kingdom proclaimer to young children ultimately produced good results.</p>

What a Bird Brain!
Science has always been mystified by the ability of birds to migrate long distances. Now the mystery has deepened—pigeons can sense the position of the moon even when they can’t see it. Before this it has been demonstrated that homing pigeons sense changes in the earth’s magnetic field, can see light waves we can’t, can detect low-frequency sounds miles away, can sense air-pressure changes and identify familiar odors. And now pigeons know where the moon is, even in daylight. How they do it is still a mystery to scientists.

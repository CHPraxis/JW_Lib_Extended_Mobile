“Awake!” Saved Her Life
“I’d like to share an experience of someone who is very much touched with appreciation of your efforts,” writes a Kingdom publisher from Louisiana. “This someone is an elderly amputee lady who accepted the February 8 ‘Awake!’ concerning the heart. She lived in a trailer in the back of her son’s property in a rural area, and although she was amazingly self-sufficient, she hadn’t been checked on in nearly a week by her family. As we talked, I noticed she was very short of breath and pale, but she insisted she was just excited about being able to talk to someone.
“As the week progressed, I couldn’t get her off my mind, and was drawn to check back on her. However, when I arrived, her trailer was locked up and dark. I got to a phone, and calling both hospitals I found her in an intensive-care unit. She was thrilled to see me, and explained that when I’d left she started reading the ‘Awake!’ and realized that she was suffering from the symptoms of a heart attack described therein. She said her son then appeared and she asked to be taken to the hospital where she had her heart attack under the care of experts.
“When she was allowed to have a lengthy visit, I brought her a ‘Truth’ book, and, as we read from it, she accepted what she learned enthusiastically.
“I know the information saved her physical life; more importantly, perhaps it will have saved her spiritual life.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“I’d like to share an experience of someone who is very much touched with appreciation of your efforts,” writes a Kingdom publisher from Louisiana. “This someone is an elderly amputee lady who accepted the February 8 ‘Awake!’ concerning the heart. She lived in a trailer in the back of her son’s property in a rural area, and although she was amazingly self-sufficient, she hadn’t been checked on in nearly a week by her family. As we talked, I noticed she was very short of breath and pale, but she insisted she was just excited about being able to talk to someone.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“As the week progressed, I couldn’t get her off my mind, and was drawn to check back on her. However, when I arrived, her trailer was locked up and dark. I got to a phone, and calling both hospitals I found her in an intensive-care unit. She was thrilled to see me, and explained that when I’d left she started reading the ‘Awake!’ and realized that she was suffering from the symptoms of a heart attack described therein. She said her son then appeared and she asked to be taken to the hospital where she had her heart attack under the care of experts.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“When she was allowed to have a lengthy visit, I brought her a ‘Truth’ book, and, as we read from it, she accepted what she learned enthusiastically.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“I know the information saved her physical life; more importantly, perhaps it will have saved her spiritual life.”</p>

Who Descended from Mizraim?
One of the sons of Ham was named Mizraim. (Gen. 10:6) The Scriptures unmistakably point to him as the forefather of the ancient Egyptians. For example, when the Canaanites observed the mourning rites of the Egyptians at the threshing floor of Atad, they called the place “Abel-mizraim,” meaning “mourning of the Egyptians.”​—Gen. 50:7-11.

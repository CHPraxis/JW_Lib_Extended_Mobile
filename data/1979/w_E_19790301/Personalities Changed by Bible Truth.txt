Personalities Changed by Bible Truth
An elementary-school student in Japan frequently lost his temper. In fact, this went to the point that he damaged furniture in his home. But then the lad obtained and read the book “Listening to the Great Teacher” and agreed to have one of Jehovah’s Witnesses study the Bible with him.
Soon a knowledge of Scriptural truth brought about a change in the youngster’s personality. He became obedient to his parents and no longer lost his temper.
As the youth learned more, he appreciated the importance of helping others to acquire knowledge of the truth. So he prayed to Jehovah God for courage to approach and aid a very quarrelsome lad in his class. One day the young Bible student intervened in a fight between the quarreler and a classmate and was struck very hard by the boy whom he desired to help spiritually. Because the Bible student did not retaliate, the quarrelsome youngster wondered: ‘Why is he so different from other boys?’
A few days later, the two had a discussion, and finally a Bible study was started with the contentious youngster. Today, both of these young persons are Kingdom proclaimers, and the first boy’s mother has embraced true Christianity. Yes, personalities can be changed by Bible truth.​—Col. 3:9, 10.

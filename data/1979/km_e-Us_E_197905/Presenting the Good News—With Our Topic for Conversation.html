<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>What are humankind’s greatest needs? Would not a good and righteous government be high on the list? Yes, we need rulership by God. For several months now we have been pointing out that ‘God’s Kingdom Is the Solution.’ We have shown people that the Kingdom for which we pray is a real government, one that can solve their problems. For the months of May through August, the suggested Topic for Conversation will be “Put Your Trust in Government by God,” based on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:1-19:146:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 146</a>. So we do well to acquaint ourselves with that Psalm. This will equip us to use from it what we feel is appropriate, depending on the householder and the circumstances.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>After introducing ourselves to the householder, we might say: “We have come to share a message of hope with you. Would you like to live in a world where there would be true peace and security? [Allow householder to comment.] That is something we also would like, and it emphasizes the need for good government that can ensure such security. But, all of us are faced with the fact that human efforts have failed to make this possible. Wisely, then, the Bible counsels us: [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:3-19:146:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 146:3</a>.] Some leaders may be sincere. They may do some good. But what happens to them? Notice what verse 4 says: [Read.] Did you notice why God advises us not to pin our hopes on humans? [Let householder comment, maybe directing his attention to phrases “to whom no salvation belongs,” “his thoughts do perish.”] We need something better, something permanent—a ruler whose beneficial government will remain.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>If the householder shows interest and does not seem pressed for time, we might continue: “Who do you think can satisfy mankind’s need?” No matter how the householder answers, we can then read verses 5 and 6, which give the Bible answer. Afterward we can emphasize: “The Creator can bring this good government, God’s kingdom. He is the only one who can.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>The next point to consider is the effect that God’s kingdom will have on its subjects. “What benefits could we expect from God’s rule?” we might ask. After listening to the householder’s comments, we can direct his attention to verses 7 through 9. We might say: “As I read these verses note the benefits God’s rule promises to bring.” After reading let the householder express himself if he wishes to do so. Finally, using the last verse of this Psalm, emphasize the grand superiority of God’s government—its ruler lives forever, “for generation after generation.” When making the offer of three pocket-size books for $1.00, be prepared to point out something in one of the books that you feel will be of interest to the householder.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>If the householder seems too busy to pursue the discussion suggested in paragraphs 3 and 4, we might simply say: “We are calling to brighten your day with a message of hope. We think you will agree that human governments cannot solve man’s problems. That is the point made here in this Bible Psalm at verse 3. [Read.] Lasting solutions to man’s problems can only come through God’s kingdom government by Christ. That is the central theme of the Bible and it is beautifully explained in these three publications that we are leaving for only $1.00.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>If we are familiar with the whole of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:1-19:146:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 146</a>, and we note on our house-to-house record just how much of this Psalm we discussed with individuals who manifested interest, then we may be able to use other verses in the same Psalm on the return visit. For example, if we did not have an opportunity to consider verses 7 to 9 on the initial visit, we may use them on the return visit. Afterward we can lead into a consideration of chapter 1 of either <em>Good News—to Make You Happy </em>or the <em>Truth </em>book.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Of course, in talking about government, the problems that exist today and the need for good government, we want to <em>exercise discretion. </em>We do not want to leave any wrong impressions. Being neutral, we do not get involved in political controversies. We are advocates only of God’s kingdom, which is no part of this world.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:36-43:18:36" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 18:36</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>It is good for us to remember that we are interested in making disciples in harmony with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>. So we should think of how we can effectively lead our discussions into a Bible study. The more familiar we become with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:146:1-19:146:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 146</a>, the easier we will find it to go from one of the many interesting points in it to a corresponding point in one of our publications.</p>

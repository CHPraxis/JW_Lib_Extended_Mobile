● The July 1, 1979, issue of The Watchtower will be a special issue that should receive a wide distribution. Congregations should immediately order the additional distributor’s copies they feel they can use.
● During the month of September, the revised brochure Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Twentieth Century will be part of the literature offer to be used in our preaching activity. It is suggested that congregations order now so that they will have the brochure on hand in time to be used by the brothers. The ratio for ordering for your congregation should be based on 20 copies for each pioneer and 7 copies for each congregation publisher.

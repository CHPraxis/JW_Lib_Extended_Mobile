Why Are They Confused?
Some churches say that Jesus is God; others say that he is not. Some churches teach that God torments the wicked in hellfire; others believe that this is false.
It is no wonder that there is confusion. But what does the Bible teach? The 192-page, hard-cover book The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life will help you to find out. Only 35 cents (U.S.), postpaid.
Please send the book The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life; I enclose 35c (U.S.).

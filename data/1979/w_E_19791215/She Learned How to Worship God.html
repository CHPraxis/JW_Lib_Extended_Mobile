<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Jehovah God does not ignore those seeking to please him. Illustrating this is the following experience related by witnesses of Jehovah in Iran:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Although it was not possible to speak with the manager [at a certain place of business], his secretary invited us into her office. . . . She had begun reading all kinds of books to find out how to pray and be heard by God . . .</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“One evening, after concluding her Zoroastrian prayers, this young woman prayed to God in her own words, saying: ‘Dear God, whoever you are, show me how you want me to worship you. . . .’</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Two weeks later, we called. Many lengthy discussions followed. (Having been educated in a Catholic school, the woman had some knowledge of the ‘Christian’ religion. . . . ) It was not long before she was convinced that she had now found the truth and that her prayers had finally been answered. From that initial week, she started attending the meetings [of Jehovah’s Witnesses] regularly, enthusiastically preaching to others and making big changes in her life and attitude.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“As the Bible study with this woman progressed, she came to appreciate that all the books she had been reading in her search for God did not contain the truth, and that, in fact, many of them were associated with spiritism. Gradually, she disposed of more than 40 books, each being worth over 40 dollars. She discarded all her former religious items, including ‘good luck’ coins, crosses, Zoroastrian symbols and those associated with astrology​—this also at great personal expense. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:19:19-44:19:19" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 19:19</a>) Thus within one year this young woman dedicated her life to Jehovah.”</p>

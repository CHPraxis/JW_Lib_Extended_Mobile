<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">● The only ones appropriately invited to attend the pioneer meeting during the circuit overseer’s visit are those currently in the regular or special pioneer service and those who are in the auxiliary pioneer service <em>at the time of his visit. </em>This is in harmony with the <em>Organization </em>book, page 83, designating this as a special meeting with the pioneers.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">● Before the Memorial, we would like to suggest that you do Bible reading from the book of Mark as outlined below. It covers the last six days of Jesus’ life on the earth. We recommend that, if possible, you do this reading as a family. If you are not able to do that, read it personally.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">We have scheduled the reading a day or so ahead of the Jewish date on which the events took place, so you can finish your Bible reading before Nisan 14, which begins after sundown on April 11.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">If you would like to read further information on the events that took place during the final week of Jesus’ public ministry, please see the <em>Aid </em>book, page 930.</p>

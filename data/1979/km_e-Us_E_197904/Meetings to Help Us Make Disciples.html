<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>What Are We Doing with What We Are Learning?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Work needs to be done on this part WELL IN ADVANCE. Many fine field points and suggestions to help in our everyday lives are considered at our meetings. Are we using what is being brought to our attention? On this part, use 5 minutes to consider special public talk and 10 minutes for the Theocratic School. Early in the month assign one or two book study groups to be prepared to cover each of these two meetings. Ask them to be alert to use points gleaned from the material discussed at these meetings. It may be that certain material will help them to make personal decisions, having something to use in informal or in house-to-house witnessing, when making return visits or in stimulating the interest of Bible students in our meetings. During the part, publishers from the groups can then tell their experiences, highlighting the value of what we have learned. This should not be a review of the material. Tell the congregation that we are going to do this again next month.</p>

What do we need to keep on doing respecting our faith?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Par. 3: What world developments convince us that “seeking first the kingdom” is the only right course? How do we demonstrate that this is what we are doing?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Par. 4: What are some of the sad consequences resulting from ignorance of the Bible? What proof do we have that living by the Bible produces marvelous results? How can we show that true faith has a wholesome effect on people’s lives?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">Pars. 5, 6: Why can we be confident that Jehovah will grant success to our efforts to help others spiritually?</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Pars. 7, 8: What hope do we have for the future, and why are we confident of its fulfillment?</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Pars. 11, 12: How can we continue to demonstrate that we have complete confidence in Jehovah God and in his Son?</p>

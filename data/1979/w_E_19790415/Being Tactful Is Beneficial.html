<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">One morning a Kingdom proclaimer in La Orotava, Tenerife Island, called at a door and a very sleepy man answered. Observing that she had awakened him, the Witness apologized and briefly presented Christian journals, which were accepted.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Later, this Witness and her husband visited this man, named Isidro. He remarked that, although he occasionally read the Bible, he could not understand it. Isidro accepted a copy of the book <em>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life.</em></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Though Isidro originally had nothing between the pages of his Bible at the time of their first visit, when the Witness couple returned, they noted that it and his copy of the <em>Truth </em>book were full of religious pictures. During the discussion, one of these items fell to the floor. The visiting Witness picked it up, and placed the article on the table.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Later, Isidro told the Witness that this had been a trap, for he had heard that <em>protestantes </em>burned religious images when they visited a home. Of course, Jehovah’s Witnesses are not Protestants, but Isidro obviously wondered what they would do. However, after studying a certain chapter in the <em>Truth </em>book, he and his wife personally removed all idolatrous items from their home.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Before long, however, Isidro and his wife had progressed spiritually and were planning to be baptized as true Christians. Also, through their efforts six of their relatives began studying the Bible. Three of them were discussing the Scriptures with Isidro himself​—the cautious man who had been awakened one morning from a sound sleep and had benefited from tactful treatment.</p>

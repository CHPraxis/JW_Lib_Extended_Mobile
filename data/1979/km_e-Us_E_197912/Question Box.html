<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● In the June, 1977, <em>Our Kingdom Service, </em>the question was asked: “What is the proper view of commercial activities within the congregation?” Are the answers given under Question Box still the proper view?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Yes, what was there stated still applies. Probably the expression “commercial activities” has not been clearly understood by some. The fact that advertisements or other literature from individual Jehovah’s Witnesses or organizations with which they are affiliated may indicate that certain benefits may accrue to members of the congregation, does not take such activities outside the realm of “commercial activities.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Kingdom Hall should not be used as an ‘agency’ to advertise any ‘business.’ Let us use it for the purpose it is intended to serve, namely, the worship of Jehovah.</p>

Invite several older persons to the platform, or may use those who have served faithfully for many years.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Encourage Holiday Witnessing. Service overseer will handle this part announcing arrangements for field service during this period. Consider special problems arising at this time of year in your territory and what may be done to handle these effectively. Have brothers prepared to comment on how they handle householders’ remarks such as “I’m busy,” “I’m going shopping,” “I’m preparing a meal,” “Merry Christmas, Happy New Year,” and so forth. Emphasize need for tact and discernment. Show how witness can be given when householder is busy by briefly offering two magazines or a book and then leaving with a promise to call back and discuss the literature at a more convenient time. Some find success in raising a single question that one scripture can answer. If the householder is interested, the answer can be shared with him then. Otherwise a return visit can be arranged. Have two brief demonstrations of the above suggestions. Stress need for Christian reasonableness and discernment. (See 12/77 <em>km, </em>p. 4, for additional information.)</p>

Giving Comfort Produces Fruitage
A witness of Jehovah in Portugal was the client of a Baptist hairdresser who had adamantly refused to listen to the Bible’s promise of everlasting life on earth under God’s kingdom. (Luke 23:43; John 17:3) One day, however, the hairdresser was extremely despondent because of serious family problems. In a kind way, the Witness pointed out to her from the Bible the importance of showing the fruitage of God’s spirit​—love, joy, peace, and so forth. (Gal. 5:22, 23) Not only did the hairdresser express appreciation for such kind and helpful information, but, on returning home, she applied the counsel.
Her husband was amazed at his wife’s good disposition and asked: “What happened to you?” He wondered why she had “changed so much,” and he was pleased to learn that one of Jehovah’s Witnesses had helped her.
The very next week, the Christian woman offered the hairdresser a home Bible study, which she gladly accepted on the condition that her husband could also attend. On the evening of the first study, numerous relatives were present, evidently all keenly interested in seeing how the Witnesses handled a Bible discussion. The arrangement surprised them and a regular study was under way with no difficulty.
Three months later, the newly interested couple were involved in a serious accident and were forced to make a decision on whether to accept a blood transfusion or not. They showed respect for God’s law regarding the sanctity of blood, holding fast to their Bible-trained conscience and refusing a blood transfusion. (Acts 15:28, 29) They have been richly blessed, indeed, for 10 persons in that particular family are now baptized witnesses of Jehovah. And it all started with informal witnessing by a Christian woman who sought to provide comforting and helpful information from the Word of God.

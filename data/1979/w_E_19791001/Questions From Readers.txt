● Why was the tree stump in King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream banded with two bands?
Nebuchadnezzar received a prophetic dream of an immense tree that was cut down and banded. Concerning the stump, we read: “Leave its rootstock itself in the earth, but with a banding of iron and of copper, . . . and with the beasts of the field let its portion be until seven times themselves pass over it.”​—Dan. 4:23, 15.
The prophet Daniel explained that in its first application this dream meant that Nebuchadnezzar would be cut down from his ruling position for seven times (evidently seven years). We understand this dream to apply also to the “seven times” of Gentile rulership during which Jehovah would not exercise universal sovereignty through a kingdom with a ruler in the line of David. See Our Incoming World Government​—God’s Kingdom (1977), pp. 71-89.
The stump’s being banded would mean that the “tree” would be kept in check for the seven times. As Job 14:7-9 shows, under normal conditions a tree stump might sprout and begin to grow again; but not this one. When Nebuchadnezzar was given this dream, iron and copper were among the strongest metals available. (Compare Psalm 107:10, 16; Job 40:18.) So the binding of the stump with a band of iron and a band of copper would doubly confirm that the “tree” would not grow again until the bands of divine restraint were removed.

That Wart—From Where?
Who, at one time or another, has not been surprised to find a wart developing on some part of his or her body? But do you know from where most warts come?
Doctors who have studied the matter report that common warts are the result of a local infection caused by a certain virus. This virus infects skin cells near the surface of the body and so does not go deep into the body.
But why should a wart suddenly come up at some spot? It may well be that weeks, months or even up to two years ago you had a small injury there. The “culprit” virus could have entered through a small opening caused by a bump, nick or insect bite. Dr. Clete Dorsey, a California dermatologist, reported: “Men with beard warts are careless shavers. They shave too hastily, too often and too close. Usually they shave against the grain to get even a closer shave.” In the same vein, some young women who shave their legs develop warts, even hundreds of them. Since warts are a virus infection of the skin, scratching open a wart may lead to other parts of the body being infected. So if a wart needs to be treated, usually it is best to have it cared for by a doctor, who may “freeze” it or cauterize it.
Perhaps one reason why we do not have a wart at every place where we cut ourselves or get bitten by an insect is that the virus may be “killed” by the body’s immunological system. For this same reason, one or more warts may suddenly disappear; they may succumb to your immunity system. That is certainly a pleasant development. For while it may be interesting to know from where your wart came, it is even nicer to know that it is gone.

<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span><strong>A Nation That Trusts in God</strong></p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“IN GOD WE TRUST.” That is an oft-repeated slogan. But whose sentiments do these words express? Do you know of any nation that actually trusts in God?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The United States of America claims to, printing these words on its billions of coins and bills of all denominations. Yet, along with other nations of the world, where is its trust actually placed? Is it not in military might and human schemes, rather than in God and his promises? Is there any nation that truly trusts in what God says he will do?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>A UNIQUE, WORLDWIDE NATION</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Bible speaks of such a nation. “Open the gates, you men, that <em>the righteous nation that is keeping faithful conduct </em>may enter,” God’s prophet Isaiah wrote. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:26:2-23:26:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 26:2-4</a>) The people who make up this nation, or join themselves to it, are not of any one racial stock or earthly nationality. They come from all nations of the world, and are distinguished by their primary allegiance to God and his laws.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:5:29-44:5:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 5:29</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">During recent months, from June 1978 to the early part of 1979, over 290 conventions sponsored by this unique, worldwide nation were held in 86 countries. As you can observe from the accompanying chart, more than 3,100,000 persons were in attendance at these “Victorious Faith” Conventions. That is a greater number of persons than the individual populations of some 55 countries that belong to the United Nations.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Representatives of this unique “nation” are found in remote, far-flung parts of the earth. Some of the faraway islands, where they met in convention, include Mauritius, where 690 attended; Cyprus, where 1,057 were present; and Madagascar, where 1,790 enjoyed the program. On the other hand, many of the conventions were tremendous in size. In January of this year, 81,938 assembled in São Paulo, Brazil; 80,008 met in Montreal, Canada’s Olympic Stadium in July; and that same month, at two separate conventions in Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, a total of 91,922 attended.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">There has indeed been a marvelous increase in the numbers of people who are putting their trust in God. <span id="page8" class="pageNum" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>In foretelling this, Jehovah had his prophet Isaiah write long ago: “The little one himself will become a thousand, and the small one a <em>mighty nation. </em>I myself, Jehovah, shall speed it up in its own time.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:22-23:60:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isa. 60:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">But can these people who assembled at the “Victorious Faith” Conventions be identified with the “mighty nation” referred to here? Are they really part of that <em>“righteous nation that is keeping faithful conduct”?</em></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>THEIR CONDUCT A MATTER OF NOTE</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">The worldwide series of “Victorious Faith” Conventions concluded in Central and South America early this year. The kind of conduct one would expect of people who trust in God was noted at these gatherings. In Nicaragua, where armed violence has been ravaging the country, the newspaper <em>Novedades </em>observed editorially on January 6, 1979:</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="si">“Light, when preceded by darkness, shines brighter; hence, it has been a real comfort to see a multitude of Jehovah’s Witnesses . . . Jehovah’s Witnesses, in their desire to apply the essence of Christianity as expressed in James’ words that ‘faith without works is dead,’ concern themselves with bringing out faith from within, making it spring forth in the streets, in the schools, everywhere, so that Christianity may be a practical thing and not a mere ritual. They want to follow the example of the Man who performed healings on the Sabbath, putting ritual aside when confronted with the compelling need to do good, to work in behalf of his neighbor.”</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">A total of 7,083 attended the convention at General Somoza García Stadium in Managua, and this is more than double the number of Witnesses in all Nicaragua! In recent months, opposition forces have been trying to overthrow Somoza’s government, and the fighting has often been intense. In fact, soon after the end of the convention, fighting broke out right in front of the stadium. There were many Witnesses still there, but none were hurt.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">An experience illustrates the position taken by supporters of the “nation” that trusts in God, as well as the consequences. Sometime prior to the convention two men, posing as members of the opposition forces, approached a family of Witnesses. They wanted to use the Witnesses’ home for making bombs, since, they said, it was well suited for this. It was explained that Jehovah’s Witnesses support God’s government, and, hence, take no sides in the political affairs of the world. So the Witnesses would not permit their home to be used for making bombs. The men then identified themselves as representatives of Somoza’s government​—as spies who were checking up on the family—​and told them that it was a good thing they said what they did.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The week after the Nicaragua convention, 8,549 assembled in neighboring Costa Rica. Many visitors came. The San José <em>News </em>reported:</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="si">“Costa Rica was under invasion this week, but not by hostile Nicaraguan soldiers. Instead, the invading force was comprised of hundreds of Jehovah’s Witnesses . . .</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="si">“Jehovah’s Witnesses view Christianity as a way of life and hold the Bible to be the complete word of God. They believe that God’s kingdom, with Christ as King, is an actual government.”</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Yet, do Jehovah’s Witnesses really behave as you would expect subjects of God’s government to behave? The administrator of the Morumbi Stadium in São Paulo, Brazil, where over 80,000 assembled, remarked: “Look at the cleanness, even outside the stadium. They have discipline, without needing a single policeman, and above all, they are obedient. We asked them not to step on the grass of the field, nor inside the chalk marks, and nobody disobeyed.”</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>In Valencia, Venezuela, where over 30,000 persons attended the two conventions in the Monumental Bull Ring, the newspaper <em>El Carabobeño </em>carried the headline: <strong>The Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses A Beautiful Example of Living Together Organization and Cooperation</strong></p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="si">“We are not exaggerating when we state that it is only during the days of the assembly that the Bull Ring remains extremely clean, with its rest rooms in perfect order, its light and sound equipment the way we would like to have it when a bull fight or any other event is held, its walls clean, its plants alive in spite of more than 15,000 persons gathering there daily, including hundreds of children and young people. . . . It is a living example that with the cooperation and effort of all, we can build a better world.”</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Think about that for a moment: A whole world of people living and working together in unity and peace! That will be realized when those associated with <em>“the righteous nation that is keeping faithful conduct” </em>are the only ones remaining on earth.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">From the evidence at hand, can you identify that “nation” today? For one thing, its members, and those who join themselves to it, love God’s Word and are very familiar with it.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="ss"><span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span><strong>EMPHASIS ON GOD’S WORD</strong></p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">An experience related at the Colombia convention illustrates how Witness children reflect the fine instruction they receive from the Bible. In the town of Turbaco, Colombia, religion classes are conducted in school. However, after the following exchange with six-year-old Tomas, the teacher no longer attempted to discuss with him church doctrines, which Tomas had learned were not based on the Bible.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Tomas asked: “Miss Teacher, do you believe in the resurrection?”</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">“Yes, Tomas, I do.”</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">“Well, if the good people go to heaven and stay there, and the bad people go to hell and cannot come back, who are going to be resurrected?”</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">There was a long silence.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">A highlight of each convention was the release of the new publication <em>My Book of Bible Stories, </em>which makes Bible instruction easier and more enjoyable. Its 116 stories cover in chronological order the main events of Bible history, and they are illustrated with over 125 large, full-color pictures. A witness from Belize, Central America, on receiving the book, exclaimed: “In the villages there are so many children and others who don’t know how to read. It’s so colorful; it’s just what the people will want.”</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">“Not only little kids enjoy it,” wrote a 16-year-old,” but big kids too.” Another person explained: “Although I am 26 years old, I am enjoying this book very much. The large and colorful pictures on just about every page are worth 1,000 words! They help me to think deeply on spiritual things.”</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">The other book released at the “Victorious Faith” Conventions, <em>Making Your Family Life Happy, </em>also fills a vital need today. “So many realistic and prevalent problems are dealt with, and in a sound, reasonable way,” observes one reader. “As a wife, I can truthfully say that the chapter for husbands covered the feelings and needs of a woman beautifully. And the chapter for wives gave me some specific and thought-provoking things to examine seriously in my own attitudes.”</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">What really gives force to this publication, making it practical and beneficial, is that it draws on the wisdom of God’s Word, and presents this wisdom in thought-provoking, delightful words. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:12:10-21:12:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eccl. 12:10</a>) A Witness explains how the application of the information has helped to improve her family life, and then relates:</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="si">“My sister was visiting recently and was impressed with the way my children behaved. When she questioned me about it, I took advantage of the opportunity and explained how we train our children. I then showed her the new <strong>Family </strong>book and she was quite interested. When she left she put her arm around me and said: ‘Sis, you’ve really got it together. Dave [her husband] majored in psychology, took a year of abnormal psychology, yet I’ve learned more from you than from him. What you say makes sense; I can see that it works.’”</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">Also released at the “Victorious Faith” Conventions were cassette tapes of the Bible book of John. The reading is presented in a clear, moving way from the <em>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.</em> In just English and Spanish over 163,000 sets of these tapes have been made, and tens of thousands more have been produced in other languages. Completing the convention releases were: the booklet <em>Unseen Spirits​—Do They Help Us? or Do They Harm Us? </em>and the 32-page brochure, <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Twentieth Century.</em> These good things, along with the excellent program, made the “Victorious Faith” Conventions truly spiritually strengthening and uplifting.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="ss"><span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span><strong>JOINING WITH “THE RIGHTEOUS NATION”</strong></p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">“The righteous nation” that trusts in God is not the modern-day nation of Israel; it is the Biblical “Israel of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:16-48:6:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Gal. 6:16</a>) This nation of ‘spiritual Israel’ is composed of Christ’s footstep followers who will reign with him in heaven. A remnant of this “nation” are still on earth. Tens of thousands of people are joining themselves with these anointed Witnesses, because they recognize them as part of God’s “righteous nation.” At the conventions, 34,853 persons symbolized their dedication to serve Jehovah God along with this “nation” by undergoing baptism.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">The high importance that so many placed on being at the conventions was marvelous to see. The determination of 10 Witnesses from the cold, bleak salt flats on Bolivia’s Altiplano, a 13,000-foot-high plain, was almost unbelievable. They had no way to cover the first 60 miles or so except on foot. However, the whole flat, covering thousands of square miles, had been completely inundated by torrential rains. The group, including some elderly ones, had to wade across the “lake” knee-deep in ice-cold water for more than two days! In order to sleep they would look for a mound standing out of the water. But they still were exposed to the cold rains and wind all during the night. After crossing the “lake,” a long, 18-hour train trip brought them to the convention in La Paz. What joy they felt to be with the 5,820 gathered for the spiritual feast!</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">That same joy was reflected by convention delegates everywhere, just as we would expect. For the Bible says: “Happy is the nation whose God is Jehovah, the people whom he has chosen as his inheritance.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:33:12-19:33:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 33:12</a>) Happiness does not characterize nations of the world today. But we invite you to see that it truly exists among Jehovah’s Witnesses. Next month begins their series of “Living Hope” District Conventions. Why not plan to attend one and examine for yourself?</p>

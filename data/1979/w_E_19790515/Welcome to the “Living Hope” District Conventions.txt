Welcome to the “Living Hope” District Conventions
HOW prominently hope appears in God’s Word! Did you know that hope is referred to some 160 times in its pages? Not without good reason does Jehovah God have so much to say in his Word about hope. Well do we read that “hope deferred makes the heart sick; a wish come true is a staff of life.”​—Prov. 13:12, The New English Bible.
No question about it: the hope that Jehovah’s people have serves to differentiate them from all others​—the hope of the Kingdom that will bring about the triumph of righteousness. That hope serves as an anchor for our souls and as a helmet to protect our minds from Satan’s fiery darts.​—Heb. 6:19; 1 Thess. 5:8.
Because this hope is so important to our spiritual well-being “Living Hope” was chosen as the theme for the 1979 district conventions. The program is truly designed to strengthen our hope. So let all of Jehovah’s people put forth every possible effort to attend; and not only to attend but to be on hand for the opening song and prayer on the first day and remain until the concluding song and prayer on the last day. And let all of us ‘pay more than the usual attention to the things presented,’ as well as making provision to share in the field service on Friday morning. (Heb. 2:1) All doing so will certainly get an enriched appreciation of our living hope.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In the fourth century C.E. clerics of the Roman Catholic Church formulated the Trinity doctrine, which claims that Jesus was equal to his Father and part of a triune deity. However, many careful Bible students have held that the Scriptures actually do not support this widely taught doctrine.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Volume 2 of <em>The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology </em>(1976) considers this matter. It acknowledges that there are “a few N[ew] T[estament] texts [that] raise the question whether the Son of God is also called God.” But what is the overall picture found in the “New Testament,” or Christian Greek Scriptures? This dictionary states:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Jesus Christ does not usurp the place of God. His oneness with the Father does not mean absolute identity of being. Although the Son of God in his pre-existent being was in the form of God, he resisted the temptation to be equal with God (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:6-50:2:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Phil. 2:6</a>). In his earthly existence he was obedient to God, even unto death on the cross (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:8-50:2:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Phil. 2:8</a>). He is the mediator, but not the originator, of salvation (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:5:19-47:5:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Cor. 5:19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:1:20-51:1:20" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Col. 1:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:15-58:9:15" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Heb. 9:15</a>), the lamb of God who bears the sins of the world (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:36-43:1:36" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jn. 1:36</a>). After the completion of his work on earth he has indeed been raised to the right hand of God (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:1:20-49:1:20" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Eph. 1:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:22-60:3:22" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 3:22</a>) and invested with the honour of the heavenly <em>Kyrios, </em>Lord (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:9-50:2:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Phil. 2:9</a> f.). But he is still not made equal to God. Although completely coordinated with God, he remains subordinate to him. (cf. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:28-46:15:28" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:28</a>). This is true also of his position as eternal high priest in the heavenly sanctuary according to Heb. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:24-58:9:24" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Heb. 9:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:12-58:10:12" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 10:12</a> f.; cf. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:1-19:110:1" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 110:1</a>). He represents us before God (cf. also <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:34-45:8:34" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rom. 8:34</a>). If in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:1:13-66:1:13" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rev. 1:13</a> ff. the appearance of the heavenly son of man is described with features from the picture of the ‘Ancient of Days’ (God) of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:1-27:7:28" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Dan. 7</a>, this is not to say that Christ is equal with God. In Rev. a distinction is always made between God and the ‘Lamb’.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Surely the overall view of the Scriptures points to the fact that Jesus was not God as the Trinity doctrine claims.</p>

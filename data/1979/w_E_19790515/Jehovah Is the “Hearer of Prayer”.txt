Jehovah Is the “Hearer of Prayer”
The psalmist David called Jehovah the “Hearer of prayer,” and there is frequent evidence that God does, indeed, answer earnest petitions. (Ps. 65:2) Noteworthy in this regard is the following experience from Portugal:
A registered nurse was highly esteemed by friends and acquaintances. But her marriage was a failure, and her husband eventually departed because of his immoral life. Being a deeply religious woman, one day the nurse desperately prayed, expressing her longing for a happy life and pleading that God would let her know if he had a worthwhile purpose.
That very afternoon, Jehovah’s Witnesses came to the woman’s door while they were engaging in their house-to-house preaching activity. She had just taken a shower and was still wearing a robe. But even from the brief introductory comments made by one of the Witnesses, the nurse felt that her prayer had been answered. So she invited the Witness couple into her home, asked many questions and enjoyed receiving Scriptural answers. A home Bible study was started with the woman, and soon she was attending Christian meetings regularly.
In time, the nurse herself became a proclaimer of the “good news” and was conducting a Bible study. Before long, she was planning to be baptized in symbol of her dedication to Jehovah, the “Hearer of prayer.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Senegal is a land of contrasts. Situated on the westerly tip of Africa’s big bulge, it is constantly swept by the parching desert winds of the Sahara to the north or by the cool ocean breezes of the Atlantic to the west and south. The northern stretches of open desert sand merge gradually into the humid jungle-like regions of the southern district. But the contrasts do not end there. They carry right over into the people and their origin, customs and religion.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Apparently attracted by the life-sustaining waters of the huge Senegal River, wandering nomadic tribes of northern Mauritania gradually pushed southward in about the eleventh century of the Common Era, bringing along their Arabic language and customs, as well as the Moslem religion. They were the Berbers, or Zenaga, the latter term probably providing the basis for the name “Senegal.” But the descendants of Ham, who had also migrated to the African continent, were attracted to this land of contrasts as well. Drawn by its more moderate climate and refreshing ocean breezes, African tribes from the south slowly moved northward settling in the fertile valleys of the Casamance and Gambia Rivers. With them came their customs, languages and animistic religion. By the gradual fusing of these two diversified ethnic groups, meeting, as they did, in a land that links the scorching desert of the north with the steaming jungle of the interior, the foundation for a new nation and a new people was being laid. Eventually, it would become the Republic of Senegal.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">But other eyes were turned to this strange, yet inviting, land. Thus it was that in 1455 the first Europeans arrived. It was then that the Venetian explorer Ca Da Mosto (commissioned by Prince Henry of Portugal) set foot on the rocky cape that juts out into the Atlantic. Now known as Cape Vert, it is the present-day site of the modern capital city of Dakar, the gateway to West Africa. The Europeans brought with them new customs, new languages and, yes, a different religion, thus adding to the already existing contrasts.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The sixteenth century saw the beginning of the slave trade to provide cheap labor for plantations in the Americas. The Dutch settled on nearby Gorée Island, and soon Spanish, Portuguese, English, Dutch and French traders regularly visited the west coast of Africa. In 1635, Catholic missionaries came and opened up parts of the country for the colonial powers. Selfish greed soon resulted in conflicts and war, with the <span id="page234" class="pageNum" data-no="234" data-before-text="234"></span>French finally winning the upper hand in 1817. The real colonization of Senegal followed.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>SEEDS OF TRUTH ARE PLANTED</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">As worldly authorities were vying for the domination of Africa, in 1914 the loving Creator, Jehovah God, set up his heavenly government, which will in due time relieve the oppressed and bring refreshment to all races. But when would this good news of the set-up kingdom reach Senegal? It was in 1951 that the first rays of spiritual light penetrated this land. One of Jehovah’s Witnesses, then working for a commercial firm, was able to spend six months in this country. Did he let his light shine? He certainly did! In the short time he spent in Senegal, he very actively sowed the first seeds of truth.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">But to grow, planted seeds need water and care. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:5-46:3:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 3:5-9</a>) Who else would come to this land of hot sun and refreshing rain to help the seed take root and develop? Who would be willing to leave the comforts of his home to come to a new land, strange in so many ways, to bring comfort to depressed souls? How lovers of truth rejoiced when in 1953 the call was answered by a full-time Kingdom proclaimer sent here by the Watch Tower Society!</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Would the colonial authorities welcome these sincere efforts to bring a message of peace and hope to people hungering for truth? On the contrary. This first special pioneer had to enter Senegal as a representative of a textile firm. He comments: “The isolation was a little difficult at first, living without Christian fellowship and no meetings. But the preaching work kept me busy, and I soon found persons willing to listen.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The people of Senegal are warm and hospitable. Living in a land of contrasting religions, they generally welcome religious discussions. Since about 80 to 90 percent of the population are Moslem, many questions come up about the differences between the Bible and the Koran, and these queries often lead into serious discussions. But there was opposition, too, in those days of small beginnings. A large quantity of our magazines was distributed in a section of Senegal that year, and this activity aroused the ire of Christendom’s clergy, who feared that their pastures were being spoiled. However, despite official interference and threats of fines, imprisonment and deportation, the work took root. Interest was found and developed.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">For example, a Portuguese barber was contacted back in 1953. Accepting our book <em>“The Kingdom Is at </em><span id="page235" class="pageNum" data-no="235" data-before-text="235"></span><em>Hand,” </em>he made steady progress and soon was attending the small meetings that had been organized in the home of an interested person. What would be the result? Well, he became the first congregation publisher in Senegal. But since 1953 this seed has produced abundant fruitage and 17 members of his family now are actively glorifying Jehovah’s name.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">In 1954, a special pioneer couple arrived to provide further help. Aside from the problem of adjusting to the climate, customs and food, these early pioneers faced other difficulties. Many of the people contacted could not read French (the national language) and hours upon hours were spent first teaching them how to read and then helping them to understand the Bible. But with much patience and the blessing of Jehovah, the work started to gain momentum. The message of God’s kingdom was beginning to be felt in Senegal.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">For instance, by 1954, three Bible study groups were functioning in Senegal, with an average attendance of 20 persons. During house-to-house witnessing here, people from Gorée were contacted, and it was learned that the majority of that island’s residents had read our literature. In fact, they had been telling others that it contained the absolute truth. Hence, although we had not yet worked from door to door on Gorée, “that island has already been witnessed to,” wrote one Kingdom proclaimer.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>MISSIONARY ACTIVITY BEGINS</strong></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">The year 1955 saw further increase. On May 15 the small group was thrilled to see six new ones take their stand for Jehovah. Toward the end of the year, there was another response to the ‘Macedonian call.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:9-44:16:9" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 16:9</a>) Jean Queyroi, a graduate of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead, arrived in Senegal and our work became established on a more solid footing.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">But what kind of territory awaited this missionary? What were the people like? How would they respond to the Kingdom message?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Senegal had come a long way from the time that the Arabian nomads of Mauritania discovered the refreshing waters of the Senegal River, or the migrating African tribes first settled along the Casamance and Gambia Rivers, back in the early eleventh century. Throughout the following centuries, several distinct tribes had developed in this land of contrasts.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">The most populous are the Ouolofs (Wolof), a tall, stately race noted for very colorful dress. The men wear baggy trousers and a <em>boubou, </em>a large outer garment flowing to the ground in a dazzling array of <span id="page236" class="pageNum" data-no="236" data-before-text="236"></span>colors. Often Ouolof (Wolof) homes are square and made of straw or clay. Polygamy is widely practiced. Then there are the Sérère (Serer), whose prime occupation is farming, the growing of millet and peanuts. The Peuls (Fulani) are thought to be the descendants of intermarriage between the Berbers and the local African tribes and are generally cattle breeders. The Toucouleur (Tukulor) tribe was the first to accept the Moslem religion. And then there are the Sarakolé (Soninke), the Mandingue (Mandingo) and the Diolas (Dyola), the rice farmers and tradesmen.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Although nearly all residents of Senegal claim to be either Moslem or Catholic, the practice of ancient animist religions is obvious everywhere. <em>Gri-gris, </em>or good-luck charms, are seen attached to individuals’ arms, waists, legs and ankles, or interwoven in their hair. Often these articles are suspended from the necks of sheep, goats and even horses. Large sums of money are paid to have these charms blessed to protect the bearer from evil spirits or to guard the affection of a husband or wife. Senegal was certainly a land of contrasts awaiting the zealous servants of Jehovah​—a land of bush and forest; of wild birds and ferocious beasts; of clear refreshing water and malaria-infested regions; of peanuts and rice; of oil and textiles; of cattle raisers and people casting their nets for fish; of quaint African villages and a large modern capital city, Dakar, with over 798,700 inhabitants.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Missionary Jean Queyroi had much to do when he appeared on the scene in 1955. He comments: “There was only a small isolated group in Senegal when I arrived. But I found a territory ripe for harvesting. And what variety! Dakar is a large cosmopolitan city with Senegalese, Guineans, Malians, Togolese, Dahomians, Mauritanians, Lebanese and Syrians, as well as Portuguese and other Europeans, especially the French. There was a great work ahead of us. The Moslem population did not show much interest in the truth but always gave a hearing ear. Bible studies soon were started, and people began developing an interest in the truth.”</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">One difficulty encountered by early Witnesses was getting sufficient Bible literature into the country for use in field service. All books and publications had to be sent through the mail in small packages, and every time they went through customs it was a delicate situation. Occasionally a zealous customs official would open a package and, upon seeing all the literature, <span id="page237" class="pageNum" data-no="237" data-before-text="237"></span>would ask many questions. Several packages were confiscated in this way.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>GROWTH BEGINS</strong></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Although true Christianity here still was in its day of small beginnings, Jehovah’s loving organization did not overlook the little nucleus developing in this land. With great joy and excitement, these hardworking Kingdom proclaimers prepared for a visit by a director of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, M. G. Henschel, who was accompanied by Harry Arnott. And it was an added privilege to taste some joys of the 1955 assemblies! Six of the main convention discourses were delivered by the visiting brothers at a three-day assembly from December 5 to 7, 1955, a gathering held for just a small group of publishers. As a result of this visit, a congregation was formed in Dakar, the first in Senegal. It reported a peak of 18 publishers during the 1956 service year.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sb">How thrilled we were to see 42 persons present at the Memorial in 1957! That year there was a peak of 22 publishers, a 50-percent increase over the previous year. Of course, during this period Senegal was still a colony of France, and many French people were working here. These were contacted, and a number started out in the witnessing work. But since they did not stay in Senegal, they would bring only temporary increase to the local congregation, returning to France after a short while.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">It was in 1956 that a family was contacted that would later play a prominent part in the development of Kingdom interests in this land of contrasts. A study was started with a young Catholic lady, and shortly thereafter she was joined in the study by her husband​—a man prominent in the tax administration of the local government. These people were from very well-known families in Dakar and Saint-Louis. Many doctrinal points had to be cleared up, but the truth steadily produced good results. The husband was a very heavy smoker, and in his office there was a large display of pipes on his desk, not to mention cigarette lighters, tobacco pouches, and so forth. Then one day there was nothing! “Yes,” he said with confidence, “I’ve thrown them all out. That’s finished with me​—I don’t smoke anymore!” Certainly, a step in the right direction!</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">The entire family courageously took their stand. And what an uproar this created in Dakar! “What! The Fourcaults are going to become Jehovah’s Witnesses? <span id="page238" class="pageNum" data-no="238" data-before-text="238"></span>What a shame!” Since they were from well-known families with certain members in high positions, their new stand for Bible truth hardly pleased anyone. Resisting all the opposition, however, they progressed rapidly to the point of symbolizing their dedication to Jehovah by water baptism. The result was that, in time, all the members of the family became active witnesses of Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="ss"><strong>OPPOSITION ENCOUNTERED</strong></p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">The work was progressing well, but not without official opposition. Endeavoring to reach other large population centers in the interior, one day our brothers were working in Kaolack, a city of over 106,800 situated about 110 miles (177 kilometers) from Dakar. There they encountered the commissioner of police, and a missionary recalls: “He asked me to step inside, saying: ‘I know what you are doing here. Follow me!’ He took me into his office and asked me to sit down. ‘I am well acquainted with you people and I have a file on you,’ he said. It seemed that one brother already had been expelled. ‘He was of this city and was asked to leave because he did what you are doing!’ the commissioner exclaimed, adding: ‘Your work is banned here in Senegal. You cannot preach here.’ And there I was sitting before him with a bag full of books and booklets, which he well saw! He asked us to return to Dakar and said he would be obliged to make a report on us. What were we to do? We were in this untouched area and did not want to leave without doing something. So we went to another part of town and worked all morning in the service, placing 55 books and hundreds of booklets.” Happily, the brothers heard no more from the authorities. But our work was to go on for several more years without legal recognition.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="ss"><strong>INCREASING OUR EFFORTS</strong></p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">The pioneer couple attended the Divine Will International Assembly at New York city in 1958 and returned with greater enthusiasm to build up the new ones. Brother Wilfred Gooch visited us as zone overseer in January 1959, and his fine counsel was greatly appreciated by the 31 attending his main talk. However, one joy followed another, and so it was that in February Brother N. H. Knorr, then president of the Watch Tower Society, came to Senegal for the first time. Certainly, this was the most outstanding event till then in the development of our work in this land <span id="page239" class="pageNum" data-no="239" data-before-text="239"></span>of variety. We enjoyed four thrilling days, with a peak of 42 attentive listeners present for Brother Knorr’s special discourse.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb">With the desire to open up the field in other French-speaking West African countries, Jean Queyroi was sent to Guinea in April of 1959. There were two active brothers in Conakry at the time, and he was able to strengthen them for the work ahead despite their isolation. The visit was not without excitement, though. On the very night that Brother Queyroi stepped off the plane in Conakry there was serious trouble among the different tribes, resulting in intervention by the army. “Some persons were killed,” recalls Brother Queyroi. “Others were injured, and there was some burning. But this did not stop us from visiting interested persons the next day. Some of the streets were barricaded, and the inhabitants were frightened. However, things calmed down to the extent that I was able to help the two faithful brothers to continue their peaceful work of making disciples despite turbulent conditions.”</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">In May 1959, the Society asked Brother Queyroi to visit the Cape Verde Islands, a group of islands under Portuguese control situated in the Atlantic off the west coast of Africa. This visit was of great benefit, as many of the persons coming into the truth in Senegal had emigrated from these islands in search of employment. Brother Queyroi took along a Portuguese brother from Dakar and, although they were able to visit only one of these islands, they contacted many interested persons and placed much literature, most of it being distributed free because of the extreme poverty. In the islands it was unlike Dakar with its many different religions. Here, the Catholic Church was still very powerful and evoked much fear among the populace. Everyone passing a church had to salute it; the women were required to kneel with one knee touching the ground, whereas the men were supposed to take off their hats. All made the sign of the cross. Despite this strong religious domination, though, the brothers, to the best of their ability, sowed seeds of truth.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">Up to that time, most of those heartily embracing Bible truth in Senegal were of Portuguese and French origin, with many of the latter returning to France after spending a limited period in Africa. Hence, 1960 saw a small decrease, but the places of those leaving were being taken by other interested ones. So the number in the congregation remained about the same.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb"><span id="page240" class="pageNum" data-no="240" data-before-text="240"></span>In 1960, loving concern prompted the Society to arrange for African pioneers to serve here in order to contact the local population better. Many people were pleased to have a European, or <em>toubab, </em>come to their homes, but, in general, our message was not taken very seriously. In March of that year, an African pioneer arrived from Cameroon. How he was touched by the warm welcome he received! He carried all his worldly possessions with him in one suitcase as he anxiously stepped off the plane at the airport. Tears of joy streamed down his cheeks when he learned that, to show their appreciation for his coming, the brothers had rented a small apartment and had furnished it with a bed, a stove and the necessary cooking utensils. He was a great help in taking care of the interested Senegalese, who now saw that the truth was not just for the <em>toubab, </em>but for the African as well. That year the brothers rejoiced that 10 Africans were among the 45 present for the Memorial.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">But this intriguing land of contrasts, with its ever-changing climate, can also pose health problems, as Brother and Sister Queyroi learned. How sad they were that they had to leave behind their spiritual brothers and sisters!</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">In the early 1960’s, surely ‘the harvest was great but the workers few’ in Senegal. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:9:37-40:9:38" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 9:37, 38</a>) More workers were needed. Who would answer the call? In the very month of June 1960, when one couple who were full-time servants left, another pioneer couple stepped off the boat in Dakar’s famous international port. Brother and Sister Casimir Krawczyk vividly recall these first impressions:</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">“We were filled with enthusiasm despite the rather rough voyage we had just had. But we noted quite a contrast​—the heat! Would we be able to adapt to the change? With Jehovah’s help we were eager to try.”</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">By working along with the couple about to leave, Brother and Sister Krawczyk were helped to adjust to their new environment. But they comment: “We remember remarking one day how difficult it was to work the territory and especially to make return visits because, in some quarters, all the houses seemed exactly alike. They were just wooden huts leaning together in the hot sand. But someone replied that we could at least be grateful that the houses did not move​—they would always be there in the same place. In time one learns how to distinguish between all the similar dwellings.”</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="ss"><span id="page241" class="pageNum" data-no="241" data-before-text="241"></span><strong>QUEST FOR LEGAL RECOGNITION</strong></p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">An important development that affected the lives of all the people, and which eventually was also to have favorable effects on the witness work, was the granting to Senegal of independence from the French colonial power in 1960. Already in 1958 we had made the first attempts to legalize our work, but without success due to the hostility of the colonial powers toward Jehovah’s Witnesses. Now that independence had been declared, a second attempt was made, in 1961, but again without success, as the same French officials were still directing National Security. When Brother M. G. Henschel stopped at Dakar in 1963, he encouraged us to continue working toward legalizing our work in Senegal. That third attempt, in 1963, brought no reply.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb">Then, beginning in 1964, we pleaded our cause before the director of political affairs, who was involved in the false accusations made against us​—that we are a secret society inciting insubordination, religious hostility, and so forth. The director was invited to attend our meetings and to come unexpectedly. Information on our subjection to the “superior authorities” finally convinced him that Jehovah’s Witnesses respect law and order. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:1-45:13:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 13:1-7</a>) Furthermore, the brother handling our case signed a declaration to the effect that all the accusations made against us were false. A final step was a visit to the Minister of the Interior. Thus the Senegalese authorities were convinced. Their decision to grant us legal recognition certainly was to the government’s credit, for the authorities had refused to base their judgment on the accusations of our enemies, but had examined the case with impartiality.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb">Now that the “Association les Témoins de Jéhovah” was registered, much more could be done in bringing in literature and additional workers for the field in the way of specially trained Gilead School graduates. How evident it is that we must not only pray for things to happen, but also take the initiative in order for God to bless our efforts! And Jehovah’s arm has not been short.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:59:1-23:59:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isa. 59:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="ss"><strong>GETTING BETTER ESTABLISHED</strong></p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb">For several years our work here had continued without the help of Gilead graduates, the first ones having found it necessary to leave. How beneficial it was, then, to have Brother George Amado arrive in Senegal on September 24, 1963, to be followed shortly thereafter by other specially trained missionaries! Now, for the <span id="page242" class="pageNum" data-no="242" data-before-text="242"></span>first time, a missionary home was opened and several special pioneers were invited to come under the missionary arrangement, even though they had not attended Gilead School. This enabled more full-time servants to remain in their assignments.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sb">Up to this point the Kingdom-preaching work in Senegal had been under the direction of the Watch Tower Society’s branch office in Paris, France. But in order to improve the supervision of our activity here, a branch was established in Senegal itself. Thus on August 22, 1965, Emmanuel Paterakis, accompanied by his wife, arrived in this land of contrasts to enjoy the happy privilege of organizing the local branch office. It was to start functioning on September 1, 1965, and also was to care for the Kingdom-proclamation work in The Gambia, Mali and Mauritania. First, a suitable location for the branch-missionary home had to be found​—not an easy task by any means. But with Jehovah’s blessing and through perseverance the local office was set up in Dakar.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="ss"><strong>EXPANDING OUR FIELD OF ACTIVITY</strong></p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="sb">In view of the urgency of the times, arrangements were made to expand the field of activity further in Senegal. Earlier, when the African tribes settled along the Casamance River, they found the area to be very fertile, a land of forests and water, of rice and millet. Ziguinchor became the capital of the Casamance region. Today it is a thriving city of over 72,700 inhabitants. And just as an abundant supply of literal water had been available to the early settlers, so in 1965 refreshing ‘waters of truth’ were made available by other “pioneers” for the benefit of the people of the Casamance region. Two special pioneers were assigned to Ziguinchor, and they found this predominantly Catholic region to be a productive field for cultivation.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sb">But what about other areas in this land of differing customs and languages? These, too, had to be reached. When a missionary couple were expelled from the land of Mali in September of 1965, they were assigned to open up a missionary home in Saint-Louis. This city of some 88,400 residents is located at the mouth of the Senegal River, the important waterway that attracted early desert tribes to this land of contrasts. Saint-Louis, situated mainly on an island, was founded in 1659, when Louis XIV ruled France, and it once was the capital of the French colony in Senegal. Now mainly Moslem, this city has proved to be one of the more difficult territories to develop. Nevertheless, <span id="page243" class="pageNum" data-no="243" data-before-text="243"></span>the first full-time servants to work in Saint-Louis started a number of Bible studies, some of which later bore fruit.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sb">Thiès is a city of some 117,300 inhabitants located about 40 miles (64 kilometers) inland from Dakar. Toward the end of 1965, arrangements were made to cultivate this “field.” Initially, the first two special pioneers had a hard time, as nearly all the streets were of loose, dusty, red sand and even walking was difficult, not to speak of trying to use a bicycle. How refreshing was a cool shower after many hours spent there searching for sheeplike ones among the quaint little shacks and straw huts!</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sb">Public talks were arranged, films produced by the Society were shown and Bible studies were started. Two missionaries assigned to Thiès increased the ranks of workers in the “harvest.” But there were difficulties, too​—opposition from the outside and, due to the unwise conduct of some, problems from the inside. Corrective measures were taken and good results were forthcoming. Today, there are 13 Kingdom publishers in Thiès, assisted by the missionaries now assigned there.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="ss"><strong>UNDETERRED BY OPPOSITION</strong></p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sb">One Catholic woman had chosen to join the Protestants because they were more inclined to read the Bible. Soon she realized that, although they did more Bible reading, they did nothing to help the people understand the Scriptures. Years later, her Moslem husband came home with three booklets he had obtained from one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. He mocked the statement that God had a Son. However, the man’s wife, on reading the booklets, recognized the clear ring of truth and wrote the Society for help. Despite much opposition from her husband, this sincere truth-seeker, along with her young daughter, made efforts to study the Bible. The husband indignantly sent his 17-year-old daughter to Lebanon to learn and practice the Moslem religion. The result? She returned, fully convinced that Jehovah’s Witnesses have the truth!</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sb">Both this girl and her mother were put out of the house by the angry father. But this did not prevent either of them from being baptized in symbol of their dedication to the “God of peace.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:9-50:4:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Phil. 4:9</a>) Despite many trials, they did not waver in faith but became the first Kingdom publishers in Rufisque, a small city several miles down the coast from Dakar.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="ss"><span id="page244" class="pageNum" data-no="244" data-before-text="244"></span><strong>GETTING STARTED IN THE GAMBIA</strong></p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="sb">In 1965, the newly established branch office at Dakar began to care for the Kingdom work in The Gambia, that small country that bites like an alligator snout right into the middle of Senegal. Seemingly, it is only due to its occupation by the colonial powers that The Gambia exists as a country separate from Senegal, as its origin and people are the same. Inasmuch as this land hugging the mighty Gambia River was first penetrated by the English, it was the English language, rather than French, that came to be spoken by many of the local people. In 1816, Captain Alexander Grant founded the city of Bathurst, which has since become the capital, with 50,000 inhabitants. The Gambia itself is the home of about 493,000 people.</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="sb">It is very difficult to determine when the “good news” was first declared in The Gambia. Brothers working in Bathurst (now Banjul) have met persons who have <em>Studies in the Scriptures, </em>books written by Brother C. T. Russell. These publications may have been left by “Bible” Brown, a witness of Jehovah who served in The Gambia for a while years ago. Or perhaps this literature was brought in from Sierra Leone.</p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sb">In 1949, two full-time Kingdom proclaimers entered The Gambia. That year there was considerable activity, with the two missionaries and one congregation publisher reporting the placement of over 1,000 pieces of literature and the conducting of eight home Bible studies. These early missionaries stayed for nearly four years; after they left, the handful of local publishers served for several years without any pioneer help. However, on December 21, 1958, Gilead School graduate Samuel Akinyemi and his wife were assigned to The Gambia. They left family and friends in Nigeria, anxious to tackle the work before them. During this period, The Gambia was cared for by the Society’s branch in Ghana.</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sb">Diligent work by a small nucleus of two special pioneers and two congregation publishers soon produced fine fruit, for a peak of nine publishers reported field service in 1959. Regular visits by zone and circuit overseers did much to build up faith and strengthen the organization. Although 41 persons attended the Memorial of Christ’s death that first year, ties to Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion, were strong, and ancient superstitions and practices were deep-rooted. Few embraced the truth, and The Gambia has proved to be a rather difficult assignment for Kingdom proclaimers.</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="ss"><span id="page245" class="pageNum" data-no="245" data-before-text="245"></span><strong>CLERICS CRY OUT</strong></p>
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="sb">The distressed cries of Christendom’s false religious shepherds soon were heard ringing throughout the land. They were trying hard to put out the light of truth that was now beginning to shine. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:43:3-19:43:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 43:3</a>) Only 10 months after their arrival, or on October 16, 1959, Brother and Sister Akinyemi were notified by the local police that they were prohibited immigrants and had 14 days in which to leave The Gambia. And the reason for this action? They were “Jehovah’s Witnesses.” That was all! But the case was taken to court in order to ‘defend and legally establish the good news,’ and the brothers were blessed with victory, enabling the special pioneers to stay in The Gambia.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:7-50:1:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Phil. 1:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="sb">The Anglican clergy threatened the proprietor of a local theater where our meetings were being held. Refusing to be intimidated, the man stated: “These people are talking about God, not the Devil. So why should I drive them out, if I am a man of God myself? No! I will refuse to do as the priests say!”</p>
<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="sb">As of December 1960, the Kingdom work in The Gambia came under the direction of the Society’s branch office in Sierra Leone. The regular visits of traveling overseers proved very upbuilding spiritually and resulted in a peak of 15 publishers in 1961.</p>
<p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="sb">The years 1961 and 1962 brought action on the legal scene, for the authorities were bent on labeling Jehovah’s Witnesses as prohibited immigrants. Two cases, involving two special pioneers from Sierra Leone and a visiting circuit overseer, were taken to the Supreme Court and were decided in our favor​—an evident proof that Jehovah was backing his servants! Thus a door for increasing activity remained open.</p>
<p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="sb">Another milestone was the formation, in 1962, of the first Gambian congregation of Jehovah’s people. Also, the law declaring Jehovah’s Witnesses prohibited immigrants was rescinded, giving the brothers greater freedom and peace of mind. Then in September 1965, the newly organized branch in Senegal began caring for the needs of the Gambian brothers. That same year, regular visits of the circuit overseer from Senegal contributed toward the steady advancement of theocratic activities in The Gambia. It was much nearer for Gambian Witnesses to attend circuit and district assemblies in Dakar, where a special program in English was arranged for them.</p>
<p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="sb">Now that the law branding Jehovah’s Witnesses as prohibited immigrants had been rescinded, would it be <span id="page246" class="pageNum" data-no="246" data-before-text="246"></span>possible to have our missionaries come in to give a helping hand? An effort to that end was made in 1967, but without success. The authorities have put out an order limiting to three the number of foreign representatives that Jehovah’s Witnesses can have in The Gambia. Despite consistent efforts by the Society and local brothers to have this order removed, no missionaries or other full-time servants have been able to enter The Gambia to bolster up the small congregation in Banjul.</p>
<p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="ss"><strong>THE “GOOD NEWS” REACHES MALI</strong></p>
<p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="sb">A third West African country that came under the care of the Society’s Senegal branch was Mali. A huge inland area reaching well into the Sahara Desert and bordered by Algeria on the north, Mali is a land of sand​—hot, dusty sand under a burning sun—​mainly in the northern Sahelian and Saharan regions. However, the southern regions, especially the part watered by the majestic Niger River, are green, with some forests and luxurious vegetation. The beautiful capital city of Bamako lies on both banks of the Niger River.</p>
<p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="sb">Mali’s 5,000,000 inhabitants, ranging from white Arabian desert nomads to dark-skinned African tribesmen, are a friendly, hospitable people, contrasting sharply with the uninviting desert that surrounds them. The first “waters” of truth began to flow in Mali during 1962 when the Society invited four Ghanian brothers to open up the field there. After a ‘crash course’ in French at Abidjan, Ivory Coast, Brother Ewuley Sarpey and his three companions were eagerly anticipating their new assignment. Would it be very different from Ghana?</p>
<p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="sb">It certainly proved to be! At first the scorching sun seemed almost unbearable, but the four Kingdom proclaimers soon learned to take advantage of the cooler hours of the day. Meetings for field service were at seven o’clock in the morning. After about three hours of service, trudging along in the hot, loose sand, it was time to head for the cooler protection of home to rest, eat and take a much-needed siesta before preparing to leave for the field again at four o’clock in the afternoon. Often, the work would continue into the cooler hours of the late evening.</p>
<p id="p70" data-pid="70" class="sb">Two of these pioneers returned to Ghana in 1964. To replace them, special pioneers Rene Peyronnet and his wife were invited to leave their assignment in Algeria to give a helping hand in Mali. But the climate can be harsh and, after only a few months, health <span id="page247" class="pageNum" data-no="247" data-before-text="247"></span>problems came up that necessitated their return to France. They were replaced on May 10, 1964, by Brother and Sister Lucien Frizon, who were assigned to the city of Bamako.</p>
<p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="sb">The people of Bamako lived within small, crowded courtyards with several families very close together, often sharing the small dwellings. Animals mingled freely with the chattering women who might be preparing a meal. And in the middle of all this commotion, as if in another world, an elderly Moslem might be sitting on a straw mat under a mango tree with a kettle of water at his side. The water would serve for his ablutions before praying. It was not easy to penetrate the thinking of such people.</p>
<p id="p72" data-pid="72" class="sb">In this primitive setting, the “good news” was to be declared. Praying for the aid of Jehovah’s spirit, the pioneers tackled the work at hand. Tirelessly, day after day, they served, faithfully declaring a message of peace and comfort. They were joined by another special pioneer couple in the summer of 1965. But the message of God’s kingdom was not welcomed by all, and soon official interference was experienced. In September of 1965, just as the Kingdom-preaching work came under the care of the newly established branch office in Senegal, the four special pioneers were deported from Mali. All were reassigned to Senegal.</p>
<p id="p73" data-pid="73" class="sb">But the Adversary has not been able to burn up the seeds of truth that were planted and then sprouted in Mali. Brother Sarpey remained in Mali and carried on faithfully there as a special pioneer, also caring for his wife and two children. Brother John Ansah, then a very zealous regular pioneer, was of great help at this critical time due to his friendly contacts with men in authority. What a blessing it is for our work that Brother Ansah continues in full-time service, now as a special pioneer! Indeed, he provides a fine example of endurance and perseverance!</p>
<p id="p74" data-pid="74" class="ss"><strong>EARLY EFFORTS IN MAURITANIA</strong></p>
<p id="p75" data-pid="75" class="sb">The work of declaring the “good news” in the sparsely settled Islamic Republic of Mauritania also is supervised by the Society’s branch office in Dakar. In 1966 the first reports of witnessing activity were received from that territory. This indicated the existence of a small spiritual oasis for the desert dwellers of that land. The populace, composed mainly of wandering Arabian tribes, enjoy few modern conveniences, and the camel remains one of the chief means of transportation. The official language is French, although <span id="page248" class="pageNum" data-no="248" data-before-text="248"></span>Arabic is the national tongue and is spoken by most of the inhabitants. But the official attitude toward our work is very unfavorable, and it is not easy to make disciples under the present conditions. The two publishers in 1966 were sisters, the wives of men sent to Mauritania on work contracts. They left the country at the end of May 1967.</p>
<p id="p76" data-pid="76" class="sb">Nevertheless, the light of truth was kept burning in Mauritania by a brother who moved to the capital, Nouakchott, at the end of 1968. Although newly baptized, he accomplished much in distributing our literature and in starting some home Bible studies. Later, when he moved to France, an isolated publisher at Rosso, on the Senegalese border, began to witness each month. This interested woman was able to travel to Dakar quite frequently and thus could receive spiritual encouragement. Additionally, a sister in Dakar conducted a Bible study with her by mail.</p>
<p id="p77" data-pid="77" class="ss"><strong>FURTHER PROGRESS IN SENEGAL</strong></p>
<p id="p78" data-pid="78" class="sb">Our work in Senegal continued to move ahead, and, after the branch office was set up in Dakar, the closer supervision resulted in a real strengthening of the local organization. There was an increase of 33 percent, with 98 publishers reporting in 1966, including 16 special pioneers and missionaries. Regular circuit and district assemblies contributed to greater spirituality.</p>
<p id="p79" data-pid="79" class="sb">In 1967, about 15 years after the first rays of truth shone in this land of contrasts, the number of 100 publishers was surpassed, with a peak of 120 engaging in the service. Enthusiastic reports were coming in regularly from Saint-Louis, Thiès and Ziguinchor. The two congregations in Dakar were expanding steadily, despite the large number of brothers leaving Senegal each year because of the government’s program of “Senegalization” of jobs. Twenty full-time Kingdom proclaimers were spearheading the activity, constantly combing the diversified territory. What a thrill to see 268 gathered for the Memorial celebration that year! Senegal is a fisherman’s paradise and also, in keeping with Jesus’ words, more and more men were being ‘caught alive’ and were being trained to let down their spiritual nets for a catch.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:5:9-42:5:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Luke 5:9-11</a>.</p>
<p id="p80" data-pid="80" class="sb">The publications of the Society certainly have served well here in getting people acquainted with their Creator, Jehovah God. Particularly is the <em>Awake! </em>magazine well known. Its value is recognized by people in all positions, and almost everyone contacted has either read or seen <em>Awake! </em>Many listen with respect when <span id="page249" class="pageNum" data-no="249" data-before-text="249"></span>they learn that the publishers of this magazine are Jehovah’s Witnesses. Frequently, we are stopped on the street and asked for the latest copy, and many Bible studies have been started, thanks to <em>Awake!</em></p>
<p id="p81" data-pid="81" class="sb">During the late 1960’s, the ranks of full-time servants in Senegal were growing steadily. The year 1968 saw more missionaries enter this land of contrasts, with a new peak of 139 publishers being reached and 339 gathering together in commemoration of Jesus’ death. For the first time, total hours spent in the witnessing work surpassed 50,000, with 266 Bible studies being conducted each month. The stage was being set for future growth.</p>
<p id="p82" data-pid="82" class="ss"><strong>“PEACE ON EARTH” ASSEMBLIES</strong></p>
<p id="p83" data-pid="83" class="sb">And what blessings 1969 had in store! With the help of the generous contributions of the brothers throughout the world, many of the missionaries were privileged to attend one of the “Peace on Earth” International Assemblies in Europe or America. What a joy! In addition to the missionaries, more than 50 of the local Witnesses attended assemblies in Paris, Nuremberg and New York. The three special pioneers then serving in The Gambia went to an assembly in London, England. All conventioners returned refreshed and strengthened for the work ahead.</p>
<p id="p84" data-pid="84" class="sb">Of course, many could not leave Senegal to attend one of the larger assemblies in 1969. So, the “Peace on Earth” District Assembly held in Dakar from December 25 to 28 had special import for them. Thirteen newly dedicated persons stood up to answer <em>“Oui<strong>” </strong></em><strong></strong>to the two questions posed during the baptismal talk.</p>
<p id="p85" data-pid="85" class="sb">Hence, 1969 proved to have many blessings for the work of making disciples in this land of contrasts: a new peak of 158 publishers, a 15-percent increase in Kingdom proclaimers, and 30 pioneers active in field service, 19 of whom were specially trained Gilead graduates. Also, the Memorial attendance was 383.</p>
<p id="p86" data-pid="86" class="ss"><strong>WE ENTER THE 1970’S</strong></p>
<p id="p87" data-pid="87" class="sb">But what would the 1970’s bring? Unfair action against Jehovah’s Witnesses was taken in certain lands of Africa. How would this affect God’s people in other African countries?</p>
<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sb">Often at the instigation of the clergy, unfavorable publicity began to appear in certain religious papers. The brothers were encouraged to progress spiritually and to instill the truth in the hearts of new ones so that they could withstand the test of persecution. The <span id="page250" class="pageNum" data-no="250" data-before-text="250"></span>result? More increase, in that 22 were baptized during the 1970 service year.</p>
<p id="p89" data-pid="89" class="ss"><strong>AN EXCEPTIONAL GATHERING</strong></p>
<p id="p90" data-pid="90" class="sb">The year 1970 concluded with something special to the praise of Jehovah​—an exceptional assembly from December 1 to 4. For Senegalese Christians, this “Men of Goodwill” District Assembly proved to be the most important event up to that point. How thankful we were that Jehovah and his visible organization had so lovingly arranged the visit of 140 brothers and sisters from the United States and Canada! Their presence transformed the small oasis of the Dakar Congregation into a larger garden and gave the assembly a truly international flavor.</p>
<p id="p91" data-pid="91" class="sb">A special effort was made to give the visiting brothers a taste of the real Africa. They were accommodated in African-style “huts” with thatched roofs. Also, a special program was prepared, mainly by the local missionaries, to make the life and scenes of Africa unfold before our visitors’ eyes right at the assembly hall. A market scene in Senegal, the witnessing work here, many customs, local songs and dances​—all of these were part of the special program.</p>
<p id="p92" data-pid="92" class="sb">This was a never-to-be-forgotten assembly, exceptional in so many ways. Twenty-five candidates presented themselves for baptism, which was more than had ever been immersed in Senegal during a whole year up to that time!</p>
<p id="p93" data-pid="93" class="ss"><strong>A LOOK AT OUR PROGRESS</strong></p>
<p id="p94" data-pid="94" class="sb">Interestingly, although it had taken 17 years’ work to reach the first 100 Kingdom witnesses in Senegal, in just four more years the 200 mark was passed, for 207 shared in declaring the “good news” during April 1971. And an indication of the potential for future growth in Senegal was the number observing the Memorial that year​—459 persons!</p>
<p id="p95" data-pid="95" class="sb">In The Gambia the brothers were carrying on steadfastly despite their rather difficult assignment. They rejoiced in seeing 24 persons gathered together for the Memorial in 1971, a real source of encouragement to the seven local publishers. The small isolated group then in Mali was receiving help from a special pioneer and a regular pioneer. During 1971, Mauritania had three isolated publishers reporting field service activity. That year, for the first time, the Memorial was celebrated in Mauritania, with 22 persons in attendance.</p>
<p id="p96" data-pid="96" class="sb"><span id="page251" class="pageNum" data-no="251" data-before-text="251"></span>How encouraging it was to see 45 persons baptized in Senegal during 1972, the most ever in one year! A Memorial attendance of 577 and a peak of 241 publishers brought us joy. Whereas it had taken 21 years to reach 200 publishers, in just three years (1971 to 1974) the 300-publisher mark was passed. We were overjoyed at seeing 302 in field service in 1974, and a Memorial attendance of 705, a leap of more than 100 over the previous year. An event that certainly contributed to this increase was the “Divine Victory” International Assembly, the most refreshing event of 1973. About 100 visiting brothers from distant lands stimulated us by their presence. The peak attendance was 510, the highest ever up till then, and 23 individuals were baptized. Those in attendance made the firm resolution to share in Jehovah’s victory by staying faithful.</p>
<p id="p97" data-pid="97" class="sb">The increase continued to be encouraging, with 327 Kingdom proclaimers in 1975 and a fine Memorial attendance of 826. But most of these new ones live in the big cities, especially Dakar. What about the small villages, many of which never had received a witness?</p>
<p id="p98" data-pid="98" class="ss"><strong>“FROM VILLAGE TO VILLAGE”</strong></p>
<p id="p99" data-pid="99" class="sb">During the 1976 service year, concerted efforts were made to visit large portions of unassigned territory. Problems were encountered because of the lack of good roads, but with Jehovah’s help much good was accomplished, as the following comments reveal:</p>
<p id="p100" data-pid="100" class="sb">“We prepared well, with a supply of food and cooking equipment, a tent and much literature. The main problems, apart from the poor roads, were illiteracy and our own ignorance of local dialects. With the help of volunteer interpreters and tape recordings in the main dialects, however, we made out well. In one village the chief eagerly accepted a set of books, and, seeing their value, led us to the village meeting place where we waited while he went from hut to hut, inviting everyone to come there. In less than half an hour 50 books were placed.</p>
<p id="p101" data-pid="101" class="sb">“Due to the condition of the tracks between villages, we sometimes used the ‘beach highway,’ skirting rocks and trying not to get bogged down in the sand. Once we were brought to a rapid halt when a jagged piece of wood, hidden by the sand, punctured two tires! Hastily, we rented a cart to carry the wheels to a nearby village for repair before the incoming tide could wash away the car and its contents. We made it! In four days, during which we visited 20 villages, we distributed 347 Bibles and books, 320 booklets and 663 <span id="page253" class="pageNum" data-no="253" data-before-text="253"></span>magazines, and more than 20 subscriptions were obtained.”</p>
<p id="p102" data-pid="102" class="sb">We pray for Jehovah’s continued blessing on those who find joy in declaring the “good news” in such territories. Like Jesus, Senegalese Christians are spreading the Kingdom message, not only in the cities, but also “from village to village.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:8:1-42:8:1" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 8:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p103" data-pid="103" class="ss"><strong>FAITH THAT SUSTAINS</strong></p>
<p id="p104" data-pid="104" class="sb">The number of publishers continued to grow. Senegal’s Memorial attendance for 1976 was 835, showing fine potential, and 1977 saw a peak of 334 participants in field service. Sometimes the increase is quite slow. But what of those already in the truth? Are they firmly anchored in the faith? Some do fall away, but the majority have become strong in faith, and the increase is in quality as well as quantity.</p>
<p id="p105" data-pid="105" class="sb">An example of this can be seen in connection with the Fourcault family. We have already mentioned how they found the truth. Yet, how strong would their faith be in the face of terrible calamities? First, an automobile accident severely injured all members of the family, except the two oldest boys. Most were confined to hospital beds. Nevertheless, family faith was maintained by regular Bible study together, and this time of distress showed the vital importance of developing spirituality. To this end the pioneer spirit was cultivated. Henri, the eldest boy, took up regular full-time service and then special pioneering. His brother Jean-Marc did the same thing a little later. Their mother became a regular pioneer. Soon, though, this zealous and united family faced an even greater time of crisis. Sister Fourcault entered the hospital for a serious operation. She made wise use of her time, witnessing and starting a Bible study in the ward. Then tragedy struck again! Just before Sister Fourcault was to leave the hospital, she died suddenly, due to a blood clot.</p>
<p id="p106" data-pid="106" class="sb">Sister Fourcault would have been happy to see the mature reaction of the family, including the little ones. Their faith in the resurrection was wonderful to observe. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="11-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:11:21-43:11:25" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 11:21-25</a>) The only daughter, Sylvie, 11 years old at the time, courageously gave her first presentation in the Theocratic School a few short hours after the funeral. Her hospitalized mother had been promised that this part of the program would be tape-recorded for her benefit, and this was done in spite of her death. When presented with the tape, little <span id="page254" class="pageNum" data-no="254" data-before-text="254"></span>Sylvie held it to her heart and said earnestly: “I shall keep this very carefully, so that after the resurrection my mother will be able to hear my first sermon.”</p>
<p id="p107" data-pid="107" class="sb">The three oldest Fourcault boys now are in full-time service. Two of them have studied at Gilead School, Henri attending the fifty-fifth class, and Jean-Marc the fifty-ninth. They have returned to serve in Senegal.</p>
<p id="p108" data-pid="108" class="ss"><strong>ACTIVE FAITH AMONG THE GAMBIANS</strong></p>
<p id="p109" data-pid="109" class="sb">The Gambia, too, has its examples of faithfulness. Ralph Phillott, a loyal elder in the Banjul Congregation, died after a long period of bad health. A fine witness was given to the hundreds of people attending the funeral talk.</p>
<p id="p110" data-pid="110" class="sb">A very important event for our brothers in The Gambia was the outstanding circuit assembly held in May 1976. For the first time, three were baptized at a Banjul assembly. Two were local Gambians. One had first been contacted in 1959. For years he had frequented the congregation, at the same time trying to reform his church. Finally, he saw the need to get out of Babylon the Great, and thereafter he got baptized. A woman immersed at the same time is a well-known retired schoolteacher, and their baptism in the Gambia River was a fine witness to the community.</p>
<p id="p111" data-pid="111" class="sb">What a pleasure it was to see a 67-percent increase in publishers in The Gambia during 1977, with a peak of 11 Kingdom proclaimers! The recent campaign of sending letters to members of the medical profession, along with the booklet <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses and the Question of Blood, </em>has helped to make our work and Scriptural position better known in that country.</p>
<p id="p112" data-pid="112" class="sb">The little group of publishers in the city of Banjul are grateful that, each time a zone visit is planned for West Africa, they are not forgotten. In February 1978, they seem to have received C. W. Barber of the Governing Body, his wife, and his traveling associate David Mercante, with as much joy as the early Christians had when they were visited by the apostle Paul. A total of 38 persons attended the special meeting held during this zone visit to The Gambia.</p>
<p id="p113" data-pid="113" class="ss"><strong>MALI’S CHRISTIANS ENJOY RICH BLESSINGS</strong></p>
<p id="p114" data-pid="114" class="sb">An important milestone in the history of our work in Mali was reached during January 1973, when three special pioneers moved from Dakar to Bamako. Their earnest efforts amid difficult conditions have produced <span id="page255" class="pageNum" data-no="255" data-before-text="255"></span>fine results. Monthly, they spend up to 200 hours in field service, place an average of 300 magazines and conduct up to 23 Bible studies each! One pioneer obtained 100 subscriptions in a month. A fine increase followed. During 1973 there were only 7 Witnesses in Mali, including the pioneers. But in 1975, 23 were declaring the “good news,” and 1977 saw 32 Kingdom announcers in the field.</p>
<p id="p115" data-pid="115" class="sb">The “Joyful Workers” District Assembly in December 1977 proved to be of great encouragement to the Malian brothers who were able to travel to Dakar, Senegal. They were deeply impressed by the Christian hospitality and friendship they experienced, and several were planning to be present at the 1978 “Victorious Faith” International Convention in Paris. Of course, the same rich spiritual banquet was planned for the Dakar assembly in December 1978.</p>
<p id="p116" data-pid="116" class="ss"><strong>WE CONTINUE CALLING OUT TO “THIRSTY ONES”</strong></p>
<p id="p117" data-pid="117" class="sb">In Senegal’s eight congregations, 56 pioneers and missionaries are working shoulder to shoulder with some 300 fellow believers. True, the more than 380 Kingdom proclaimers in Senegal, Mali, The Gambia and Mauritania are seemingly an insignificant handful when compared with a total population of around 11,000,000. Yet, confident in Jehovah, they continue to combat spiritual drought.</p>
<p id="p118" data-pid="118" class="sb">Although some have lost their spiritual vision in recent years, “the solid foundation of God stays standing,” and “Jehovah knows those who belong to him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:19-55:2:19" data-bid="12-1" class="b">2 Tim. 2:19</a>) Thus, with ever-renewed zeal, happy declarers of the “good news” continue inviting the honesthearted to ‘come and take life’s water free.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:22:17-66:22:17" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Rev. 22:17</a>) In Senegal, this land of contrasts that is severely affected by persisting drought, we keep on serving Jehovah and preparing for the day when, like the spiritual paradise of the present time, “the wilderness and the waterless region will exult, and the desert plain will be joyful and blossom as the saffron.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:1-23:35:1" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Isa. 35:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p119" data-pid="119" class="sb">In the meantime, like small oases in parched country, Jehovah’s faithful servants in Senegal, Mali, Mauritania and The Gambia will keep on sounding out the heartwarming invitation to come to the Fountain of all waters, Jehovah God. In unison with our fellow believers earth wide, we continue crying out: “Hey there, all you thirsty ones! Come to the water. . . . Listen, and your soul will keep alive.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:1-23:55:3" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Isa. 55:1-3</a>.</p>

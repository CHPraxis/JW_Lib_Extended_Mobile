<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A Bible-based publication especially designed to aid young persons has enjoyed wide acceptance among students and educators in Australia. For instance, in one letter received by the Watch Tower Society’s branch office in that country, 200 copies of the book “Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It” were ordered.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The letter was signed by a priest from a Catholic college. When 200 copies of the book were delivered, some reference was made to the priest’s obtaining of approval from his superiors before distributing the publications to his students. His reply was that this would pose no problem since he was the head teacher of the college. The priest originally had obtained a copy of the “Youth” book while visiting patients in a hospital. He had come to the bed of a young Kingdom publisher who had taken advantage of the opportunity thus afforded to give the priest a witness.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In one Australian city, four Christian witnesses of Jehovah listed 20 public, private and religious schools in their territory. These women first approached the principal or head teacher and offered a copy of the “Youth” book for the school library. None were refused. One teacher obtained 20 copies for use in study groups. In visiting the first 10 schools, these Kingdom proclaimers placed more than 300 copies of the “Youth” book.</p>

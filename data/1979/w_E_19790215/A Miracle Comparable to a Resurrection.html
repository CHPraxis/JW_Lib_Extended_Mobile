<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">At the age of 99, Abraham was too old to father a child. But his advanced years were no obstacle to the Creator’s reviving his reproductive powers, making it possible for Abraham to have Isaac by his beloved Sarah whose reproductive powers were also restored. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:17:17-1:17:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gen. 17:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:21:1-1:21:2" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 21:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:4:19-45:4:19" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Rom. 4:19</a>) Since this miracle involved the restoration of living cells, it was indeed comparable to a resurrection. Amazingly, this was no temporary revival of Abraham’s ability to father children. After Sarah’s death, when Abraham took another wife, Keturah, he had six more sons​—Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak and Shuah. Hence, more than 40 years after his reproductive powers were revived Abraham still had the ability to procreate. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:23:1-1:23:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Gen. 23:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:25:1-1:25:2" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 25:1, 2</a>) This well illustrates what the angel Gabriel told the virgin Mary many centuries later: “With God no declaration will be an impossibility.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:37-42:1:37" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 1:37</a>) The miracle also provides assurance respecting the certainty of the resurrection hope.</p>

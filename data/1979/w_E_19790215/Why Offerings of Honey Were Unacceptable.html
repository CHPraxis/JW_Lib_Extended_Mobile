<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">God’s law to Israel stated: “You must make no sour dough and no honey at all smoke as an offering made by fire to Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:2:11-3:2:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Lev. 2:11</a>) The particular honey referred to is evidently the syrup of fruits, since such honey, not bees’ honey, could be spoken of as being firstfruits. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:2:12-3:2:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Lev. 2:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:31:5-14:31:5" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2 Chron. 31:5</a>) The honey of fruits could ferment and, therefore, was rightly prohibited as an offering upon the altar.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">When presenting an animal sacrifice at the sanctuary, an Israelite would place his hand on the head of the bull, sheep or goat. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:1:4-3:1:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Lev. 1:4</a>) This act signified that the individual acknowledged the offering as his and that it was being presented in his behalf.</p>

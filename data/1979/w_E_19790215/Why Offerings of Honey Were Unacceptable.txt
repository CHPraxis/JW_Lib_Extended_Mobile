Why Offerings of Honey Were Unacceptable
God’s law to Israel stated: “You must make no sour dough and no honey at all smoke as an offering made by fire to Jehovah.” (Lev. 2:11) The particular honey referred to is evidently the syrup of fruits, since such honey, not bees’ honey, could be spoken of as being firstfruits. (Lev. 2:12; 2 Chron. 31:5) The honey of fruits could ferment and, therefore, was rightly prohibited as an offering upon the altar.

Question Box
● What benefit is there in reporting our field service?
A “good report” is said to have the same uplifting and refreshing effect as cold water on a tired soul. (Prov. 25:25) For example, how encouraging it was for us to read in the July Our Kingdom Service that we had an all-time peak of 51,008 auxiliary pioneers in April and that over one million more hours were spent in field service that month than a year ago! Such thrilling reports certainly bring us great joy and refreshment!
An accurate and complete report from us also enables the Society to plan its activities properly, especially in estimating and anticipating the amount of literature we need in our Kingdom-witnessing and disciple-making work. Also, such reports are used to identify places where there may be a greater need, so that assistance can be directed to such areas to further spread the Kingdom good news.—Mark 13:10.
But, what is it that makes possible such encouraging and helpful reports? It is basically the conscientious effort of each Kingdom publisher in turning in reports regularly each month that enables the branch office to compile and publish composite reports for the encouragement of all. So, while it may be a small thing in itself, our reporting regularly can be viewed as one of the things we can personally do to build up and encourage our brothers world wide. Is that not worthy of our concern and effort? Hence, report regularly yourself and also help others to do so. Book study conductors and the service overseer particularly can take the lead in doing this. Such helpful reminders should be given and accepted in the spirit of love. May we have concern for one another with a view to making a good report.—1 Cor. 10:24.

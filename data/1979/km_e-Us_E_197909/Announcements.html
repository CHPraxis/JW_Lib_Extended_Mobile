<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn">● At times mail addressed to the Kingdom Hall is returned to the Society or to others who write. It is marked as being undeliverable for various reasons, usually because there is no mailbox for receiving mail. We recommend that at the next elders’ meeting the presiding overseer discuss with the body of elders how this can be remedied. If there is a problem at the local post office, this can be discussed with an official at the post office in an effort to clear it up.</p>

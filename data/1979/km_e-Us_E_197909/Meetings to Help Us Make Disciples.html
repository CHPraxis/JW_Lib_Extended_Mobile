<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>“<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:201979322/">Help One Another to Serve Regularly</a>.” Stimulating talk based on article. Emphasize need to keep personally strong by serving regularly; also to assist others who need some help. In considering paragraph 5, include demonstration of experienced publisher calling on one who has not recently associated. Start with discussion of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:5-61:1:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Peter 1:5-8</a> and share points learned from talk “Neither Inactive nor Unfruitful,” Saturday afternoon of “Living Hope” District Convention. Select a few of the qualities mentioned in verses and bring in appropriate points remembered from talk. For example, on FAITH: Loss of faith can begin with “clean” association with nice neighbors, workmates, and so forth, or by being so wrapped up in daily concerns for life that one thinks about God less and less. Each day must give thought to fact that God exists and not let busy schedule crowd out prayers and Bible reading. On SELF-CONTROL: May need self-control in things not wrong in themselves—when to turn off TV or leave friend’s house. Getting more rest may help enjoy service and meetings more. For God’s spirit to help us, must learn to say “No” when faced with temptation. It is love of God and neighbor that motivates us to action and fruitfulness, but need to deepen love so it not only exists, but “overflows,” making works not forced, but spontaneous from heart. After discussion, tactfully invite and arrange to go to Kingdom Hall together on Sunday. Chairman concludes part by considering <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:58-46:15:58" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>.</p>

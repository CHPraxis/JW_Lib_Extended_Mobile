<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Have you read recent issues of <em>The Watchtower </em>carefully? If so, you will doubtless recall these points:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>● How does Jehovah God draw individuals to himself?</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">He does this by making it possible for them to hear about his arrangement for salvation through Jesus Christ. Then the Most High enables individuals to develop heart appreciation for the grand benefits that result from being in union with the Son.​—4/15 p. 14.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>● For a congregation of God’s people to be happy, how should every member of it be viewed?</strong></p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>● </strong><strong>As shown at </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:49:20-19:49:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 49:20</strong></a><strong>, when is a man “comparable with the beasts”?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The man who does not understand or appreciate spiritual things and makes no room for the Creator in his life can be compared to an unreasoning animal that has no capacity for worshiping God.​—5/1 p. 11.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>● What factors determine whether a person can acceptably approach God in prayer?</strong></p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>● During what period may David have experienced the sickness referred to in </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:41:0-19:41:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 41</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">This may have been while his son Absalom was plotting to seize the throne. The fact that <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:41:0-19:41:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 41</a> refers to a trusted companion who turned against David lends support to this conclusion. David’s personal adviser Ahithophel traitorously cast in his lot with Absalom.​—6/1 pp. 30, 31.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn"><strong>● What proves that infants will be resurrected?</strong></p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:31:15-24:31:15" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Jer. 31:15</a>) The prophecy says further: “‘Hold back your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears, for there exists a reward for your activity,’ is the utterance of Jehovah, ‘and they will certainly return from the land of the enemy.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:31:16-24:31:16" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Jer. 31:16</a>) Only by being raised from the dead could those slaughtered infants return from Sheol, to the comfort of the mothers who lost them in death.​—6/15 pp. 18, 19.</p>

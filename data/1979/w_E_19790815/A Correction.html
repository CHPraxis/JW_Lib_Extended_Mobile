<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In making the <em>New World Translation </em>of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:23:21-3:23:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Leviticus 23:21</a>, the Hebrew יהיה (“it will be”) was misread as יהוה (“Jehovah”). Hence, the first sentence of this verse should read: “And you must make a proclamation on this very day; there will be a holy convention for yourselves.”</p>

New Peak in Memorial Attendance!
We are happy to report that on April 11, 1979, the Memorial attendance was 1,335,268 in the United States. This is a 5.6% increase over last year—a genuine cause for rejoicing! We pray that these hundreds of thousands of interested persons who attended the Memorial this year will make further progress in their association with Jehovah’s people. To that end, let us continue in our efforts to help them derive the greatest benefits from the spiritual provisions of the congregation.

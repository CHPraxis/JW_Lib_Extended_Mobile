<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Literature offer for August: <em>My Book of Bible Stories </em>for $2.00. Or, alternative offer of three pocket-size books for $1.00 for those who do not prefer a book for children.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● Since the Society receives quite a number of inquiries relating to gifts and wills and the conditional donation arrangement, it may prove helpful to read to the congregation again the Society’s letter of last year. Especially is this suggested if, for some reason, it was not read to the congregation before. With this letter, enclosures were sent. These were to be placed in the congregation file by the secretary who is to make them available to any who request to read them.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● As of July 1, the Society is producing <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>two Braille <em>Watchtower </em>magazines each month. Henceforth, the Braille edition will be available on a subscription basis only, the partnership arrangement for exchanging magazines being discontinued. The subscription rate is $6.00 per year. Other publications are available in Braille. Those who are interested should write the Society, Attention: Braille Desk.</p>

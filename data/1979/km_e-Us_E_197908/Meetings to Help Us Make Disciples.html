Tells her about a newer sister in the group with a family and a busy schedule who appears to be in need of assistance. Asks her if she would be willing to work with her for a day or two, depending on the need, when they are able to do so. She is agreeable; willingly offers to help. <em>Scene 2: </em>Later, she approaches the other sister. Inquires how she is getting along and suggests the possibility of working together. Explains that she feels that preparing for service together with someone else and working with them would be mutually encouraging. Tells her that she would enjoy her company and likely each of them would do much to assist the other. Sister is pleased, readily agrees. They discuss tentative plans for the coming week. Both optimistic about the outcome. <em>Scene 3: </em>These two sisters are conversing with study conductor after the book study, relating experience they had in service.

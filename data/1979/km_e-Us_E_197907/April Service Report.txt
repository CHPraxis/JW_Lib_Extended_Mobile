WELL DONE!
The service report for April was excellent! An all-time peak of 51,008 auxiliary pioneers! The total in hours surpassed last April by more than a million! There were also excellent increases in placements, Bible studies and the number baptized. This fine effort gives cause to rejoice. Keep up the good work!

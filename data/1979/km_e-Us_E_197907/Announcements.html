<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● When publishers move and will be associated with a different congregation, it is a loving kindness to advise the new congregation so that there will be no delay in welcoming them and otherwise rendering assistance as needed. The secretary can be sure to follow through on this as soon as he learns that publishers will be moving. In connection with his report on the congregation, the circuit overseer will continue to inquire about this at the time of his visit.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● Starting in September the circuit overseers will be giving a slide presentation entitled: “The Bible—A Book for <em>This </em>Generation.” District overseers will be speaking on the topic: “Whose Disciple Are You?”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">● When the service overseer is selected by the body of elders during the circuit overseer’s visit, the congregation can be informed without first awaiting the return of the form on which new appointments are made. The elders decide who will fill this position just as they decide who will serve as <em>Watchtower </em>conductor and school overseer.</p>

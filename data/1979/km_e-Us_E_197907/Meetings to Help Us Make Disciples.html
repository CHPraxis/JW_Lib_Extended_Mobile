Elder discusses with group of young folks practical points from <a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:1101976079/">chapter 9 of <em>Youth</em></a> book, “Are You Bored at Home?” (See also <a class="xt" data-xtid="2" href="jwpub://p/E:1976641/10:806-15:849"><em>w76 </em>9/1 p. 519</a>.) Not only at home, but are you bored at meetings, in field service, at school? Why? What is remedy? The following questions may be used or adapted in conducting the discussion: (1) What natural factors in growing up contribute to being bored at times? (2) How does one’s own attitude determine to a large extent whether one becomes bored or not? (3) What can you do personally to improve the spirit in your home? (4) When you get assignments at home, at school or otherwise, why is it helpful to see how such assignments may affect your life now and in the future? To relieve boredom, why can it make a difference if you do things for others? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:3-50:2:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Phil. 2:3, 4</a>) (5) Why does preparing for and commenting at meetings help to make them more interesting? (6) How will keeping in mind the reasons why we share in the preaching work help you have joy in the service? (7) Why is the complaint, “There’s nothing to do,” not a valid one? (8) Why are endurance and faith important in conquering boredom? Elder concludes with admonition to youth in congregation to fight boredom by being active in Jehovah’s service, including also commendation for what is being done by young ones to serve Jehovah and keep strong in faith despite the allures of this world and problems “incidental to youth.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:22-55:2:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Tim. 2:22</a>.</p>

(See <a class="xt" data-xtid="13" href="jwpub://p/E:1976250/1-20$p/E:1976251/"><em>w76 </em>4/1 pp. 220-222;</a> <em>or </em>p. 108, 109.)</p>

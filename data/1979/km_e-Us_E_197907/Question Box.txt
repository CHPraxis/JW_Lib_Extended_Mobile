‚óè What is the correct way to count meeting attendance?
All adults should be counted. And how old should children be in order to be counted? A definite age has not been set. Rather, if the attendant believes that a child is benefiting and learning from the meeting, even to a limited extent, he should be counted. So, while young children may not pay the very best attention all through the meeting, if they nonetheless benefit and learn something, they should be counted. (Neh. 8:2) Parents are truly wise when they teach their children to pay attention rather than provide coloring books or other things that hinder children from listening and learning.
At assemblies, if persons are able to hear the program and are benefiting to some extent from it, they should be counted, even though not seated. Of course, all are encouraged to take seats and enjoy the program to the full, showing proper respect for what is being presented from the platform.
It is suggested that the count be taken during the last half of the meeting.

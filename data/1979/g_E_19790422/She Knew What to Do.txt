She Knew What to Do
JUST how valuable is the material published in Awake!? A letter from one reader says, in part: “I wanted to write and express my thanks for the many articles in both the Awake! and The Watchtower. In December 1977, I had reason to be especially thankful. Both my legs were scalded badly in a home accident. Instantly remembering the information given about treating burns with cold water, I jumped into the bathtub and ran cold water over my legs. Later, at the hospital, the doctor told me that that action saved me from skin grafts. Sections of the burn were still either deep second-degree or shallow third-degree burns.
“Due to the information given in the Awake! [July 22, 1966, pages 12-16], a potentially very serious accident was minimized. Many persons remarked they would not have thought of using that treatment or they had never heard of doing it before.”

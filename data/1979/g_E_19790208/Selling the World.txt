Selling the World
◆ The non-Communist world spends a yearly average of about $25 (U.S.) per person to sell products by advertising. And the United States spends more than all the rest put together, according to the 1978 edition of World Advertising Expenditures. Americans are bombarded with over $150 each in advertising, while Ethiopians each get about 3 cents’ worth.

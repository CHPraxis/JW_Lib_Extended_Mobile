<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◆ The non-Communist world spends a yearly average of about $25 (U.S.) per person to sell products by advertising. And the United States spends more than all the rest put together, according to the 1978 edition of <em>World Advertising Expenditures. </em>Americans are bombarded with over $150 each in advertising, while Ethiopians each get about 3 cents’ worth.</p>

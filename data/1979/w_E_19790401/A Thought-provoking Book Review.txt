A Thought-provoking Book Review
Students who are Jehovah’s Witnesses often find it possible to share the “good news” with others at school. For instance, in Spain the pupils in a certain class were assigned to read a book during their winter vacation and later give a classroom report on it.
A 12-year-old Witness decided to base her review on the book Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It, a Watch Tower publication. The girl’s resumé of it aroused the interest of many fellow pupils. As a result, this young Witness of Jehovah placed 48 Youth books with others, and at least one fine, progressive Bible study resulted from her effort.
Another youngster heard this experience related at a Christian meeting. He, in turn, enjoyed excellent results in offering the same Bible-based publication to others in his school.

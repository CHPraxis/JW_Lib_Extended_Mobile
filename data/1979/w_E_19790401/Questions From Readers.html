<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● </strong><strong>Is Jesus the “mediator” only for anointed Christians?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The term “mediator” occurs just six times in the Christian Greek Scriptures and Scripturally is always used regarding a formal covenant.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Moses was the “mediator” of the Law covenant made between God and the nation of Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:19-48:3:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Gal. 3:19, 20</a>) Christ, though, is the “mediator of a new covenant” between Jehovah and spiritual Israel, the “Israel of God” that will serve as kings and priests in heaven with Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:6-58:8:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Heb. 8:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:15-58:9:15" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 9:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:24-58:12:24" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 12:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:16-48:6:16" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> Gal. 6:16</a>) At a time when God was selecting those to be taken into that new covenant, the apostle Paul wrote that Christ was the “one mediator between God and men.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:5-54:2:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:5</a>) Reasonably Paul was here using the word “mediator” in the same way he did the other five times, which occurred before the writing of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:5-54:2:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Timothy 2:5</a>, referring to those then being taken into the new covenant for which Christ is “mediator.” So in this strict Biblical sense Jesus is the “mediator” only for anointed Christians.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The new covenant will terminate with the glorification of the remnant who are today in that covenant mediated by Christ. The “great crowd” of “other sheep” that is forming today is not in that new covenant. However, by their associating with the “little flock” of those yet in that covenant they come under benefits that flow from that new covenant. During the millennium Jesus Christ will be their king, high priest and judge.

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>● </strong><strong>At </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:89:19-19:89:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>Psalm 89:19</strong></a><strong>, who are the “loyal ones” to whom Jehovah spoke in a vision?</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">An examination of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:89:0-19:89:52" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 89</a> reveals that the subject matter is the Kingdom covenant. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:89:19-19:89:20" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps 89 Verses 19, 20 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:89:29-19:89:29" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 29</a> of this psalm read: “At that time you spoke in a vision to your loyal ones, and you proceeded to say: ‘I have placed help upon a mighty one; I have exalted a chosen one from among the people. I have found David my servant; with my holy oil I have anointed him . . . And I shall certainly set up his seed forever and his throne as the days of heaven.’”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The account of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:17:1-13:17:27" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Chronicles 17</a> reveals that the promise of a continuing dynasty in the house of David was revealed to the prophet Nathan in a vision. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:17:15-13:17:15" data-bid="9-1" class="b">First Chronicles 17:15</a> tells us: “According to all these words and according to all this vision was the way that Nathan spoke to David.” Therefore, the “loyal ones” are Nathan and David, with David receiving the divine revelation through Nathan.</p>

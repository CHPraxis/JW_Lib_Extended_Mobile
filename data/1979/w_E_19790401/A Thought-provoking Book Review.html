<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Students who are Jehovah’s Witnesses often find it possible to share the “good news” with others at school. For instance, in Spain the pupils in a certain class were assigned to read a book during their winter vacation and later give a classroom report on it.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A 12-year-old Witness decided to base her review on the book <strong>Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It, </strong>a Watch Tower publication. The girl’s resumé of it aroused the interest of many fellow pupils. As a result, this young Witness of Jehovah placed 48 <strong>Youth </strong>books with others, and at least one fine, progressive Bible study resulted from her effort.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Another youngster heard this experience related at a Christian meeting. He, in turn, enjoyed excellent results in offering the same Bible-based publication to others in his school.</p>

A Big Change
Can just one copy of a Christian journal really affect the course of a man’s life? The following experience from Spain indicates that it can.
Serious-faced Roberto usually sat alone when riding a train, but on one occasion he took a seat beside an elderly man, who asked: “Do you like to read?” The reply was affirmative, and so Roberto was given a copy of The Watchtower. Though the white-haired gentleman left the train, Roberto kept reading until he had finished the entire magazine. On reaching the end of the railway line, he stood on the platform asking himself: “Where are you going? Don’t you see that now you can’t do what you were going to do?”
Beset by unemployment, huge debts and disillusionment, that morning desperate Roberto had boarded the train to the provincial capital intent on killing the business partner who had cheated him out of his life’s savings. Then Roberto planned to return home, take the lives of his wife and children and finally commit suicide. But now he took the next train home, contacted a Witness neighbor, and asked for a Bible study.
After searching for many months, a new Roberto located the witness of Jehovah who had given him that magazine on the train, finally spying him in the crowd at a Christian assembly. Think of that elderly man’s joy when he learned that Roberto and his whole family were studying the Bible, attending meetings of God’s people and would soon be baptized! Yes, one magazine had brought about a big change.

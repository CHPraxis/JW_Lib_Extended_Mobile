Could All the Animals Have Fitted Into Noah’s Ark?
“Impossible,” many say. But do they really know how large the ark was? Do they realize the carrying capacity of a vessel that size?
You will be fascinated to learn about these things in the chapter “Was There an Earth-wide Flood?” in Is the Bible Really the Word of God? This 192-page, hardbound book examines many questions raised by critics of the Bible. Only 50 cents (U.S.), postpaid.
Please send the book Is the Bible Really the Word of God? I enclose 50c (U.S.).

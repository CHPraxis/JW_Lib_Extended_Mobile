Is There Really a God?
Can the existence of a Supreme Being be proved?
If there is a God, why is there such disorder in the world? Why is there so much suffering?
You will find an interesting treatment of these questions in the book Life Does Have a Purpose. Only 50 cents (U.S.), postpaid.
Please send the book Life Does Have a Purpose. I enclose 50c (U.S.)

Triumph Despite Opposition
● Early in the sixteenth century, Bible scholar William Tyndale translated much of the Bible from Hebrew and Greek into the English language of his time. However, there was great clerical opposition to his translation. Hence, copies of Tyndale’s rendition of the Christian Greek Scriptures (the first ever printed in English) had to be brought into England from continental Europe in barrels, cases, bales of cloth, sacks of flour and the like. The clergy burned thousands of copies at St. Paul’s Cross in London as “a burnt-offering most pleasing to Almighty God.”
● As it is, the printing press was too much for the opposers. The Bible triumphed in its fight to live.

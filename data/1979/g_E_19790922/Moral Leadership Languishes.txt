Moral Leadership Languishes
“Like sheep, all of us have gone astray or followed false shepherds after pausing to kill our emergent prophets. Political leaders we have in abundance, as well as military leaders, business leaders, social leaders, intellectual leaders. But moral leadership languishes, and upon moral leadership we still rely for salvation.”—Karl Menninger in “Whatever Became of Sin?” p. 192.

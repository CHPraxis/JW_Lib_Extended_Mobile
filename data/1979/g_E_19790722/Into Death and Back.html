<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">CAN a person who dies be brought back to life? Many news reports from around the world tell about its happening. The Toronto <em>Star </em>of February 20, 1976, carried this amazing heading:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="ss"><strong>“‘Dead’ 105 minutes doctors revive boy”</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Canadian newspaper explained:</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="si">“A 16-year-old boy who ‘died’ for 105 minutes three weeks ago now just wants to get back to school.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="si">“Edward Milligan collapsed on a school snowshoeing expedition and had no heart beat, no pulse and did not breathe for at least 105 minutes. . . .</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="si">“Dr. Arnold Tweed, a specialist at [Selkirk General Hospital], said ‘it is the longest time we know of’ that a patient’s heart has stopped beating and the patient recovered without apparent brain damage.”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Less than a year later, on January 20, 1977, the New York <em>Post </em>carried an even more amazing report. The newspaper heading read:</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>“Longest Death: Revived After 4 Hours”</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The report told about a 20-year-old Chippewa Indian woman, Jean Jawbone, who was found unconscious in a snowbank. She had been there for nearly two hours at temperatures as low as 33° F <em>below </em>zero (−36° C)! Her heart had stopped, and her body temperature was only 75° F (24° C), more than 23° F (13° C) below normal! The <em>Post </em>reported:</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="si">“The doctors applied non-stop heart massage, depressing the breastbone and squeezing the heart for two hours before they had any signs of life returning.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="si">“A tube was inserted into her windpipe to pump air.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="si">“Finally, they used a rare technique known as peritoneal dialysis—injecting a warm solution into the abdominal cavity.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="si">“After the woman’s body temperature rose sufficiently, a defibrillator was used to give her heart an electrical jolt that established a regular beat.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="si">“She regained consciousness, was able to talk, and ‘behaved just like a person coming out of anesthesia,’ [Dr. Brian] Pickering said.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="si">“Yesterday, Miss Jawbone was ‘just waiting to go home.’”</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Surely these are remarkable recoveries. And with the advent of modern medical techniques, recoveries like these are occurring with greater frequency. But they can raise intriguing questions, as noted in a headline of the San Diego <em>Union </em>of October 1, 1978:</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span><strong>“Case Poses Problem Of ‘Death’ In Texas”</strong></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The newspaper explained:</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="si">“Roger Ragland’s startling return to life after 12 hours of apparent clinical death has renewed debate over what constitutes death in Texas. . . .</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="si">“‘He had all the neurological signs of brain death,’ said Dr. James Lindley, who examined the youth in the Brackenridge Hospital emergency room.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="si">“Physicians had received his family’s permission to use the teen-ager’s kidneys in a transplant, and put him on a respirator to continue blood and air circulation through body tissues. The family had notified a funeral home.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="si">“The day after the accident, however, neurosurgeon Bryon Neely noticed movement in Ragland’s legs and then detected brain activity. . . .</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="si">“Texas now has no legal definition of death. Such legislation could be brought before the Legislature when it meets in January.”</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Have these persons actually returned from the dead? Can they give the living some insights regarding the condition of those who have died? What really is death?</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The ten-tribe kingdom of Israel is compared to a wall that, as determined by a plummet, was straight but in time began to lean. We read: “Look! Jehovah was stationed on a wall made with a plummet, and there was a plummet in his hand. Then Jehovah said to me: ‘What are you seeing, Amos?’ So I said: ‘A plummet.’ And Jehovah went on to say: ‘Here I am setting a plummet in the midst of my people Israel. I shall no more do any further excusing of it.’”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:7:7-30:7:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Amos 7:7, 8</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Measured by Jehovah’s standard or his plummet, Israel as a wall had leaned too far from the perpendicular. No longer would the Most High excuse or pardon the error of the people. Just as a leaning wall must be torn down to prevent injuring passersby, so unfaithful ten-tribe Israel would experience adverse judgment from God.</p>

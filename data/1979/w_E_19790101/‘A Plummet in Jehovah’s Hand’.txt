‘A Plummet in Jehovah’s Hand’
The ten-tribe kingdom of Israel is compared to a wall that, as determined by a plummet, was straight but in time began to lean. We read: “Look! Jehovah was stationed on a wall made with a plummet, and there was a plummet in his hand. Then Jehovah said to me: ‘What are you seeing, Amos?’ So I said: ‘A plummet.’ And Jehovah went on to say: ‘Here I am setting a plummet in the midst of my people Israel. I shall no more do any further excusing of it.’”​—Amos 7:7, 8.
Measured by Jehovah’s standard or his plummet, Israel as a wall had leaned too far from the perpendicular. No longer would the Most High excuse or pardon the error of the people. Just as a leaning wall must be torn down to prevent injuring passersby, so unfaithful ten-tribe Israel would experience adverse judgment from God.

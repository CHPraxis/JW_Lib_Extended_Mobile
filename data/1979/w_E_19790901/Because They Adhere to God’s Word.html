<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Honesty and sticking to Jehovah God’s Word, the Bible, are rewarding in various ways. This is clearly indicated by the following experience from South Africa:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">During the early 1970’s, a black witness of Jehovah started a small business. Immediately, he employed fellow Christians. When he learned that tobacco endangers health and that Christians should not use or sell it, this man got rid of all the tobacco in his store. Neighboring shop owners laughed at him, saying that he was heading for bankruptcy since tobacco was the fastest-selling product in their business places.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">To the surprise of his neighbors, however, in time the Witness expanded his shop. Not only did it become bigger than theirs, but it became the area’s first supermarket, with a café and dining facilities as well as a gasoline station. These developments, in 1976, worried the neighboring shop owners, who asked him how he had accomplished this in such a short time, whereas they had been struggling for years to make profits and develop their businesses.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Witness explained that his Christian employees were reliable and would not even take a sweet from him​—not because they were afraid of their employer but due to their fear of Jehovah God. Also, he pointed out that his prices were in agreement with provisions of the Price Control Board and his place was always clean.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Since then, Witness employees can be found in almost every shop in that town, and it is common for job seekers there to be asked: “To what religion do you belong?” And Jehovah’s Witnesses are preferred as employees. Why? Because they adhere to God’s Word and have a reputation for reliability and faithfulness.</p>

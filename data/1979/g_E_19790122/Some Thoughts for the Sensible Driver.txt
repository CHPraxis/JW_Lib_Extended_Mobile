Some Thoughts for the Sensible Driver
In a recent survey, 80 out of 100 drivers admitted losing ability to concentrate after driving long distances without a break. Some are overcome by a form of tiredness after 200 kilometers, others after 500 (124 and 311) miles) of driving without interruption. A definite connection has been discovered between signs of tiredness, physical performance and wrong eating habits.
Hence, for safer driving, the German Society for Nutrition recommends:
Get a good rest before a longer trip. Never start out on an empty stomach. But do not eat much, and avoid fat. Eat vitamin-rich foods.
Take a break every two hours. But do not remain seated in the automobile. Walk about and eat something: fruit, biscuits, chocolate. But not too much!
Take your meals at the customary hours. Eat light and take your time. After eating, do not start driving right away. “Stretch your legs” first.
Drink smaller amounts (of milk, fruit juices, mineral water—coffee and tea only moderately) more frequently, instead of a large quantity at one sitting.

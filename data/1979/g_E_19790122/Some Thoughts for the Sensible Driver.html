<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In a recent survey, 80 out of 100 drivers admitted losing ability to concentrate after driving long distances without a break. Some are overcome by a form of tiredness after 200 kilometers, others after 500 (124 and 311) miles) of driving without interruption. A definite connection has been discovered between signs of tiredness, physical performance and wrong eating habits.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Hence, for safer driving, the German Society for Nutrition recommends:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Get a good rest before a longer trip. Never start out on an empty stomach. But do not eat much, and avoid fat. Eat vitamin-rich foods.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Take a break every two hours. But do not remain seated in the automobile. Walk about and eat something: fruit, biscuits, chocolate. But not too much!</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Take your meals at the customary hours. Eat light and take your time. After eating, do not start driving right away. “Stretch your legs” first.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Drink smaller amounts (of milk, fruit juices, mineral water—coffee and tea only moderately) more frequently, instead of a large quantity at one sitting.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">â—† Language experts in Lebanon and Syria say that there is still one small community 38 miles from Damascus, Syria, that speaks Aramaic. The language survived in this town, it is believed, because it was isolated in the mountains and inaccessible until modern times. It is thought to be the only place in the world where Aramaic is still spoken. Aramaic was spoken when Jesus Christ was on earth.</p>

How Long Was Man Meant to Live?
For ages humans have wondered about this. And to many persons it has not seemed reasonable that God meant for humans to enjoy this beautiful earth for only 70 or 80 years or less.
What is God’s purpose for human life on earth? What does his Word the Bible teach about this?

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● The Society is arranging for a limited number of regular pioneers to serve temporarily as special pioneers in isolated territory for a two- or three-month period. The assignments are designed for a team of two. The requirement will be 140 hours each month in field service. Also, a car that is in good condition will be necessary. Some financial assistance will be provided. Before writing to the Society, arrangements should be made for a partner. Please submit a letter giving the name of your partner, as well as the congregation(s) with which both of you are presently associating. Also state whether you will be willing to work with a <em>congregation </em>that needs assistance in covering its territory. (No financial assistance is given for this.) The elders should sign the letter, indicating that they believe the individuals would do well in this work.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● Please order Memorial invitations now so that your congregation will receive them well in advance of the Memorial celebration, April 11, 1979. Invitations may be ordered in lots of 250, 500 and 1,000, using the special order blank. Please do not remit with your order. The Memorial invitations will be charged to your congregation’s literature account. Payment should be included in the money remitted for literature.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● There will be a special public talk on Sunday, April 1, 1979. Congregations holding their public talks on a midweek night will schedule it during the week of April 1. We would like to advertise this particular public talk widely. So please order handbills as soon as possible. Use the special talk handbill order blank now being sent out to the congregations.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sn">● Effective immediately, the Byington translation, known as <em>The Bible in Living English, </em>will cost $8.00 for the public, $7.75 for congregation publishers, and $4.00 for pioneers.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn">● In the future, the secretary of the congregation will be responsible for keeping the meeting attendance records for the congregation, instead of the Bible study overseer. If the secretary keeps these records, it is felt that there will be easier access to these records both by other elders and by the circuit overseer when he visits.</p>

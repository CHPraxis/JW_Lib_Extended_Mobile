<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The apostle Paul wrote: “The word of God is alive and exerts power.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>) A recent experience from Spain confirms that statement.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">While engaging in witnessing on the street, a Christian elder approached a young man who identified himself as a Buddhist. Although he preferred observing people instead of reading, the man accepted an older issue of <strong>The Watchtower. </strong>Also, he was invited to attend a meeting at the local Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A few days later, the young man appeared at the hall. After being introduced to some individuals present, he was invited to sit down. But he declined and stood for two hours without moving. In conversation afterward, he said that he did not care to read, preferring to listen and observe.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">However, on one occasion the elder asked the young man if he had ever read the Bible through. He had not, but was encouraged to do so, the Witness mentioning that the Bible is an Oriental book. This Buddhist read the entire Bible in just a few days. From then on, Jehovah helped him to grow spiritually. Today, he is a baptized Christian. God’s Word truly does exert power.</p>

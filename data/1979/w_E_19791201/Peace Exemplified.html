<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The reputation of Jehovah’s Witnesses for good conduct is well known. In Bombay, India, a Christian assembly was held for the first time in the Shanmukhananda Hall. The Board of Trustees of this hall were so pleased with the peace and good order of Jehovah’s Witnesses that they made this statement to the convention overseer: “We are happy with your convention. We have never seen anything like this before. If everyone were like this there would be no need for government. You can come here every year if you desire.”</p>

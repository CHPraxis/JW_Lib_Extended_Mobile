<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">This past August the following letter was received from a woman in Washington, D.C.:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sg">“Dear Sir:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Recently I purchased several copies of ‘My Book of Bible Stories’ from a friend . . . Truly, I could not put this most inspiring, clear and beautifully illustrated publication down. I have been raving to everyone about these stories of the Bible. I have read these stories over and over again, and read the references in the Bible upon which they are based. Like many people, I neglect to read my Bible as often as I should because of many activities and work. Besides, I don’t always understand some of the readings. This printing of ‘My Book of Bible Stories’ has enhanced my Bible readings and understanding.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“With all this uplift, I decided to purchase a few of these books for others to read and called your place and was told by one of your gracious staff members that this type of request would be honored.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“I am enclosing a check for $120.00 for the initial purchase of sixty (60) books to be forwarded to me as quickly as possible. If necessary I may be reached at . . . for further information. I am anxious to receive these marvelous readings.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“May God continue to bless you in all your endeavors.”</p>

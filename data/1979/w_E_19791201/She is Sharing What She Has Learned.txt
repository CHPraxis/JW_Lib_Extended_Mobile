She is Sharing What She Has Learned
This past August the following letter was received from a woman in Washington, D.C.:
“Dear Sir:
“Recently I purchased several copies of ‘My Book of Bible Stories’ from a friend . . . Truly, I could not put this most inspiring, clear and beautifully illustrated publication down. I have been raving to everyone about these stories of the Bible. I have read these stories over and over again, and read the references in the Bible upon which they are based. Like many people, I neglect to read my Bible as often as I should because of many activities and work. Besides, I don’t always understand some of the readings. This printing of ‘My Book of Bible Stories’ has enhanced my Bible readings and understanding.
“With all this uplift, I decided to purchase a few of these books for others to read and called your place and was told by one of your gracious staff members that this type of request would be honored.
“I am enclosing a check for $120.00 for the initial purchase of sixty (60) books to be forwarded to me as quickly as possible. If necessary I may be reached at . . . for further information. I am anxious to receive these marvelous readings.
“May God continue to bless you in all your endeavors.”

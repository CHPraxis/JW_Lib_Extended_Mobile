<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong>Listening to the Great Teacher </strong>is a unique book for parents and children. The stories are designed in a way that encourages you to ask your child questions. This, in turn, encourages your child to become more involved and to learn to think. Equally important, it helps you to hear how your child really feels about things.</p>

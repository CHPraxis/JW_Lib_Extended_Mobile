You May Have Missed Our First 100 Years​—But Don’t Miss the Next 12 Months.
The magazine you have in your hand was founded to call attention to the things that the Bible foretells for our day. As a result The Watchtower has quite often found itself in a vanguard position.
◆ As early as 1880, it alerted the world to a coming crises in 1914.
◆ It exposed some of the most widely held religious doctrines as unsupported by the Bible. It turned the hose on hell (Ecclesiastes 9:5); proved the soul not to be immortal (Ezekiel 18:4); showed that Jesus is the Son of God, not Almighty God.​—Mark 13:32.
◆ In 1919, while the League of Nations was still in course of formation, it pointed out what the Bible said would happen to it; and in 1942, when steps were being taken to form the U.N., it called attention to what Bible prophecy said about its destiny.​—Revelation 17:8-11.
◆ Based on Matthew 24, it has not only prepared readers for the increasingly immoral, violent, difficult days of this generation, but also reminded us of the solution that God provides​—his Kingdom government.
◆ It strives to be a source of encouragement, calling to mind Bible guidelines for stabilizing families, maintaining sexual morality and personal integrity.

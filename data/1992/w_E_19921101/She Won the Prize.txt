She Won the Prize
“I OWE it all to you,” writes Kioye, a high school senior, to the Watch Tower Society’s branch office in Japan. What is she so grateful for? Kioye recently won the highest prize in a national composition contest, sponsored by the Japan Traffic Safety Association. The valuable award includes a trip to Sweden.
Kioye wrote to express her appreciation for the many fine publications published by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, which she feels greatly helped her succeed. Aside from this contest, she has represented her school in many speech and composition contests. “In most of these contests,” she says, “a theme is given, and the students do research for their compositions in a library. However, I do not have to go to all that trouble. I find wonderful material on the bookshelf at home!” She continues: “Whatever the theme, be it the problems of aging, the environment, international relations, or self-improvement, there is usually an in-depth discussion in the Watchtower or Awake! magazines.”
Nevertheless, it is not just the publications that helped Kioye. She says that the education she received through the teaching programs of Jehovah’s Witnesses helped her to improve her reading and writing, and this enabled her to excel in the contests. “Once, I really wanted to get a university education,” she admits. “But where could I get training like this?” Now she hopes to work full-time in helping others to benefit from the education that she has received. While delighted with the composition prize, Kioye’s heart is set on winning the prize of life.​—Compare Philippians 3:14.

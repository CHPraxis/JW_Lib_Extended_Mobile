<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>August: </strong><em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. </em><strong>September: </strong><em>Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? </em><strong>October: </strong>Subscriptions for either <em>Awake! </em>or <em>The Watchtower </em>or for both magazines. When genuine interest is found, subscriptions may be obtained for one year or six months. There is no arrangement for subscriptions to quarterly editions of the magazines. Multiyear subscriptions will not be accepted. <strong>November: </strong><em>New World Translation </em>with the book <em>The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s? </em>NOTE: Congregations that have not yet requested the above-​mentioned campaign items should do so on their next monthly Literature Request Form (S(d)-14).</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Everyone associated with a congregation should send all new and renewal subscriptions for <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake!, </em>including their personal subscriptions, through the congregation.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ The Society will no longer be filling requests for literature made by individual publishers. Those desiring a given item may advise the literature servant, who will promptly include it in the congregation’s monthly request for literature.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ Congregations should begin requesting the <em>1993 Calendar of Jehovah’s Witnesses </em>with their September literature request. The calendars will be available in Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Swedish, and Ukrainian.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ The Society is now accepting requests for reprinted <em>Watchtower </em>bound volumes in SPANISH for the years 1980 through 1985. Any interested in obtaining the reprinted Spanish <em>Watchtower </em>bound volumes should request them through the congregation on the next Literature Request Form (S(d)-14). Since the volumes are being reprinted one time only, we urge all to consider their needs carefully. Please bear in mind that these bound volumes are special-​request items.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ From August 28 through September 2, the Society will be taking an inventory of all literature on hand in Brooklyn Bethel. Because of this inventory, no congregation literature requests will be processed for shipment or for pickup during those days.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ Each congregation will receive three Literature Inventory forms and should take an actual count of campaign literature. Please fill out the forms completely, and send the original to us no later than September 6, 1992. Keep a carbon copy for your files. We are sending a third copy for use as a work sheet.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">▪ An adequate supply of forms for use during the 1993 service year is being sent to each congregation. These forms should not be wasted. They should be used only for their intended purpose.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">▪ A packet of legal materials is available when publishers are involved in lawsuits over child custody and visitation. The packet contains court decisions and other materials designed to assist an attorney who is representing a publisher whose parental fitness is being challenged because of his or her religious beliefs or practices. The Society’s Legal Department should be contacted by the body of elders if (a) court papers or legal documents indicate that the publisher’s religion is going to be attacked; (b) apostate literature, a religious expert, or a former Witness will be used to testify against the publisher; (c) a pretrial deposition of the publisher will be taken; or (d) a psychological examination or home study is scheduled. The packet offers no assistance in cases involving secular issues such as support and property.</p>

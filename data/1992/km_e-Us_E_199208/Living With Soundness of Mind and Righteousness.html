<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>We live in a world that exerts a strong influence toward ungodliness. The standards of this system continue to deteriorate. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:3-55:3:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:3</a>) As Christians, we must take a stand for what is right and understand why we must continue to do so. But what direction and guidance is available? What standards should we follow? “Living With Soundness of Mind and Righteousness” is the encouraging theme selected for our special assembly day program for the 1993 service year.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:12-56:2:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Titus 2:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>By means of talks, demonstrations, and experiences, we will learn how we can strengthen ourselves to resist ungodliness and to repudiate worldly desires. We will also see how it is possible to live with soundness of mind and righteousness amid this wicked system. Provisions for helping us safeguard our mental powers will be outlined. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:7-60:4:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Pet. 4:7</a>) Parents and youths will especially want to give attention to the talks and interviews on the afternoon program. These will stress the need to gain godly wisdom and experience and to work together to build for a happy theocratic future.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Though surrounded by an ungodly world, God’s Word instructs us in the best course to follow. The benefits of heeding Bible counsel will be highlighted in the talk “Cherish Your Blessings Amid a Joyless World.” As we prepare to attend, we want to keep in mind that paying close attention to the program and applying the counsel will enable us to be more effective in our service to Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:15-50:3:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Phil. 3:15, 16</a>.</p>

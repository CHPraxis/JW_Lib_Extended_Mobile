It’s Helping the Young
LAST year a mother from Dearborn, Michigan, U.S.A., visited a doctor with her son Max, who was being treated for a learning disability. “Since the doctor specializes in the counseling of young people,” the mother noted, “I felt it was vital for him to have the book Questions Young People Ask​—Answers That Work. He accepted it with great enthusiasm.”
While Max’s mother would wait for him to finish his sessions with the doctor, she became acquainted with Tim, a 12-​year-​old who would be waiting to see the same doctor. She developed a friendship with Tim and also gave him a copy of the Young People Ask book. She describes what happened:
“At least one month passed before I saw Tim again. I saw him coming from the doctor’s office. When he saw me, he raised up his Young People Ask book for me to see, smiling as he did. His grandmother spoke up, saying how wonderful the book was and how it had helped Tim. Afterward, when I sat down with the doctor in his office, he explained that he and Tim study the book together and that he assigns Tim chapters to prepare and discuss.”
This doctor, as well as Tim and his grandmother, is among the millions that are recognizing the value of this fine publication prepared by Jehovah’s Witnesses to help young ones meet today’s challenges and assist them to cope with today’s problems.

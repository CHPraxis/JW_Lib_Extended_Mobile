▪ It is important that groups of 30 or more persons planning to visit the Society’s facilities first correspond by mail with the Central Tour Desk at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201. This includes those groups that will be visiting Brooklyn Bethel, Watchtower Farms, the Watchtower Educational Center project site in Patterson, and the Jersey City Assembly Hall. Please provide information on the number coming and the date and time for each location. The Society will provide a description of the tours that are available as well as a map giving directions to each location. ANY PUBLISHER NEEDING ACCOMMODATIONS MAY OBTAIN LODGING INFORMATION THROUGH THE CONGREGATION ELDERS.
▪ Publishers planning to auxiliary pioneer in October should turn in their application early. This will allow the elders to make necessary arrangements for literature and territory.
▪ The elders are reminded to follow through on counsel given on pages 21-3 of the April 15, 1991, Watchtower regarding any disfellowshipped or disassociated persons who may be inclined toward becoming reinstated.
▪ On pages 103-4 of Organized to Accomplish Our Ministry, direction is given as to what may be included in reporting hours of field service. Some have wondered whether a publisher who interprets for a speaker giving a public talk may count the time. Yes, both speaker and interpreter may include in their field service reports the time thus spent.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>We should always display a warm, personal interest in the people we meet in the field ministry. Asking for their opinion on matters demonstrates our respect for their viewpoint. The subject we introduce and the questions we raise may stimulate their thinking and cause them to want to learn more about God and his purpose for mankind.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>During September we will be directing attention to the truth about creation as we offer the book <em>Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? </em>Take time to review this publication personally, and choose specific points to highlight. When discussing information in the <em>Creation </em>book, open it and hand it to the householder. Refer to specific subjects and illustrations. Be enthusiastic in demonstrating the value of this fascinating publication.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>After warmly introducing yourself, you could say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ “In this modern, scientific world, is it reasonable to believe there is a God who created us and this beautiful earth on which we live? [Allow for response.] When we consider the vastness and wonders of the earth and the entire universe, we are impressed with its order and design. Does this not testify to the existence of a Creator? Notice the Bible’s reasoning on this matter. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:3:4-58:3:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hebrews 3:4</a>.] Logically, every building had a designer and builder. [Take out the <em>Creation </em>book and turn to the illustration on page 114.] Our universe is awe inspiring! Do you think it could have come into existence by itself?” Then turn to page 122 and read the caption below the picture of a watch. The illustration and scripture quoted on page 127 could also be used. Additional helpful points can be found in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="16" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989217/38:228-44$p/E:1101989218/1-23"><em>Reasoning </em>book, pages 84-8</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>Or you might say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ “What do you think is necessary for mankind to find true peace and happiness on this earth? [Allow for response.] The Bible says that we must fear God and acknowledge him as the Creator of heaven and earth.” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:7-66:14:7" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Revelation 14:7</a>, and then open the <a class="xt" data-xtid="18" href="jwpub://p/E:1101985020/29:358-32"><em>Creation </em>book to pages 140 and 141</a>, possibly reading paragraphs 24 and 25, where it explains that the earth was designed for human habitation. If the householder’s interest warrants further conversation, turn to chapter 19 and explain how an earthly paradise will soon be a reality.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>If the householder expresses doubts about the existence of a Creator, you might say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">▪ “Many people share your feelings, especially in view of all the suffering in the world. If there is a God, why would he permit suffering? Can you think of any reasonable explanation?” Depending on the response, you may be able to continue by using <a class="xt" data-xtid="19" href="jwpub://p/E:1101985026/">chapter 16 of the <em>Creation</em></a> book to further the discussion. Or if he listens with limited interest, you might just highlight a specific point or two from the article “Why Do Good People Suffer?” in the September 15, 1992, issue of <em>The Watchtower. </em>Additional helpful replies on this question can be found in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="20" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989274/32:119-41$p/E:1101989275/"><em>Reasoning </em>book, pages 399-400</a>. At times it may be appropriate to leave the tract <em>Why You Can Trust the Bible.</em></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Our objective is not only to stimulate interest in the Kingdom message but also to start Bible studies. How pleased we are to have this beautifully illustrated book that explains the truth about creation and honors our Grand Creator! May we make good use of it in stimulating the interest of honesthearted people we meet during September.</p>

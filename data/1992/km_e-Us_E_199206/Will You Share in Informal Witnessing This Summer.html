<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Our regular routine in life includes specific periods for talking to people about Jehovah. We set aside time for witnessing formally from house to house, making return visits, and conducting Bible studies. There are many other less formal occasions, though, when we can speak to people about the truth. We refer to this preaching as informal witnessing.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Some publishers find many opportunities to engage in this form of the ministry. All of us can endeavor to be alert to such occasions this summer as we travel to and from conventions, take vacations, and visit with relatives. Will you take advantage of opportunities for informal witnessing during this time?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Make Advance Plans: </strong>Preparation and forethought will enable us to witness informally in an effective way. In this regard, we are well equipped with a variety of publications to help us accomplish this. In addition to <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake!, </em>we have several tracts that feature thought-​provoking titles to stir interest. There are brochures that appeal to people of various backgrounds and religions. We also have pocket-​size books that cover subjects of current interest. Which publications do you feel comfortable using? Give thought to this as a family. Then practice what you will say when the appropriate occasion comes up.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>While on Vacation: </strong>An excellent time to witness informally is while on vacation. Are you planning a trip by plane, train, or bus? Then take along a Bible and one of the publications mentioned above. Reading such publications on public transportation often sparks a conversation. If you travel by automobile, think about what you can say when you stop at a filling station or restaurant or while staying at a hotel. For such occasions, you could keep a small supply of tracts handy to give to interested persons. If you are at a highway rest stop that has a scenic background, perhaps you could begin to witness by asking someone: “Would it not be nice if the whole earth looked like this?” If you are at a beautiful beach or park, a similar introduction could be used.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong>At the District Convention: </strong>We can also find occasions to witness informally at the district convention. Many have found success in talking to motel and hotel employees or in speaking to people while on the street or at a bus stop. Be sure to wear a badge card during the convention. You may patronize the local restaurants and stores, and perhaps people will ask you what your badge card represents. This may lead to your giving a fine witness.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>The summer months may offer us refreshment and relaxation, but let us not overlook the opportunities we have to give an informal witness. This method of preaching is fruitful, and Jehovah’s servants should share in it. As with Jesus, may our love for fellow humans move us to speak out on every appropriate occasion!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:14-40:5:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 5:14-16</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">NOTE: <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>will schedule a Service Meeting for each week during the summer. Congregations may make adjustments as needed to allow for attending the district convention and then for a 30-​minute review of the program highlights at the Service Meeting the following week. The day-​by-​day review may be assigned in advance to two or three qualified brothers who will be able to focus on key points. This well-​prepared review will help the brothers remember key points for personal application and use in the field. Comments from the audience and experiences related should be brief and to the point.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:31:12-5:31:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deut. 31:12, 13</a>) All need to be attentive with objective of determining how they can use the information personally and in the field service. There is a need to make final check to see that all have transportation arrangements. There are some cautions all should have in mind. No one should plan late-​night recreation during convention, since all of us need sufficient rest. We should plan on witnessing. To whom? People met on public transportation and at gas stations, restaurants, hotels, and so forth. We must be discerning when offering literature and should not leave literature indiscriminately in public places or with persons who do not show genuine interest.</p>

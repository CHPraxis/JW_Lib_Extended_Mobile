Is the Bible Really a Gift From God?
“I BELIEVE the Bible is the best gift God has ever given to man.” That statement was made by Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States.a He was not alone in his appreciation for this age-old book.
The 19th-century British statesman William E. Gladstone stated: “The Bible is stamped with a Specialty of Origin, and an immeasurable distance separates it from all competitors.” Along similar lines, the 18th-century American statesman Patrick Henry said: “The Bible is worth all other books which have ever been printed.” Obviously impressed by the Scriptures, French emperor Napoléon Bonaparte commented: “The Bible is no mere book, but a Living Creature, with a power that conquers all that oppose it.”
For some, the Bible has been a source of help and comfort. The American Confederate general Robert E. Lee stated: “In all my perplexities and distresses, the Bible has never failed to give me light and strength.” And because of his appreciation for this book, U.S. president John Quincy Adams said: “I have for many years made it a practice to read through the Bible once every year.”
If the Most High has given the Bible to mankind, there should be evidence that it is divinely inspired. It should be greater than any other book. And for the Bible to be a true source of strength and instruction, it would have to be completely reliable. So, then, there remains the question, Is the Bible really a gift from God? Let us next seek the answer to that question.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“FIRE! Fire! The Assembly Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses is on fire!” That startling cry rang out one Friday afternoon in October 1989 in Heerenveen, a town in the northern region of the Netherlands.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses had used this fine Assembly Hall for 11 years. Almost every weekend, hundreds had gathered there for either a two-day circuit assembly or a one-day special assembly day. It had been a comfortable place for Bible instruction.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">An accident occurred while work was under way on the roof of the hall. Practically in minutes, this mishap turned the hall into smoldering ruins. Thankfully, however, no one was hurt.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Sad about the loss but not disheartened, the Witnesses made plans for a new hall at another location. They found a suitable site at Swifterbant, in the province of Flevoland. This is a vast polder in the former inland Zuider Zee, 16 feet <strong>[5 m] </strong>below sea level.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">By January 1991 the signal was sounded to start building a new Assembly Hall. It would be built between May and September 1991. Hundreds of Witnesses volunteered to work at the site, and some young men saw the project as a stepping-stone to serving Jehovah God full-time. Dozens of workers came from Belgium and England.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">A nicely designed building was constructed. Its auditorium and cafeteria are separated by a glass-roofed corridor. The main hall seats 1,008 people, and another 230 can watch the program on television screens in an adjacent hall.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Today, thousands are saying: ‘Come, let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, and he will instruct us about his ways.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:2-23:2:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 2:2, 3</a>) This new Assembly Hall is just one of many places where such spiritual instruction is being imparted. The local Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses is another. There you will find a warm welcome.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE apostle Paul wrote about the resurrection at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:35-46:15:58" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:35-58</a> and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:5:1-47:5:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 5:1-10</a>. In doing so, did he follow the immortal-soul ideas of Plato and the Greek philosophers, or was he in harmony with the teaching of Jesus and the rest of the Scriptures?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The booklet <em>Immortality of the Soul or Resurrection of the Individual: St. Paul’s View with Special Reference to Plato, </em>written in 1974 and endorsed by the archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Church of North and South America, gives a revealing answer. After discussing the nature of the resurrection in the above-mentioned scriptures and the Hellenistic influences of the time, the author reaches the following conclusion:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Plato teaches that the soul continues in unending and eternal existence, apart from the body. The soul for Plato is inherently and intrinsically immortal . . . St. Paul neither teaches such a view nor makes any claim to do so . . .</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“The Apostle Paul is not concerned with the immortality of the psyche or spirit as separate and distinct parts but with the resurrection of the whole complex soul-spirit body of man as the consequence of Christ’s resurrection. Paul’s conception of the resurrection body has nothing to do with the resuscitation of dead bodies from the grave.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“His conception of resurrection body may be better expressed as the transformation, re-creation, and reconstitution, by the power of God, of the whole man’s unity, of the same person, of the personality, of the psycho-somatic organism, of the true psycho-physical individual. Our future resurrection will take place not as our own natural possession, but as the royal gift of God.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Yes, immortality is not an inherent possession of any human. Rather, it is a prized and gracious gift from Jehovah through our Lord Jesus Christ to those who make up the anointed Christian congregation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:20-46:15:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:20,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:57-46:15:57" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 57;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:14-50:3:14" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Philippians 3:14</a>.</p>

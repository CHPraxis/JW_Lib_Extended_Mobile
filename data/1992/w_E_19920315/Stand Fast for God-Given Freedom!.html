These things stand as a symbolic drama; for these women mean two covenants, the one [the Law covenant] from Mount Sinai [where God inaugurated that covenant with the Israelites], which brings forth children for slavery, and which is Hagar. [The other covenant was the one made with Abraham regarding his Seed.] Now this Hagar means Sinai, a mountain in Arabia, and she corresponds with the Jerusalem today, for she is in slavery with her children [descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob].

Moreover, because he served God faithfully, he will be resurrected and <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>will serve as one of the “princes in all the earth” under the Greater Moses, Jesus Christ.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:45:16-19:45:16" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Psalm 45:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:18:17-5:18:19" data-bid="44-2" class="b"> Deuteronomy 18:17-19</a>.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">21. What encouraging examples are given concerning godly women of ancient times?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>Dedicated Christians today can also be encouraged by considering women who became truly free and joyful. Among them was the Moabitess Ruth, who experienced both the heartache of widowhood and the joy of God-given freedom from false religion. Abandoning her people and her gods, she stuck with her widowed mother-in-law, Naomi. “Where you go I shall go,” said Ruth, “and where you spend the night I shall spend the night. Your people will be my people, and your God my God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:1:16-8:1:16" data-bid="45-1" class="b">Ruth 1:16</a>) As the wife of Boaz, Ruth became the mother of David’s grandfather Obed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:4:13-8:4:17" data-bid="46-1" class="b">Ruth 4:13-17</a>) Why, Jehovah granted this humble non-Israelite woman “a perfect wage” by allowing her to become an ancestress of Jesus the Messiah! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/8:2:12-8:2:12" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Ruth 2:12</a>) How joyful Ruth will be when she is resurrected and learns that she had such a privilege! Similar joy will undoubtedly fill the hearts of the resurrected former harlot Rahab, who was freed from immorality and false worship, as well as erring but repentant Bath-sheba, for they also will learn that Jehovah allowed them to become ancestresses of Jesus Christ.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:1-40:1:6" data-bid="48-1" class="b">Matthew 1:1-6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:1:16-40:1:16" data-bid="48-2" class="b"> 16</a>.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="qu">22. What will be considered in the next article?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[53]" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>A consideration of recipients of God-given freedom could go on and on. For example, their number includes the men and women of faith mentioned in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:1-58:11:40" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Hebrews chapter 11</a>. They suffered tribulation and ill-treatment, “and the world was not worthy of them.” Add to their number the loyal first-century followers of Christ and other faithful ones since then, including the millions now serving Jehovah as his Witnesses. As we shall next see, if you have taken a stand with them for God-given freedom, you have many reasons for joy.</p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 1. What is joy, and why can those dedicated to God experience it?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb">JEHOVAH fills the hearts of his people with joy. This state of great happiness or exultation results from the acquisition or expectation of good. Humans dedicated to God can experience such an emotion because joy is a fruit of his holy spirit, or active force. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:22-48:5:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Galatians 5:22, 23</a>) So even if distressing trials beset us, we can be joyful as Jehovah’s servants, who are led by his spirit.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 2. Why did the Jews rejoice on a special occasion in Ezra’s day?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>On a special occasion in the fifth century B.C.E., the Jews used their God-given <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>freedom to hold a joyous Festival of Booths in Jerusalem. After Ezra and other Levites read and explained God’s Law to them, “the people went away to eat and drink and to send out portions and to carry on a great rejoicing, for they had understood the words that had been made known to them.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:5-16:8:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Nehemiah 8:5-12</a>.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>During that festival, the Jews realized the truthfulness of the words: “The joy of Jehovah is your stronghold.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:8:10-16:8:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Nehemiah 8:10</a>) This joy is our stronghold too if we are standing fast for God-given freedom as dedicated, baptized Witnesses of Jehovah. A few of us have experienced an anointing by holy spirit and adoption into God’s family as heavenly joint heirs with Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:15-45:8:23" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Romans 8:15-23</a>) The vast majority of us today have the prospect of life in an earthly paradise.

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Though we have wonderful prospects, it is not easy to endure sufferings and persecution. We can do so, however, because God gives us his holy spirit. With it we have joy and the conviction that nothing can rob us of our hope or of God’s love. Moreover, we can be sure that Jehovah will be our stronghold as long as we love him with all our heart, soul, strength, and mind.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:27-42:10:27" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Luke 10:27</a>.</p>

If we tried to be declared righteous by keeping the Law, we would be parted from Christ. Aided by God’s spirit, however, we await the hoped-for righteousness resulting from faith operating through love, not from physical circumcision or other works of the Law.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:1-48:5:6" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Galatians 5:1-6</a>.</p>

Such wicked persuasion was not from God and was to be resisted. As a little leaven ferments a whole lump, false teachers or a leaning toward apostasy can corrupt an entire congregation. Paul wished that advocates of circumcision seeking to subvert the Galatians’ faith not just be circumcised but get themselves sexually mutilated. Strong language indeed! But we must be just as firm in rejecting apostasy if we are to maintain our God-given freedom from religious error.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:7-48:5:12" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Galatians 5:7-12</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup><em>God-given freedom has brought us into association with a loving brotherhood, but we must do our part to show love. </em>The Galatians were not to use their freedom as “an inducement for the flesh” or an excuse for unloving selfishness.

Then we will not be bent on unlovingly satisfying our sinful flesh that “is against the spirit in its desire.” If we are led by God’s spirit, we will do what is loving but not because rules demand compliance and impose penalties on wrongdoers.

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup><em>Many blessings associated with our God-given freedom result from avoiding the sinful “works of the flesh.” </em>As God’s people, we, in general, avoid much anguish because we do not practice fornication, uncleanness, and loose conduct.

Determined to live contrary to the desires of the sinful flesh, we wish to be led by God’s spirit and to live by it. The spirit makes us humble and peaceable, not “egotistical, stirring up competition with one another, envying one another.” No wonder it is a joy to associate with those displaying the spirit’s fruitage!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:22-48:5:26" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Galatians 5:22-26</a>.</p>

Our feet must be shod with the equipment of the good news of peace. Needed, too, is the large shield of faith, with which to quench the wicked one’s burning missiles. We must wear the helmet of salvation and wield “the sword of the spirit,” God’s Word.

Whenever you lie down you will feel no dread; and you will certainly lie down, and your sleep must be pleasurable.

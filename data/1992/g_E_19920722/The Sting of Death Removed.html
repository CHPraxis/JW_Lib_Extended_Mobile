<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IT IS not unusual to read of death as natural or normal. Actually, it is not, according to the Bible account. Death is an enemy that resulted from sin. “Through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned,” the Bible says at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 5:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Since death was not God’s intent for mankind, he has lovingly made the way out. In allowing his Son to die in our behalf, he provided a corresponding ransom to offset the death penalty. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:20:28-40:20:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 20:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:2-62:2:2" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 1 John 2:2</a>) He has also promised an earthly paradise with an entirely new government to rule over all mankind. That government will completely erase the effects of sin and death. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:18:30-42:18:30" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 18:30</a>) The Bible says at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:3-66:21:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 21:3, 4</a>: “God himself will be with them. And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.” But what about those who have already died?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">They have the resurrection hope​—the prospect of living again as humans on that Paradise earth, with perfectly healthy bodies and minds. Yes, “the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29</a>) The one sent by God to redeem mankind, Jesus Christ, further assures us: “This is the will of my Father, that everyone that beholds the Son and exercises faith in him should have everlasting life, and I will resurrect him at the last day.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:6:40-43:6:40" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 6:40</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">It is this hope of the resurrection that sustains many who have lost a loved one in death. They realize that their loved ones merely “sleep in death,” and therefore they do “not grieve like the rest of men, who have no hope.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/52:4:13-52:4:13" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>, <em>The New English Bible</em>) They look forward to enjoying association with them again in that new system of things promised by God. They have faith in the God who gives comfort and hope.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Romans 15:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:13-45:15:13" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:1:3-47:1:3" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 1:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:2:16-53:2:16" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> 2 Thessalonians 2:16</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">That is why the funeral services of Jehovah’s Witnesses stand out as different from others. In order to merit God’s favor, the Witnesses avoid any practices that run counter to his Word, the Bible. Customs and trappings that have their basis in beliefs not taught in the Bible are avoided. As they worship only the true God, Jehovah, they refuse to give such worshipful honors to their dead. And they do not put on any showy display of wealth or status, as they know that this displeases God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:16-62:2:16" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 John 2:16</a>) Their funerals are simple and dignified and help to calm the hearts of those bereaved. A talk is given in memory of the dead one, setting out the hope found in the Bible. They mourn, but not excessively.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses know that soon “the last enemy, death,” is to be removed. Then the foretold words will come true: “Death is swallowed up forever. Death, where is your victory? Death, where is your sting?”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:26-46:15:26" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:26,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:54-46:15:55" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 54, 55</a>.</p>

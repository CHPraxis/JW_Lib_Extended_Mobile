“Written Just for Me”
THAT is what a youth from St. Lucia in the West Indies said about the book Your Youth​—Getting the Best Out Of It. “When I reached chapter 5,” she explained, “I saw that the information was written just for me. It was about masturbation and homosexuality.
“Masturbation has been one of my major problems. For three years I’ve been fighting to overcome it. I even thought I was the only one in the whole world doing that. Praise God for having you people write this precious book that gave me advice as to what to do. I’m putting your solutions into practice.
“My second problem is concerning boyfriends. I’ve faced many disappointments in this area. My last boyfriend has another girlfriend, and it seems he loves her more than me. I just don’t know what to do.
“I must comment, however, that when I’ve been hurt by my friends, especially my boyfriend, I just take hold of this little book and read it. It has been a great help to me. It has given me lots of advice that I have never thought about. After reading many chapters in this little red book, I could have just sat down and cried. I was really consoled and comforted by chapters 8 and 23.”
Growing up in these troubled times surely is not easy. Youths face many new situations and must make weighty decisions. Smoke? Accept drugs? What conduct is proper with one of the opposite sex?

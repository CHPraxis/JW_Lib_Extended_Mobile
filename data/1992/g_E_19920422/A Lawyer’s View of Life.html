<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><em>LIFE​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? </em>Millions have pondered over this. A thoroughly researched, 256-​page book with the above title was published in 1985 to examine these questions. Already, over 26 million copies of the book have been printed in 28 languages. After reading it, a semiretired attorney wrote in appreciation:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Over the past two years, I have read it four times and continue to be impressed with the depth of study, scholarship, and documentation that went into its production.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Please continue to publish it. This book should be in the hands of every person in the world. Should this happen, all the carping and confusion over our origins and the atheistic beliefs would be ended immediately.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“I have degrees in both law and political science and history and can recall no single book which so lucidly and forcefully develops its premises. The bibliography is beyond compare.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">If you would welcome further information regarding the origin of life on earth and its purpose, please write to Watchtower, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201, or to the appropriate address listed on page 5.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Starting conversations in the ministry can be quite challenging since people are so preoccupied with their own affairs or have definite opinions about religion. What can we have in mind that will assist us in making our initial call effective?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong><em>Since this is a holiday season, you might begin your conversation by saying:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ “At this time of the year, the sacrifice of Jesus is certainly on our minds. What do you think Jesus is doing now?” Allow for a response. Then you might share with the householder <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:2-66:6:2" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Revelation 6:2</a>, which describes Jesus as seated upon a white horse and going forth to complete his conquest. Comment on his kingly role and the lasting benefits his rulership will bring to all obedient mankind.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>When offering the April 1 issue with the article “True Freedom​—From What Source?,” you might say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ “People around the world are struggling for freedom. But promises of freedom by human governments have failed to mature. Worship of Jehovah, the true God, brings lasting freedom.” Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:3:17-47:3:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>, and point out that this issue of <em>The Watchtower </em>highlights God’s promise and shows why world events confirm that our liberation is near at hand.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong><em>You might introduce the April 15, 1992, “Watchtower” by highlighting the subject of prayer, saying:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ “People generally pray for victory in times of war. Do you think God hears such prayers and takes sides? [Allow for response.] Consider the Bible’s answer.” Then read and comment on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:12-60:3:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:12</a>. After a brief explanation, point to something in the <em>Watchtower </em>article that may stimulate the person’s interest in reading the magazine. If you detect genuine interest, you might offer the subscription.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Keep in mind that our goal is to conduct Bible studies. Since many will be auxiliary pioneering in April, we will have even more opportunities to find individuals who are interested in studying the Bible. But even if our circumstances do not allow us to auxiliary pioneer during April, we can all set the goal of starting a Bible study.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Some publishers have used tracts to start Bible studies on the initial call.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong><em>When offering the tract “Life in a Peaceful New World,” you might say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn">▪ “We are volunteers in your neighborhood. Let me give you this tract, which identifies the nature of our work. Do you think the world will ever look like that?” After getting a response, you could discuss the first few paragraphs with the person, highlighting <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9, 10 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:29-19:37:29" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Psalm 37:29</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Give careful thought as to how you will introduce yourself. Excellent suggestions are presented in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="38" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989202/1-64$p/E:1101989203/"><em>Reasoning </em>book on pages 9-15</a>. Skillfully utilizing these introductions will help make your initial calls effective.</p>

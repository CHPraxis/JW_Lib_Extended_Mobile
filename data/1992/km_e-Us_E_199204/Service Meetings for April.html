Capable publisher converses with householder, using the suggested presentation in paragraph 4 of the article “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:201992131/">Effective Initial Calls</a>.” Make appropriate reference to pertinent points on prayer in the April 15, 1992, <em>Watchtower. </em>Householder is pleasant but only mildly interested. Publisher states: “Our literature is offered without charge, but we would gladly accept a small donation toward our work.” Publisher pauses to let the words sink in. Householder simply says “That is interesting.” He says he would be happy to read the magazines but makes no move to give a contribution. Publisher presents him with magazines and expresses desire to return and discuss matter further. Householder agrees. After demonstration, chairman asks publisher why he did not offer to write up a subscription. Publisher appropriately felt that the interest was rather minimal and it might be more appropriate to call again in order to determine the extent of the householder’s interest.​—See May 1990 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>article “Use Our Literature Wisely.”</p>

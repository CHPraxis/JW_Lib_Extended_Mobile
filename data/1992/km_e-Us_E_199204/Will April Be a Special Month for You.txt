Will April Be a Special Month for You?
1 We often refer to the months of March and April as the Memorial season. Since the Memorial celebration always takes place at this time of year, Jehovah’s people are stirred to increase their participation in the field ministry.
2 Some who were enrolled as auxiliary pioneers in March will continue and be joined by others in this expanded ministry during April. If you can have a share, your application should be turned in immediately.
3 Even those not able to pioneer can make April a special month by increasing their field ministry. Certainly, there is much to be done. Perhaps congregation publishers and pioneers can invite new unbaptized publishers to work with them in the field. Extra effort should be made to invite all interested persons to the Memorial on April 17.
4 By being alert to welcome new ones who attend, you may be able to start another Bible study. With Jehovah’s blessing upon your increased efforts, your ministry will be fruitful and April will prove to be a special month for you.​—Ps. 34:8; Prov. 10:22.

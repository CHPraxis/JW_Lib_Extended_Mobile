<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>▪ Should the congregation keep a file of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In the May 1972 issue of the <em>Kingdom Ministry, </em>it was pointed out that it is advisable to keep in the Kingdom Hall library a file for the monthly editions of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>for reference purposes. It continues to be appropriate to maintain such a file in each Kingdom Hall library for the use of the elders and the publishers.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">With such a file available, publishers can refer to past material bearing on field service presentations, conducting Bible studies, making return visits, and so forth. Good ideas for use in the ministry can be found. From time to time, current issues of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>refer to issues that were published before some of the brothers were associated with the congregation. Newly associated ones can benefit if the file is kept. One of the newly designed <em>Watchtower </em>file cases could be used to store past copies of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>at the Kingdom Hall.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The elders should assign either the Theocratic Ministry School overseer or a qualified ministerial servant to make sure that this file is kept up-​to-​date month by month. While the information presented in <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>is in the form of suggestions and not rigid rules, it is still a fine source of reference material that should be a part of each congregation Kingdom Hall library. Back issues of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>cannot be ordered from Brooklyn, however.</p>

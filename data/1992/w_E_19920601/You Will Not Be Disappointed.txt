You Will Not Be Disappointed
ONE couple in the Philippines took two days to get there. They hiked 40 miles [70 km], carrying two young children through leech-infested jungles and over rivers swollen by typhoon rains. But they were determined not to miss it.
Two women in Zaire walked more than 300 miles [500 km], spending 14 days on the road, in order to be there. Also in Zaire, a 70-year old man got there by riding his bicycle 160 miles [260 km]. He was undeterred by the distance or the inconvenience. The important thing was not to miss it.
Where were all of them going? To one of the large-scale gatherings of Jehovah’s Witnesses organized in their countries. And however difficult the journey, all felt that their efforts were worthwhile.
Have you made plans yet to be at the 1992 “Light Bearers” District Convention? Likely, you will not have to go to such lengths as these faithful souls did to attend. But even if it costs you some inconvenience, we urge you not to miss it.
An excellent and highly practical program has been prepared. If you enjoy Christian fellowship and are interested in learning how to find real peace, what the future holds, or how better to do God’s will, we can promise that you will not be disappointed. Any Witness in your area will tell you where and when the convention nearest to you will be held.

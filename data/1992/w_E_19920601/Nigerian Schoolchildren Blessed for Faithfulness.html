<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE apostle Paul wrote: “If possible, as far as it depends upon you, be peaceable with all men.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:18-45:12:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 12:18</a>) Schoolchildren of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Nigeria apply this counsel, even when persecuted. As a result, Jehovah blesses them.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">□ One teacher disliked Jehovah’s Witnesses very much. During one morning’s assembly, he called all the Witnesses to the front and ordered them to sing the national anthem. They refused, stating that they wanted to give exclusive devotion to God. The teacher then took all of them outside and told them to cut the grass. Meantime, the other students continued with their classes.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">An adult Witness took the brochure <em>School and Jehovah’s Witnesses </em>to the teacher, explaining the neutral stand of Jehovah’s Witnesses. However, the teacher refused to discuss the matter or to accept the brochure. In fact, he immediately intensified the punishment of the children.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The young Witnesses continued to endure this punishment and went on cutting the grass even when the teacher was not present. One day the teacher hid and watched them unobserved as they continued working and singing Kingdom songs. He was so impressed that he sent them back to class, expressing amazement at their attitude. What was the result? The teacher is now having a Bible study with Jehovah’s Witnesses!</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Certainly these schoolchildren were blessed for their faithfulness to Jehovah and his principles.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:22-20:10:22" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 10:22</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">□ Ruth and her friends were also blessed for their faithfulness to Jehovah’s requirement to be “no part of the world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:16-43:17:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 17:16</a>) Ruth, who is 18, started pioneering when she was 12. She and other Witnesses received opposition from members of the school staff because of refusing to sing the national anthem. A teacher asked to see the girls’ parents. After they gave an explanation, using the <em>School </em>brochure, the teacher was satisfied and gave the students no more trouble.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">One day, however, a teacher from India insulted and punished one of the girls in front of the class when the girl did not sing the national anthem. The girl boldly defended her faith and the teacher took her to see the school principal. When they got there, the young Witness found that the vice-principal was also present. Much to her surprise, the principal and the vice-principal started to laugh. Turning to the teacher, the principal said: “Madam, do not worry yourself about these girls. Even if you should kill them, they would rather die than recite the anthem. Haven’t you heard about them?” She and her assistant then spoke of the faith and courage of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Speaking to the girl, the principal said that she was sorry for the embarrassment suffered. She then added: “Continue in your deeds of faith. I admire your religion and your courageous stand both outside and here in the school.” Later, the teacher who had been opposed apologized to the Witness, saying that she now understands the neutral stand taken by the Witnesses.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">These children followed the example of the three Hebrews who would not break their integrity to God by bowing down to an image, and also of Daniel, who refused to stop praying to Jehovah. These men were blessed by Jehovah because they were faithful to God’s righteous laws.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:1-27:3:30" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Daniel, chapters 3 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:6:1-27:6:28" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 6</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>What can we do to encourage people to read <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>regularly? We need to have interesting points to talk about when recommending the magazines to others. If we have become well acquainted with the people in our territory and have them in mind when we read the magazines, we can be looking for talking points to capture their interest.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>In some areas people may be of similar background, making it quite easy to note something that would be of general interest. But in other localities, we may find people from many different backgrounds. If we have a number of talking points in mind, we can pick one that best suits each person we meet.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Do not be quick to discard older issues of the magazines when receiving the newer ones. One brother usually holds up three or four issues of <em>The Watchtower </em>to a householder and allows him to pick the one he wants to read. If we find we are receiving more magazines than we can distribute, we should consider adjusting our order.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>By always using appropriate talking points, we may motivate others to read our magazines and perhaps start such ones on the road to life. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:14-40:7:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 7:14</a>) If we give careful consideration to this important matter, we can be assured of Jehovahâ€™s blessing.</p>

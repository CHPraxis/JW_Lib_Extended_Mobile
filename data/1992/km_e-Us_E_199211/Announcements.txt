Announcements
▪ Literature offer for November: New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures with the book The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s? December: The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. January: Any 192-​page book published in 1983 or earlier. If the congregation has no stock of such books to be offered, the book True Peace and Security​—How Can You Find It? should be offered and may be requested from Brooklyn. February: You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. NOTE: Congregations that will need the above-​mentioned campaign items should request them on their next monthly Literature Request Form (S(d)-14).
▪ Secretaries are to provide replacement Pioneer Service Identification cards only for pioneers who move into their congregation from within the United States (not including Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico). Please note our letters dated August 1, 1989, and January 1, 1991, in this regard. Also, before submitting the S-206 form advising the Society of pioneers going off the list, please review carefully the instructions on the form and answer all pertinent questions.
▪ Adjustments have been made in the School Guidebook to bring expressions and procedures up to date. The only significant change, on pages 100 to 102, affects the Theocratic Ministry School, making the procedure correspond with the instructions printed in the annual Theocratic Ministry School Schedule. This adjusted School Guidebook is now available in English and Spanish and may be requested by congregations as needed.
▪ Congregations should begin requesting the 1993 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses on their November literature requests. (See the Watchtower Publications List, paragraph 10.) The Yearbook will be available in Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, and Swedish. Until the Yearbook is available and shipments are made, it will appear as “Pending” on congregation packing lists. Yearbooks are special-​request items.​—See the Watchtower Publications List, paragraphs 24 and 25.

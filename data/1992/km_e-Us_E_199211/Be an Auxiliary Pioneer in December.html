<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>All of us do well to ask ourselves: ‘To what extent will I be a bearer of light during December? Can I be an auxiliary pioneer?’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:14-40:5:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 5:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:16-40:5:16" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 16</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Baptized young ones generally have extra time off from school during the holiday season. Some parents and other adult publishers may be able to join these in expanded field service during the month. Many who work full-​time will likewise have some additional time to dedicate to this lifesaving ministry.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>A key factor in being able to serve as an auxiliary pioneer is our willingness to put forth the required extra effort. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:13:24-42:13:24" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 13:24</a>) If we carefully organize our activity, including family and congregation matters, time can be made available so that we may experience the joy of serving as an auxiliary pioneer.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Will you be able to expand your ministry during December? Doing so can help you to feel more confident at the doors and result in upbuilding experiences. Greater happiness can thus be yours.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>.</p>

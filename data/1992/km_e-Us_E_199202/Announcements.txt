Announcements
▪ Literature offer for February: Any 192-​page book published in 1983 or earlier. If the congregation has no stock of these books, the book Worldwide Security Under the “Prince of Peace” should be offered and can be requested from Brooklyn. March: Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand! April and May: Watchtower subscription.
▪ The secretary and the service overseer should review the activity of all regular pioneers. If any are having difficulty meeting the requirement of hours, elders should arrange for assistance to be given. For suggestions, review Society’s letters (S-201) of October 1, 1991, and October 1, 1990. Also, see paragraphs 12-20 of the August 1986 Our Kingdom Ministry insert.
▪ On Saturday, April 25, 1992, the Brooklyn Bethel Home and factory as well as Watchtower Farms buildings will be closed for spring cleaning, so there will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on that day.
▪ The Memorial celebration will be held Friday, April 17, 1992. Although the talk may start earlier, please remember that the passing of the Memorial bread and wine should not begin until after sundown. Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. No meetings other than for field service are to be conducted on that date.
▪ The special public talk in 1992 will precede the Memorial and be held on Sunday, April 5, 1992. The title will be “Religion’s Role in World Affairs.” Congregations being visited by the circuit overseer, having a special assembly day, or having a circuit assembly will schedule the special public talk on the following Sunday, April 12, 1992. Those congregations having Public Meetings on days other than Sunday may schedule the special public talk during the period of April 6-11.
▪ Those publishers who wish to auxiliary pioneer in March and April should make their plans now and turn in their application early. This will help the elders to make necessary field service arrangements and have sufficient literature on hand.
▪ Recently, there has been an increase in mailing costs for audiocassette subscriptions, both for surface mail and for airmail, which affects the Society’s costs for supplying these.
▪ The Society has produced a new tract in English and in Spanish for use among the Jewish population. The title is A Peaceful New World​—Will It Come? (Tract No. 17). Congregations that have a Jewish population in their territory may wish to request a supply of this tract. As it becomes available in other languages, announcement will be made.

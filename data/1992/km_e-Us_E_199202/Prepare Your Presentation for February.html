<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>During February, we are featuring any 192-​page book published in 1983 or earlier or the <em>Worldwide Security </em>book. Any of these fine publications can be used to present the good news in a variety of ways. No doubt you will find it practical to learn and use one or all of the following suggested presentations.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>The Earth​—Man’s Lasting Home: </strong>If you want to start conversations with people who are concerned about the earth and its environment, try the theme “The Earth to Last Forever as Mankind’s Home.” This topic is flexible enough to capture the attention of family-​oriented people, nature lovers, and environmentalists. The scripture to use is <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:1:4-21:1:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 1:4</a>. The theme and scripture are explained in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="14" href="jwpub://p/E:1101986082/4-5"><em>Worldwide Security </em>book, pages 98-9, paragraphs 2 and 3</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>After introducing yourself, you could say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ “I am calling briefly to discuss a matter of deep concern to many of us. The earth is our home, and no doubt you too are concerned about the way it is being ruined. Scientists and environmentalists keep warning that if the pollution continues, the earth could become uninhabitable. Do you see any solution to the problem? [Pause for householder to comment if he desires.] Briefly, I would like to show you what the Bible says about the future of the earth at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:1:4-21:1:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 1:4</a>.” Read the text, and show comments in paragraphs 2 and 3 on <a class="xt" data-xtid="15" href="jwpub://p/E:1101986082/1-7:194">pages 98-9 of the <em>Worldwide Security</em></a> book.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>Wickedness to Be Removed: </strong>To appeal to people who are concerned about crime, violence, and war, you may want to converse with them on the theme “Wickedness to Be Removed So That Those Who Love God Can Enjoy Life and Peace.” <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:9-19:37:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 37:9-11</a> makes this point, and it is explained in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="16" href="jwpub://p/E:1101986084/18-20"><em>Worldwide Security </em>book, pages 118-20, paragraphs 13-15</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>Following a customary introduction, you could say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ “Do you think a time will ever come when we will not have to contend with crime and violence? [Allow for householder’s response.] The Bible points to the lasting solution here at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:9-19:37:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 37:9-11</a>.” Read the text and turn to <a class="xt" data-xtid="17" href="jwpub://p/E:1101986084/15:432-20">pages 118-20 in the <em>Worldwide Security</em></a> book to read selected portions of paragraphs 13-15.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup><strong>The Resurrection Hope: </strong>Since at some time everyone has lost a loved one in death, it could be comforting to initiate conversations on the topic “Kingdom Rule to Restore Life to Dead Loved Ones Under Paradise Conditions.” You could use either <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29</a> or <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:23:43-42:23:43" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 23:43</a> and show the comments on the topic and scripture that are found in the <a class="xt" data-xtid="18" href="jwpub://p/E:1101986090/16-18"><em>Worldwide Security </em>book, pages 166-7, paragraphs 12 and 13</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup><strong><em>You could begin your conversation with the third introduction on </em></strong><a class="xt" data-xtid="19" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989202/46:135-56"><strong><em>page 14 of the “Reasoning”</em></strong></a> <strong><em>book and then say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn">▪ “From time to time most of us think about loved ones we have lost in death. But do you feel that we might see them again?

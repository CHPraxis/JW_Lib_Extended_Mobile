<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“THIS means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) So said Jesus in prayer to his heavenly Father, and in this way he showed a vital prerequisite for gaining eternal life. Why, though, does the <em>New World Translation </em>render this verse “taking in knowledge of . . . God” instead of “know . . . God,” as most other translations of the Bible express it?​—See also the footnote to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Greek word here translated ‘take in knowledge’ or “know” is a form of the verb <em>gi·noʹsko. </em>And the rendering in the <em>New World Translation </em>is designed to bring out as fully as possible the meaning of that word. The basic meaning of <em>gi·noʹsko </em>is to “know,” but the Greek word has various shades of meaning. Note the following definitions:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“GINŌSKŌ (γινώσκω) signifies to be taking in knowledge, to come to know, recognize, understand, or to understand completely.” (<em>Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words, </em>W. E. Vine) Hence, rendering <em>gi·noʹsko </em>‘take in knowledge’ is not ‘changing the Bible,’ as critics of the <em>New World Translation </em>have alleged. In a discussion of the various shades of meaning the word can encompass, renowned lexicographer James Hope Moulton states: “The present simplex, γινώσκειν, is durative, ‘to be taking in knowledge.’”​—<em>A Grammar of New Testament Greek.</em></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><em>A Grammatical Analysis of the Greek New Testament </em>explains <em>gi·noʹsko </em>as it appears at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 17:3</a> as “implying a continuous process.” A further comment on this Greek word appears in <em>Word Studies in the New Testament, </em>by Marvin R. Vincent. This says: “Eternal life consists in knowledge, or rather the <em>pursuit </em>of knowledge, since the present tense marks <em>a continuance, a progressive </em>perception.” (Italics his.) A. T. Robertson’s <em>Word Pictures in the New Testament </em>suggests translating the word “should keep on knowing.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Therefore, in the original Greek, Jesus’ words at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 17:3</a> imply continuous effort to get to know the true God and his Son, Jesus Christ, and this is well brought out in the rendering of the <em>New World Translation.</em> We acquire this knowledge by diligently studying God’s Word and by obediently conforming our lives to its standards. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:4:1-28:4:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Hosea 4:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:8:2-28:8:2" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 8:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 2 Timothy 3:16, 17</a>.) What fine reward awaits those who acquaint themselves with God’s personality and with that of his Son and then strive to imitate them? Everlasting life!</p>

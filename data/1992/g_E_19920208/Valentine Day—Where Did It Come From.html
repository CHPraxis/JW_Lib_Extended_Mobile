<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">DID you ever send or receive a valentine, a card or a gift? In many countries it is the custom to send them out for February 14, Valentine Day. It is supposed to be a day celebrated by lovers. But how did the custom start?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><em>Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable </em>says: “Valentine, St. A priest of Rome who was imprisoned for succouring persecuted Christians. He became a convert and, . . . he was clubbed to death. His day is 14 February. . .</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“The ancient custom of choosing <em>Valentines </em>has only accidental relation to [the] saint, being essentially a relic of the old Roman <em>Lupercalia </em>. . . or from association with the mating season of birds. It was marked by the giving of presents and nowadays by the sending of a card on which cupids, transfixed hearts, etc., are depicted.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">And what does Cupid have to do with Valentine Day? The same source says: “Cupid (Lat[in] <em>cupido, </em>desire, love). The Roman god of love, identified with the Greek Eros. He is usually represented as a beautiful winged boy, blindfolded, and carrying a bow and arrows.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><em>The World Book Encyclopedia </em>gives further information, offering various theories on the origin of Valentine Day practices. “According to one story, the Roman Emperor Claudius II in the A.D. 200’s forbade young men to marry. The emperor thought single men made better soldiers. A priest named Valentine disobeyed the emperor’s order and secretly married young couples. . . . Many stories say that Valentine was executed on February 14 about A.D. 269. In A.D. 496, Saint Pope Gelasius I named February 14 as St. Valentine’s Day.”</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Regardless of the true origin of the practice, it is evident that it is rooted in ancient pagan beliefs and in Christendom’s listing of so-​called “saints.” Valentine Day is also another excuse for commercial exploitation of an often uninformed public.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:14-47:6:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 6:14-18</a>.</p>

1992 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses
Containing Report for the Service Year of 1991
While people of the world push more and more for independence, may we, as Jehovah’s Witnesses, adhere closer and closer to one another as we rejoice in our unifying hope and keep steadfast in prayer. Thus, for 1992 our yeartext is: “Rejoice in the hope. . . . Persevere in prayer.”​—Rom. 12:12.

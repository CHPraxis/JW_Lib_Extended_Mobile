Acts of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Modern Times
Kenya and Other Countries  66
Of all the regions of the earth, few hold the excitement, color, beauty, and glamour of Eastern Africa. And few have witnessed a people whose tested faith has stood firm under such fiery persecution. Read of faith in action in Kenya, Burundi, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Eritrea, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda, as well as the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean and Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula.
Solomon Islands  208
Spread like two necklaces of precious pearls across the turquoise-dappled waters of the Pacific lies the Melanesian nation of the Solomon Islands, fondly called “the Happy Isles” by its inhabitants. Read how a deep love for the spreading of Bible truth has helped some islanders accomplish amazing things in the making of disciples and the construction of halls for worship of Jehovah God.

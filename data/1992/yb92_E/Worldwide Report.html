<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The wicked, writes the psalmist, “sits in an ambush” and “from concealed places he will kill someone innocent.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:10:8-19:10:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ps. 10:8</a>) Down through the centuries, worshipers of Jehovah have been innocent victims of the viciousness of the wicked. It is no less so today in some parts of Africa.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Civil war in <strong><em>Liberia </em></strong>killed 33 of our brothers and forced many others to flee the country and seek refuge in Côte d’Ivoire and Sierra Leone, escaping with only the clothes on their backs. Relief committees, set up in two cities on the borders of Liberia and Côte d’Ivoire, not only have looked after these destitute refugees but have also sent aid to the remaining suffering Witnesses in Liberia. Witnesses in Côte d’Ivoire, Sierra Leone, and Ghana trucked tons of clothing, as well as medicine, food, and money, into Liberia. The brothers in Abidjan have also rushed to the rescue and are tenderly caring for a large group of refugees who also are in dire need of help.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Many of these brothers have undergone hair-raising, <span id="page43" class="pageNum" data-no="43" data-before-text="43"></span>traumatic experiences. For example, an elder serving in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, recounts: “On July 27, 1990, my family and I were forcibly removed from our home at about two in the morning. The rebels marched us outside, where we joined several hundred of our neighbors. We were assured that after a brief search of the area, we could go back home. Well, we never did see our homes again. Instead, we were led to the main refugee camp 30 miles <strong>[50 km] </strong>away. I carried my wife’s aunt, who is an invalid, on my back the entire distance. We prayed constantly to Jehovah for strength, as we saw dead bodies strewn about everywhere.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“After about an hour of nightmarish staggering with the rebel escort just behind us, we fell into an ambush by government troops. Bullets were flying from all directions as we dived for the ground. Many people were killed; some escaped. Suddenly, I realized that my own 14-year-old son was missing! Quickly, 45 of us townspeople were captured and taken to an abandoned gas station. There it was decided that all of us would be executed. A soldier took his gun to fire at me, but he could not fit the ammunition clip into his gun. At that moment, the group’s commander arrived and ordered that we be taken to the military barracks. That night, nine persons were executed. We prayed to Jehovah to help us remain faithful.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“The next morning the commander decided that all of us could leave. He even offered to drive us in one of his trucks. We declined and asked instead for a wheelbarrow in which to carry my wife’s aunt, and then we set off by ourselves. Halfway to our destination, the army trucks zoomed by. As they reached the intersection in front of us, a deafening explosion ripped the air. Heavy machine-gun fire followed for almost 30 minutes. Stray bullets were zipping in all directions while we scrambled for cover. The military convoy <span id="page44" class="pageNum" data-no="44" data-before-text="44"></span>that had offered to transport us had been completely wiped out. How thankful we were not to have accepted the commander’s offer of a ride!</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“Although my wife was five months pregnant, she managed bravely to walk 36 miles <strong>[58 km] </strong>in just one day. We still faced a problem of escaping. A Lebanese brother, learning of our predicament, arranged to pay our fares on the only means of transport out of the country, an old bus.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">“We finally made it safely across the border into Côte d’Ivoire. We were very sad, though, because we had lost track of our 14-year-old son during the ambush mentioned earlier. We thought he was dead, killed. However, to our greatest joy, we learned six months later that he had survived. Arrangements were made for him to join us here in Côte d’Ivoire.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Other Witnesses had terrifying experiences. Clement from Nigeria had lived for 17 years in Monrovia, but he had to flee. Rebel forces were hunting for all Nigerians and Ghanaians in the country. If caught by the rebels, he would be shot. As many as a hundred checkpoints, from Monrovia to Danané in Côte d’Ivoire, lay between Clement and safety. He was able to talk his way through most of these checkpoints by saying that he was an alien desiring to leave the country. At one checkpoint, his explanation did not work. He was to be executed. Clement decided to give a good witness before he would be put to death. He preached to the commander about God’s Kingdom and showed him the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. Perplexed, the commander bellowed: “Listen, we have a work to accomplish for the moment. When this is taken care of, we will turn our attention to what you are saying. Now, just leave!”</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Later, as Clement had the calmness of mind to reflect on this incident, he said he knows what <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:10-20:18:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:10</a> means <span id="page45" class="pageNum" data-no="45" data-before-text="45"></span>when it says that the name of Jehovah is a strong tower. It was only by using Jehovah’s name and preaching about God’s Kingdom that he was able to maneuver his way through the remaining checkpoints. Eventually, he crossed over the border into Côte d’Ivoire. He had reached safety! Recently some of the branch personnel have been able to return to Liberia.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Not all countries have so sad a story to tell. <strong><em>Mozambique </em></strong>gives us good reason to rejoice. On February 11, 1991, the government in Maputo granted legal recognition to the corporation named Jehovah’s Witnesses of Mozambique. We are very grateful indeed for this development because it means that missionaries can now be given residence in Mozambique. Literature and magazines can be imported without hindrance. Missionary homes have been established in three cities, housing a total of 18 missionaries. A Society-owned depot is located at each of these homes.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Nevertheless, young ones are called upon to maintain their neutrality and display their loyalty to Jehovah during the ongoing guerrilla war in that country. A 12-year-old girl who is deaf and mute was kidnapped for immoral purposes by the rebel forces. But her parents had trained her well in Bible principles. When her captors wanted to violate her, she staunchly refused. The young sister would point to heaven to show that immorality was against God’s law. Because of her firm resolution, her captors beat her viciously one day and left her for dead. Two months passed before she returned to her parents, accompanied by a woman who had been with her during her captivity. “I don’t know what you taught this young girl,” the woman said, “but I’m impressed by her moral conduct. She never gave in to pressure from the soldiers. She was just outstanding! What is your religion?” Because of the firm stand of this deaf sister, the woman is now studying with the Witnesses and making fine progress in learning the truth.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><span id="page46" class="pageNum" data-no="46" data-before-text="46"></span><strong>Asia</strong></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">“Your blessing is upon your people,” sang King David of old. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:3:8-19:3:8" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 3:8</a>) Today, Jehovah’s blessing is upon his people too. Jehovah’s Witnesses living in countries situated in Asia can give positive testimony to that fact.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">In <strong><em>Korea </em></strong>a sister’s life was saved in a rather unusual way by having her Medical Document on her person. As she was getting out of her parked car, she was suddenly attacked by four men, who forced her into the back of her car and onto the floor. She offered her ring and purse for her freedom, but they were not satisfied. The dreadful thought that they might sexually attack her rushed through her mind. She began screaming at the top of her voice. “We will have to kill her,” growled one of the men. She was stabbed in the leg and thigh. Then they taped her eyes shut and her feet together. Desperately, she began praying and weeping out loud, using the name of Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Abruptly, the men became stone-quiet. At last, one asked: “Lady, are you one of Jehovah’s Witnesses?” They had found <span id="page47" class="pageNum" data-no="47" data-before-text="47"></span>her Medical Document as they rummaged through her purse. They decided not to kill her but drove her to a place near her home, left her in the car, and quickly disappeared. The sister prays that all these men will repent of their lawless action and become worshipers of Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">As is true for many countries, more and more housewives in <strong><em>Japan </em></strong>are joining the labor force, which makes it difficult to reach them at home with the good news. So a pioneer sister in Niigata City decided to take the Kingdom message to the center of the city​—where the people were. She signed out a business territory from her congregation and began preaching, briefly offering a home Bible study to the businesspeople she would meet. She used the brochure <em>“Look! I Am Making All Things New” </em>and followed up the interest by making return visits on all persons who showed even a little interest. She suggested to interested ones that they could study in a teahouse, in a department-store lounge, or at a park for 30 minutes during lunch break. She concentrates on only one particular point during each study session and has been conducting up to eight studies at a time in this business territory.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">More than 60,000 Filipinos have come from the Philippines to work as domestics in Chinese homes on the island of <strong><em>Hong Kong. </em></strong>The majority of these workers are Roman Catholic. One sister met such a person in an elevator and simply asked her if she was interested in learning more about the Bible. The reply was: “I have been praying to learn more about the Bible.” A Bible study was started just that quickly.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">In <strong><em>Cyprus </em></strong>a young publisher from Nicosia wrote: “My name is Marcos; I am 12 years old. In the class for religious instruction, the teacher planned three lessons about religion. I made sure I brought to class the book <em>Mankind’s Search for God. </em>Before the first lesson began, I showed the book to my <span id="page48" class="pageNum" data-no="48" data-before-text="48"></span>teacher. She paged through it and placed it on her desk. A little later she said to the class: ‘I am going to use Marcos’ book for the lessons, as it contains more thorough information than the book provided by the school.’” Young Marcos concludes: “I encourage all young publishers to have always with them some of the Society’s literature at school.”</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Lucas, a Roman Catholic by birth, started studying the Bible in <strong><em>Sri Lanka</em></strong><em>. </em>He was one of a crew of four men who worked on a fishing boat owned by a Buddhist. His employer desired the blessings of the sea gods on his fishing business, so he asked the crew to make a pilgrimage to a famous center of worship for adherents of both Hinduism and Buddhism. Lucas explained that he would not be able to participate, since he believed that Jehovah is the only true God. “Either join us or you’re fired!” snapped the owner. Lucas resigned immediately. He returned to his village and in just a few days found a job on another boat. Now he is able to study regularly.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">When Bangnam, a young married woman who lives in <strong><em>Thailand</em></strong><em>, </em>began studying the Bible, her parents fell sick. The parents consulted a witch doctor who said that the spirits of their dead relatives did not approve of their daughter’s changing her religion and if the parents wanted to recover, they must stop their daughter’s Bible studies. The parents begged their daughter to quit the study. The special pioneer who was studying with Bangnam showed the parents from the Bible that it could not be the spirits of the dead causing the trouble, but instead, it was wicked spirits. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:9:5-21:9:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eccl. 9:5, 6</a>) The parents then concluded that they should send their daughter far away. However, the sister showed them how the Bible teaches children to love their parents and how Bangnam wanted to live with them to care for them because she loves them. When the mother heard this, she relented and agreed <span id="page49" class="pageNum" data-no="49" data-before-text="49"></span>to go with the sister to town to see a medical doctor. The doctor found nothing wrong with her. On the way home, a rainstorm developed, and as it was getting quite late, the special pioneer suggested that the mother spend the night with her at her home. Next morning Bangnam’s mother woke up refreshed and was very excited, since she had slept well all night, without any problem breathing. When the father learned about this improvement in his wife’s health, he agreed to get rid of all their spiritistic trappings. Quickly his health improved as well. Bangnam is now baptized, and her husband is progressing toward dedication.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Than lives in <strong><em>Myanmar. </em></strong>He was a soldier, but his military career ended in bitter disappointment. His life of despair started this way: During intense fighting with rebel forces, a shell exploded near a bunker where he had concealed himself. The bunker collapsed, burying half of his body. After he was dug out from under the rubble, he discovered, to his dismay, that he could not move his legs​—he was paralyzed. Soon the army discharged him. In his hopeless state, he began to brood over his misfortune, lost all faith in God, and contemplated suicide. About this same time, a special pioneer brother was visiting Than’s neighbor, regularly conducting a Bible study. Once Than learned who the regular visitor was, he invited him into his home also. The pioneer comforted Than with the Scriptures. A Bible study was started. It did not take long for him to recognize the ring of truth, and he enthusiastically started witnessing to others. He also wanted to attend the meetings at the Kingdom Hall, which is about five <strong>[8 km] </strong>miles away. He acquired an old pair of bicycle wheels and built himself a wheeled cart. With great determination, he pulls and pushes himself up and down the slopes leading to the Kingdom Hall and attends meetings regularly. His bitter disappointment has been replaced by a radiant hope of a better future.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><span id="page50" class="pageNum" data-no="50" data-before-text="50"></span><strong>Europe</strong></p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">“Our soul is like a bird that is escaped from the trap of baiters. The trap is broken, and we ourselves have escaped. Our help is in the name of Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:124:7-19:124:8" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 124:7, 8</a>) How well this psalm describes our brothers in Eastern Europe!</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">The past service year was a remarkable one in the history of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the <strong><em>Soviet Union. </em></strong>Besides record peaks in the publisher and pioneer ranks, seven peaks in book placements and ten peaks in magazine placements gave added reason for our brothers to rejoice in their newly obtained freedom. These peaks were attained because, for the very first time, shipments of literature could be received.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">On Monday, March 18, 1991, the branch in Germany dispatched the first truck, containing about 20 tons of literature, to the Soviet Union. Prior to this, the brothers received their literature in small parcels by mail. How did the arrival of the first truckload of literature turn out?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">It was midnight in the city of Lvov, when a local elder answered an unexpected telephone call. It was the Germany <span id="page51" class="pageNum" data-no="51" data-before-text="51"></span>branch on the other end of the line notifying him that a large truck with a yellow cab and a blue body was being loaded with literature stamped for its destination, the Soviet Union. They agreed upon a rendezvous​—the Polish-Soviet border. By the time the Soviet Witnesses arrived at the border on Wednesday, the weather had turned bitter. Undaunted by the biting cold and rain mixed with snow, the brothers resolutely took turns in scrutinizing each truck as it approached the border. One of them exclaimed: “We’ve been waiting for decades for this memorable moment. Therefore, we consider it a privilege to wait for hours or perhaps even days.”</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">Finally on Friday, March 22, at exactly eight in the morning, a truck with a yellow cab and a long, large blue body could be seen rolling toward the border. From the depths of the brothers’ hearts, prayers rose heavenward. The truck passed over the border and entered Soviet soil. When the two puzzled customs officers gazed at the amount of literature, they wondered how to handle this situation and began to discuss the matter. After a document and cargo check, the officers nodded their heads and, with a quick wave of their hands, allowed the truck to pass through. “Our joy was unbounded!” said the brothers in retrospect. “After many decades of severe persecution, our brothers are finally supplied with an abundance of spiritual food.”</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">A permit to unload the cargo was issued. More than 70 brothers waited eagerly to help with the work. They formed two “conveyer” lines, with literature packages moving systematically, almost in musical rhythm, from hand to hand. On the next day, Saturday, brothers came from faraway territories throughout the vast land to pick up the literature. Two brothers who had traveled about 2,200 miles <strong>[3,500 km] </strong>were the first to arrive. “Jehovah God did what no man is able to do, and we were eyewitnesses of these happenings,” said the one.</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="sb"><span id="page52" class="pageNum" data-no="52" data-before-text="52"></span>From the city of Dresden in what was once known as <strong><em>East Germany </em></strong>comes this experience: “For a long time, my wife and I had been trying to win my parents over to the truth, but all we received was opposition. However, in November 1988 my wife had to go to the hospital for three weeks. We had no choice but to leave our 18-month-old daughter, Sara, in Grandma and Grandpa’s care.</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">“Things started happening right on the first day. At the breakfast table, Sara wondered why Grandma and Grandpa just sat down and started eating. So she nudged Grandma, folded her hands, and said: ‘Grandma, pray!’ She bowed her head and shut her eyes tight. Grandma did not respond; Sara repeated her request. Finally, my mother realized what Sara wanted, so she said grace in the Lutheran manner. That evening my mother asked me which religion we were affiliated with. She only knew that we had resigned from the church. She had never allowed us to explain anything else. I explained things to her. Grandma agreed to treat Sara the way she was used to being treated by us, so I gave her <em>My Book of Bible Stories, </em>since Sara was used to hearing a story every evening.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">“Sara talked Grandma into reading three or four stories each night. My parents were surprised at Sara’s Bible knowledge, since she would sometimes interrupt the stories and finish the account herself. My mother began getting curious about the things she was reading to Sara night after night. In May 1990 we began a home Bible study with my parents. Soon, they resigned from church membership and came to the meetings with us. A year later, in May 1991, my mother became an unbaptized publisher and is now preparing for baptism. My father is also progressing very well. We thank Jehovah for having used our little girl and the <em>Bible Stories </em>book in order to accomplish something we tried to do for such a long time without success.”</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">In <strong><em>Austria </em></strong>many young people are taking a firm stand for <span id="page53" class="pageNum" data-no="53" data-before-text="53"></span>true worship. Melanie, an 11-year-old girl, is an example. Because of family circumstances, the custody of Melanie was taken from her mother and given to her stepsister. The stepsister and her husband started to study the Bible with the help of Jehovah’s Witnesses, and Melanie joined in too. They all made good progress. Melanie desired to leave the Catholic Church. However, according to Austrian law, this can only be done after one reaches the age of 14. Did this end the matter for Melanie? No! She went to the director of the Youth Welfare Office and made known her desire. After an interview this director said in a letter to Melanie: “After a thorough deliberation, I would like to let you know that I give my consent for you to leave the Catholic Church. However, as to the existing law, it will also be necessary for the local court to be in agreement with the decision I have made.” So Melanie had to appear all on her own before the judge and to give reasons why she would like to leave the church. On September 21, 1990, she received a favorable decision by the local court. What a fine victory for an 11-year-old girl! Melanie now is taking a joyful part in the preaching work as an unbaptized publisher.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">A woman in <strong><em>Finland, </em></strong>severely hurt in a car accident, was lying in the hospital, thinking: ‘If my life would have ended, would this have been all there was to life?’ When she returned home, she searched the Bible for an answer but did not find one. She sighed: “God in heaven, please, let me know what is the purpose of life. I know it should be in the Bible. I ask you sincerely, help me to understand it.” Hardly had ten minutes gone by, when the doorbell rang, and who stood at the door? One of Jehovah’s Witnesses with a warm smile. “I was shocked,” she said. “My first thought was: ‘Oh, no! Did it have to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses?’ But I restrained myself and asked her to come in. From then on my understanding of the Bible has continued to improve.”</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="ss"><span id="page54" class="pageNum" data-no="54" data-before-text="54"></span><strong>Latin America</strong></p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb">“I shall laud Jehovah according to his righteousness, and I will make melody to the name of Jehovah the Most High.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:7:17-19:7:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ps. 7:17</a>) For the past service year, this psalm of David has been a constant theme of the publishers living in Latin America.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="sb">Should creation be given equal time along with the study of evolution? That is a question often asked in <strong><em>Ecuador. </em></strong>In the seaport city of Guayaquil, a teacher decided to consider the information in the book <em>Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? </em>with his 104 students. At the end of the school term this past January, he asked his students a series of questions. One was: “Taking into consideration all the scientific and Biblical proofs given in this class, to what conclusion have you arrived as to the origin of life?” The answers were overwhelmingly in favor of divine creation. One student replied: “I have come to the conclusion that the earth and all that is in it must have been brought into existence by a perfectionist. There must have existed someone very loving <span id="page55" class="pageNum" data-no="55" data-before-text="55"></span>who had a purpose for people that live here. It is absurd to think that something as complicated as living persons could be created by chance. It is not in the hands of man to create something as complex as life.”</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="sb">Bible truth has had such an impact on this teacher that he was baptized in December 1990. Present to witness the baptism at that local circuit assembly were 42 of his students. Coincidentally, 31 of the students were also studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses in Guayaquil!</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">A Bible student living deep in the interior of <strong><em>Guyana </em></strong>near the Moruka River studies by mail. She strongly desired to be united in pure worship with Jehovah’s Witnesses on the night of the Memorial of Christ’s death. At great expense she rented a dugout canoe and with her 13-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter paddled 21 hours to the nearest congregation in Charity. The journey entailed traveling the Moruka River out to the Atlantic Ocean and paddling back inland again on the Pomeroon River. She started out at 9:30 p.m. and arrived at 6:20 p.m. the next day, stopping for just one hour to rest. After the Memorial she had to return right away, as the canoe was rented at a daily rate. She is an unbaptized publisher and at the time of the Memorial was four months pregnant!</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="sb">Last March in <strong><em>Venezuela, </em></strong>a Roman Catholic priest came to the branch office seeking literature. Then he asked to speak to someone about certain doctrinal points. He introduced himself as being over 65 years old and having served as a priest for 37 years. He studied for the priesthood in Rome, Italy. For the last four years, he had been reading information related to the councils of the Catholic Church and was surprised at what he found. “The church is far from having the truth,” he said.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="sb">“These days I have been reading more in the Bible than during my whole life,” he said. “I’m confused. The teachings <span id="page56" class="pageNum" data-no="56" data-before-text="56"></span>of the church do not harmonize with the Bible. I have to teach, but my conscience does not permit me to teach lies. I’m seeking how to get out of this torture. I’ve dedicated my whole life to the church; now I’m an old man, and what can I do at my age? Where would I find a job? I live in a fine place, I have a luxury car, I have money in the bank, but if I leave the church, I lose all of this. I don’t know what to do.”</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">The brother showed him some scriptures establishing that Jehovah does not abandon those who serve Him. The brother, knowing the priest had studied Greek, showed him <em>The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures, </em>referring him to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:28-40:10:28" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 10:28</a>. Excitedly the priest exclaimed, “But this is very clear, very clear​—the soul dies! So this has been another lie!”</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="sb">After they talked for some time, the brother asked the priest why he had come to the branch office. His answer was quite interesting. A 14-year-old publisher entered his church in Caracas, found a lady praying, and asked her where the priest was. “There in the back,” was the answer. So the young brother went to the back of the church and found the priest’s office. “What do you want?” the priest asked the boy. Our young publisher said he had come to talk about the Bible; he told the priest that Babylon the Great will be destroyed, and if the priest did not get out of false religion, he would also be destroyed. The priest was so surprised that a 14-year-old boy could explain so many things so boldly to a man his age that he was speechless. The young publisher gave him the address of the branch office. That is why this priest showed up at the office.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="sb">After about a two-hour discussion, the priest left. We hope that he will have the courage to face his superiors and accept the truth.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="ss"><span id="page57" class="pageNum" data-no="57" data-before-text="57"></span><strong>North America and the Caribbean Islands</strong></p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="sb">Witnesses in North America and the islands of the Caribbean echo these words of the psalmist David: “Bless Jehovah, O my soul, even everything within me, his holy name. Bless Jehovah, O my soul, and do not forget all his doings.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:103:1-19:103:2" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Ps. 103:1, 2</a>.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="sb">Sometimes, interested individuals may take the position that they are too old to change religions. However, one elderly lady in British Columbia, <strong><em>Canada, </em></strong>does not share that view. She was well-known in her small community, being an art teacher and one of the principal supporters of the Anglican Church. She had personally paid for the altar in the church and was a lay reader in religious services. Being interested in the Bible, she had been on the magazine route of the local Witnesses for a number of years but had made no progress beyond that. About five years ago, her daughter and her daughter’s husband moved into her home, ostensibly to help her in her advanced years. However, they were opposed to <span id="page58" class="pageNum" data-no="58" data-before-text="58"></span>Jehovah’s Witnesses and badgered her to move into a home for the aged. She was certainly not ready for that! So while her daughter and son-in-law were away on vacation, she moved into a mobile home.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="sb">Finally, one of our sisters used the direct approach, demonstrated our Bible study method, and asked her if she was interested in studying the Bible. Her response was: “I was wondering when you were going to ask me!” Since she was a sincere believer in the Bible, she quickly understood basic Bible truths, stating: “If it’s in the Bible, it must be true.” However, she continued attending her church, feeling that she would in this way be able to help fellow church members.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sb">After studying for about a year and a half, she learned that an archbishop of the Anglican Church had misappropriated church funds and gone on a vacation trip to the Caribbean with his secretary, even though he was a married man. She also understood that the archbishop then tried to pin the blame for the misappropriated funds on a church deacon. This whole affair was brought to light during a heated open discussion in the church. During the discussion, she publicly labeled the archbishop an “old hypocrite,” following which she walked out of the church and loudly slammed the door behind her, never to return.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sb">When she first attended meetings at the Kingdom Hall, she remarked: “I can’t believe how many men you have and how involved and active they are in congregation affairs. In the church I was in, the few men that did come just sat and slept.” On September 29, 1990, at the age of 87, she was baptized.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sb">After his latest visit to <strong><em>Greenland, </em></strong>a circuit overseer rejoiced: “The miracle goes on! And this is only the tip of the iceberg.” Many new ones are attending meetings, studies are being started, new ones are joining in the field ministry and are being baptized.</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" class="sb"><span id="page59" class="pageNum" data-no="59" data-before-text="59"></span>Several of the new ones have had to fight a long-lasting struggle to gain an approved relationship with Jehovah. For example, Andy (not his real name) was in his mid-30’s. He was living with Eunice (not her real name); he was an alcoholic with bad associates. This undermined their relationship, and his troubled conscience sometimes showed itself in unpleasant ways. But then Eunice began studying the Bible. She gradually understood that if she wanted to be acceptable in Jehovah’s eyes, she must clean up her life, and so she moved away from Andy.</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" class="sb">This made Andy understand the situation he was in: He had chosen liquor​—she had chosen a Christian way of life. Eunice continued her progress and was baptized, and she is a zealous sister in the congregation.</p>
<p id="p55" data-pid="55" class="sb">Then Andy asked to have a study. He made some spiritual progress, rejoiced in the things he learned, but still had relapses into his old weakness. He only rarely attended the meetings and could not stay away from bad association. In 1989, Andy attended the district convention​—and that was a turning point. He now believed that he could overcome the problem, and he went to his doctor for help. He was hospitalized, and when he returned to his home, the congregation was ready to help him. He says: “I felt I had a much better foundation for going into spiritual matters. I was free of liquor, and my life was stable. My old associates were replaced by new ones in the congregation. My relationship with Jehovah became more real, and it was only now that I felt I could approach him in prayer. Since then, prayer has been of great importance to me. Ever so frequently I have prayed to Jehovah, and he has heard me. When temptation became too great and my desire to do wrong almost overwhelmed me, I always seemed to meet some of my friends from the Kingdom Hall, who encouraged me to hold on to my new way of life.”</p>
<p id="p56" data-pid="56" class="sb"><span id="page60" class="pageNum" data-no="60" data-before-text="60"></span>This is the third year that Andy has been free of liquor. God’s Word, His spirit, and His organization have helped Andy. He began preaching and was baptized at the “Lovers of Freedom” Convention in Godthaab (Nuuk) this past August.</p>
<p id="p57" data-pid="57" class="sb">When someone is determined to share in the worship of Jehovah, physical disability is no barrier. For example, Kenwyn, who is now 17 years old, lives on the island of <strong><em>Grenada. </em></strong>When he was 4 years old, he had a fall that seriously affected his ability to walk. As he grew older, walking became more and more difficult. By the age of 15, he was forced to walk with the aid of wooden crutches. At age 17, an operation intended to correct his walking problem was not successful.</p>
<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="sb">It was about this time that Kenwyn began to study with one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, a missionary. He made good progress in accepting Bible knowledge but hesitated when invited to share his knowledge with others in the house-to-house ministry. He was afraid because of his physical condition and would reply: “I’ll tell you when I’m ready.” He was encouraged to read for himself experiences from <em>Awake! </em>and <em>The Watchtower </em>of Witnesses who had a physical disability yet regularly preached from door to door. After reading these experiences, he announced to the missionary: “I’m ready now.”</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="sb">And ready he was. He spent 19 hours witnessing to others his first month in the field ministry. The following month, he reported 63 hours. He was baptized in March of this year and enrolled as an auxiliary pioneer the next month. Kenwyn can be seen walking with crutches up and down the hilly terrain of his witnessing territory. What an outstanding example and source of encouragement he is to all in his congregation! Since hills are no barrier to his preaching work, the brothers affectionately call him “Four-Wheel Drive.”</p>
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="ss"><span id="page61" class="pageNum" data-no="61" data-before-text="61"></span><strong>Islands of the Pacific</strong></p>
<p id="p61" data-pid="61" class="sb">“He will have subjects from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth,” foretold <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:8-19:72:8" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 72:8</a>. True to those words, the greater Solomon, Christ Jesus, has subjects around the earth, including the islands of the Pacific.</p>
<p id="p62" data-pid="62" class="sb">The inhabitants of the small islands and atolls of the western Pacific under the <strong><em>Guam </em></strong>branch are receiving a witness in many languages. The book <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth </em>has found its way into many homes. From one island comes this experience: One woman who accepted a copy of this book noticed that her father, who is the pastor of their church, was using the red book in his sermon from the pulpit. After the sermon she saw him discreetly put it into his attaché case so that others would not notice it. But she did, and after the service she asked him: “Papa, why are you using that red book?” He replied: “What the book says is true.” She asked him where he got his book. “It’s your book,” he said. After this experience she and her husband were eager to study the Bible with the help of the local Witnesses. One day her neighbors began to ridicule her for allowing the <span id="page62" class="pageNum" data-no="62" data-before-text="62"></span>Witnesses to study with her, since her father was a pastor. But when the pastor heard of this, he rebuked them and said: “Do not say anything against them [the Witnesses], as they are God’s people bringing the good news to us.”</p>
<p id="p63" data-pid="63" class="sb">The branch in <strong><em>Papua New Guinea </em></strong>received the following letter from the Morobe Province: “We here in Lengbati live in thick bush country where there are big mountains and no roads for cars. There is a small airstrip, but the plane does not come often. In 1987 there was only one Witness who did field service and conducted Bible studies. The circuit overseer and his wife came and looked after us, and at this time opposition struck. Enemies of the Kingdom tried to stop our work and burned down the Kingdom Hall before the eyes of the circuit overseer. What was the result of this opposition? We now have seven publishers and meet in a new Kingdom Hall we built. When we do the Kingdom work, we feel very happy, just as all our brothers and sisters elsewhere are feeling when they do the same work.”</p>
<p id="p64" data-pid="64" class="sb">Young ones can do a lot to help other young ones learn the truth. In <strong><em>Australia, </em></strong>nine-year-old Linda was asked by her teacher to sit next to Rebecca, who was sitting alone. Linda made friends with Rebecca and talked to her about the Kingdom. Eventually she started a study with Rebecca during the lunch hour at school, using the book <em>Listening to the Great Teacher. </em>They then spoke to another pupil, Ebony, and she joined the study. Then, along came Sarah, yet another pupil, to ask if she could join in the game they were playing. Linda explained it was not a game​—they were studying the Bible. So Sarah joined in too. Another girl asked if she could join in, and now at times there are two groups of children studying the <em>Great Teacher </em>book, Linda taking one group and Rebecca the other. Then the teacher became curious and wanted to know what they were doing, so Linda showed her the <em>Great Teacher </em>book, and the teacher gave her approval.</p>
<p id="p65" data-pid="65" class="ss"><span id="page63" class="pageNum" data-no="63" data-before-text="63"></span><strong>Countries Under Ban</strong></p>
<p id="p66" data-pid="66" class="sb">“Deliver me from my persecutors, for they are stronger than I am,” cried David to his Savior, Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:142:6-19:142:6" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Ps. 142:6</a>) Today, in countries that have restricted the witnessing work, Jehovah’s people look to Him for their salvation. And Jehovah hears their pleas and comforts them.</p>
<p id="p67" data-pid="67" class="sb">This past service year, their 15th consecutive year under ban, has proved to be a very busy, as well as a blessed one for Jehovah’s Witnesses in one country in <strong><em>Asia. </em></strong>A new peak of Kingdom publishers was reached​—a 9-percent increase! However, caution is still needed. For example, one congregation meets in the home of an elder. For no apparent reason, the neighbors became displeased with the meetings and began to heave bricks and stones onto the galvanized roof of the house. Tempers rising, some brothers at the meeting wanted to confront the culprits. However, the elder calmly convinced them to depend on Jehovah’s spirit and not to resort to force. The next-door neighbors dug a trench along the outer side of the wall of the brother’s property, three feet deep <strong>[1 m] </strong>and one and a half feet wide <strong>[0.5 m]</strong>, hoping that the wall would collapse and, therefore, the meetings would <span id="page64" class="pageNum" data-no="64" data-before-text="64"></span>be stopped. The elder patiently waited on Jehovah. About a month later, the neighbor who was the instigator became sick. As he left for the hospital, he inadvertently backed his car into the trench that was dug along the brother’s wall. Neighbors helped him out of his predicament, but no one could improve his health. He continued to get weaker and died shortly thereafter. Rather than retaliate, the brothers were patient and learned that relief from persecutors comes in some unexpected and unusual ways.</p>
<p id="p68" data-pid="68" class="sb">A youth organization of the ruling political party in one country in <strong><em>Africa </em></strong>continues to brutalize the Witnesses because they refuse to carry political party cards. Persecution has continued relentlessly for the past 24 years. During all this time, Jehovah’s people have remained submissive to the superior authorities, never insulting them or seeking revenge.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:13:1-45:13:1" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Rom. 13:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p69" data-pid="69" class="sb">Their steadfastness to Bible principles has won the respect of some opposers. For example, one brother was arrested and taken to prison a little over a year ago. The police officer in charge said: “So, we have finally caught you.” However, the police had known all along of his pattern of theocratic activities but had taken no action against him until the vehicle he was driving, which was carrying a load of Bible literature, was involved in an accident with a police vehicle. Although the brother was sentenced, he was treated well while incarcerated.</p>
<p id="p70" data-pid="70" class="sb">The brother in whose name the vehicle was registered also appeared before the police. He had to explain why his vehicle was carrying so-called unlawful literature. During interrogation he was asked: “Are you one of Jehovah’s Witnesses?” He replied: “Before the ban I became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Since the ban I have not changed to another religion. My family and I pray at home, and we do not interfere with anyone else. So, what do you think, Officer?” Amazingly, all charges against him were dropped, and he was allowed to drive the vehicle home. Thus, the Witnesses have remained faithful to their God during all these years, and Jehovah has given them increase and the strength not to give up.</p>

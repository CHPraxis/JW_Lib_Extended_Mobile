<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>SOME people never stop talking about money​—or their lack of it. Unhappily for them, in recent years they have had much to discuss. In 1992 even the affluent West experienced a recession, and executives as well as rank-and-file workers found themselves out of work. Many wondered if they would ever again see a time of stable prosperity.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="2"><sup>2</sup></span> Is it wrong to be concerned about our material well-being? No, to a degree it is only natural. At the same time, there is a basic truth that we must recognize about wealth. Ultimately, all material things come from the Creator. He is “the true God, Jehovah, . . . the One laying out the earth and its produce, the One giving breath to the people on it, and spirit to those walking in it.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:5-23:42:5" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 42:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="3"><sup>3</sup></span> Although Jehovah does not foreordain who is to be rich and who is to be poor, all of us are answerable for the way we use whatever share we have of “the earth and its produce.” If we use our wealth to lord it over others, Jehovah will hold us accountable. And any who slave for riches rather than for Jehovah will find that “the one trusting in his riches​—he himself will fall.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:11:28-20:11:28" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 11:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:24-40:6:24" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Matthew 6:24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:9-54:6:9" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 1 Timothy <span id="page8" class="pageNum" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>6:9</a>) Material prosperity not accompanied by a heart submissive to Jehovah is ultimately without value.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:2:3-21:2:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 2:3-11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:2:18-21:2:19" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 18, 19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:16:9-42:16:9" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Luke 16:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="4"><sup>4</sup></span> In addition to material prosperity, the Bible speaks of spiritual prosperity. This is clearly the better kind. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:19-40:6:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matthew 6:19-21</a>) Spiritual prosperity entails a satisfying relationship with Jehovah that can last for eternity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:12-21:7:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:12</a>) Moreover, spiritually rich servants of God do not lose out on wholesome material blessings. In the new world, spiritual wealth will be linked with material prosperity. Faithful ones will enjoy a material security that is not gained by bitter competition or the sacrifice of health and happiness, as is so often the case today. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:16-19:72:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 72:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:28-20:10:28" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Proverbs 10:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:25:6-23:25:8" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> Isaiah 25:6-8</a>) They will find that in every way “the blessing of Jehovah . . . makes rich, and he adds no pain with it.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:22-20:10:22" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Proverbs 10:22</a>.</p>

True, they work to pay their bills and feed their families. Or some might even lose their jobs in times of recession. But they are not overwhelmed by such concerns. Rather, they believe Jesus’ promise when he said: “Never be anxious and say, ‘What are we to eat?’ or, ‘What are we to drink?’ or, ‘What are we to put on?’ . . . For your heavenly Father knows you need all these things. Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:31-40:6:33" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 6:31-33</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> This truly is spiritual prosperity, something money cannot buy. It is a striking fulfillment of Jehovah’s promise: “‘Bring all the tenth parts into the storehouse, that there may come to be food in my house; and test me out, please, in this respect,’ Jehovah of armies has said, ‘whether I shall not open to you people the floodgates of the heavens and actually empty out upon you a blessing until there is no more want.’” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:10-39:3:10" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Malachi 3:10</a>) We today have seen this promise fulfilled. Why, though, does Jehovah, the Source of all wealth, ask that his servants bring in a tenth part, or a tithe? Who benefits from the tithe? To answer these questions, consider why Jehovah spoke these words through Malachi in the fifth century B.C.E.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> In Malachi’s time God’s people were not prospering. Why not? In part it had to do with offerings and tithes. Back then, Israel was under the Mosaic Law covenant. When Jehovah made that covenant, he promised <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>that if Israel kept their part of it, he would bless them spiritually and materially. In effect, Israel’s prosperity depended on their faithfulness.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:28:1-5:28:19" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 28:1-19</a>.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 9. In the days of ancient Israel, why did Jehovah require Israel to pay tithes and bring offerings?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Part of Israel’s obligation under the Law was to bring offerings to the temple and to pay tithes. Some of the offerings were burned in their entirety on the altar of Jehovah, while others were divided between the priests and the ones presenting the sacrifice, with special portions being offered to Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:1:3-3:1:9" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Leviticus 1:3-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:7:1-3:7:15" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 7:1-15</a>) Regarding tithes, Moses told the Israelites: “Every tenth part of the land, out of the seed of the land and the fruit of the tree, belongs to Jehovah. It is something holy to Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:27:30-3:27:30" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Leviticus 27:30</a>) The tithe was given to the Levite workers at the tabernacle and later at the temple. In turn, nonpriestly Levites would give a tenth of what they received to the Aaronic priests. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:18:21-4:18:29" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Numbers 18:21-29</a>) Why did Jehovah require Israel to pay tithes? First, so that they could show in a tangible way their appreciation for Jehovah’s goodness. And second, so that they could contribute to the support of the Levites, who could then concentrate on their obligations, including the teaching of the Law. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:17:7-14:17:9" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 17:7-9</a>) In this way pure worship was also supported, and everyone benefited.</p>

There was no punishment prescribed in the Law, but there were consequences. Jehovah withheld his blessing, and the Levites, deprived of material support, left their temple duties in order to support themselves. Thus, all Israel suffered.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="12"><sup>12</sup></span> That was hard discipline, but after 70 years Jehovah restored his people to their homeland. Many of the Paradise prophecies in Isaiah were to have their initial fulfillment after that return. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:35:1-23:35:2" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Isaiah 35:1, 2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:1-23:52:9" data-bid="22-2" class="b"> 52:1-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:17-23:65:19" data-bid="22-3" class="b"> 65:17-19</a>) Yet, the main reason Jehovah brought his people back was, not to build an earthly paradise, but to rebuild the temple and restore true worship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/15:1:2-15:1:3" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ezra 1:2, 3</a>) If Israel obeyed Jehovah, material benefits would follow, and the blessing of Jehovah would make them rich both spiritually and materially. Accordingly, as soon as they arrived in their homeland in 537 B.C.E., the Jews built an altar in Jerusalem and began work on the temple. However, they encountered strong opposition and stopped.

Haggai showed that the <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>nation was suffering material hardships and related this to their lack of zeal for Jehovah’s house. He said: “This is what Jehovah of armies has said, ‘Set your heart upon your ways. You have sown much seed, but there is a bringing of little in. There is an eating, but it is not to satisfaction. There is a drinking, but not to the point of getting intoxicated. There is a putting on of clothes, but it is not with anyone’s getting warm; and he that is hiring himself out is hiring himself out for a bag having holes.’ This is what Jehovah of armies has said, ‘Set your heart upon your ways.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Encouraged by Haggai and Zechariah, the Israelites set their hearts upon their ways, and the temple was built. Some 60 years later, though, Nehemiah visited Jerusalem and found that Israel had again become neglectful of Jehovah’s Law. He corrected this. But on a second visit, he found that things had again deteriorated. He reports: “I got to find out that the very portions of the Levites had not been given them, so that the Levites and the singers doing the work went running off, each one to his own field.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:13:10-16:13:10" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Nehemiah 13:10</a>) This problem was corrected, and “all Judah, for their part, brought in the tenth of the grain and of the new wine and of the oil to the stores.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/16:13:12-16:13:12" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Nehemiah 13:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> Likely, the prophesying by Malachi was in this same general time period, and the prophet tells us more about Israel’s unfaithfulness. He records Jehovah’s words to Israel: “‘If I am a father, where is the honor to me? And if I am a grand master, where is the fear of me?’ Jehovah of armies has said to you, O priests who are despising my name.” What was wrong? Jehovah explains: “When you present a blind animal for sacrificing [you say]: ‘It is nothing bad.’ And when you present a lame animal or a sick one [you say]: ‘It is nothing bad.’”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:1:6-39:1:8" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Malachi 1:6-8</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> In this graphic way, Malachi shows that while the Israelites were bringing in offerings, the poor quality of these betrayed gross disrespect. Malachi also wrote: “‘From the days of your forefathers you have turned aside from my regulations and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you,’ Jehovah of armies has said.” The Israelites wondered what specifically <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>they had to do, so they asked: “In what way shall we return?” Jehovah answered: “Will earthling man rob God?

Jehovah answered: “In the tenth parts and in the contributions.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:7-39:3:8" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Malachi 3:7, 8</a>) Yes, by failing to bring in their tithes and offerings, Israel was robbing Jehovah!</p>

They were a demonstration of appreciation on the part of the giver. And they helped support true worship in a material way.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="1"></span>IN THE fifth century B.C.E., the Israelites had been unfaithful to Jehovah. They had withheld tithes and brought unfit animals to the temple as offerings. Nevertheless, Jehovah promised that if they would bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, he would pour out a blessing until there was no more want. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:8-39:3:10" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Malachi 3:8-10</a>) Some 500 years later, Jehovah, represented by Jesus as His messenger of the covenant, came to the temple in Jerusalem for judgment. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:1-39:3:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Malachi 3:1</a>) Israel as a nation was found wanting, but those individuals who returned to Jehovah were richly blessed.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:2-41:1:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Mark 1:2, 3</a>) Was there a preparatory work in connection with the second coming of Jehovah to his temple? Yes. In the decades before the first world war, the Bible Students appeared on the world scene teaching pure Bible doctrine and exposing God-dishonoring lies, such as the Trinity and the hellfire doctrines. They also warned of the coming end of the Gentile Times in 1914. Many responded to these light bearers of truth.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:43:3-19:43:3" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Psalm 43:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:14-40:5:14" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> Matthew 5:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:16-40:5:16" data-bid="9-3" class="b"> 16</a>.</p>

The last of those temples was destroyed back in 70 C.E. Jehovah does have, however, a greater temple that was foreshadowed by that at Jerusalem. Paul spoke of this greater temple and showed how grand it truly is, with a holy place in heaven and a courtyard here on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:11-58:9:12" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:11, 12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:24-58:9:24" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:19-58:10:20" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 10:19, 20</a>) It is to this great spiritual temple that Jehovah came for a judgment work.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:1-66:11:1" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Revelation 11:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:15:8-66:15:8" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 15:8</a>.</p>

According to substantial evidence available, in 1918.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> What was the result? As for Christendom, Jehovah saw an organization whose hands dripped with blood, a corrupt religious system that had prostituted herself to this world, allying herself with the wealthy and oppressing the poor, teaching pagan doctrines rather than practicing pure worship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:1:27-59:1:27" data-bid="14-1" class="b">James 1:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:4-59:4:4" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 4:4</a>) Through Malachi, Jehovah had warned: “I will become a speedy witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against those swearing falsely, and against those acting fraudulently with the wages of a wage worker, with the widow and with the fatherless boy.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:5-39:3:5" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Malachi 3:5</a>) Christendom had done all of this and worse. By 1919 it was clearly seen that Jehovah had condemned her to destruction along with the rest of <span id="page14" class="pageNum" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>Babylon the Great, the worldwide edifice of false religion. From then on, the call went out to righthearted ones: “Get out of her, my people.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:1-66:18:1" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Revelation 18:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:18:4-66:18:4" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 4</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="7"><sup>7</sup></span> Who, then, was the faithful and discreet slave? In the first century, it began with the small group that responded to the witness work of John the Baptizer and of Jesus, the messenger of the covenant. In our century, it was the few thousands who responded to the preparatory work of the Bible Students during the years leading up to 1914. These ones endured harsh trials during the first world war, but they demonstrated that their heart was with Jehovah.</p>

<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 8, 9. Back in 1918, in what ways did the faithful and discreet slave need cleansing, and what promise had Jehovah made in this regard?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="8"><sup>8</sup></span> Even this group needed cleansing, however.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:3:18-50:3:18" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Philippians 3:18</a>) Others were unwilling to shoulder the responsibilities involved in serving Jehovah and drifted away. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:2:1-58:2:1" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Hebrews 2:1</a>) Apart from that, there were Babylonish practices remaining that needed to be eliminated. Organizationally too the faithful and discreet slave had to be cleansed. A proper position of neutrality toward this world had to be learned and applied. And as the world became more and more corrupt, they needed to put up a hard fight to keep moral and spiritual uncleanness out of the congregations.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:3-65:1:4" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Jude 3, 4</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="9"><sup>9</sup></span> Yes, cleansing was needed, but Jehovah had lovingly promised concerning the enthroned Jesus: “He must sit as a refiner and cleanser of silver and must cleanse the sons of Levi; and he must clarify them like gold and like silver, and they will certainly become to Jehovah people presenting a gift offering in righteousness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:3:3-39:3:3" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Malachi 3:3</a>) Starting in 1918, Jehovah, through this messenger of the covenant, has fulfilled his promise and cleansed his people.</p>

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="11"><sup>11</sup></span> In Malachi’s day God’s people brought in literal offerings and tithes, such as grain, fruit, and livestock. Even in Jesus’ day, faithful Israelites made literal offerings at the temple. However, after Jesus’ death all that changed. The Law was abolished, including the command to present specific material offerings and tithes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:15-49:2:15" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Ephesians 2:15</a>) Jesus fulfilled the prophetic type of the offerings under the Law.

(Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:17-50:2:17" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Philippians 2:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:6-55:4:6" data-bid="26-2" class="b"> 2 Timothy 4:6</a>.) For example, Paul spoke of the preaching work as an offering when he said: “Through him let us always offer to God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips which make public declaration to his name.” He pointed to another spiritual kind of sacrifice when he urged: “Do not forget the doing of good and the sharing of things with others, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:15-58:13:16" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:15, 16</a>) When parents encourage their children to enter the pioneer service, they may be said to be offering them to Jehovah, much as Jephthah offered his daughter as “a burnt offering” to God, who had given him the victory.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:11:30-7:11:31" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Judges 11:30, 31,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/7:11:39-7:11:39" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 39</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="13"><sup>13</sup></span> What about tithes, though? Are Christians obligated to put aside a tenth of their material income and give it to Jehovah’s organization, comparable to what is done in some churches of Christendom? No, that is not required. There is no scripture stating such a rule for Christians. When Paul was collecting contributions for needy ones in Judea, he did not mention a specific percentage that should be given. Rather, he said: “Let each one do just as he has resolved in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:9:7-47:9:7" data-bid="29-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>) In speaking of those in special ministries, Paul showed that while some were quite properly supported by voluntary contributions, he was prepared to work and support himself. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:3-44:18:4" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Acts 18:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:13-46:9:15" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 9:13-15</a>) There were no tithes assigned for this purpose.</p>
<p id="p49" data-pid="49" class="qu">14. (a) Why does bringing in a tithe not represent our giving of our all to Jehovah? (b) What is represented by the tithe?</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="14"><sup>14</sup></span> Clearly, for Christians the tithe <em>symbolizes,</em> or <em>represents,</em> something. Since it is a tenth and the number ten often symbolizes earthly completeness in the Bible, does the tithe symbolize our giving of our all to Jehovah? No. When we dedicate ourselves to Jehovah and symbolize this by water baptism, that is when we give our all to him. From the time of our dedication, we have nothing that is not already Jehovah’s. However, Jehovah allows individuals to dispose of what is theirs. So the tithe represents the portion of what is ours that we bring to Jehovah, or use in Jehovah’s service, as a token of our love for him and of our recognition of the fact that we belong to him. The modern-day tithe does not have to be just a tenth. In some cases it will be less. In others it will be more. Each individual brings what his heart impels him to bring and what his circumstances permit.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">15, 16. What is included in our spiritual tithe?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span><span class="parNum" data-pnum="15"><sup>15</sup></span> What is included in this spiritual tithe? For one thing, we give Jehovah of our time and energy. The time we spend at meetings, in attending assemblies and conventions, in the field service, all of this is something given to Jehovah​—a part of our tithe. The time and energy we spend visiting the sick and helping others​—again, these are part of our tithe. Assisting in constructing Kingdom Halls and sharing in the work of maintaining and cleaning the hall are likewise a part.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="16"><sup>16</sup></span> Our tithe also includes our financial contributions. With the extraordinary increase of Jehovah’s organization in recent years, financial obligations have increased. New Kingdom Halls are needed, along with new branch facilities and new Assembly Halls, together with the upkeep of those already built. Covering the expenses of those who have made themselves available for special service​—often making great personal sacrifices to do so—​also constitutes a formidable challenge. In 1991 the cost of maintaining missionaries, traveling overseers, and special pioneers alone amounted to more than 40 million dollars, all of which was provided by voluntary contributions.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">17. Just what should we give as our spiritual tithe?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><span class="parNum" data-pnum="17"><sup>17</sup></span> Just what should we give as our spiritual tithe? Jehovah does not set a percentage. Nevertheless, a sense of dedication, a genuine love of Jehovah and the brothers, as well as a sense of urgency from realizing that there are lives to be saved, encourage us to bring in our whole spiritual tithe. We feel impelled to serve Jehovah to the greatest extent possible. If we were to stint or give grudgingly of ourselves or our resources, this would be tantamount to our robbing God.​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:1-42:21:4" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Luke 21:1-4</a>.</p>

This has been seen most dramatically in their numerical growth.

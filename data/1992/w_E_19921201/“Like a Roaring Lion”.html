<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">DO YOU believe that Satan exists? Today, many do not. It seems they view such a belief as “unscientific.” Even back in 1911, the <em>Encyclopædia Britannica</em> said: “Science has so explained many of the processes of outer nature and of the inner life of man as to leave no room for Satanic agency.” Theologians reason that Satan is just a symbol, a myth. <em>The World Book Encyclopedia</em> states: “Many modern theologians consider the Devil to be a symbol of the power of evil, of the worst qualities of human nature.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What, though, are the facts? If you believe in the Bible, you <em>have</em> to believe that Satan is real. Jesus not only believed he existed but called him “the ruler of the world.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:30-43:14:30" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 14:30</a>) The apostle Paul called Satan “the god of this system of things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:4-47:4:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>) And the aged apostle John said: “The whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:19-62:5:19" data-bid="3-1" class="b">1 John 5:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">If you disagree with John, think of recent history. Consider the death squads and the use of torture by governments. Remember the wars and genocides our generation has seen. And what about the vicious crimes headlined in our newspapers​—the mass murders, the rapes, the serial killings, the sexual abuse of children, to name just a few? Could anyone but Satan be the god of this world?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Christian apostle Peter warned: “Be watchful. Your adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:5:8-60:5:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Peter 5:8</a>) If a lion was loose in your neighborhood, would you be discussing whether it existed or not? Or would you run for cover?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Be assured that Satan exists. He is merciless and vicious, and he is stronger than we are. So run for protection to One who is even stronger. “The name of Jehovah is a strong tower. Into it the righteous runs and is given protection.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:18:10-20:18:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:10</a>) Take shelter with Jehovah God, and know that soon mankind will be freed from the influence of that evil one, Satan. What a joyful relief that will be!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:20:1-66:20:3" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Revelation 20:1-3</a>.</p>

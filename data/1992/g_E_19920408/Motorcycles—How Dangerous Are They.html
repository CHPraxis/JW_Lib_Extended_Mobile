<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">By <em>Awake! </em>correspondent in Japan</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">SUSUMU’S trail bike was running smoothly when suddenly he saw a car crossing his lane. The next thing he saw was the roof of a house as he was catapulted into the air. He landed on his head and shoulder. A crack in the middle of his helmet revealed the severity of the crash. He survived the accident, but his leg was broken and bent into a U shape.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Susumu’s accident is not unique. <em>The Globe and Mail </em>of Canada reports that during one year 166,000 Americans were hospitalized after motorcycle accidents. “Of those, 4,700 died. Many others were crippled for life.” In Canada, says the same source, motorcycle accidents doubled in a ten-​year period. And in Japan 2,575 motorcyclists lost their lives in 1989. Of these, excluding moped riders, more than 70 percent were youths between the ages of 16 and 24.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">How do these figures compare with automobile-​accident statistics? Insurance companies claim that in some countries, for the same distance traveled, the death rate for motorcyclists is about nine times higher than that for persons riding in a car. What causes this greater death toll? <em>Consumer Reports </em>gives three reasons: (1) A motorcycle is harder to see than a car. (2) A motorcycle offers little or no protection for its rider. (3) A motorcycle’s handling is tricky​—if it skids, it often spills. No wonder that many people feel that motorcycles are dangerous. Others disagree. Riding a motorcycle has advantages, they say. What do you think?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">True, as a means of economical transportation, the motorcycle is hard to surpass. Fuel economy is its hallmark. With a medium-​sized motorcycle, says <em>Consumer Reports, </em>you can ride 60 to 70 miles <strong>[25 to 30 km] </strong>on one gallon <strong>[1 L] </strong>of fuel. Additionally, it has only two tires. Other advantages are: easy to maneuver, no parking problems, and a price tag far lower than that of an automobile. But even some who could afford to drive an expensive automobile still prefer the motorcycle. Why?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span><strong>The Main Appeal</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Most motorcycle lovers admit that the main appeal of motorcycles is the thrill that comes with riding one. “It may be their sound,” says one motorcycle enthusiast. The rumble of an English twin, the howl of a Japanese multi-​two-​stroke, or the purr of a multicylinder four-​stroke​—all are like music to the ears of motorcycle lovers.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">For other motorcyclists, it is the sense of freedom and feeling of control. Says one: ‘It’s exciting to feel that machine beneath you, to know that it will answer to your every whim or direction, to lean into curves and know that it will carry you to your destination reliably.’ This mixture of sound, speed, and freedom may appeal to you too. But there is a danger. This thrill may become an addiction.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Especially are young people in danger. “You feel scared when you see a sharp bend,” says a former member of a motorcycle gang, “but the thrill of clearing the bend at high speed without skidding leaves you excited. I used to search for ever sharper bends and take them at higher speeds.” Yoshio, who used to be crazy about motorcycling, says: “I used to ride, rain or shine, because it made me high. To me it was like a drug.” And Susumu, mentioned earlier, says: “I didn’t care whether it would kill me or not​—I had to ride.” So even before the cast was removed from his broken leg, he was riding again. He admits: “I was hooked.”</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>‘Should I Ride a Motorcycle?’</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">So weigh these aspects of appeal and safety against each other when you consider riding a motorcycle. And if you are a Christian who values a clean conscience and respects the Bible, there are also some scriptures you will want to consider.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:6:16-20:6:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 6:16, 17</a>, for example, lists seven things that are detestable to Jehovah. One of them is “hands that are shedding innocent blood.” A law given to the ancient nation of Israel tells us more about Jehovah’s viewpoint on shedding innocent blood. The law states: “If a bull was formerly in the habit of goring and warning was served on its owner but he would not keep it under guard, and it did put a man or a woman to death, the bull is to be stoned and also <em>its owner </em>is to be put to death.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:21:29-2:21:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Exodus 21:29</a>) In other words, we are accountable for our possessions.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">So if you have in mind getting a motorcycle, how will you handle it and what type will you choose? One of the powerful, potentially dangerous bikes that are designed for high-​speed performance and that are often involved in fatal accidents? If so, will you be free of bloodguilt if you are involved in an accident? Even if you do not harm others, what about your own life? Will you show respect for the gift of life if you speed around dangerous corners just for the thrill of it?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">This principle also applies to the maintenance of your motorcycle if you have one or obtain one. Your motorcycle can turn into a ‘goring bull,’ so to speak, if you do not keep the brakes in order. Additionally, each time before riding the motorcycle, you should make chain and engine checks. And how about being a nuisance to neighbors by reckless driving and loud noise?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">True, if you are a motorcycle enthusiast, you may love the sound of the bike’s engine, but not everyone shares those sentiments. In fact, to some people the sound is so upsetting that they have been known to react violently. One irate man in Japan, reports the newspaper <em>Nara Shimbun, </em>threw a piece of lumber at a passing motorcycle. The rider, a 16-​year-​old motorcycle-​gang member, died. Another person, stated the newspaper <em>Asahi Shimbun, </em>stretched a rope across a route frequented by bike gangs. The rope caught the neck of a young cyclist, who was strangled to death. <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>And when the newspaper invited its readers to say how they felt about motorcycle-​noise pollution, some readers sympathized with the ones who took those actions against the motorcyclists.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Of course, the Bible condemns such violent actions. But on the other hand, motorcyclists should not provoke others by cruising through residential areas on motorcycles that do not have mufflers, as motorcycle gangs sometimes do. After all, we should want to live up to the law that Jesus Christ gave his followers: “You must love your neighbor as yourself.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:39-40:22:39" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 22:39</a>.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>A Sound Mind</strong></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Does this mean that you should not ride a motorcycle? No, but a sound mind is needed. For many people a motorcycle is an affordable, convenient, and pleasant way to get around. In some countries, however, people use motorcycles mostly for recreation. That can be enjoyable, but be cautious. Do not let passion for speed and power overcome your better judgment.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">Some who lived solely for their motorcycle have made changes. Now they center their lives around pleasing God. Yoshio, for example, used to ride powerful motorcycles. Today he says: “When I rode for thrills, I was pleasing only myself. Now, I have the joy of giving by working as a Christian minister.” Knowing that he cannot control himself once he gets on a motorcycle, Yoshio did not renew his license.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">A former member of a motorcycle gang in Hokkaido, Japan, recalls: “I used to ride the motorcycle to show off. I was deep into drugs as the result of bad association with motorcycle-​gang members.” But he started to think about the future. He looked into various religious groups and finally found the truth by studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">And what about Susumu? For him, riding a motorcycle is no longer the center of his life. Susumu, as well as the two motorcycle enthusiasts mentioned above, now serve as full-​time Christian ministers. One of them exchanged his heavy motorcycle for a moped and uses it in spreading Bible truth to others.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Yes, the motorcycle can be an efficient means of transportation, but it must at all times be used carefully and with respect for the feelings of others.</p>

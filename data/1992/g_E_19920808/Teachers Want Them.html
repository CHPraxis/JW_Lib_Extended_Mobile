<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A 17-​year-​old student in the Netherlands writes: “My school friend asked many questions about the differences in religions. I used the opportunity to give her the book <em>Mankind’s Search for God. </em>When our class was assigned to write an essay on a subject of our choice, my friend chose the subject of religion so that she could use her newly acquired book.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Since we had to present our sources of information, the book came into the hands of our teacher. Later he asked where ‘that very interesting book’ came from. My friend explained that the book came from me.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Right away my teacher asked me to provide him with four copies for himself and his friends. The next day I handed the books to him, and right away he showed them to other teachers. A short time later, he told me: ‘I have the approval of the school administration to obtain 35 of these books.’”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Many today are recognizing the value of examining religion. Most people know only the religion of their parents and that often only superficially. But should your religion be simply the one you were born into? By comparing your religion with that of others, you will be better equipped to make an intelligent choice.</p>

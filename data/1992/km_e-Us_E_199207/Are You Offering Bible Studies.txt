Are You Offering Bible Studies?
1 Many are having fine success in starting Bible studies by using the direct approach in offering people the opportunity to study the Bible. A man who had refused literature on several occasions responded readily when a Bible study was offered. He replied: “I have always wanted to study the Bible.” A Bible study was started, and the entire family made rapid progress.
2 All should be conscious of starting studies. If individuals are going to make progress in becoming disciples of Christ, they must be taught. (Matt. 28:19, 20) To be taught, they need to have a Bible study conducted with them. Studies can often be started just by making the offer to demonstrate how the householder can learn more about the Bible and God’s promises. A brother was able to start five studies in the tract Life in a Peaceful New World. Since he was not able to conduct that many Bible studies regularly, he started turning the Bible studies over to other publishers.
3 If we find it easy to start studies, we can take other publishers along with us and help them to get studies too. Or we can turn over some studies we start to others in the congregation. If you would like to conduct a Bible study, why not try making the offer of a Bible study to those you meet in the house-​to-​house ministry? In one case a publisher made a return visit on a teenage girl who did not show much interest. Nevertheless, the publisher offered her a Bible study, and she accepted. She is now baptized, and her sister and her sister’s husband are also attending meetings.​—Gal. 6:6.
4 Not everyone we start a study with will continue to study. Not all of those who study will come into the truth. But some will. The more studies we start, the more likelihood there is that we will be able to help others become praisers of Jehovah.

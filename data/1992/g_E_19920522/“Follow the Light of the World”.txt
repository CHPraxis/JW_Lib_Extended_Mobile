Come, Hear the Free Public Talk:
“Follow the Light of the World”
Humans need light to illuminate their way just as surely as a car needs its headlights on a winding mountain road on a dark night. Spiritual light may be compared to excellent headlights, which light a roadway so that people can see exactly where they are going. What is the source of that spiritual light? And who is reflecting it today?
These are questions that will be answered in the public talk featured at the hundreds of “Light Bearers” District Conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses to be held around the world this summer. You are cordially invited to attend.
The convention program will also feature helpful discussions on practical matters of life as well as a full-​costume Bible drama. Contact the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses in your area to find out where and when the convention nearest your home will be held, or write the publishers of this magazine.

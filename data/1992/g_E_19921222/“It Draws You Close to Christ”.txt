“It Draws You Close to Christ”
THAT is what many have said about a book recently published by Jehovah’s Witnesses, The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. A woman from France observed: “Although I have always greatly appreciated the Watch Tower Society’s publications, never has a book had such an effect on me.” In a letter to the Society’s branch office in France, she explained:
“This comprehensive biography of Christ made me come to love his appealing personality even more. I also discovered important aspects of his life, even though I have already read the Gospel accounts several times. Throughout the pages of the book, we live the intense moments Christ lived, finding him compassionate and gentle, but also manly and firm.
“The final chapters are particularly touching. I got to the point where I could not hold back my tears while considering that the most important creation in the entire universe willingly suffered at the hands of the Devil’s vile agents. What a powerful example! I must say that I now feel much closer to our ‘Eternal Father,’ yes, our reigning King.”​—Isaiah 9:6.
Jehovah’s Witnesses are an international organization of over four million Bible students, all of whom are convinced that Jesus Christ is not only the greatest man who ever lived but also the only means by which humans can receive everlasting life.​—Acts 4:12.

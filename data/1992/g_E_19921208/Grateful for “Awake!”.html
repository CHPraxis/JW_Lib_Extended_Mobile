<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">MORE and more readers of this magazine are grateful for the enlightenment that they receive on so many subjects. In southern France a man and his wife who are Jehovah’s Witnesses received the following letter from a gentleman with whom they had left a copy of <em>Awake!</em></p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I am well aware that God has other things to do than gratify our funny little ways of seeing his intervention in every circumstance possible. Although I do not subscribe to this kind of thinking myself, I am convinced that your arrival just as I was leaving the house was more than a mere coincidence. I just had time to accept the August 8, 1990, issue of <em>Awake! </em>What a great pity it would have been to miss it!</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“The wise analysis in the series ‘Human Rule Weighed in the Balances’ captured my interest and quite amazed me. I strongly subscribe to the way the series is presented . . . Therefore, may I ask you to see that I receive the coming issues of <em>Awake! </em>I would not want to miss any in this series.”</p>

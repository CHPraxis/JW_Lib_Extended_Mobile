Grateful for “Awake!”
MORE and more readers of this magazine are grateful for the enlightenment that they receive on so many subjects. In southern France a man and his wife who are Jehovah’s Witnesses received the following letter from a gentleman with whom they had left a copy of Awake!
“Dear Sir and Madam:
“I am well aware that God has other things to do than gratify our funny little ways of seeing his intervention in every circumstance possible. Although I do not subscribe to this kind of thinking myself, I am convinced that your arrival just as I was leaving the house was more than a mere coincidence. I just had time to accept the August 8, 1990, issue of Awake! What a great pity it would have been to miss it!
“The wise analysis in the series ‘Human Rule Weighed in the Balances’ captured my interest and quite amazed me. I strongly subscribe to the way the series is presented . . . Therefore, may I ask you to see that I receive the coming issues of Awake! I would not want to miss any in this series.”
Jehovah’s Witnesses are an international organization of over four million Bible students who are devoted to helping people learn more about the world around them and about God’s Word and the course of its fulfillment.

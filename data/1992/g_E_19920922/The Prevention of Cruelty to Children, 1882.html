<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“THE SOCIETY FOR THE PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO CHILDREN, 1882. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children was founded in New York in 1875 by Henry Bergh. Seven years after its founding, the Society, the first organization to provide any protection for abused children in the city, was handling thousands of complaints annually, removing children from unfit homes and prosecuting offenders through the courts. This melodramatic engraving represents the timely intervention of officers in a tenement.”​—<em>New York in the Nineteenth Century, </em>by John Grafton.</p>

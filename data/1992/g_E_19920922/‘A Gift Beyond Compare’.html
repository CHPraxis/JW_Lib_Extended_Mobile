<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THAT, in effect, is what a woman from São Paulo, Brazil, said about the gift of the publication <em>My Book of Bible Stories. </em>Her aunt had sent the book for the niece’s five-​year-​old daughter. The niece wrote in appreciation:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Every night I read a bit to her, and she likes it very much. She really is interested in it, asking questions, commenting on it, and even making comparisons with her daily life, using the teachings of the book as examples. Without my reminding her, she goes to get the book, curious about the next story.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“However, I want to say that the present was not just for Natalia; sharing God’s teachings with my daughter has been very good for me. It has very much increased my joy and gratitude for being a mother.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“There are many kinds of presents we can give or receive, some being measured by their monetary value, others by their size. But this book that we received cannot be compared to any of such gifts. Its value can be measured only by the love with which it was given and by the joy it brings to the hearts of those who receive it.”</p>

▪ Literature offer for January and February: Any 192-​page book published in 1983 or earlier. If the congregation has no stock of these books, Worldwide Security Under the “Prince of Peace” should be offered. It may be requested from Brooklyn. March: Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand!

▪ Beginning in February, and no later than March 1, the new public talk for circuit overseers will be “Jesus Christ​—Earth’s New Ruler.”
▪ The Society is now accepting requests for reprinted Watchtower bound volumes in ENGLISH for the years 1980 through 1985. Any interested in obtaining the reprinted English Watchtower bound volumes should request them through the congregation on the next Literature Request Form. Since the volumes are being reprinted one time only, we urge all to consider their needs carefully. Please bear in mind that these bound volumes are special-​request items.

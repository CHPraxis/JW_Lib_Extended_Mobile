<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>To be effective in our ministry requires preparation so that when we call back on those who initially showed interest, we will be able to rekindle their interest and continue our conversation. How might we do this?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Since true Christians are sincerely interested in others, you might first refer to something you learned about the householder on the previous visit.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong><em>To a person who revealed his concern about crime, you could say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ “The last time we spoke you said you were troubled by the noticeable increase of lawlessness. Do you think that hiring more policemen would solve the problem?”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong><em>If a person expressed anxiety over recent developments in the world situation, you could say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ “The last time we spoke together you made an interesting point about the lack of peace in the world. Do you think that world leaders will bring in a new world order?”</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn"><strong><em>To a person who is disturbed by the selfishness of others, you could say:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">▪ “The last time we spoke you made an excellent point concerning the greediness we see in people in general. What do you think God’s view is of greedy people? [Allow response.] This is what the Bible says at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:5-49:5:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:5</a>.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong><em>Other expressions that have been used effectively include:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn">▪ “I enjoyed our last conversation very much, so I researched this brief thought to show you how Jehovah recognizes the plight of the homeless. Note <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:21-23:65:23" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:21-23</a>.”</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn">▪ “I enjoyed your comment that mankind needs better government.”</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn">▪ “You asked an interesting question on whether all religion meets with God’s approval.”</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn">▪ “You really got me thinking on what you said about predestination.”</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn">▪ “I’ve been thinking about our conversation, and there’s a point in the book <em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived </em>that I think you will enjoy. [May show householder selected points in book.]”</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sn">Introductions like these show that we appreciated our previous conversation and that we are interested in speaking with the householder again.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Before you make the return visit, give thought to what you will say. Tailor your presentation to each person.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup><strong><em>If the person we are visiting is busy, we can still be effective by saying:</em></strong></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sn">▪ “I know you have only a few minutes, but here is something you can think about while you are finishing your work. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 5:3</a>.]”</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn"><strong>Or you could say:</strong></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sn">▪ “I wrote these three scriptures down for you. Since it is not a good time to talk, let me leave them, and when I come back, I would like to take five minutes to discuss them with you.”</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup><strong>Negative Approaches to Avoid: </strong>Questions that might bring a negative response or that might put the householder in an awkward position usually do not produce good results. These include: “Did you read the material I left you?” “Do you have any questions?” “Do you remember me?” “I called to ask if you are still interested in talking about God’s purposes for this earth.”</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>We will be eager to call on individuals who previously manifested interest if we prepare ahead of time to give them assistance that is truly meaningful.</p>

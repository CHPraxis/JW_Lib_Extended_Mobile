A Practical Approach to Preparation for Field Service
1 Do you sometimes hesitate to share in some feature of the field service because of not knowing what to say? If you do, we are sure you will appreciate the approach being taken in Our Kingdom Ministry.
2 Beginning with this issue, Our Kingdom Ministry will offer an even greater variety of suggestions for presenting the Kingdom message, whether from house to house, on a return visit, or on a Bible study. These should stimulate your thinking on what expressions you would like to use in the ministry. When preparing for the ministry, select a presentation that is well suited to your territory. Next, determine whether you will use the wording that is suggested in the article or you will adjust the wording to fit local circumstances or your own personality. Your presentation may sound more conversational if you expressed it naturally in your own words. Would you like to expand your ministry in some way, perhaps by engaging in some feature for the first time? The detailed suggestions offered may be just what you need to get started.
3 If you conduct one of the congregationâ€™s meetings for field service, you should be well acquainted with the material published in Our Kingdom Ministry. Have your copy well studied, and draw attention to those suggestions that are most likely to be effective locally.
4 All of us enjoy the things we do well. It is our hope that this practical approach will help both the newer and the more experienced publishers to be effective and joyful in their Kingdom ministry.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong>Children of Divorce  </strong>I have been separated from my wife for three years, and I miss my child very much. But it is the children who suffer, and we parents ought to think more about this. Had I read the series “Help for Children of Divorce” (April 22, 1991) while we were still together, I am certain I would have thought twice about separating.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><strong>Barrier Reef  </strong>At school I was assigned to do research on corals. I did not know where to seek detailed and concise information, however. It was a great surprise to me to see the article “A Visit to the Great Barrier Reef.” (June 8, 1991) It had precisely what I needed! I used that information and received the highest grade. Many thanks for your valuable help.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><strong>Raising Families  </strong>The article “Raising Families Worldwide​—Parenting With Love, Discipline, Example, and Spiritual Values” (September 22, 1991) was a great encouragement to me as a new student of the Bible. When we began attending Christian meetings, my son would act up and cry like a maniac. But with the help from the Christian woman who studies with us, and the encouragement from the magazines you publish, I am now reaping fruitage. My two-​and-a-half-​year-​old son now sits quietly during the meetings and even makes short comments.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><strong>Gossip  </strong>I was a serious gossiper. But one day I came home from school and read the series “Gossip​—How to Avoid Getting Hurt.” (June 8, 1991) With your help I was able to break that bad habit. I really didn’t know that gossip was so serious and that it could ruin someone’s reputation. I am so grateful for this information.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">The articles literally saved my job. I repeated a rumor going around that they were closing down the factory where I work. Before the day was over, I was called to my supervisor’s office. He told me that I was gossiping and that spreading things like that would only scare people because jobs were scarce. People had been getting laid off where I work, and I figured this was their excuse to get rid of me. When I received the <em>Awake! </em>on gossip, I took it as counsel from above. I showed it to my supervisor and told him what I had learned and that I would do whatever I could to stay free from gossip. He thanked me​—and I still have my job.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><strong>Estrogen Replacement  </strong>I am grateful for the article “Estrogen Replacement Therapy​—Is It for You?” (September 22, 1991) I was amazed at its clarity. I am being treated now for osteoporosis and have been receiving estrogen replacement therapy for four years. But now I am better able to converse with my doctor about things and can face my problems with more optimism. Thank you very much.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><strong>Learning Musical Instruments  </strong>I really want to thank you for the article “If Only I Could Play Like That!” in the September 8, 1991, issue. I am now in my first year of junior high school and am learning to play the electric organ. Already two years have passed, and although it’s about time I showed some progress, I have not. At this year’s recital, my playing was full of mistakes. It was terrible. This article was gentle and timely advice for me.</p>

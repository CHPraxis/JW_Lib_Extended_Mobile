<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Two German hikers were amazed to find a deep-​frozen corpse in a glacier near the Austro-​Italian border last September. The grisly discovery has been called the best-​preserved “prehistoric” man found in Europe. Named “Simulaun Man,” after the glacier where he was found, the corpse “is beginning to reveal some of his secrets following some intensive scientific coaxing,” reports the <em>Süddeutsche Zeitung. </em>The “iceman” had with him clothing, hunting weapons, and a wooden-​framed rucksack, which items scientists used to date the discovery to be about 4,000 years old. Interestingly, the quality of his clothing and equipment was more sophisticated than many experts would ever have imagined.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The number of cases of cholera in Africa during the first seven months of 1991 was almost double the total of 1990, stated Nigeria’s <em>Daily Times. </em>Referring to a World Health Organization report on the epidemic, the <em>Times </em>said that the outbreak now affects 20 African countries, including some with no previous record of the disease. Since January 1991, the number of reported cases on the continent reached 48,860, with a death toll of 3,736. Recently, cholera has also been raging in South America.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In 1975 the Presbyterian Church in Australia decided to allow women to be ordained as ministers in that church. But on September 11, 1991, the Presbyterian governing body, the National General Assembly, overturned this decision and voted by a two-​to-​one majority to ban women from the ministry. Concession was made, however, to allow the five women who had been ordained during the intervening period to continue serving as ministers. And two other women who had been accepted as candidates were also allowed to proceed with their ordination on the condition that they not change parishes. The decision was not popular with many church members, and there is talk of a challenge in the courts by opposing groups. Stronger critics even predict that the decision will split the church and that many​—particularly women—​may choose to leave the Presbyterian Church altogether.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">The governor of the state of Amazonas asked the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Resources for permission to hunt alligators. Why? According to <em>Veja </em>magazine, ‘the superpopulation of the alligator is disturbing the life of human beings. In Nhamundá, for example, there are 200 alligators for every human inhabitant, and in the dispute for food, man does not always come off as winner.’ <em>Veja </em>explains that alligators not only devour the fish before the fisherman appears but also attack chickens and pigs. Says the governor: “Man has the right to kill the alligator when it takes away his food.”</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>Contaminated Blood</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Judge José Eduardo Carreira Alvim sentenced the Brazilian federal government and the State of Rio de Janeiro to pay damages to the family of musician Francisco Mário de Souza for his having contracted the AIDS virus through a blood transfusion, reports the magazine <em>Veja. </em>The musician, a hemophiliac, died in 1988. According to <em>Veja, </em>Governor Leonel Brizola said that his state will comply. “If I were the judge,” he is reported as saying, “I would make the same decision.” However, the federal government plans to appeal. The final decision may have far-​reaching effects, since, as the magazine declared, only “70% of the blood offered in the 3,600 blood banks in the country is analyzed.”</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">A mother, her two sons, and a young friend climbed a hill in a game park of Botswana with the intention of viewing a black eagle’s nest. Halfway up, according to the wildlife magazine <em>Custos, </em>they heard a menacing growl from behind a bush. Instinctively, they turned to run, but then the mother recalled advice she had once read not to react that way. “I spun around,” explains Jill Olivier, “to face a huge lioness, who, fortunately for me, skidded to a halt about five metres [15 feet] away.” Then brave Jill gave loud instructions to the three boys behind her, telling them not to move. “I was quite terrified,” she adds, “but I knew I dare not take my eyes off hers, as she might charge me.” After about two minutes, the lioness started to retreat. With her eyes still fixed on the animal, Jill also <span id="page29" class="pageNum" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>backed away. Suddenly, the lioness turned and ran off. Jill concludes with this sound advice: “Do not take the bush for granted and always walk with someone who is experienced.”</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">In 1990, for the second straight year, New York City topped the 25 largest cities in the United States in robberies. According to the annual report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a record 100,280 robberies were reported to the New York City police last year. That means that 1 out of every 73 people in the city was mugged or robbed during the year. Following New York were Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, New Orleans, Washington, Dallas, Boston, and Los Angeles​—each exceeding the 25-​city average of 9.7 robberies for every 1,000 residents. Despite its record of 2,262 homicides last year, New York City dropped to tenth place in murders per capita, with 30.9 for every 100,000 residents. Heading the list was the nation’s capital, Washington, D.C. It had 77.8 killings for every 100,000 residents. According to the report, firearms were used in 3 out of every 5 murders.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="ss"><strong>A Community of Prostitutes</strong></p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Vila Mimosa is reputedly the oldest and best-​known center of prostitution in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. According to the Argentinean newspaper <em>Clarín, </em>more than 400 prostitutes can be found in this two-​block community. In order to educate and entertain these women, a new radio station is now broadcasting news, interviews, advertising, and music just for prostitutes. “Most of the disc jockeys are prostitutes,” reports <em>Clarín. </em>The spread of AIDS is a serious concern among many prostitutes. The newspaper adds that there are more than 17,000 victims of AIDS in Brazil, with an additional 350,000 to 450,000 people who are infected with the virus but who have not yet developed AIDS.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="ss"><strong>TV Blamed</strong></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Television is again being blamed for the decline in the reading ability of students. Verbal-​test scores of college-​bound students in the United States reached an all-​time low in 1991. William M. Honig, superintendent of public instruction in California, said: “The more television you watch, the lower your reading ability.” On the other hand, Michael Fitzmaurice of the National Association of Broadcasters came to the defense of television. He said: “The one thing we know is that the biggest predictor of scholastic success is the time parents spend reading to their children. Even if you threw away television, the scholastic abilities aren’t going to improve.”</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>Back Problems</strong></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">“Every third German suffers constantly from backache,” reports the German daily <em>Schweinfurter Tagblatt. </em>According to Gebhard Glück, Bavarian minister for social services, absence from work due to back-​related disorders amounts to 75 million working days per year. Not only is the adult or elderly population affected but 11 percent of persons under 18 years of age who were examined also had spinal disorders. The main causes were said to be the lifting of heavy objects incorrectly, bad posture, sitting in the wrong position, and strenuous body movements while engaging in sports and other leisure activities.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">The pollution of coastal waters has become an increasing concern in Asia and the Pacific, reports <em>Asiaweek </em>magazine. Charles Birkeland, a marine biologist at the University of Guam, told the magazine that since the mid-1970’s, more and more people have been hospitalized or killed by eating poisoned shellfish. The shellfish are apparently tainted when they consume organisms that, in turn, are fed by pollutants. The source of these pollutants? According to <em>Asiaweek, </em>a prime suspect is the nutrient-​laden runoff that leaches into the sea when tropical forests are cut down.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>Dilemma for Spiritists</strong></p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Zé Arigó, a spirit medium who died in 1971 and who claimed to speak for a spirit called ‘Doctor Fritz,’ currently has 13 would-​be successors in Brazil. According to <em>Veja </em>magazine, this profusion of ‘Doctor Fritz’ mediums is posing a problem for Brazil’s 6.9 million spiritists. Reportedly, the president of the Spiritist Federation of São Paulo stated: “Theoretically, it is possible that a spirit may be incarnate in more than one person. But we are beginning to think that there are too many ‘Doctor Fritzes.’” Yet, as <em>Veja </em>comments: “Spiritism is a decentralized movement, without any rigid hierarchy, and has no authority to point out who really receives Doctor Fritz and who is merely an imitation.” Spiritism, however, is not a dilemma for those who look to the Bible for instruction. It condemns all forms of spiritism.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:18:10-5:18:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>.</p>

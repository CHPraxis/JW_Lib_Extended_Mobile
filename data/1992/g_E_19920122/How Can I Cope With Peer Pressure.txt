How Can I Cope With Peer Pressure?
A letter from a policeman in Chicago, U.S.A., illustrates the importance of knowing the answer. He writes:
“On January 15, 1990, I was processing an 18-​year-​old prisoner who was brought back to Chicago from Mississippi on a fugitive warrant. Part of the processing is to take all the prisoner’s property. He had in his possession a book, Questions Young People Ask​—Answers That Work.
“‘Did you read this book?’ I asked.
“‘Yes,’ he replied. ‘While I was hiding in Mississippi, I worked on a farm, and two of Jehovah’s Witnesses gave me this book.’ Then he started to cry, sobbing almost uncontrollably. Between sobs, he said: ‘I’ve read this book many times, and the chapter I keep reading over and over is “How Can I Cope with Peer Pressure?”’ He added: ‘If I had only had this information three or four years ago, I would not be here today.’
“The prisoner was led away, and I read the police report and the confession he gave to the police. In it he said: ‘The leader of my gang told me to go down the street and shoot a rival gang member who was selling cocaine in our territory. I did what I was told. I feared the other members would think I’m not cool. I wanted to be accepted.’
“This 18-​year-​old prisoner was charged with murder, and if convicted, he will be put on death row for doing what his peers told him to do.”

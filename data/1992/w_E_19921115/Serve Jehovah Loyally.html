King David of ancient Israel knew that God also acts in loyalty with those loyal to him. David said so in a song he composed “in the day that Jehovah had delivered him out of the palm of all his enemies and out of [King] Saul’s palm.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:22:1-10:22:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Samuel 22:1</a>.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>What It Means to Be Loyal</strong></p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 3. From a Scriptural standpoint, what does it mean to be loyal?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>David’s song of deliverance gives us this comforting assurance: “With someone loyal you [Jehovah] will act in loyalty.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:22:26-10:22:26" data-bid="10-1" class="b">2 Samuel 22:26</a>) It is the Hebrew adjective <em>cha·sidhʹ </em>that denotes “someone loyal,” or “one of loving-kindness.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:18:25-19:18:25" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Psalm 18:25</a>, footnote) The noun <em>cheʹsedh </em>contains the thought of kindness that lovingly attaches itself to an object until its purpose in connection therewith is realized. Jehovah expresses that sort of kindness for his servants, even as they express it for him. This righteous, holy loyalty is rendered “loving-kindness” and “loyal love.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:20:13-1:20:13" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Genesis 20:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:21:23-1:21:23" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 21:23</a>) In the Greek Scriptures, “loyalty” carries the idea of holiness and reverence, expressed in the noun <em>ho·si·oʹtes </em>and the adjective <em>hoʹsi·os.</em> Such loyalty includes faithfulness and devotion and means being devout and carefully performing all duties toward God. To be loyal to Jehovah means to stick to him with devotion so strong that it acts like a powerful adhesive.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 4. How is Jehovah’s loyalty shown?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Jehovah’s own loyalty is shown in many ways. For example, he takes judicial action against the wicked because of loyal love for his people and loyalty to justice and righteousness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:15:3-66:15:4" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Revelation 15:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:5-66:16:5" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 16:5</a>) Loyalty to his covenant with Abraham moved him to be long-suffering toward the Israelites.

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Since Jehovah God is loyal, he requires loyalty of his servants. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:24-49:4:24" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Ephesians 4:24</a>) For example, men must be loyal to qualify for appointment as congregation elders.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup><em>Gratitude for the Scriptural things we have learned should move us to serve Jehovah loyally. </em>The apostle Paul urged Timothy: “Continue in the things that you learned and were persuaded to believe, knowing from what persons you learned them and that from infancy you have known the holy writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through the faith in connection with Christ Jesus.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:14-55:3:15" data-bid="19-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:14, 15</a>) Remember that such knowledge came from God through “the faithful and discreet slave.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:47" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matthew 24:45-47</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Especially should appointed elders appreciate the nourishing spiritual food provided by God through the faithful slave. Years ago a few elders lacked such appreciation.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup><em>Heartfelt appreciation for the spirit of fellowship existing within our Christian brotherhood furnishes another incentive to serve Jehovah loyally. </em>In fact, our relationship with God and Christ cannot be spiritually sound without this spirit. The apostle John told anointed Christians: “That which we have seen and heard we are reporting also to you, that you too may be having a sharing [“fellowship,” <em>Diaglott</em>] with us. Furthermore, this sharing of ours is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. . . . If we make the statement: ‘We are having a sharing with him,’ and yet we go on walking in the darkness, we are lying and are not practicing the truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:1:3-62:1:6" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 John 1:3-6</a>) This principle applies to all Christians, whether their hope is heavenly or earthly.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu">10. Though Euodia and Syntyche apparently had difficulty resolving a personal problem, how did Paul view these women?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Effort is required to maintain a spirit of fellowship. For instance, the Christian women Euodia and Syntyche apparently found it difficult to resolve a problem between them. Paul thus exhorted them “to be of the same mind in the Lord.” He added: “I request you too, genuine yokefellow, keep assisting these women who have striven side by side with me in the good news along with Clement as well as the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:2-50:4:3" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Philippians 4:2, 3</a>) Those godly women had fought side by side with Paul and others “in the good news,” and he was sure that they were among those ‘whose names were in the book of life.’</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">11. If a loyal Christian encounters a spiritual problem, what would it be fitting to keep in mind?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Christians do not wear an insignia to show what they have been privileged to do in Jehovah’s organization and how they have served him loyally. If they have a spiritual problem, how unloving it would be to ignore their years of loyal service to Jehovah! Likely, the one called “genuine yokefellow” was a loyal brother eager to assist others. If you are an elder, are you a “genuine yokefellow,” ready to give help in a compassionate way? May all of us consider the good done by fellow believers, even as God does, and lovingly help them to bear their burdens.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:2-48:6:2" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Galatians 6:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:10-58:6:10" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Hebrews 6:10</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>“Sayings of everlasting life” were not found in Judaism of the first century C.E. Its principal sin was the rejection of Jesus as the Messiah. In none of its forms was Judaism based exclusively on the Hebrew Scriptures. The Sadducees denied the existence of angels and did not believe in the resurrection. Though the Pharisees disagreed with them in these respects, they sinfully made God’s Word invalid because of their unscriptural traditions. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:1-40:15:11" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Matthew 15:1-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:23:6-44:23:9" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> Acts 23:6-9</a>) These traditions enslaved the Jews and made it difficult for many to accept Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:8-51:2:8" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Colossians 2:8</a>) Zeal for ‘the traditions of his fathers’ caused Saul (Paul) in his ignorance to be a vicious persecutor of Christ’s followers.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:1:13-48:1:14" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Galatians 1:13, 14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:1:23-48:1:23" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> 23</a>.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Judaism lacked God’s favor, but Jehovah blessed the organization made up of his Son’s followers​—‘a people zealous for fine works.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:14-56:2:14" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Titus 2:14</a>) That organization still exists, and of it a longtime Witness of Jehovah said: “If one thing has been most important to me, it has been the matter of keeping close to Jehovah’s visible organization. My early experience taught me how unsound it is to rely on human reasoning. Once my mind had been resolved on that point, I determined to stay by the faithful organization.

<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">15. Why cooperate with Jehovah’s visible organization and with those shouldering responsibility in it?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>Our hearts should impel us to cooperate with Jehovah’s organization because we know that it alone is directed by his spirit and is making known his name and purposes.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup><em>A desire to be upbuilding to others should also motivate us to serve Jehovah loyally. </em>Paul wrote: “Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:8:1-46:8:1" data-bid="35-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>) Since a certain kind of knowledge puffed up its possessors, Paul must have meant that love also upbuilds those showing that quality. A book by Professors Weiss and English says: “The person who has the capacity to love is usually loved in return. The capacity to <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>extend good will and consideration into every aspect of life . . . has a marked constructive effect upon the person who extends such feelings as well as upon the person who receives them and thus brings pleasure to both.” By showing love, we upbuild others and ourselves, as is implied by Jesus’ words: “There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:4-46:13:8" data-bid="38-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:4-8</a>) Such love will keep us from complaining about our brothers, who are imperfect even as we are. It will prevent us from becoming like the “ungodly men” who “slipped in” among true Christians of the first century. These men were “disregarding lordship and speaking abusively of glorious ones,” evidently maligning such individuals as anointed Christian overseers who had certain glory conferred upon them.

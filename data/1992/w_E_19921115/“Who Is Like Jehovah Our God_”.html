<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 3. What are the Hallel Psalms, and why are they so named?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Faith in Jehovah is warranted because he is the unique God. This is emphasized in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:113:1-19:113:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalms 113,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:114:1-19:114:8" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 114</a>, and <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:115:1-19:115:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps 115</a>, part of the six Hallel Psalms. According to the rabbinic School of Hillel, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:113:1-19:113:9" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalms 113 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:114:1-19:114:8" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 114</a> were sung during the Jewish Passover meal after the second cup of wine was poured and the significance of the observance was explained. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:115:1-19:118:29" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalms 115 through 118</a> were sung after the fourth cup of wine. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:30-40:26:30" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matthew 26:30</a>.) They are termed “Hallel Psalms” because they repeatedly use the exclamation Hallelujah!​—“Praise Jah!”</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu"> 4. What is the meaning of the term “Hallelujah,” and how often does it appear in the Bible?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>“Hallelujah!” is a transliteration of a Hebrew expression appearing 24 times in the Psalms. Elsewhere in the Bible, a Greek form of it appears four times in regard to joy experienced over the destruction of Babylon the Great, the world empire of false religion, and the rejoicing associated with Jehovah God’s beginning to rule as King. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:1-66:19:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Revelation 19:1-6</a>) As we now examine three of the Hallel Psalms, we might well imagine ourselves singing these songs to Jehovah’s praise.</p>

His Witnesses now declare that Jehovah is God, <span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span>Christ is King, and the Kingdom has been established in heaven.

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>The song of praise will go forth until Jehovah causes it to fill the earth. “From the rising of the sun until its setting Jehovah’s name is to be praised.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:113:3-19:113:3" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 113:3</a>) This means more than daily worship by some earthly creatures. The sun rises in the east and sets in the west, covering all the earth. Everywhere the sun shines, Jehovah’s name will soon be praised by all people freed from bondage to false religion and Satan’s organization. In fact, this song that will never end is now sung by anointed Witnesses of Jehovah and those who will be earthly children of his King, Jesus Christ.

<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 8. Why and how does Jehovah condescend to take notice of matters in heaven and on earth?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Moved by God’s loftiness, the psalmist said: “Who is like Jehovah our God, him who is making his dwelling on high? He is condescending to look on heaven and earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:113:5-19:113:6" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Psalm 113:5, 6</a>) God is so exalted that he must condescend to take notice of matters in heaven and on earth. Though Jehovah is not inferior to anyone or in subjection to others, he shows humility in exercising mercy and compassion toward lowly sinners. Providing his Son, Jesus Christ, as “a propitiatory sacrifice” for anointed Christians and for the world of mankind is an expression of Jehovah’s humility.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:1-62:2:2" data-bid="18-1" class="b">1 John 2:1, 2</a>.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>Jehovah Is Compassionate</strong></p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> 9, 10. How does God ‘exalt the poor one, to make him sit with nobles’?</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Stressing God’s compassion, the psalmist adds that Jehovah is “raising up the lowly one from the very dust; he exalts the poor <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>one from the ashpit itself, to make him sit with nobles, with the nobles of his people. He is causing the barren woman to dwell in a house as a joyful mother of sons. Praise Jah, you people!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:113:7-19:113:9" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Psalm 113:7-9</a>) Jehovah’s people have faith that he can deliver upright needy ones, change their state, and satisfy their proper needs and desires. ‘The High and Lofty One revives the spirit of the lowly ones and the heart of those being crushed.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:57:15-23:57:15" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Isaiah 57:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>How does Jehovah ‘exalt the poor one, to make him sit with nobles’? When it is God’s will, he puts his servants in positions of glory equal to that of nobles. He did so in the case of Joseph, who became Egypt’s food administrator. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:41:37-1:41:49" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Genesis 41:37-49</a>) In Israel, sitting with the nobles, or men of authority among Jehovah’s people, was a privilege to be cherished. Like Christian elders today, such men had God’s aid and blessing.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">11. Why may it be said that <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:113:7-19:113:9" data-bid="54-1" class="b">Psalm 113:7-9</a> especially applies to Jehovah’s people of modern times?</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>What about ‘making the barren woman a joyful mother’? God gave barren Hannah a son​—Samuel, whom she devoted to His service. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:1:20-9:1:28" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 Samuel 1:20-28</a>) More significantly, beginning with Jesus and with the outpouring of holy spirit upon his disciples at Pentecost 33 C.E., God’s symbolic woman, heavenly Zion, started to bring forth spiritual children.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:16-48:6:16" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Galatians 6:16</a>) As loyal Witnesses of Jehovah, the remnant of spiritual Israel and their associates with earthly hopes are heartily responding to the final words of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:113:1-19:113:9" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Psalm 113</a>: “Praise Jah, you people!”</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:114:1-19:114:8" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Psalm 114</a> shows Jehovah’s uniqueness by citing unique events involving the Israelites. Sang the psalmist: “When Israel went forth from Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people speaking unintelligibly, Judah became his holy place, Israel his grand dominion.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:114:1-19:114:2" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Psalm 114:1, 2</a>) God delivered Israel from slavery to the Egyptians, whose language was strange to their ears. The deliverance of Jehovah’s people, called Judah and Israel in poetic parallelism, shows that God can deliver all his servants today.</p>
<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="qu">13. How does <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:114:3-19:114:6" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Psalm 114:3-6</a> show Jehovah’s supremacy and apply to ancient Israel’s experiences?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Jehovah’s sovereignty over all creation is evident in the words: “The sea itself saw and took to flight; as for the Jordan, it began to turn back. The mountains themselves skipped about like rams, the hills like lambs. What was the matter with you, O sea, that you took to flight, O Jordan, that you began to turn back? O mountains, that you went skipping about like rams; O hills, like lambs?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:114:3-19:114:6" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Psalm 114:3-6</a>) The Red Sea “took to flight” when God opened a path through it for his people. Israel then saw Jehovah’s great hand in action against the Egyptians who died in the returning waters. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:14:21-2:14:31" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Exodus 14:21-31</a>) In a similar display of divine power, the Jordan River “began to turn back,” allowing the Israelites to cross into Canaan. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:3:14-6:3:16" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Joshua 3:14-16</a>) ‘The mountains skipped about like rams’ as Mount Sinai smoked and trembled when the Law covenant was instituted. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:19:7-2:19:18" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Exodus 19:7-18</a>) With the climax of <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>his song in view, the psalmist put matters in question form, perhaps suggesting that the inanimate sea, river, mountains, and hills were awestruck by these displays of Jehovah’s power.</p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">14. What was done by Jehovah’s power at Meribah and Kadesh, and how should this affect his modern-day servants?</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>Still alluding to Jehovah’s power, the psalmist sang: “Because of the Lord be in severe pains, O earth, because of the God of Jacob, who is changing the rock into a reedy pool of water, a flinty rock into a spring of water.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:114:7-19:114:8" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Psalm 114:7, 8</a>) In a figurative way, the psalmist thus indicates that mankind should stand in awe of Jehovah, the Lord and Universal Ruler of all the earth. He was “the God of Jacob,” or Israel, as he is of spiritual Israelites and their earthly companions. At Meribah and Kadesh in the wilderness, Jehovah showed his power by miraculously supplying Israel with water, “changing the rock into a reedy pool of water, a flinty rock into a spring.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:17:1-2:17:7" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Exodus 17:1-7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:20:1-4:20:11" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> Numbers 20:1-11</a>) Such reminders of Jehovah’s awesome power and tender care give his Witnesses sound reasons for unquestioning faith in him.</p>

For he has executed judgment upon the great harlot [Babylon the Great] who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and he has avenged the blood of his slaves at her hand.” Again they said: “Praise Jah, you people!” So <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>did “the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures.” A voice from the throne said: “Be praising our God, all you his slaves, who fear him, the small ones and the great.” Then John added: “I heard what was as a voice of a great crowd and as a sound of many waters and as a sound of heavy thunders. They said: ‘Praise Jah, you people, because Jehovah our God, the Almighty, has begun to rule as king.’”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:1-66:19:6" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Revelation 19:1-6</a>.</p>

<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>How fitting it is that heavenly hosts praise Jehovah! In his new world now near, resurrected loyal ones will join survivors of this system’s end in praising Jah. Towering mountains will lift their heads in songs of praise to God. Verdant hills and fruitful trees will sing his praises. Why, every creature that lives and breathes will praise Jehovah’s name in the great Hallelujah chorus! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:148:1-19:148:14" data-bid="50-1" class="b">Psalm 148</a>) Will your voice be heard in that joyous throng? It will be if you loyally serve Jah with his people. That should be your purpose in life, for who is like Jehovah our God?</p>

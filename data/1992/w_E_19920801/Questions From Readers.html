<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>Should we understand from </strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:8-18:1:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Job 1:8</strong></a> <strong>that during the period when Job lived, he was the only human who was faithful to Jehovah?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">No. That conclusion is not justified by <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:8-18:1:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 1:8</a>, which says:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Jehovah went on to say to Satan: ‘Have you set your heart upon my servant Job, that there is no one like him in the earth, a man blameless and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad?’” God provided a similar assessment at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:2:3-18:2:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Job 2:3</a>, asking Satan: “Have you set your heart upon my servant Job, that there is no one like him in the earth, a man blameless and upright, fearing God and turning aside from bad?”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The book of Job itself indicates that Job was not the only human alive whom God accepted as faithful. Beginning in chapter 32, we read about Elihu. Though being a younger man, Elihu corrected the error of Job’s outlook and magnified the true God.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:32:6-18:33:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Job 32:6–33:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:33:31-18:33:33" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 31-33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:35:1-18:36:2" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Job 35:1–36:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Consequently, God’s comment that ‘there was no one like Job in the earth’ must mean that Job was particularly outstanding as a man of uprightness. Likely Job lived in the interval between the death of Joseph in Egypt and the beginning of Moses’ service as God’s prophet. During that period a large number of Israelites resided in Egypt. There is no reason to think that all of them were unfaithful and unacceptable to God; probably there were many who trusted in Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:2:1-2:2:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Exodus 2:1-10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:23-58:11:23" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Hebrews 11:23</a>) Yet, none of them played a prominent role, as Joseph had, nor were those worshipers outstanding as to true worship, as Moses would be in leading the nation of Israel out of Egypt.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Living elsewhere, though, there was a man of noteworthy integrity. “There happened to be a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man proved to be blameless and upright, and fearing God and turning aside from bad.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:1-18:1:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Job 1:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Jehovah could thus mention Job as a conspicuous or notable example of faith and devotion. Similarly, Bible writers Ezekiel and James retrospectively singled out Job as setting a pattern of righteousness and endurance.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:14:14-26:14:14" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ezekiel 14:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:11-59:5:11" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> James 5:11</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“ADULTERY almost seems like an everyday event.” So say many experts, according to the <em>Los Angeles Times. </em>Does such a statement surprise you? Yet, psychiatrist Frank Pittman estimates that about 50 percent of husbands and from 30 percent to 40 percent of wives have been unfaithful. If that is true, almost half of all married people commit adultery!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Does that mean that immorality is all right? By no means! The spread of infidelity does not make it right​—any more than the growth of street crime makes it right to rob someone. Immorality hurts. For example, mankind today is afflicted by a pandemic of dangerous sexually transmitted diseases all of which could be easily controlled if people led moral lives. The killer disease AIDS would never have got the foothold it has if people had not been so loose in their sexual lives.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Besides, even the most sophisticated and “enlightened” feel enormous pain when their partners are unfaithful. One act of infidelity can cause wounds that take half a lifetime to heal.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The most important point, though, is that playing fast and loose with marriage vows is gross disrespect for God, since he is the Author of marriage. The Bible says: “Let marriage be honorable among all.” We are also warned: “God will judge fornicators and adulterers.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:4-58:13:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Hence, wise people heed the inspired words: “Rejoice with the wife of your youth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:5:18-20:5:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 5:18</a>) They seek contentment and happiness with their marriage mates. In doing so they guard their physical and emotional health, and most important, they bring honor to the grand Author of marriage, Jehovah God.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">MANY honesthearted people are fleeing from false religion, learning Bible truth, and coming to worship Jehovah, the true God. Over 7,600 have done so in Bolivia, including a nun.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When only nine years old, M​——​ had her first contact with one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. She answered the door when the Witness called at her home, and for the first time, she heard God’s name, Jehovah, pronounced. It stayed in the back of her mind for years.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Since she was the only girl in the family, it was decided that she should become a nun. “How happy I felt that I was going to be in God’s service​—at least, that is what I thought,” says M——. But her joy turned into disillusionment when she saw the injustice and partiality practiced in the convent. She says: “Perhaps I shall never forget those bouts of depression and those physical and spiritual beatings that were so agonizing, causing me to view God, not as the One of love, but as One who punishes without compassion.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">She continues: “By the time I became a nun, I had been unsuccessful in finding the name Jehovah in the Bible. I only found ‘Yahweh,’ and that bewildered me. One day I even went out to look for those people who spoke of Jehovah, but I never found them.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“Time passed, and one day when I was on the way to my family’s home, I saw a sign, ‘Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses.’ I wanted to tell them that they were false prophets, but no one was in the hall. I returned on Sunday. A meeting was in progress, and a number seemed surprised to see a fully garbed nun in attendance. After the meeting, I tried to make a quick exit. Nevertheless, one of the Witnesses greeted me, so I asked her, ‘Why do you blaspheme the Holy One by bearing that name?’ My question led to a Bible discussion, and I made arrangements for her to visit me at my family’s home. My parents threw her out. We met again, however, two months later, and she invited me to her home for a Bible study. I was very impressed by the information she showed me, proving that Christians should use God’s name. That evidence gave me the needed strength to renounce all the worthless things I had been taught as a nun.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“I remember many things about my life in the convent. For example, once I needed more food to eat. So I wrote and asked my parents to send me some, not realizing that letters were censored at the convent. At the next meal, a great amount of bread and jelly was placed before me, and I was forced to eat it all. Now I had too much food. I mentioned this to my friends, and one suggested that I crumble the bread that I could not eat and scatter it over the floor. When I did that, a nun immediately grabbed me and hurled me to the floor, with the stern order that I should lick the entire floor clean with my tongue. The room was large. While obeying the order, I heard much giggling and laughing​—no mercy whatsoever was shown.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">“I can now see how marvelous it is to be free from all of that. As could be expected, this liberation involved sacrifices. For one thing, my father threw me out of the house. Nevertheless, before leaving the convent, I had the privilege of helping other young nuns to learn the truth. I rejoice to say that some of us have dedicated our lives to Jehovah God!</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">“After I left the convent, it was difficult for my father to understand why I turned down well-paying but time-consuming jobs. However, I wanted more time for God’s service. I now serve as a regular pioneer, with an uncomplicated and yet very rewarding life. And to my great joy, my mother and my brothers have joined me in Jehovah’s service.”</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Truly, Bible truth does free one from this world’s false religious system, and it brings lasting joy and happiness.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:32-43:8:32" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 8:32</a>.</p>

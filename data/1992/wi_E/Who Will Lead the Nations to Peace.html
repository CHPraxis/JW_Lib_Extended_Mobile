<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb">ISAIAH chapter 2 is much more than a prophecy about the return of the Jewish people to Jerusalem after 70 years of Babylonian captivity. Indeed, the prophecy refers to nothing less than the turning of peoples of all nations to the pure worship of the only true God, Jehovah. It implies the forming of an international brotherhood rendering sacred service acceptable to God.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>A transformation of such magnitude, encompassing people in every part of the world, would be not only dramatic but also visible, as if happening on a mountain in full view of everyone. This is exactly what is happening today among Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide. Millions from Christendom’s religions have learned that God is one and have stopped worshiping the Trinity. In India, Hindus have abandoned their pantheon of gods and myriads of idols for the one true God. The same is true of people in Africa, on faraway islands, and in the Middle East. Those who have gone up to Jehovah’s holy mountain, his pure worship, have put away all racial, tribal, and political hatreds; they literally ‘learn war no more.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:2-23:2:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>This international brotherhood is also related to the fulfillment of God’s purpose for all mankind: that people of <em>all nations </em>would bless themselves by means of a promised “seed,” a descendant of Abraham, and so worship God in truth and unity. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:18-1:22:18" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 22:18</a>, <em>JP</em>) Later prophecies indicated that this “seed” was also to be the ‘prophet like Moses,’ who would mediate a new covenant that would serve as the legal basis for sincere people of all nations to worship God in unity.

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>The identity of the Messiah has been debated for centuries. According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:11:10-23:11:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 11:10</a> and other texts, he would be a Jew, a descendant of King David (Jesse’s son), and people of all nations would accept him as the legitimate Messiah sent by God. Referring to the first-​century Jewish teacher Jesus, Rabbi H. G. Enelow wrote: “No sensible Jew can be indifferent to the fact that a Jew should have had such a tremendous part in the religious education and direction <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>of the human race.”<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1101992077/11-11"><sup>10</sup></a> What other Jew have so many Gentiles accepted as the Messiah?

<h2 id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>Christendom’s Apostasy</strong></h2>
<div class="pGroup">
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> 5-7. Why do many find the very names of Jesus and of Christianity offensive?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>For the majority of non-​Christians, it is Christendom, whose adherents supposedly follow Christ’s teachings, that has caused an aversion to the very name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus, many nations have suffered at the hands of Christendom, but without a doubt the Jewish people have suffered more than any of them.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>In our own time, anti-​Semitism in Christendom culminated in the Nazi Holocaust. Though many factors were involved, religious hatred cannot be ignored as one of the main ones. And if some in Christendom would deny this, the fact that “Christians,” both Catholics and Protestants, were among the ones that did the killing or condoned it is undeniable. Elie Wiesel sums up the Jewish view in his book <em>A Jew Today: </em>“How is one to explain that neither Hitler nor Himmler was ever excommunicated by the church? That Pius XII never thought it necessary, not to say indispensable, to condemn Auschwitz and Treblinka? That among the S.S. a large proportion were believers who remained faithful to their Christian ties to the end? That there were killers who went to confession between massacres? And that they all came from Christian families and had received a Christian education?”<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1101992077/12-12"><sup>11</sup></a> Therefore, just how much faith could Jewish people be expected to demonstrate in someone whose name was for centuries connected with every humiliation and blow that they received?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Aside from outright persecution, what kind of moral example have the “Christian” countries given to the rest of the world? Little more than wars, Crusades, and “holy” Inquisitions. Even World War I and World War II were begun in “Christian” lands. Could it be said that “Christian” morality has been exemplary? AIDS for example, is rampant in countries where the majority of the population profess Christianity. The scandals among Christendom’s clergy are notorious. Immoral televangelists who rake in millions of dollars and live like kings as well as homosexual clergy, some of whom have even been sued for committing sexual abuses against male minors, are just a few of the things that non-​Christians feel characterize Christianity​—fruitage that besmirches the name of Jesus, whom “Christians” claim to follow.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"> 8-10. (a) Why cannot Christendom rightly claim to represent Jesus and true Christianity? (b) What warning did the Scriptures give about an apostasy from Jesus’ true teachings?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Additionally, both Judaism and Islam are rightly repelled by the idolatry rampant in Christendom. Many of Christendom’s unscriptural doctrines, such as the veneration of Mary as the “Mother of God,” are also objectionable to these religions. The Trinity doctrine is especially viewed with disdain by Jews as a clear contradiction of the essence of Judaism​—the monotheistic concept embodied in the words “HEAR O ISRAEL: THE LORD OUR GOD, THE LORD IS ONE.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:6:4-5:6:4" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, <em>JP.</em></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><span id="page27" class="pageNum" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span><sup>9 </sup>The persecutions perpetrated by Christendom, its wars, immorality, hypocrisy, and blasphemous doctrines are unpardonable not only in the eyes of non-​Christians but also in the eyes of God Almighty. For this reason, Jehovah’s Witnesses, though followers of Jesus Christ, are no part of Christendom. Christendom, on the other hand, is no part of true Christianity. Virtually the only similarity between Christendom and the first Christians is the use of the name Jesus. But if Jesus’ teachings were so outstandingly good and practical, how did such an apostasy come about?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Actually, that false Christians would arise and that there would be an apostasy from Jesus’ true teachings were prophesied by Jesus himself as well as by the writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures, incorrectly referred to as the New Testament. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:29-44:20:30" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 20:29, 30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/53:2:1-53:2:12" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:1-54:4:3" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 1 Timothy 4:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:1-61:2:2" data-bid="8-4" class="b"> 2 Peter 2:1, 2</a>) According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:21-40:7:23" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 7:21-23</a>, the Messiah himself would judge these apostate ones for what they are and would say to them, “I never knew you! Get away from me, you workers of lawlessness.”​—<em>NW; </em>compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:24-40:13:30" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 13:24-30,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:37-40:13:43" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 37-43</a>.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>At first, all the followers of Jesus were Jews.

<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>With a new covenant came the need for further inspired writings that would provide necessary additional information for those who would serve God under this new-​covenant arrangement. These writings, the Christian Greek Scriptures, were all written by Jews. They report on Jesus’ life and teachings, fill in details concerning many prophecies recorded in the Hebrew Scriptures, and clarify points concerning the Messiah and his role in the divine purpose. Additionally, they include letters that serve as counsel and encouragement for the new international body of worshipers.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>19 </sup>Another text that is related to the Messiah’s being “cut off,” or killed, as an atonement sacrifice, is found at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:13-23:53:12" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Isaiah 52:13 to 53:12</a>. (See the box “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1101992075/85-92">‘My Servant’—Who Is He?</a>”) Rabbis in the first century applied this text to the Messiah, as did Rambam and others in the Middle Ages. The text makes it perfectly clear that forgiveness is linked with the Messiah and his death.</p>
<div class="boxSupplement"><aside><div id="p85" data-pid="85" class="boxTtl rule"><div><strong>“MY SERVANT”​—WHO IS HE?</strong></div></div>
<div class="boxContent"><p id="p86" data-pid="86" class="se"><strong>“‘Indeed, My servant . . . was despised, shunned by men . . . We held him of no account. Yet it was our sickness that he was bearing, our suffering that he endured. . . . But he was wounded because of our sins, crushed because of our iniquities. . . . We all went astray like sheep . . . And the LORD visited upon him the guilt of all of us.’ . . . Though he had done no injustice and had spoken no falsehood. . . . </strong><strong>‘My righteous servant makes the many righteous, it is their punishment that he bears . . .</strong> <strong>He exposed himself [“poured out his soul,” <em>NW</em>] to death and was numbered among the sinners, whereas he bore the guilt of the many and made intercession for sinners.’”​—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:13-23:53:12" data-bid="67-1" class="b"><strong>Isaiah 52:13–​53:12</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p87" data-pid="87" class="sc">The picture Isaiah presents here is of a completely innocent, pure individual whose suffering and death provided atonement for his own nation, which did not acknowledge him.</p>
<p id="p88" data-pid="88" class="sc">Today, however, most Jewish commentators accept as an established fact that the reference is to the nation of Israel as a whole or to a righteous group within the nation.</p>
<p id="p89" data-pid="89" class="sc">The question is, Did the nation of Israel, or even a portion of it, ever fit this description, or does it apply to an individual?</p>
<p id="p90" data-pid="90" class="sc">For over 800 years after Isaiah’s writing these words of prophecy (c. 732 B.C.E.), there is no record of any Jew or rabbi who taught that this “servant” was to be viewed in a collective sense. Throughout this period, the prophecy was universally understood to refer to an individual and was generally regarded as a prophecy concerning the Messiah.</p>
<p id="p91" data-pid="91" class="sc">In addition, notice the comment in the prologue to the book <em>The Fifty-​Third Chapter of Isaiah According to the Jewish Interpreters: </em>“Surviving Jewish exegesis up to the end of the amoraic period [up to the sixth century C.E.] suggests that it was then frequently, perhaps even generally assumed without question that the figure referred to was the Messiah, which is of course how the Targum also, somewhat later, interprets it.”​—Edited by H. M. Orlinsky, 1969, page 17.</p>
<p id="p92" data-pid="92" class="sc">What could be the motive for rejecting and reinterpreting the most natural understanding of this scripture as referring to an individual, even the Messiah? Was it not simply an effort to avoid any connection between this prophecy and Jesus, the first-​century Jew who fitted its description in every detail?</p>
</div>
</aside></div>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>For the above reasons, the teaching that the Messiah’s death would make possible the complete forgiveness of sin in God’s sight was readily understood by many first-​century Jews.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:7:20-21:7:20" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Ecclesiastes 7:20</a>) The need for sacrifice to atone for sin was a lesson perceived daily; it was implicit in the very framework and nature of the Law covenant.

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>In addition to explaining Jesus’ death as a ransom sacrifice, the Christian Greek Scriptures also highlight his role as a ‘prophet like Moses.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:18:18-5:18:18" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>; see the section “What Is God’s Purpose for Mankind?,” <a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1101992073/21-24">paragraphs 17-19</a>.) As such, he prophesied the destruction of Jerusalem and instructed his disciples to flee the city when they would see it surrounded by armies. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:37-40:24:2" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Matthew 23:37–​24:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:20-42:21:21" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> Luke 21:20, 21</a>) But how can one flee a city when it is besieged by troops? The Jewish historian Yoseph ben Mattatiyahu (Josephus), himself an eyewitness of these events, records the answer: “Cestius [the Roman commander, 66 C.E.] . . . suddenly called off his men, abandoned hope though he had suffered no reverse, and flying in the face of all reason retired from the City.”<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:1101992077/14-14"><sup>13</sup></a> That was the opening the Christians needed to flee the city. Four years later, in 70 C.E., the Roman troops, now under General Titus, returned and again besieged the city. Jesus had prophesied of the city that the enemy would build ‘a fortification with pointed stakes and would encircle the city and distress it from every side.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:43-42:19:43" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Luke 19:43</a>, <em>NW</em>) Josephus confirms that Titus built such a fortification of pointed stakes, nearly five miles (8 km) long, denuding the countryside of trees for a radius of about ten miles (16 km). Jesus’ prophecies gave precise instructions on how to avoid destruction at the hands of the Romans, and their veracity is proved by the fact that the lives of all those who heeded them were saved.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:20-42:21:24" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Luke 21:20-24</a>.</p>

(See <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:14" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3-14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:10-42:21:11" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> Luke 21:10, 11</a>.) Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that this great composite sign has been in evidence since 1914, when “the appointed times of the nations” came to their end. Long before that time they had been announcing that 1914 would be a marked date in human history. When the first world war began in August of that year, their expectations on that were confirmed. In reality, none of the Witnesses had received any divine visions; it was their diligent study of the Holy Scriptures that led them to this conclusion.</p>

Question Box
▪ Should we telephone the Society to obtain answers to Bible questions or for personal advice?
Many people use the telephone to do things quickly, but often more than speed is involved. In the world it is common to put priority on personal convenience; people avoid exerting themselves.
What a contrast we find with God’s advice! He urges us to seek for knowledge as for hidden treasure, which implies our being willing to exert ourselves. Experience proves that our doing so results in more lasting satisfaction.​—Prov. 2:1-4.
Such effort is fitting if a question arises as we prepare for a share in meetings or if we face a personal problem. Instead of simply telephoning the Society, we will benefit by personally doing research in the Bible and our publications, especially the Watch Tower Publications Index, with its valuable Scripture and subject indexes.
After we have thus ‘sought for hid treasures,’ we can approach one of the local elders if we still need help. The elders have considerable Bible knowledge and experience in searching for information. Their balanced help would especially be fitting if we need advice about a personal problem or decision, for they are close to us and our situation.​—Compare Acts 8:30, 31.
If it still seems that more information is needed directly from the Society, it is usually better to send a letter. The elders may be of assistance too in preparing this. Such a letter will allow time for the reply to be based on adequate research or reflection, which usually is impossible with a telephone call.

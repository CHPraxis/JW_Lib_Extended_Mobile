Announcements
▪ Literature offer for December: The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. January: Any 192-​page book published in 1983 or earlier. If the congregation has no stock of such books, the book True Peace and Security​—How Can You Find It? should be used and may be requested from Brooklyn. February: You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. March: Revelation​—Its Grand Climax At Hand! NOTE: Congregations that will need the above-​mentioned campaign items should request them on their next monthly Literature Request Form (S(d)-14).
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on December 1 or as soon as possible thereafter.
▪ The Memorial for 1994 will be Saturday, March 26, after sundown. This advance notice of the date for the 1994 Memorial celebration is given so that brothers may make necessary reservations or contracts for available halls when there are too many congregations using the Kingdom Hall and they must find other facilities.
▪ The Society has produced another new tract in English and in Spanish for use among the Jewish population. The title is Jehovah’s Witnesses​—What Do They Believe? (Tract No. 18). Congregations that have a Jewish population in their territory may wish to request a supply of this tract. As it becomes available in other languages, announcement will be made.
▪ A new brochure that makes reference only to the Hebrew Scriptures has also been produced. Although this brochure, entitled Will There Ever Be a World Without War?, has been prepared especially for the Jewish population, its message would be entirely appropriate for use throughout the field. It is now available in English and in Spanish.
▪ Congregations should begin requesting bound volumes of The Watchtower and Awake! for 1992 on their December literature request. (See the Watchtower Publications List, paragraphs 6-8, 10.) The bound volumes will be available in Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish. Until the bound volumes are available and shipments are made, these will appear as “Pending” on congregation packing lists. Bound volumes are special-​request items.​—See the Watchtower Publications List, paragraphs 24 and 25.

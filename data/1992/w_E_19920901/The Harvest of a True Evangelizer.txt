The Harvest of a True Evangelizer
WILLIAM R. BROWN first went to Africa in 1923. With his wife and child, he ‘did the work of an evangelizer’ in The Gambia, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. (2 Timothy 4:5) The fruitage of his work is extraordinary.
This native of the West Indies was not a member of one of Christendom’s churches and certainly did not get involved in politics. Rather, he imitated Jesus and the apostles by publicizing the name and sovereignty of Jehovah, emphasizing the importance of the ransom, and preaching the good news of the Kingdom. (Matthew 9:35; 20:28; John 17:4-6) William R. Brown constantly used the Bible, pointing to it as the final authority in matters of doctrine and faith. (2 Timothy 3:16) So insistent was he on this that he was known as Bible Brown.
With Jehovah’s blessing, the seeds sown by Bible Brown sprouted and grew. Today, in the lands where he led the way, almost 200,000 Africans have dedicated their lives to their Creator and, in turn, preach the good news of the Kingdom to others. (Matthew 24:14; 1 Corinthians 3:6-9) These active Christians are widely known for their honesty and reliability. They are proud to be Witnesses of Jehovah and subjects of Christ, the reigning King.
Such a harvest is the result of true Christian evangelism. A similar harvest is being reaped around the world on every inhabited continent. In upwards of 200 lands, over four million meekhearted men and women have been “harvested” and are repeating to others the words of the evangelizing angel: “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of the judgment by him has arrived.” (Revelation 14:7) In truth, the only way to find hope in our troubled age is to turn to God and submit to his Kingdom rule.

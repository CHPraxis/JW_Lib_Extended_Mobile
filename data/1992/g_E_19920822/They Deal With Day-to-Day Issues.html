<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A woman from Lisbon, Portugal, a while back wrote to the Watch Tower Society branch office in that country to request the <em>Awake! </em>magazine. What prompted her request was that she had recently received a copy of the <em>Watchtower </em>magazine. She had read it and appreciated it so much that she said:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I want to thank you for the issue of <em>The Watchtower </em>that arrived in today’s mail. I found all the articles in this issue very beneficial. Since <em>Awake! </em>is a source of practical counsel based on the Bible in dealing with day-​to-​day issues, it will be a good addition to my leisure reading.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I started to study the Bible just one month ago, but that is sufficient to grasp the usefulness of your publications.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Once again, my sincere thanks to all of those who dedicate their lives to helping people like me learn about the Kingdom and Jehovah’s Word.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses are an international organization of some four million Bible students who use their lives in helping others learn more about God’s purposes.

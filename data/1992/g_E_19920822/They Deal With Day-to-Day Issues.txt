They Deal With Day-​to-​Day Issues
A woman from Lisbon, Portugal, a while back wrote to the Watch Tower Society branch office in that country to request the Awake! magazine. What prompted her request was that she had recently received a copy of the Watchtower magazine. She had read it and appreciated it so much that she said:
“I want to thank you for the issue of The Watchtower that arrived in today’s mail. I found all the articles in this issue very beneficial. Since Awake! is a source of practical counsel based on the Bible in dealing with day-​to-​day issues, it will be a good addition to my leisure reading.
“I started to study the Bible just one month ago, but that is sufficient to grasp the usefulness of your publications.
“Once again, my sincere thanks to all of those who dedicate their lives to helping people like me learn about the Kingdom and Jehovah’s Word.”
Jehovah’s Witnesses are an international organization of some four million Bible students who use their lives in helping others learn more about God’s purposes.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">NORTHERN and southern lights, or auroras, have been a source of wonder for people living near the geomagnetic north and south poles. It is believed now that inside the earth, columns of molten metal rise and fall and are twisted as the earth rotates. This causes electrical currents that generate magnetic fields aligned approximately with the axis of the spinning earth. Particles of radiation reaching the earth from the sun cause a visible effect because of these magnetic fields. But the effect is enhanced when increased numbers of particles arrive from huge solar flares associated with sunspots. Many particles are trapped by the earth’s magnetic field. Atoms in our atmosphere in zones surrounding these magnetic poles are excited and produce visible light in various colors. The colors are produced when oxygen and nitrogen atoms are excited by this energy from the sun and produce visible light in the wavelengths of red/​green/​violet. Most auroras are green in color, with some areas of red and violet. In the northern parts of the earth, these lights are called aurora borealis (Latin, northern dawn), while in the southern, they are called aurora australis (southern dawn).</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">LAST year, a consistory (solemn council of cardinals) was organized to discuss certain matters that are of great concern to the Catholic Church. One of these, according to the newspaper <em>Il Sabato, </em>is “the aggressiveness of the sects.” However, the newspaper said: “It should be no problem for the cardinals to reach agreement on this point. All are in accord that there is a need for a more in-depth study of the phenomenon of new religious movements and also a need to prevent, as far as possible, their expansion.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Evidently, though, “the aggressiveness of the sects” is not just a problem in Italy. <em>Il Sabato </em>reports: “While visiting the Vatican recently, Archbishop Kirill of Smolensk [one of Russia’s oldest cities] . . . asked the pope for ecumenical aid in coping with the overwhelming growth of Jehovah’s Witnesses and similar groups in the Soviet Union.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the first century, leaders of established religion had similar complaints when Christianity was spread aggressively by its adherents. On one occasion indignant Jews complained to the city rulers: “These men that have overturned the inhabited earth are present here also”! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:17:6-44:17:6" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 17:6</a>) Back then, religious leaders tried hard to stop the spread of Christianity, but they failed. Today also, any effort to stop the spread of true Christian doctrine is doomed to failure. God himself promises: “Any weapon whatever that will be formed against you will have no success, and any tongue at all that will rise up against you in the judgment you will condemn. This is the hereditary possession of the servants of Jehovah, and their righteousness is from me.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:54:17-23:54:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 54:17</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>After attending this year’s district convention, we are more keenly aware of the need to be light bearers to our neighbors. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:14-40:5:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 5:14</a>) As we reflect on all the information presented on the program and strive to apply it in our daily lives, we are helped to draw closer to Jehovah in true worship and to help others learn about Jehovah’s promises.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Our opportunities to bear light were increased when, at the close of the Friday morning session, the new tract entitled <em>Will This World Survive? </em>was released. The demonstrations on Saturday morning were very helpful in showing how this tract might be used. Along with this, there was an announcement that three other tracts would soon be available. These are entitled <em>Comfort for the Depressed,</em> <em>Enjoy Family Life,</em> and <em>Who Really Rules the World?</em> Encouragement was given to carry these handy instruments with us for use as opportunities arise.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>At the conclusion of the talk “Deliverance at the Revelation of Jesus Christ” on Saturday afternoon, a fine new brochure entitled <em>Does God Really Care About Us? </em>was released. This full-​color, beautifully illustrated brochure will answer many questions people ask, such as: Why does God permit suffering? Will suffering ever end? How do we know that we are in the last days? How will the earth be transformed into a paradise? How may we attain to everlasting life in God’s new world? This brochure will be an excellent instrument for starting new studies.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>How grateful we are for the abundance of spiritual food received at the “Light Bearers” District Convention! May we, as bearers of God’s spiritual light, be resolved to demonstrate our heartfelt appreciation through conscientious application of what we learned and diligent use of these fine new releases in helping people everywhere to know and serve Jehovah.</p>

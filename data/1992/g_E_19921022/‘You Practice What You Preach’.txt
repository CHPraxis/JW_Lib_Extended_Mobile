‘You Practice What You Preach’
Jehovah’s Witnesses maintain branch offices in nearly a hundred countries throughout the world. In South Africa last year, a man from Beacon Bay wrote a letter of appreciation to the Watch Tower Society’s branch office in that country. He said:
“I am not a Witness but regularly read the Watchtower and Awake! magazines. I really find reading them very uplifting. You cover a great variety of topics in these magazines and present your material very clearly and professionally.
“I think very highly of Witnesses’ morals and behaviour. You are the only variety of Christianity I’ve come across whose members consistently practise what they profess. May your work prosper.”
In recent years the work of Jehovah’s Witnesses has prospered to the extent that over 30 of their branches earth wide now print The Watchtower and Awake! Altogether, almost 700 million copies of these magazines were printed last year, nearly 16 million copies of each issue of The Watchtower and over 13 million copies of each issue of Awake!

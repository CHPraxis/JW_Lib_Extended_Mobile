<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses maintain branch offices in nearly a hundred countries throughout the world. In South Africa last year, a man from Beacon Bay wrote a letter of appreciation to the Watch Tower Society’s branch office in that country. He said:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I am not a Witness but regularly read the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. I really find reading them very uplifting. You cover a great variety of topics in these magazines and present your material very clearly and professionally.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I think very highly of Witnesses’ morals and behaviour. You are the only variety of Christianity I’ve come across whose members consistently practise what they profess. May your work prosper.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In recent years the work of Jehovah’s Witnesses has prospered to the extent that over 30 of their branches earth wide now print <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>Altogether, almost 700 million copies of these magazines were printed last year, nearly 16 million copies of each issue of <em>The Watchtower </em>and over 13 million copies of each issue of <em>Awake!</em></p>

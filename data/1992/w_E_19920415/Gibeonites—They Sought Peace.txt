Gibeonites​—They Sought Peace
THE hilltop city above is identified as being on the spot where ancient Gibeon stood, some six miles [10 km] north of Jerusalem.
You likely know that Gibeon came to prominence soon after Joshua led Israel into the Promised Land and defeated Jericho. The Canaanites of Gibeon realized that they could not withstand Israel, who clearly had divine backing. What to do? Resorting to a ruse, the Gibeonites sent representatives who posed as travelers from a distant land. This effort toward peace succeeded, for Israel made a covenant with them. When their trick was exposed, the Gibeonites became gatherers of wood and drawers of water.
God must not have been displeased with this people who sought peace. He supported Joshua’s defense of the Gibeonites when they were attacked by five kings. Jehovah even performed the miracle of extending daylight for that battle.​—Joshua 9:3-27; 10:1-14.
Excavators found on this mound a deep pit, or pool, cut into solid rock. The Gibeonites could descend steps into this and obtain water from an underground chamber. Might this have been “the pool of Gibeon” mentioned at 2 Samuel 2:13? Archaeologists also discovered cellars cut into rock and a great deal of wine-making equipment. Yes, it seems that Gibeon was a center for making wine.
During David’s time the tent, or tabernacle, of the true God was located here. King Solomon came here to offer sacrifices. Jehovah appeared to Solomon in a dream and promised him “a wise and understanding heart,” as well as riches. (1 Kings 3:4-14; 2 Chronicles 1:3) The article on pages 12-17 of this issue shows that the descendants of the people who dwelt here in Gibeon were specially privileged among God’s nation at a later time. Do you know how?

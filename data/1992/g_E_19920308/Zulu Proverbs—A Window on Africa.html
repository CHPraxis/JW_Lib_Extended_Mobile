<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE Zulu nation, living along the subtropical east coast of South Africa, has inherited a legacy of delightful proverbs that capture the lessons of life in a typically African way. Since the beloved cattle of the Zulus play an important part in their lives, it is not surprising that this is reflected in many of their sayings.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Consider, for instance, how a Zulu would describe the effect when two masters try to run one household. That would be as disastrous as putting ‘two bulls in the same kraal [enclosure].’ (<em>Akukho zinkunzi zahlala ndawonye.</em>)</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">And speaking of cattle, the acrid smell of a horn burning in the communal fire is extremely unpleasant to all in the immediate vicinity. Therefore, of a cantankerous and quarrelsome person, someone may mutter: “Oh, there he goes burning the horn again.” (<em>Ushis’ uphondo.</em>)</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Carrying one’s own load in life is deemed a virtue by most people. The Zulus are no exception. Therefore, an old sage may remark: “You should face your responsibilities squarely, since ‘no elephant ever found its trunk too heavy.’” (<em>Akundlovu yasindwa umboko wayo.</em>)​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:5-48:6:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Galatians 6:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">If one encountered a rhino on a rampage in a wilderness area, a tree to climb would be most useful. Thus, the expression: “Do not speak of the rhino if there is no tree nearby!” (<em>Ungakhulumi ngobhejane kungekho sihlahla eduze.</em>) The proverbial warning is obvious.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In a similar vein, trying to handle too many things at once can be counterproductive. “You cannot chase two antelope at once,” say the Zulus. (<em>Ungexoshe mpalambili.</em>) Anyone who has tried to do this will know that as you concentrate your energies on one buck, the other is busy making a getaway. The lesson? Tackle one thing at a time.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Unreasonable obstinacy is generally frowned upon by most people. The Zulus have a quaint way of summing up such a hardheaded person when they say: “While he was being cooked, a stone was also being cooked, and the stone was ready first.” (<em>Kwaphekwa yena kwaphekw’ itshe, kwavuthw’ itshe kuqala.</em>)</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Although not divinely inspired like the proverbs that are found in the Bible, many of these expressions reflect wholesome values that help us to succeed in life.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:1:5-20:1:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 1:5, 6</a>.</p>

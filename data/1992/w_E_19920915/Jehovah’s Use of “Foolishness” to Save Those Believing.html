<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“Since, in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom did not get to know God, God saw good through the foolishness of what is preached to save those believing.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:21-46:1:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 CORINTHIANS 1:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="qu"> 1. In what sense would Jehovah use “foolishness,” and how do we know that the world in its wisdom did not get to know God?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb">WHAT? Would Jehovah use foolishness? Not really! But he can and does use what <em>appears </em>foolish to the world. He does so in order to save people who know and love him. Through its wisdom, the world cannot get to know God. Jesus Christ made this clear when he said in prayer: “Righteous Father, the world has, indeed, not come to know you.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:25-43:17:25" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 17:25</a>.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu"> 2. How may it seem that Jehovah’s ways and the world’s ways are running parallel to each other, but what are the facts?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Jesus’ words indicate that Jehovah’s ways differ from those of the world. On the surface it may appear that God’s purpose and that of this world are running parallel to each other. It may seem that the aims of this world have God’s blessing. For instance, the Bible says that God would set up a righteous government that will bring life in peace, happiness, and prosperity to mankind on earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:6-23:9:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 9:6, 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:10-40:6:10" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Matthew 6:10</a>) Likewise, the world trumpets its purpose to give people peace, prosperity, and good government by means of a so-called new world order. But God’s purposes and those of the world are not the same. Jehovah’s purpose is to vindicate himself as the Supreme Sovereign of the universe. This he will do by means of a heavenly government that will obliterate all earthly governments. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:44-27:2:44" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Daniel 2:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:4:11-66:4:11" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Revelation 4:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:10-66:12:10" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 12:10</a>) So God has nothing in common with this world. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:36-43:18:36" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 18:36;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:15-62:2:17" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 John 2:15-17</a>) That is why the Bible speaks of two kinds of wisdom​—“the wisdom of God” and “the wisdom of the world.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:20-46:1:21" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 1:20, 21</a>.</p>

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 3. Though the wisdom of the world may seem impressive, why would man’s promised new world order never be satisfying?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>To those not guided by the wisdom of God, the wisdom of the world seems impressive. There are lofty-sounding worldly philosophies that captivate the mind. Thousands of institutions of higher learning impart information from what many consider the greatest minds of mankind. Extensive libraries are replete with the accumulated knowledge of centuries of human experience. Despite this, however, the new world order that worldly rulers propose could only be a rule by imperfect, sin-stained, dying men. Hence, that order would be imperfect, repeating many past <span id="page20" class="pageNum" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>blunders and never satisfying all of mankind’s needs.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:10-45:3:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Romans 3:10-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 5:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Man’s proposed new world order is subject not only to human frailty but also to the influence of wicked spirit creatures​—yes, Satan the Devil and his demons. Satan has blinded the minds of the people so that they do not believe “the glorious good news about the Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:3-47:4:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:3, 4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:12-49:6:12" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Ephesians 6:12</a>) Consequently, the world suffers one disorder after another. It fights and bleeds in its disastrous attempt to govern itself without God’s help and without regard for the divine will. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:10:23-24:10:23" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Jeremiah 10:23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:15-59:3:16" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> James 3:15, 16</a>) Thus, as the apostle Paul said, “the world through its wisdom did not get to know God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:21-46:1:21" data-bid="10-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 1:21</a>.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>What, then, is the basic flaw of this world’s wisdom, including its plans for a new world order? It is that the world ignores what can never successfully be ignored​—the supreme sovereignty of Jehovah God. It arrogantly refuses to recognize divine sovereignty. The world purposely leaves Jehovah out of all its calculations and relies upon its own ability and schemes. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:4:31-27:4:34" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Daniel 4:31-34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:37-43:18:37" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> John 18:37</a>.) The Bible makes it clear that “the fear of Jehovah is the start of wisdom.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:9:10-20:9:10" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Proverbs 9:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:111:10-19:111:10" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Psalm 111:10</a>) Yet, the world has not even learned this basic requirement of wisdom. Without divine backing, therefore, how can it succeed?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:127:1-19:127:1" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 127:1</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>On the other hand, those who know God display the wisdom of God and choose to be guided by it. As Jesus foretold, they are preaching “this good news of the kingdom . . . in all the inhabited earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 28:19, 20</a>) Is such preaching practical <em>now, </em>when our earth is filled with strife, pollution, poverty, and human suffering? To worldly-wise ones such preaching about God’s Kingdom seems to be sheer foolishness, lacking practicality. They view the preachers of God’s Kingdom as barnacles that weigh down the ship of State and slow its progress toward ideal political government. In this they are backed by Christendom’s clergy, who preach according to this world’s wisdom and do not tell the people what they need to know about God’s new world and its Kingdom government, even though this was Christ’s principal teaching.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:17-40:4:17" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 4:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:14-41:1:15" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Mark 1:14, 15</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Historian H. G. Wells called attention to this failure of Christendom’s clergy. He wrote: “Remarkable is the enormous prominence given by Jesus to the teaching of what he called the Kingdom of Heaven, and its comparative insignificance in the procedure and teaching of most of the Christian churches.” Yet, if people of this generation are to gain life, they must first hear about God’s established Kingdom, and to that end someone must preach the good news about it.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:14-45:10:15" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Romans 10:14, 15</a>.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Preaching God’s good news, then, is the most practical thing to do today. This is so because the Kingdom message provides a genuine hope that fills human hearts with rejoicing during these last days when ‘critical times hard to deal with are here.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:12-45:12:12" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Romans 12:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:2:13-56:2:13" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> Titus 2:13</a>) <span id="page21" class="pageNum" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>Whereas life in this world is uncertain and short, life in God’s new world will be everlasting, amid joy, plenty, and peace right here on earth.

Such an individual’s present enjoyment of material things has been futile, vain, and fleeting.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:26-40:16:26" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matthew 16:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:1:14-21:1:14" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Ecclesiastes 1:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:10:29-41:10:30" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> Mark 10:29, 30</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>One man whom Jesus invited to be his follower said: “Permit me first to leave and bury my father.” What did Jesus advise him to do? Knowing that the man would be postponing a most vital work simply to wait until his parents lived out the rest of their natural lives, Jesus replied: “Let the dead bury their dead, but you go away and declare abroad the kingdom of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:9:59-42:9:60" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Luke 9:59, 60</a>) Those who show wisdom by obeying Christ cannot turn aside from fulfilling their commission to preach the Kingdom message.

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Saul of Tarsus, who became Paul the apostle of Jesus Christ, took up this life-saving work. Is it reasonable to think that when Jesus Christ converted Saul, He was assigning him to engage in a foolish activity? Paul did not think so. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:16-50:2:16" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Philippians 2:16</a>) At that time the Greeks were considered to be the most intellectual people of the world.

Because such wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> Paul sought divine wisdom, which moved him to preach the good news from house to house. The greatest Preacher of all time, Jesus Christ, had set the example and had instructed him to do the same work.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:43-42:4:43" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Luke 4:43;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:20-44:20:21" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Acts 20:20, 21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:26:15-44:26:20" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> 26:15-20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:16-46:9:16" data-bid="25-4" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 9:16</a>.</p>

For the speech about the torture stake [Jesus’ ransom sacrifice] is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is God’s power. For it is written: ‘I will <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>make the wisdom of the wise men perish, and the intelligence of the intellectual men I will shove aside.’ Where is the wise man [such as the philosopher]?

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Incredible as it may seem, the very ones the world calls foolish are those whom Jehovah uses as his preachers. Yes, through the foolishness of the ministry of these preachers, God saves those who believe. Jehovah arranges matters so that preachers of this “foolishness” cannot glorify themselves, and other humans cannot rightly glorify those through whom they have heard the good news. This is so that “no flesh might boast in the sight of God.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:28-46:1:31" data-bid="27-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 1:28-31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:6-46:3:7" data-bid="27-2" class="b"> 3:6, 7</a>) True, the preacher plays an important role, but the message that he has been commissioned to preach is what works toward a person’s salvation if he believes it. Those who want “the wisdom from above” will not despise the message of the preacher because he seems to be foolish and lowly, is persecuted, and goes from house to house. Instead, the meek ones will respect a Kingdom proclaimer as a preacher commissioned by Jehovah and coming in God’s name.

Because a foolish thing of God is wiser than men, and a weak thing of God is stronger than men. For you behold his calling of you, brothers, that not many wise in a fleshly way were called, not many powerful, not many of noble birth; but God chose the foolish things of the world, that he might put the wise men to shame; and God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put the strong things to shame.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:22-46:1:27" data-bid="29-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 1:22-27</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:8-23:55:9" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:8, 9</a>.</p>

Soon, Jehovah God will vindicate his universal sovereignty and bring everlasting life to all those now believing and acting on “the foolishness of what is preached.”</p>

<div id="fn1" class="fcc"><p id="p25" data-pid="25">Despite all the philosophical debates and investigations of the wise men of ancient Greece, their writings show that they found no genuine basis for hope. Professors J. R. S. Sterrett and Samuel Angus point out: “No literature contains more pathetic laments over the sorrows of life, the passing of love, the deceitfulness of hope, and the ruthlessness of death.”​—<em>Funk and Wagnalls New “Standard” Bible Dictionary, </em>1936, page 313.</p></div>

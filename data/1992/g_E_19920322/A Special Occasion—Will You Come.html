<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">AS OPPRESSED slaves in Egypt over 3,500 years ago, the Israelites were in dire need of deliverance. But Pharaoh refused to let his slaves go. So Jehovah God had the Israelites kill a lamb and sprinkle its blood on the doorposts and lintels of their houses. That very night His angel <em>passed over </em>the houses that had blood on the doorposts but killed the firstborn sons in the houses of all the Egyptians. At that Pharaoh let the Israelites go free. Ever since then, on the anniversary date of when the angel <em>passed over </em>the Israelite homes, Jews have celebrated this event.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Later, Jesus Christ appeared on the earthly scene. One day John the Baptizer, who had baptized Jesus, pointed to him and said: “See, the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world!” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:29-43:1:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 1:29</a>) As the blood of the Passover lamb meant deliverance for the Israelite firstborn, so Christ’s poured-​out blood can deliver from sin and death.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Jesus instituted a meal to memorialize his sacrificial death. He handed his faithful apostles bread and said: “Take, eat. This means my body.” Then he gave them a cup of wine and said: “Drink out of it, all of you; for this means my ‘blood of the covenant,’ which is to be poured out in behalf of many for forgiveness of sins.” Also, Jesus said: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:26:26-40:26:28" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 26:26-28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:22:19-42:22:20" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Luke 22:19, 20</a>) So Jesus meant for it to be an annual observance of his death.</p>

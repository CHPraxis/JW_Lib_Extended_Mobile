Welcome to the “Light Bearers” District Conventions
THE very first of the creative days saw the creation of light in regard to earth. We read that Jehovah God said: “Let light come to be.” And “then there came to be light.” (Genesis 1:3) That is consistent with what the apostle John wrote: “God is light and there is no darkness at all in union with him.”​—1 John 1:5.
Since God’s Son is in union with his Father, it is not surprising that Jesus once said: “I am the world’s light.” (John 9:5) We can come out of darkness and into the light by putting faith in Jehovah God and in his Son. Jesus also testified: “I have come as a light into the world, in order that everyone putting faith in me may not remain in the darkness.” (John 12:46) Rightly, therefore, Jesus Christ said of his true followers: “You are the light of the world. . . . Let your light shine before men, that they may see your fine works and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens.”​—Matthew 5:14, 16.
What a blessing it is to have the truth, the understanding of God’s Word as made clear by “the faithful and discreet slave”! (Matthew 24:45-47) No more are we mystified by belief in a Trinity; no more are we perplexed as to why an almighty and loving God allows wickedness and violence; no more are we in doubt as to the condition of the dead. The light has given us hope, the Kingdom hope. It has revealed to us what a marvelous God the Creator is. The light of truth has given us purpose in life, to serve the purpose for which we were created in the first place, to glorify our Maker, Jehovah God. This we do by being bearers of the light. Being light bearers is a great honor and privilege, but it is also a serious responsibility. To do justice to that obligation, we need to make use of all the help that Jehovah provides. So how fitting that our 1992 district conventions should be termed the “Light Bearers” District Conventions!
To improve both our skills and our appreciation of our role as light bearers, we will want to attend at least one of these conventions, being on hand for the opening song and remaining until the concluding prayer. And we will want to pay close attention to all that is said on the platform, be it in talks, interviews, experiences, or a drama. Taking notes not only gives us something to refer to afterward to refresh our memories but greatly helps us to concentrate on what is being presented. Yes, all during the convention program, we will want to ‘pay attention to how we listen.’​—Luke 8:18.

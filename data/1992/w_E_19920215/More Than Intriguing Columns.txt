More Than Intriguing Columns
Visitors are intrigued by columns in the Mediterranean Sea at Caesarea, an ancient port on Israel’s coast. Herod the Great built this harbor and named the city in honor of Caesar Augustus.
Archaeologists have uncovered much of the city, including its large amphitheater. They have also gone underwater to gain insight into how the harbor complex was built along the sandy shore.
The New York Times (January 8, 1991) reported the discovery of columns in the remains of a palace that formerly jutted out into the sea. These are special in that inscriptions on them name some Roman governors who were not previously known. The “curator” of ships is also mentioned, which “is the first inscription ever found that relates to the harbor.”
Bible students know that the apostle Paul sailed into this harbor at the conclusion of two missionary tours. Here he stayed with Philip the evangelizer, and his experiences must have greatly encouraged the disciples. (Acts 18:21, 22; 21:7, 8, 16) We can read many of these thrilling experiences in the Bible book Acts of Apostles.
So these columns along the shore are not just worthless historical relics. They call to the minds of Christians their early brothers, who actively spread good news in harbors and out “to the most distant part of the earth.”​—Acts 1:8.

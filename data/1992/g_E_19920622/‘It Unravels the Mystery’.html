<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Trinity has been called a mystery, but a reader from Australia says the brochure <em>Should You Believe in the Trinity? </em>“unravels the mystery and puts it to final rest.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In New York a former teacher in the Roman Catholic Church’s Confraternity of Christian Doctrine program said that she wished this brochure had been available decades ago. For 15 years, she says, she stood before classes of 30 to 35 students, from 7 to 12 years old, “drawing a three-​leaf shamrock to teach them about the Trinity​—three petals for three different Persons, each God, in one stem, making one God! Yet that was what the nuns and priest told us to do,” she writes.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I was troubled about it then,” she continues. “Now I have the true answers and facts from God’s own Word. How I wish I could gather to me all the young ones I taught and show them the truth about all these things!”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Many have greatly appreciated this scholarly, well-​documented brochure on the Trinity, which remains a fundamental teaching of most churches of Christendom. Among the brochure’s numerous quotations is that from <em>The New Encyclopædia Britannica, </em>which observes: “Neither the word Trinity nor the explicit doctrine appears in the New Testament.”</p>

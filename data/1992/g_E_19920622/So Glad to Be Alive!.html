<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“I AM so glad to be alive!” enthused Bernice, a healthy nine-​year-​old girl who lives in southern Germany. She has special reason to rejoice.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One day while Bernice was developing in her mother’s womb, her sister became sick. She had German measles! The mother was terrified, as this contagious disease can be passed on to an unborn baby during pregnancy and can cause serious disabilities in the child.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">After examining blood specimens, the doctor reacted swiftly with a strong recommendation to terminate the pregnancy. Based on the blood analysis, he had no doubt that both the mother and the unborn child had German measles. Also, the tests indicated that there was a high probability that the baby would be born grossly deformed.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The parents, however, believed abortion to be against God’s laws. As Jehovah’s Witnesses, they refused to accept such a procedure. Nonetheless, the doctor insisted, painting a ghastly picture of what their refusal could lead to. He pointed to the problems associated with bringing up a severely disabled child. But the parents were resolute, explaining their Biblical viewpoint on abortion. They were prepared to face whatever situation might arise and to love the child regardless of what might happen.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The doctor was deeply impressed. He admitted that he himself was not in favor of abortion, believing it to be morally wrong. But he was obliged to present the facts and the consequences very clearly.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Nine years later, Bernice, a normal and healthy child, had to visit a doctor. An analysis of her blood disclosed that she had never had German measles. Apparently, the diagnosis made before her birth had been erroneous. How good it was that the parents remained firm in their belief! No wonder Bernice can say: “I am so glad to be alive!”</p>

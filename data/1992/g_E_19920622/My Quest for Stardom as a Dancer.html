<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">I HAD just turned 12 when I made my debut as a dancer in my hometown of Rome, Italy. That was in 1945, right after the second world war.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Just imagine how it was for a child who had seen and felt the effects of that frightening slaughter to get up on the dance floor and do just what she liked doing most​—dance! I was thrilled!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">From dancing in chorus lines, I moved eventually to becoming a solo dancer. I specialized in Afro-​Cuban, Oriental, and Hawaiian styles, but I also did various rumbas, cha-​chas, tangos, boogie-​woogies, and other dances in vogue at the time.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Dancing opened the doors to fascinating new worlds for me. In the 1950’s, for example, I appeared in well-​known films, including <em>War and Peace </em>and <em>Quo Vadis. </em>It was a thrill to work with celebrities such as Elizabeth Taylor, May Britt, Eleanora Rossi Drago, Robert Taylor, Valentina Cortese, and Gabriele Ferzetti.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>Achieving “Success”</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In my quest for success, I traveled from one end of the world to the other, visiting Aden, Yemen; Cape Town, South Africa; London, England; Bangkok, Thailand; Tehran, Iran; and various cities in Australia. Success had finally come. While I was yet 19, I was enjoying the so-​called beautiful world.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The exhausting training and the harsh treatment I went through to keep in form and remain physically attractive were very difficult. However, when I thought of the success that I had already achieved and my goal of becoming even more famous, I readily accepted such rigors.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In the circles in which I traveled, wealthy and respected people rubbed shoulders with thieves, drug pushers, and mafiosi. It was an unimaginably immoral world, a world saturated with <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>drugs, alcohol, immorality, and violence. But that was of little concern to me at the time. My life centered on dancing and a luxurious life-​style of expensive cars, jewelry, clothes, and famous hotels.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">Although I made plenty of money, most of it ended up in the pockets of my managers. To maintain the standard of living I had become accustomed to, I found a daytime job as a cashier. And sad to say, I stooped to violating my principles and engaged in immoral activity.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="ss"><strong>My Return Home</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">In 1965, after enjoying considerable professional success abroad, I decided to return to Italy to devote myself to becoming a truly great dancer of our time. I thought my experience and reputation abroad would open doors for me at home. Instead, I experienced stinging disillusionment. The road to success seemed suddenly blocked.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">In time, I began performing in squalid nightclubs and discos. I felt alone, trapped in a corrupt environment and forced to give in to all sorts of threats and violence. I had two abortions and almost died. What a price to pay for my foolish quest for success! When I had reached rock bottom, I found something that has made my life a real success.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="ss"><strong>A Momentous Day in My Life</strong></p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">It was a summer afternoon in 1980, and I was on my way to the swimming pool near my apartment in the province of Alessandria. There I met a friend, who made a strange request. “Will you accompany me to a Bible study that I am having with one of Jehovah’s Witnesses?” she asked.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">“Jehovah? And who is Jehovah?” I wanted to know.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">“Jehovah is God’s name,” she answered.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">An animated conversation followed that made me forget all about swimming. I drove my friend to visit the Witness lady, and I asked if I could join the Bible study. I imagined I would find a mysterious atmosphere, perhaps some guru or holy person performing strange and macabre rites in suffused light. Instead, I found myself in a normal house before an ordinary woman who very courteously invited us in. The study was in the third chapter of the book <em>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life, </em>entitled “Who Is God?”</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">Learning that God has a personal name and that the name of God is “Jehovah” was an extraordinary revelation to me. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:83:18-19:83:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 83:18</a>) I thought to myself, ‘If the churches have hidden even the name of God, who knows what other truths they may have hidden!’ I asked the Witness how much her lessons cost and was very surprised to learn that they were free. In the world I lived in, nobody did anything for nothing. I was encouraged to begin a study of the Bible.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="ss"><strong>Making Changes</strong></p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">I had little free time because of my work schedule​—I was still fulfilling dance engagements in various cities. Yet, I couldn’t wait for this lady to come and visit me so that I could learn more about the true God, Jehovah. Besides learning that God has a name, I discovered that Jesus and God are not the same person. They are not part of a Trinity. I also discovered how wrong I was to think that God was dead! Instead, I now began to <span id="page14" class="pageNum" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>become acquainted with a real Person, a God who is alive and who is accomplishing things!</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">I finally found the will to live! How grateful I am to Jehovah! I began to attend all the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses. There I gained a better understanding of the marvelous qualities of this loving and merciful God. This was very comforting to me, considering the kind of life I had led. Seeing the calm serenity on the faces of those at the meetings in the Kingdom Hall, I realized I had found a truly beautiful world, and I was determined never to leave it.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:133:1-19:133:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 133:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">However, I began to realize that if I wanted to live in that world, I would have to make some big changes in my life. After attending a convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses and hearing Bible principles clearly explained, I firmly decided I would modify my life. I quit dancing, which until then had been my great joy in life. I left the man I had been living with for the previous six years and completely severed all links with my past life and the corrupt show-​business environment. I also destroyed addresses and mementos of impresarios and so-​called friends.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="ss"><strong>A New Life</strong></p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">At this point, I was out of work and homeless, yet I was learning to put my full trust in Jehovah. Since I was in financial need, I sold my valuable things​—car, fur coats, jewelry—​the things I thought symbolized real success in life. For secular work, I began scrubbing the stairs of apartment blocks and doing cleaning for families. I have discovered that real success in life is measured, not by possessions or position, but only by whether one has the blessing of Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">On April 23, 1983, I was baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. There were no photographers surrounding me that day, only fellow Witnesses who were happy to welcome a new praiser of Jehovah to their midst. Soon afterward I left for Australia to help my brother learn the marvelous things I had learned. Even though he and his children did not share my enthusiasm for Bible truth, my stay in Australia turned out to be very fruitful.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">I was soon able to enter the full-​time ministry as a pioneer and found many Italians living in Australia who showed an interest in the Bible. In time, I was conducting many progressive Bible studies. Then, in 1985, I moved back to Italy. At first I had difficulty getting settled in, but now I have a small apartment and live on a pension, which allows me to serve as a full-​time minister and attend all congregation meetings.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">For many years I desired success in dancing more than anything else. I thought that glory and fame were everything. I tried to imitate worldly idols. How different everything is now! Of course, dancing is something wonderful, but now I have discovered that real success in life comes in helping others learn about the marvelous promises of Jehovah God, not in living for personal glory.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sb">I confidently await the fulfillment of the marvelous promise: “Hope in Jehovah and keep his way, and he will exalt you to take possession of the earth. When the wicked ones are cut off, you will see it.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:34-19:37:34" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 37:34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 2 Peter 3:13</a>)​—<em>As told by Edvige Sordelli.</em></p>

Is There a Solution?
Man’s insatiable curiosity drives him to expend energy, money, materials, and even lives in his quest for knowledge of the universe. While interplanetary travel is the immediate goal for some, for others the challenge is the earth itself. Crime, violence, and war reap lives on a daily basis. Man ruins the earth and creates an ecological imbalance with his pollution and commercial exploitation of its finite resources. The earth’s “lungs,” its forests, are being denuded. Earth’s water is being poisoned and wasted. Is there a viable solution to these problems? Awake! is dedicated to bringing to your attention God’s solution as found in the Bible.

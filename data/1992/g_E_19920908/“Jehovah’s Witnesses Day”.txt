“Jehovah’s Witnesses Day”
JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES enjoy gathering together in large numbers several times during the year. They assemble to learn about God and his righteous principles. These meetings are also excellent opportunities for encouraging association with fellow Christians.​—Hebrews 10:24, 25.
What sort of impact do these large groups of Witness visitors have on the cities selected for these assemblies? Of course, there is a financial benefit to the local economy. But there is also the impact of “their example of spiritual dedication and personal decorum,” as stated in a proclamation issued by the mayor of the city of Gainesville, Georgia, U.S.A.
This official document stated in part: “WHEREAS, the Jehovah’s Witnesses have been meeting at the Georgia Mountains Center on an average of 14 weekends annually for the past 11 years, with the attendance at each session averaging 2,200 persons; and . . . this ‘great cloud of Witnesses’ has surely given an inspiring testimony of faith and dedication to all who have observed it:
“NOW, THEREFORE, I, Emily D. Lawson, Mayor of the City of Gainesville, hereby proclaim Saturday, November 23, 1991, as ‘JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES DAY’ in Gainesville; calling upon all citizens to recognize and extend a warm welcome to these visitors, and to seek to emulate their example of spiritual dedication and personal decorum, at every opportunity this weekend and in the future.”

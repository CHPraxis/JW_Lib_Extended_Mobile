<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Have you been using some of the introductions suggested in the <em>Reasoning </em>book or those appearing in recent issues of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry? </em>Many publishers are reporting greater success in their house-​to-​house ministry by using these opening remarks word-​for-​word as they appear in print. Others have found that by taking just a little more time in preparation for the field ministry, they have been able to formulate opening remarks in their own words but based on the wording of the printed suggestions.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>One thing is certain, and that is if you have your opening remarks well in mind before approaching someone with the Kingdom message, you will feel more comfortable and be more confident. Your expressions will reflect your sincere desire to share the good news. Your being well prepared makes your ministry more enjoyable because you will get better results. Of greatest importance is that we make our sacrifice of service the best we can offer.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:15-58:13:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 13:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:5-60:2:5" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1 Pet. 2:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>So take time to prepare. Consider the type of people you are likely to meet in your local territory. What are their worries and concerns? What current events are affecting their lives? After reflecting on the answers to these questions, look over the opening remarks suggested on <a class="xt" data-xtid="18" href="jwpub://p/E:1101989202/1-64$p/E:1101989203/">pages 9-15 of the <em>Reasoning</em></a> book or select one or more of the opening remarks from <em>Our Kingdom Ministry. </em>Feel free to modify or adjust the exact wording so that you feel comfortable with it. The next step would be to get other publishers to go over your opening remarks with you in a practice session. Perhaps this will encourage the others to improve their opening remarks also. At any rate, you will certainly be encouraging one another and be building one another up in fine works.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>The time and effort you spend in preparing your field presentations will be rewarded. You may be blessed to have a more effective share in the exciting ingathering work now under way.</p>

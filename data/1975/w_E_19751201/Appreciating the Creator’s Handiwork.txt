Appreciating the Creator’s Handiwork
◆ “I shall laud you because in a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made.” (Ps. 139:14) Commenting on these words, the book The Common Cold (by Fabricant and Conklin) says: “This verse of David the Psalmist applies with rich emphasis to the study of the anatomy and physiology of the nose, the throat, the lungs, and the parts thereof. No human inventor could ever have conceived of so complex and curious a maze of bones, cartilage, tendons, tissues, membranes, passages, pockets, tubes, and glands as exists in the respiratory tracts of the least as well as of the greatest of men. In one thing are all people approximately equal and that is in their bodies and its parts, the vehicle of the conscious being.”

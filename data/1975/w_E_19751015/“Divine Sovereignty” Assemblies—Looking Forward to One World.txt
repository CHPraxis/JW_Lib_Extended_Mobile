“Divine Sovereignty” Assemblies​—Looking Forward to One World
The public talk “One World, One Government, Under God’s Sovereignty,” presented on the preceding pages, was the Sunday-afternoon feature at 98 assemblies held throughout the United States during June-August 1975. At these assemblies the unity of worship and service of the Christian witnesses of Jehovah of all races and walks of life provided a foretaste of the harmony and peacefulness that God’s Kingdom government will bring to mankind during the thousand-year rule of Jesus Christ

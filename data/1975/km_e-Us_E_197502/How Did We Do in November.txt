How Did We Do in November?
In addition to reaching a fine new peak in publishers during November, the grand total of 5,825 were baptized. This brings the total immersed this service year to 15,000. Last year for the same period of time there were 14,025. Thus we are enjoying a 7-percent increase in the number baptized so far this service year. How thrilling it is for all of us to be having a share in Kingdom-preaching and the disciple-making work!

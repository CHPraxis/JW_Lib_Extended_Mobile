<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">New Peak 554,257 Publishers!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Jehovah’s organization is on the move. This is evident in many ways: Its understanding of God’s Word grows brighter year by year. The way the congregations function has been brought into closer conformity with the Scriptures. And, as foretold in the Bible, the rate of ingathering of new disciples has been tremendously accelerated; another new peak, 554,257 publishers, reported in the United States in November!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:17-23:60:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isa. 60:17,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:60:22-23:60:22" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 22</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>What about us as individuals? Are we moving ahead with the organization? It surely is what all of us want to do. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:15-54:4:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:15</a>) If we are newly associated, this means reaching forward toward Christian maturity. “Maturity” comes from a Greek word that means full-grown, complete. It involves acceptance of the <em>full range </em>of Christian truth. It means no longer holding back in any way with respect to pure worship. It also involves experience, that is, learning “to distinguish both right and wrong.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:14-58:5:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 5:14</a>) Those who are mature are not always asking someone else to make decisions that they should be making for themselves. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:5-48:6:5" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Gal. 6:5</a>) But does this mean that a mature person has all the answers? No. A mature person continues to learn and to apply God’s Word. Thus maturity, instead of marking the end of progress, makes it easier to move ahead with Jehovah’s organization.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>From a spiritual point of view, are you on the move with your brothers and sisters throughout the earth? In many respects, no doubt, you are. But are there areas in your life needing further attention, such as personal study and commenting at meetings? What about the matter of making greater application of Jehovah’s Word in the day-to-day affairs of life? This is something that offers opportunities for progress for all of us, isn’t it?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Can you also see evidence of progress in your personal field service? All who have continued to share in it over a period of time with reliance on Jehovah can see such advancement. But perhaps you discern that there are more forward steps that you personally could take. For example, do you actually use the Scriptures in your field service when appropriate? During the <em>Watchtower </em>campaign you will find helpful in this regard the prominently featured scripture in the first article of each issue of <em>The Watchtower.</em></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>If you are sharing in the house-to-house service, is there still room for advancement? Well, are you calling back to instruct those who, in some way, manifest interest in the good news? Rarely does anyone simply read a piece of literature that has been placed with him and, without any personal help, begin attending meetings and sharing in the field service. Rather, is it not necessary to return and regularly visit the individual to help him to progress to spiritual maturity? We encourage you, with full reliance on Jehovah, to share regularly in this work. Perhaps you are making return visits on your placements and expired-subscription slips. Do you also study with interested persons? This should be our goal. It is not difficult. More than anything else, it requires a willingness to be used by Jehovah in this manner, coupled with preparation.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>When we think back on what our lives were before we learned the truth, we realize that, because we have responded to Jehovah’s loving encouragement, every one of us has certainly moved ahead. And we want to continue to do so, right on into his new order, now so near.</p>

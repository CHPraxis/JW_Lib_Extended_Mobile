<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sh">Dear Kingdom Publishers:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Bethel family is really having many blessings. Every morning at the breakfast table we have been reading from the new <em>Yearbook, </em>and thoroughly enjoying it. Besides that, in connection with our family study on Monday evening, we are all having the privilege of benefiting from the study material provided for elders who attend the Kingdom Ministry School.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Already work is under way here in preparation for the special activity in April. We have had a peek at the material for the special issue of <em>Awake! </em>for April 8. It features the timely subject “The Answer to Mankind’s Problems.” And the April 15 issue of <em>The Watchtower </em>will carry the special public talk that is to be given on March 30 on the subject “‘Who Is Jehovah,’ so that All Should Worship Him?” Both of these magazines are to be given wide distribution.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">A special distribution is planned in connection with the April 15 issue of <em>The Watchtower. </em>Many people with whom we conduct Bible studies will have heard the public talk and may wish they could share the information with others. The Society would like to make a gift of three free copies of that issue of <em>The Watchtower </em>to each individual or household with whom a Bible study is being conducted, with the encouragement for them to give those magazines to other persons who they believe will read them. You do not need to order these additional copies of the magazines for those with whom you conduct Bible studies; the Society will consign them. But be sure to order extra copies for your own use in the field service.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">It is a pleasure for us here at Bethel to be working alongside you as we all continue to make advancement in our service to God.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Be assured of our warm Christian love.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sj">Your brothers,</p>

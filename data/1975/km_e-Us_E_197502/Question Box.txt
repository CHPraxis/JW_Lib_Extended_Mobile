Question Box
● To what extent may ministerial servants be assigned to care for parts on the platform in congregation meetings?
There are many things that they can be invited to do, depending on local needs and their personal ability. Some who do well on the platform may be assigned as chairmen at public meetings. Any who are fluent readers, having good pronunciation and sense stress, may be invited to read at the Watchtower study. Ministerial servants may present appropriate portions on service meetings. Certain ones who have cultivated good ability as teachers from the platform may be asked to give instruction talks. Those who demonstrate notable teaching ability and who can hold the interest of an audience for longer talks may be invited to give public talks in their home congregation; and even in other congregations, if specific request is made for them to do so.
Of course, one’s being a ministerial servant does not automatically qualify one for these assignments. Much depends on the abilities that he has cultivated and the needs of the local congregation.
It is beneficial to have a variety of brothers serve the congregation from the platform, where this is possible. But quality of instruction should not be unduly sacrificed in doing so. Nevertheless, the fact is that many ministerial servants are fine speakers and it would be appropriate to make good use of their abilities on the meetings.

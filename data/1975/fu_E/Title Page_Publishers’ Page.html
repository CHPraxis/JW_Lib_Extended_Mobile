<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span id="page2" class="pageNum" data-no="2" data-before-text="2"></span>If you long for life under secure conditions, you will find what is set out in this booklet to be very encouraging. Besides your reading it, however, we believe that you will want to discuss the contents with a person who understands the Bible well, because these matters deeply affect the lives of all of us. This will enable you to see how the Bible itself answers your questions. Jehovah’s witnesses will be glad to demonstrate, free of charge, how beneficial such discussions can be.</p>

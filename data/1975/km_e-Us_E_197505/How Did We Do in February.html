<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The short month of February, with its usual adverse weather in various parts of the country and accompanying sickness, is behind us. Nonetheless, Jehovah has richly blessed our efforts. For example during the months of January and February, 234,299 new subscriptions were obtained. Also, from September through February of the 1974 service year, there were, on an average, 18,559 regular pioneers. However, the average from September through February of the current service year is 21,032. Very fine, indeed! And, during that same period, 59,935 others arranged to share in temporary pioneer service.</p>

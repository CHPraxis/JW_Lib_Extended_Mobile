Attend the “Divine Sovereignty” Assemblies
1 These will soon commence. Are you ready? Have you sent in your room request and volunteer service forms? Will your whole family attend? Are you taking any newly interested persons with you?
2 The program will begin on Thursday morning at 9:55. Arrange to be there then. Do not miss anything on the program. There will be immersion on Friday for those making a dedication; they should have gone over the eighty questions with the elders before convention time. Bathing suit and towel should be brought from home.
3 Arrange your schedule so you do not have to leave the convention prior to 3:50 p.m. on Sunday, when the convention closes. It has been arranged to end earlier this year for your convenience in traveling. Do not miss the public lecture “One World, One Government, Under God’s Sovereignty.” How many people can you invite to the public talk? There will be extensive handbill distribution in each assembly city for a few days prior to the assembly, so if you can arrive there early, you may share in this witness work. Talk to people where you stay during the assembly and invite them to come. Bring someone to the public lecture if you can.
4 Give a good witness by what you say and do. Allow everyone a chance to have a seat. Elderly ones long in the truth cannot always get there early to find a seat. Please do not block off large sections of seating. Consider others and their happiness. Seats not occupied when the program begins should be made available to any who may be standing up.
5 Good spiritual things are being prepared. Do your utmost to be there.

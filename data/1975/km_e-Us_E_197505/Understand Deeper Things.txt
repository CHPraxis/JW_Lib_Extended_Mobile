Understand Deeper Things
1 How grateful we are for spiritual food! Since learning the truth, we have enjoyed the primary doctrine about Christ, but as dedicated servants of God we need to cultivate an appetite for solid food if we are to continue to grow spiritually. (1 Cor. 2:10; Heb. 5:14; 6:1; 2 Pet. 2:16) One provision for understanding deeper things is the congregation book study. Much of the material is more than elementary and requires effort on our part to dig into it to grasp the meaning.
2 All of us in the truth in 1971 enjoyed studying the ‘Know Jehovah’ book after its release that year. But from 1972 through 1974 there were 654,985 who were baptized and became part of Jehovah’s organization. What a fine thing it will be for these many new brothers to study this book with us.
3 In addition to attending regularly, it is recommended that we carefully prepare our lesson each week before going to the book study, with a view to participating in the study.
4 When you finish the “Eternal Purpose” book you can look forward to studying the ‘Know Jehovah’ book. In our study, we will take up selected portions of the ‘Know Jehovah’ book, as listed below. No set number of pages must be covered in any one study, but we estimate that it will take about six months to complete this material: p. 35 ¶1 to p. 50 ¶34; p. 54 ¶1 to p. 62 ¶17; p. 69 ¶32 to p. 72 ¶38; p. 74 ¶5 to p. 78 ¶15; p. 81 ¶22 to p. 82 ¶25; p. 85 ¶29 to p. 91 ¶44; p. 95 ¶9 to p. 113 ¶51; p. 127 ¶34 to p. 141 ¶67; p. 144 ¶8 to p. 162 ¶47; p. 165 ¶9 to p. 166 ¶12; p. 173 ¶27 to p. 176 ¶33; p. 237 ¶1 to p. 243 ¶16; p. 250 ¶35 to p. 255 ¶46; p. 278 ¶1 to p. 292 ¶37; p. 293 ¶1 to p. 308 ¶40; p. 349 ¶1 to p. 406 ¶17.
5 We are sure that you will enjoy studying the ‘Know Jehovah’ book during the coming months.

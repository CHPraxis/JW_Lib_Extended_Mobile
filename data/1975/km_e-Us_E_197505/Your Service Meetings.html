<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>12 min: </strong>Song 92. Introductory comments and points from Branch Letter.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>25 min: </strong>‘Advertise the King and the Kingdom.’ Have certain book study groups prepared to comment on these points. Discuss the importance of zealously proclaiming the “good news.” The <a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:301975003/66:789-205:260"><em>1975 Yearbook, </em>page 119, paragraph 2, to page 144, paragraph 2</a>, will provide the basis for their comments. The publishers can center their conversation around the following questions: (1) What developments in 1919 proved that Jehovah wanted his people to be busy in advertising the King and his Kingdom? (Pp. 120-122) (2) How was <em>The Golden Age </em>used to spread the “good news”? (Pp. 123-125) During the period from 1919 to 1921 what publications were used in bringing the Kingdom message to people’s homes? (Pp. 125-128) (3) In view of what happenings in connection with printing operations can we say that the use of literature in the field has had divine backing? (Pp. 128-130) (4) How did the second Cedar Point assembly serve as a grand stimulus for increased activity in door-to-door preaching? (Pp. 131-135) (5) How have Jehovah’s servants on earth been involved in the fulfillment of thrilling apocalyptic prophecies? (Pp. 135-139) (6) How was the radio used to advertise the King and the Kingdom? (Pp. 139-144) In concluding, emphasize that it is a marvelous privilege to share in the field service​—a work being done under angelic direction. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:6-66:14:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Rev. 14:6, 7</a>) This should certainly encourage us to continue zealously advertising the King and the Kingdom.</p>

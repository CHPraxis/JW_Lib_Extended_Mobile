Can You Talk With the Dead?
At death do humans only seem to die? Is there something about humans that survives death? And therefore can you talk with the dead?
These questions are answered authoritatively in the new 192-page book Is This Life All There Is? Only 25c, postpaid.
Please send the hardbound book Is This Life All There Is?; I enclose 25c.

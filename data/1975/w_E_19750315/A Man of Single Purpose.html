<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IN THE early morning hours of Thursday, January 23, 1975, John Otto Groh ended forty-one years of devoted service to Jehovah his God. To those of Jehovah’s witnesses who knew him, he will be remembered as a man of single purpose. He was born at Kulm, North Dakota, on July 3, 1906, and as a young man became a university-trained research metallurgist. Then, in April 1934, he was baptized and eight years later he and his wife Helen began devoting their full time to the publishing of the good news of God’s kingdom in the area of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They became members of the Brooklyn Bethel family in 1953, and Brother Groh in time became the chief purchaser for the Watchtower Society. He was a member of the world governing body of Jehovah’s witnesses. Many will also remember Brother Groh for the key part he played in supervising many large assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses in New York and elsewhere. At the Memorial service held in the Brooklyn Bethel Kingdom Hall numerous business acquaintances were among those present to hear about the happy hope that this friendly man of single purpose pursued. As the speaker on that occasion said, Brother Groh had come off victorious by his faithful course. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:15:57-46:15:57" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Cor. 15:57</a>) Of him, along with other anointed ones who complete their earthly assignment, it can be said: “For the things they did go right with them.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:13-66:14:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Rev. 14:13</a>.</p>

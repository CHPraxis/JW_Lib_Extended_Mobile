<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● Living things on earth depend on the sun in one way or another. Light, heat and energy from this mighty source are vital to the continued existence of earthly life. But how much solar energy is received by the earth? In his book <em>1001 Questions Answered About Astronomy, </em>James S. Pickering wrote: “The Earth receives only about one part in 2 billion of the energy that is produced by the Sun. This tiny fraction amounts to 4,690,000 horse power per square mile of the Earth’s surface.” It is just what is required for life on earth.</p>

One World, One Government, Under God’s Sovereignty
WILL IT NOT BE WONDERFUL when we have one united world of mankind under one righteous government over them all? What happy and joyful things this will mean for us all!
And to think of it—this is all to come within our generation! And over it will be the sovereignty of the Most High God, without which it could never come to existence or remain forever on earth.
What God’s sovereignty means in itself, and the blessings to flow from it to all mankind, are delightful things set forth in this booklet. We, the Publishers, are happy to make it available to you and your loved ones.

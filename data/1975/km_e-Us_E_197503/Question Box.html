<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>●  Are repentant wrongdoers “placed” or “put on” public or private reproof as if placed on probation?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">No. A reproof is a congregational <em>expression of disapproval </em>occasioned by a serious wrongdoing that could have led to the disfellowshiping of one of its baptized members if he had been unrepentant. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:20-54:5:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:20</a>: <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:10-56:1:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Titus 1:10-13</a>) Once that expression of disapproval is made, the reproof is complete. The individual does not enter a period of continued reprimand and so is not <em>under </em>reproof, “put on probation” as it were.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Why, then, are restrictions in effect? Serious sin committed by a member of the congregation manifests spiritual weakness on his part. As a person who is physically ill may be restricted from eating certain foods or from engaging in certain activities until his condition shows marked improvement, so a person who is spiritually weak may be relieved of certain responsibilities in the congregation until there is evidence of his regaining spiritual strength. The restrictions are to a large extent intended to help the repentant wrongdoer recover from spiritual weakness and to impress upon him the importance of respecting God’s holiness.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:7-48:6:9" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Gal. 6:7-9</a>; see <em>or, </em>p. 167.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">If a brother who has recently been reproved moves to another congregation, it is advisable to inform the elders of that congregation as to any restrictions that may be in effect. This will enable the elders in his new congregation to continue supervising the restoration of his privileges and to aid him toward full spiritual recovery. Of course, no announcement of such previous reproof is made in the new congregation. At all times elders should imitate the merciful way in which Jehovah dealt with his people even when discipline was needed.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:63:7-23:63:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isa. 63:7-9</a>.</p>

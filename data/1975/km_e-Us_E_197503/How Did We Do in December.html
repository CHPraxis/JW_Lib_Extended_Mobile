<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Good work was done! During December there were 1,132,293 bound books placed. That is more than two books for every publisher of the good news in this country. We were offering the <em>New World Translation </em>and <em>Is This Life All There Is? </em>You will be interested to know that, during the past year, 3,018,860 copies of the <em>New World Translation </em>in English were shipped from Brooklyn and, to date, 3,944,295 copies of the book <em>Is This Life All There Is? </em>have been shipped out.

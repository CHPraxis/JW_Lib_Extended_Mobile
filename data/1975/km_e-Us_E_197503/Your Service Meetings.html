<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sn"><strong>25 min: </strong>How Can We Help Our Brothers? Show vital role mercy plays in true worship. When seeing serious need of brothers, more required than merely expressing wish or even the faith that “things will work out all right.” True worship moves us to <em>act </em>on their behalf. Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:14-59:2:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">James 2:14-17</a> and then consider the following situations with the audience: (1) What could be done if a brother comes into great material need for reasons beyond his control, such as being out of work for an extended period or having to meet unexpected medical expenses? (<em>w </em>9/15/74, p. 570; <em>Organization </em>book, p. 149, par. 3) Show brothers how to avail themselves of governmental help. (Illustrate with relief measures for Malawian brothers in refugee camps. [<a class="xt" data-xtid="2" href="jwpub://p/E:301975000/19:98-22:519">yb75, p. 9</a>] After leaving Malawi much of their clothing wore out, and many had no money to buy new things. South African brothers responded, mailing parcels to camps. This proved very costly, but brothers in South Africa were willing to bear cost themselves. Relief funds contributed by brothers world wide were used too. Also, you may relate how brothers in Germany shared scant bread rations, often just crumbs. [<a class="xt" data-xtid="3" href="jwpub://p/E:301974005/233-237:368">yb74, p. 176</a>] Would we be willing to do that?) (2) If one of our brothers is sick, how could we show mercy to him? (<em>w </em>9/15/74, p. 570) Situations that could come up are: The mother may be in the hospital and the father may be working. Who will care for the children? An elderly sister living by herself may get very sick. (3) In the event a publisher dies, how could members of the congregation assist the rest of the family? (<em>w </em>9/15/70, p. 576; also show ways to help those who are lonely, in need of work, etc. [<em>Awake! </em>2/8/69, pp. 11, 12]) (4) When pressure from workmates, relatives or former friends tends to dishearten our brothers, what encouragement could be offered? (<em>w </em>2/15/68, p. 119, under “Personal Visits.” and <em>w </em>9/1/68, pp. 529, 530. Might point out briefly how daily text could be used to give encouragement.)</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sn"><strong>10 min: </strong>Concluding comments. Mention benefits of being united and interested in one another. We are living in critical days. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Tim. 3:1</a>) Brothers in Rome appreciated need to be concerned about their Christian brothers.

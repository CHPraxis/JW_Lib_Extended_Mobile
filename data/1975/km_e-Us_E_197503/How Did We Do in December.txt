How Did We Do in December?
Good work was done! During December there were 1,132,293 bound books placed. That is more than two books for every publisher of the good news in this country. We were offering the New World Translation and Is This Life All There Is? You will be interested to know that, during the past year, 3,018,860 copies of the New World Translation in English were shipped from Brooklyn and, to date, 3,944,295 copies of the book Is This Life All There Is? have been shipped out. Many people are hungering for the truth.

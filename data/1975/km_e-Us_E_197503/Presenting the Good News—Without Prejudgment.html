<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>All people are entitled to hear the “good news.” Jesus Christ died, not for just a few, but “for all.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:5:14-47:5:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Cor. 5:14</a>) We should be careful, therefore, not to prejudge people, thinking that it would be a waste of time to revisit them.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>True, there are people who may accept literature simply as a kind gesture. However, regardless of the attitude they might have on the initial call, we do not know the inclinations of their hearts nor can we be sure of the effect the literature may have on them. We may have seen and talked to the individual only once. So would it not be sad if our prejudgment caused a person to lose valuable time in getting started on the way to life?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Deep concern for fellow humans will also cause us to take note of people who manifest some interest in the Bible but accept no literature. When some interest is shown you can lay the basis for a return visit. Before leaving, you could mention that you would like to talk to the householder again, sharing additional points from the Bible with him. Try to determine what might be a good subject to talk about when you return. You could also find out when it would be best to call back. After you leave the house, note that information on your house-to-house record. To prepare yourself for the return visit, you could select scriptures from <em>Sermon Outlines, </em>a magazine article or a chapter from one of the books. You may need to make a number of calls to stimulate the householder’s interest sufficiently to want to study the Bible with you.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>While not all our efforts may bear fruit, we can rest assured that Jehovah is pleased with our imitating his concern for mankind. Moreover, at times the completely unexpected happens. Take the case of a woman in Martinique. During a period of some four and a half years she refused to listen to the Witnesses. When a sister who had often been turned away called with <em>Kingdom News, </em>the woman said: “I already told you so many times that I am not interested at all.” Replied the sister: “It is just to give you this tract that is being distributed world wide. It is very important. Please take it.” The woman did accept the tract. Concerned about the apparently “opposed” woman, the sister was anxious to find out what effect the tract might have had on her and returned two weeks later. Imagine her delight when, after being invited into the home, the woman agreed to have a Bible study. Now this woman is a zealous publisher. She often tells the sister: “If I had only known, I would have accepted it long ago. I lost so much time.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>We never know what might develop. Response may not be very enthusiastic on the initial call. Yet that can change. Something we said may cause the householder to think, or a point in the literature placed may stimulate his interest. Our genuinely friendly way may impress him. However, neglect due to our prejudgment could cause interest to diminish. That is why we have good reason to be diligent in our follow-up work, demonstrating our being in full harmony with Jehovah’s desire that “all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:2:4-54:2:4" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Tim. 2:4</a>.</p>

Come, Hear the Free Public Address:
One World, One Government, Under God’s Sovereignty
It is the principal talk of the four-day district assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses being held this summer in scores of cities in the United States, the British Isles and Canada. The assembly program also features helpful Bible discussions on practical matters of life, and four full-costume Bible dramas.
Contact the local Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses to find out where the nearest assembly will be held, or write the publishers of this magazine.

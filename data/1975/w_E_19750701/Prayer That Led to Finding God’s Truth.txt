Prayer That Led to Finding God’s Truth
◆ In Colombia a contractor prayed that God might use him in some way. When one of Jehovah’s witnesses, a missionary, and his ten-year-old companion called, the contractor listened attentively. Impressed by the boy’s Scriptural knowledge, the man agreed to study the Bible with the missionary. Soon thereafter he got rid of his books on spiritism, stopped smoking and then, after explaining to his wife what the Bible had to say on the matter of idolatry, threw out the images. Ten months after starting to study the Scriptures the man was baptized at a district assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses.

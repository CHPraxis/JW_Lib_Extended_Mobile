Fruit “Drinks” or Juices?
▪ Mothers once claimed that they bought “fruit drinks” for their families​—not genuine fruit juices—​because of their lower prices. Now that sugar costs have made the “drinks” almost as high in price as juice, it would seem that, even for economical reasons, juice would become much more popular. But not so. An article in Women’s Wear Daily quotes a vice-president of one large grocery chain as saying: “Dopey mothers insist on buying the drinks instead of the juices.”

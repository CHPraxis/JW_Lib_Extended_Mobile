<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">It was pleasurable to see 2,644 persons being baptized during September. Yes, there are still many honest-hearted individuals who want to serve Jehovah and who respond to our witnessing. Could we help more people to gain life by improving our share in field service? The September report shows a drop in the number of hours spent in the field, the books, magazines and subscriptions placed, the return visits made and the Bible studies conducted compared with the same month the previous year. Let us use our time wisely during the coming months so more lives will be saved to the honor of Jehovah God.</p>

How Do You View Confidential Matters?
1 As Christians we have many fine things that we can enjoy discussing-Scriptural points, experiences, conventions. Still, the Bible shows that some self-control is necessary regarding what we talk about. (Ps. 34:13; Prov. 10:19) We would not, for example, want to be slanderously spreading harmful talk or be one who indiscriminately tells everything he hears.​—Prov. 20:19.
2 We are open and honest people, not suspiciously secretive. But some matters are confidential and we should not discuss them without authorization. This may not be easy, for we might be tempted with the impulse to share with a friend a confidential matter we learned. Also, it takes discipline not to try to pry confidential information from others.​—Judg. 16:15-17.
3 What are some areas where this is so? Family: In the confidence of your family you may learn of a family member’s weakness or private plans. Yet, husband, wife and children should not publicly converse about everything that happens or is planned in the family. (Ps. 50:20) One aspect of family love is that one’s family members are trustworthy. This is something that parents can help children to learn. Employment: Revealing your employer’s business details or plans could cause him financial harm. Congregation: Elders maintain confidence about problems they handle, for if someone confided in an elder about a spiritual or family problem and he talked about it publicly, others might hesitate to seek help from any elder. (Jas. 5:13-16) Even if, out of curiosity, his wife or child asked, an elder should not reveal confidential congregational matters. Thus he avoids burdening his family with keeping confidence on such congregation matters. (Watchtower, April 1, 1971, pp. 222-224)
4 Having this view of confidential matters, we can concentrate on speech that is upbuilding, helpful.​—Prov. 25:9; 16:13.

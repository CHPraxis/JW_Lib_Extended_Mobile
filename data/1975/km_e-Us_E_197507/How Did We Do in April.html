<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">How wonderful to learn of the excellent number attending the Memorial this year​—1,248,641 in the United States! That is 66,529 more than the previous peak attendance of 1974. Partakers were 4,610​—down 97, or 2 percent, compared to last year. Our hope for the many new ones who attended Memorial is that they will continue to show appreciation for God’s mercy toward them.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Also, there were 20,205 more publishers than last April. Though not a new peak, it is a fine increase. Total subscriptions during the four-month <em>Watchtower </em>campaign came to 485,299. By making return visits on subscribers, likely many new Bible studies can be started.</p>

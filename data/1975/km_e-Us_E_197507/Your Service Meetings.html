Audience discussion. May read selected brief portions from <em>Thousand Years </em>(<em>ka</em>) book.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">(1) Since <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:1-40:24:51" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 24</a> applied in period up to 70 C.E., how do we know it has application now? (Prophecy of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:6:1-66:6:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Rev. 6:1-8</a>, written after 70 C.E., parallels <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:6-40:24:8" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matt. 24:6-8</a> and shows it has future application.) (<em>is </em>122-128) Jerusalem’s destruction was not worst catastrophe in history. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:21-40:24:21" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Matt. 24:21</a>: <a class="xt" data-xtid="2" href="jwpub://p/E:1101973026/33-33"><em>ka </em>304 par. 28;</a> w75 274. par. 10) “All the tribes of the earth” were not involved in 70 C.E. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:30-40:24:30" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matt. 24:30</a>; w75 273. par. 5) (2) Is the warning in vs. 23 merely repeating vss. 4, 5? (Applied after Jerusalem’s end, not before.) (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:20-40:24:22" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matt. 24:20-22</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="3" href="jwpub://p/E:1101973026/69-70"><em>ka </em>320, pars. 58, 59</a>) Disciples had no need to be misled, for presence would not be revealed to just a select few. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:24-40:24:27" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Matt. 24:24-27</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="4" href="jwpub://p/E:1101973026/71-72"><em>ka </em>320, 321, pars. 60, 61</a>) (3) How have heavens been darkened in our time? (Is a time of gloom, with no bright outlook for men in general.) (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:29-40:24:29" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matt. 24:29</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="5" href="jwpub://p/E:1101973026/80-80"><em>ka </em>324, par. 68</a>) Heavens no longer seem benign, but contain dangers (<a class="xt" data-xtid="6" href="jwpub://p/E:1101973026/82-82"><em>ka </em>325, par. 70;</a> w75 276. par. 18) (4)  Has “sign of the Son of man” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:30-40:24:30" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matt. 24:30</a>) already occurred since 1914’? (This is not the “sign” of Jesus’ presence; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matt. 24:3</a>) Applies to “coming” at end of system. (<a class="xt" data-xtid="7" href="jwpub://p/E:1101973026/87-87"><em>ka </em>327, par. 74</a>) (5) How is period of Jesus’ presence like “days of Noah”? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:37-40:24:37" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matt. 24:37</a>) (Presence extends over period of time.) (<a class="xt" data-xtid="8" href="jwpub://p/E:1101973027/7-7"><em>ka </em>333, par. 5</a>) Jesus was not emphasizing violence that was before Flood, but faithlessness and absorption in daily affairs by majority of people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:38-40:24:39" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matt. 24:38, 39</a>; <a class="xt" data-xtid="9" href="jwpub://p/E:1101973027/8-8"><em>ka </em>334, par. 6</a>) (6) Why did Jesus not give us a specific date for finale of the system? (This allows us to prove whether we have faith and are zealous for the work God has given us.) (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:43-40:24:44" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matt. 24:43, 44</a>)</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Preparing to offer the book <em>God’s Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached. </em>Preparation helps us to be much more effective. A brief presentation that includes the reading of an appropriate scripture directly from the Bible usually gets best results; may help you reach the heart of a sincere person in search of the truth. After introducing yourself, you could say: “God’s approaching kingdom is the main theme of the entire Bible.” Thereafter, you could make any one of the following statements: “Jesus said that those who sincerely appreciate spiritual things will be richly blessed by that kingdom. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Matt. 5:3</a>.] . . .” “Jesus taught his followers to make this kingdom the most important thing in their lives. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:33-40:6:33" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matt. 6:33</a>.] . . .” “Jesus described this hope as a treasure worth more than anything else we could possess. [Read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:44-40:13:44" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matt. 13:44</a>.] . . .” Then, offer the book, perhaps calling attention the purpose for which it is dedicated as mentioned on page 5. Other suggested presentations can be found in the October 1973 <em>Kingdom Ministry. </em>Review and demonstrate one or two that might be used effectively in your territory. Encourage all to share in distribution during August.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="ss"><strong>WEEK STARTING AUGUST 3</strong></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Song 14. Introduction. Talk on “<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:201975245/">Presiding in a Fine Manner</a>.” Show how this is a desirable quality in those seeking to qualify as elders as well as in all husbands and fathers.</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sn"><strong>30 min: </strong>Review of the “Divine Sovereignty” Assembly. (Note: Congregations attending early in July can schedule this on an earlier meeting, adjusting the program as necessary.) Follow the outline suggested under Announcements in the June <em>Kingdom Ministry. </em>Participants should be prepared in advance to offer specific, upbuilding information.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>“Salvation Belongs to Jehovah.” Discussion of <em>1975 Yearbook, </em>168. par. 2, through p. 190, par. 4. Have a few publishers prepared to relate in their own words points from the material. Do not stress the violence experienced by God’s people. Rather, point out that we must realistically acknowledge that Satan does stir up persecution. Nevertheless, Christians can have confidence that God will deliver his servants because “salvation belongs to Jehovah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:3:8-19:3:8" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Ps. 3:8</a>)</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">(1) As shown in the booklet <em>Loyalty, </em>why do Jehovah’s witnesses refuse to salute the flag? (Pp. 168, 169) (2) What were Kingdom Schools, and why and for how long did they function? (Pp. 170-172) (3) Why could May 3, 1943, well be called a “field day” for Jehovah’s witnesses in their legal fight? (Pp. 179, 180) (4) What did violent foes do during the 1939 Madison Square Garden convention, and what was the outcome? (Pp. 180-182) (5) How did the 1940 mob violence at Connersville, Indiana, give evidence that Jehovah aids his people when persecuted? (Pp. 186-188) (6) What experience did Jehovah’s witnesses have at the hands of persecutors at Winnsboro, Texas, in 1942? (Pp. 188-190) (7) How can Christians endure brutal persecution?

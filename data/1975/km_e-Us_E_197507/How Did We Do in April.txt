How Did We Do in April?
How wonderful to learn of the excellent number attending the Memorial this year​—1,248,641 in the United States! That is 66,529 more than the previous peak attendance of 1974. Partakers were 4,610​—down 97, or 2 percent, compared to last year. Our hope for the many new ones who attended Memorial is that they will continue to show appreciation for God’s mercy toward them.
Also, there were 20,205 more publishers than last April. Though not a new peak, it is a fine increase. Total subscriptions during the four-month Watchtower campaign came to 485,299. By making return visits on subscribers, likely many new Bible studies can be started.

Teaching That Reaches the Heart
17 min: Song 10. Introductory comments on meeting theme. Talk based on January 8, 1975, Awake! article “The Art of Persuasion.” Cover material under subheadings “Logic a Basic Requirement” and “Apply the Golden Rule!” Some persons allow emotion to dominate their thinking. Aggressive tactics may win an argument, but the real objective, winning the individual, is lost. Explain how application of the “Golden Rule” can help to change thinking of others. Offer suggestions on applying this in dealing with a common subject of discussion in your territory.
13 min: “Presenting the Good News​—With Warm Appeal from the Heart.” Discuss with audience. Include experiences of some who have enjoyed good results by displaying warm sincerity in their preaching work.
20 min: Teaching Others to Appreciate God’s Ways. Talk; do not just present facts but show how we can teach a new person to reason on God’s past and future dealings.
Necessary to gain God’s viewpoint, recognizing that his ways are perfect. (is 92, 93: Isa. 40:14; 55:9; Deut. 32:4) Persons should view his past acts in the light of what is known of God’s qualities. (is 93-97; Deut. 9:5; Ezek. 33:11; Job 34:10. 12) We can be confident that his future dealings will be just, righteous, perfect. (is 100; w75 279, 280; 2 Pet. 3:9; John 5:30; Rev. 19:1, 2; Isa. 11:2-5) While we have yet much to learn about what Jehovah will do and why, we can rest assured that his ways will be perfect.
10 min: Concluding comments. Comment on how Bible was designed to reveal the heart condition of those hearing its message. (w75 148, par. 27; ad 1287, pars. 3-6) Ask all to bring Thousand Years book next week. Song 68.
WEEK STARTING JULY 27
10 min: Song 4. Introduction and brief remarks on Theocratic News and, if it applies to your congregation, the Question Box.
25 min: Scriptural discussion. Matthew Chapter 24​—Extraordinary Prophecy That Has Meaning for Us. Audience discussion. May read selected brief portions from Thousand Years (ka) book.
(1) Since Matt. 24 applied in period up to 70 C.E., how do we know it has application now? (Prophecy of Rev. 6:1-8, written after 70 C.E., parallels Matt. 24:6-8 and shows it has future application.) (is 122-128) Jerusalem’s destruction was not worst catastrophe in history. (Matt. 24:21: ka 304 par. 28; w75 274. par. 10) “All the tribes of the earth” were not involved in 70 C.E. (Matt. 24:30; w75 273. par. 5) (2) Is the warning in vs. 23 merely repeating vss. 4, 5? (Applied after Jerusalem’s end, not before.) (Matt. 24:20-22; ka 320, pars. 58, 59) Disciples had no need to be misled, for presence would not be revealed to just a select few. (Matt. 24:24-27; ka 320, 321, pars. 60, 61) (3) How have heavens been darkened in our time? (Is a time of gloom, with no bright outlook for men in general.) (Matt. 24:29; ka 324, par. 68) Heavens no longer seem benign, but contain dangers (ka 325, par. 70; w75 276. par. 18) (4)  Has “sign of the Son of man” (Matt. 24:30) already occurred since 1914’? (This is not the “sign” of Jesus’ presence; Matt. 24:3) Applies to “coming” at end of system. (ka 327, par. 74) (5) How is period of Jesus’ presence like “days of Noah”? (Matt. 24:37) (Presence extends over period of time.) (ka 333, par. 5) Jesus was not emphasizing violence that was before Flood, but faithlessness and absorption in daily affairs by majority of people. (Matt. 24:38, 39; ka 334, par. 6) (6) Why did Jesus not give us a specific date for finale of the system? (This allows us to prove whether we have faith and are zealous for the work God has given us.) (Matt. 24:43, 44)
15 min: Preparing to offer the book God’s Kingdom of a Thousand Years Has Approached. Preparation helps us to be much more effective. A brief presentation that includes the reading of an appropriate scripture directly from the Bible usually gets best results; may help you reach the heart of a sincere person in search of the truth. After introducing yourself, you could say: “God’s approaching kingdom is the main theme of the entire Bible.” Thereafter, you could make any one of the following statements: “Jesus said that those who sincerely appreciate spiritual things will be richly blessed by that kingdom. [Read Matt. 5:3.] . . .” “Jesus taught his followers to make this kingdom the most important thing in their lives. [Read Matt. 6:33.] . . .” “Jesus described this hope as a treasure worth more than anything else we could possess. [Read Matt. 13:44.] . . .” Then, offer the book, perhaps calling attention the purpose for which it is dedicated as mentioned on page 5. Other suggested presentations can be found in the October 1973 Kingdom Ministry. Review and demonstrate one or two that might be used effectively in your territory. Encourage all to share in distribution during August.
10 min: Concluding comments. Song 13.
WEEK STARTING AUGUST 3
15 min: Song 14. Introduction. Talk on “Presiding in a Fine Manner.” Show how this is a desirable quality in those seeking to qualify as elders as well as in all husbands and fathers.
30 min: Review of the “Divine Sovereignty” Assembly. (Note: Congregations attending early in July can schedule this on an earlier meeting, adjusting the program as necessary.) Follow the outline suggested under Announcements in the June Kingdom Ministry. Participants should be prepared in advance to offer specific, upbuilding information.
15 min: “Salvation Belongs to Jehovah.” Discussion of 1975 Yearbook, 168. par. 2, through p. 190, par. 4. Have a few publishers prepared to relate in their own words points from the material. Do not stress the violence experienced by God’s people. Rather, point out that we must realistically acknowledge that Satan does stir up persecution. Nevertheless, Christians can have confidence that God will deliver his servants because “salvation belongs to Jehovah.” (Ps. 3:8)
(1) As shown in the booklet Loyalty, why do Jehovah’s witnesses refuse to salute the flag? (Pp. 168, 169) (2) What were Kingdom Schools, and why and for how long did they function? (Pp. 170-172) (3) Why could May 3, 1943, well be called a “field day” for Jehovah’s witnesses in their legal fight? (Pp. 179, 180) (4) What did violent foes do during the 1939 Madison Square Garden convention, and what was the outcome? (Pp. 180-182) (5) How did the 1940 mob violence at Connersville, Indiana, give evidence that Jehovah aids his people when persecuted? (Pp. 186-188) (6) What experience did Jehovah’s witnesses have at the hands of persecutors at Winnsboro, Texas, in 1942? (Pp. 188-190) (7) How can Christians endure brutal persecution? (P. 190) Concluding comments. Song 31.

Answers at Your Fingertips
Answers can be that close when you use the Watch Tower Publications Indexes. They index all subjects, Biblical and others, discussed in the Watchtower and Awake! magazines, as well as in other publications of Jehovah’s witnesses.
The 1974 Index is now available. It costs 10 cents. The 1971, 1972 and 1973 Indexes are also 10 cents each. An Index for 1930-1960 is available for $1.
Please send what I have checked and for which I enclose $‐‐‐‐‐‐: 1974 Index (10c) □; 1973 Index (10c) □; 1972 Index (10c) □; 1971 Index (10c) □; 1930-1960 Index ($1) □.

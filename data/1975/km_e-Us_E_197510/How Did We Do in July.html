<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Despite the many attractions and diversions of summer, including assemblies, vacations, gardening, canning, etc., you nonetheless devoted much time (6,821,870 hours) and energy to preaching and teaching. There were 531,294 reporting field service, over 15,000 more than last July. Likely there were even more who actually shared in proclaiming the good news, as some, when away from home and the usual routine, forget to report their activity or are late getting in their reports. The 8,864,224 magazines that were placed hopefully reached the hands of those who will benefit from the faith-strengthening message therein. May their hearts also be moved to join those telling the good news to others in the future.</p>

Interview publishers who have obtained subscriptions. Did they get them in house-to-house work or on return visits? What seemed to appeal to the subscriber? Have discussion between two publishers, one giving talking points on an article from <em>Awake! </em>and the other from <em>The Watchtower </em>with a view to offering both subscriptions. Ask audience for other helpful talking points.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Starting Bible Studies During the Subscription Campaign. [Demonstration] Two publishers finished taking subscription; promise to return with new magazines. After leaving, one says may offer <em>Truth </em>book on return visit to try to start study. Other publisher asks, “Why not start study in one of the booklets left with the subscription?” [Chairman] Let’s see how this might be done. [Demonstration] As in original scene, they finish taking subscription. Second publisher calls attention to <em>“Look!” </em>booklet explaining that many people would like to know more about the Bible but have found it difficult to understand. However, Jehovah’s witnesses are offering to help householder find out from his own Bible how God is going to bring back paradise to earth. Comment on cover of <em>Look! </em>booklet. (Brief study is started in <em>“Look!” </em>booklet paragraphs 1-4.) [Chairman] Examining the scriptures in this booklet and discussing them together can be done in relatively few visits. Encourage trying this with all subscribers.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>10 min: </strong>Song 45. Introduction and discussion of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:46-40:12:50" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 12:46-50</a>. (See <em>Aid, </em>page 262.)</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Getting to Know One Another. How many are new in the congregation in the last year or so? We should know our spiritual brothers and sisters well to help them progress to Christian maturity. Interview several. Discuss how they first heard of the truth and any obstacles they had to overcome. What particularly helped them see it was the truth? How have they been encouraged to stay close to Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>12 min: </strong>Helping Each Other Spiritually. Talk highlighting need to progress spiritually. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:5:11-58:6:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Heb. 5:11–6:1</a>) New ones attracted to the congregation by the things they learn, appreciating spiritual truths instead of tradition and ritual. How can we help them continue progressing toward maturity? Association in addition to the meetings is especially encouraging. Do you know someone you could help this way? Many need continued help in study even after baptism. May wish to invite new ones to share in your family study at times. Are there some in your book study who would be happy to share in field service with you? Help may also be appreciated preparing a field presentation or a part for the School. We want to offer such spiritual assistance, thus showing we feel the same way toward our spiritual brothers as Jesus did.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:50-40:12:50" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 12:50</a>.</p>

Do not want to see any of our spiritual family neglected. [Demonstration] Two sisters talking about elderly sister, not getting to meetings, apartment not kept up properly; why don’t elders do something for her? One comments, “Of course, she is our sister in the truth too; maybe we should do something ourselves,” Agree this is a good idea. Plan to take turns picking her up for meetings, seeing what they can do in a tactful way to help her clean her apartment since she is getting feeble. [Ask congregation,] What kinds of things can sisters do to help others in the congregation in a practical way? What can teen-agers do? What can elders do to help others in the congregation? All of us can show love by warmly welcoming all attending meetings. How can love be shown in other practical ways in harmony with <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="6-1" class="b">John 13:35</a></p>

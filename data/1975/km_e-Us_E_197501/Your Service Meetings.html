<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">(2 min.) Chairman: We want to help children understand Bible, not just find answers to study material. Good to discuss key scriptures thoroughly, to be sure all in family understand their meaning. When reading the Bible in connection with the Theocratic Ministry School program, take time to comment on the significance of what is read. At times it is beneficial to discuss questions or problems confronting the family or that may be raised in school. Some families find it interesting for the one taking the lead to take the opposite side of a question, raising arguments for the others to overcome Scripturally.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">(12 min.) Interview several family heads on their arrangements for family study and how they prepare for the meetings. Consider (1) their study program, (2) how they try to add variety to the study arrangement to keep it interesting for younger members of the family, and (3) what they do to make the material meaningful and applicable to their family.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">(1 min.) Chairman: The important thing in each case is to have a regular program for family study, one that is helpful to your family. Commend the brothers for the efforts they are making to help their families keep well-nourished spiritually.</p>

Can read excerpts. Stress points likely to be beneficial to local congregation, but convey the story, not dwelling long on one idea. On pages cited, can emphasize: (1) Brother Russell’s action when his faith in the Bible was reestablished, and how God’s spirit enlightened early Bible students about Christ’s invisible presence, end of Gentile Times (pp. 34-37); (2) <em>The Watchtower </em>has Jehovah’s backing and has upheld the ransom from the start (p. 38); (3) God’s people knew they should preach the good news and did so (pp. 39, 40); (4) Holy spirit prompted persons to act on the truth (pp. 41, 42); (5) God’s people put forth effort to attend Christian meetings and from these young and old benefited spiritually (pp. 43, 44); (6) Tract work was done industriously and tracts brought good results (pp. 45, 46); (7) Pilgrims displayed Christian qualities, and spiritual benefits resulted from their visits (pp. 48-51); (8) Society’s headquarters were transferred to expand the preaching work, and Bethel family received good spiritual care, as through morning Bible discussions (pp. 51-53).</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">As a résumé, review with congregation how same pattern of Christian activity applies to us: (1) God’s spirit still reveals truth and motivates people to act on it; (2) Faithfully preach the good news, as did the early Bible Students; (3) Attend Christian meetings regularly, for they benefit young and old spiritually; (4) Share in tract distribution and presenting the magazines, and we can expect fine results; (5) Take full advantage of circuit overseer’s visit and thus benefit as God’s people did when pilgrims visited; (6) Like the Bethel family, we can discuss daily Bible text, to our spiritual advantage.</p>

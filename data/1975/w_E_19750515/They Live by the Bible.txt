They Live by the Bible
All that a disabled war veteran in the state of New York knew about Jehovah’s Christian witnesses was their view regarding neutrality and saluting the flag. As he put it, these were things “not likely to appeal to most people.” But through a conversation with a friend who was studying with Jehovah’s witnesses, he was moved to want to learn more about them. He writes: “I expected to find a rabble of wild-eyed fanatics; instead, I have found Jehovah’s Witnesses to be gentle, decent people who present, quietly but forcefully, the principles of the faith by which they live: a consistent, coherent faith.”

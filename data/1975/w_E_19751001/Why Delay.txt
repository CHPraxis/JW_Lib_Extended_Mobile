Why Delay?
● It has been said that the lazier a man is the more he says he is going to do “tomorrow.” If something needs to be done, why delay doing it? Now is the time to be busy in the service of God. About the lazy man the Bible says: “A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding your arms to lie abed​—and your poverty shall come like a prowler.”​—Prov. 6:10, 11, The Bible in Living English.

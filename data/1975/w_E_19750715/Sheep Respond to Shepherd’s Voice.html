<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◇ In one of his illustrations, Jesus Christ showed that sheep learn to recognize the voice of the shepherd and to respond to his voice only: “The sheep listen to his voice, . . . the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:3-43:10:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 10:3, 4</a>) A traveler to the Holy Land recently experienced the accuracy of those words. He reports: “We wanted to film some sheep and tried to make them come near. But they did not follow us because they did not know our voices. Then a small shepherd boy came along; hardly had he called them when they followed along. We recorded the shepherd’s voice on a tape recorder and afterward played it. To our great surprise, now the sheep followed even us!”</p>

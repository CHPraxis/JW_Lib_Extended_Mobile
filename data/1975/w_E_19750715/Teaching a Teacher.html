<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">‚óè A thirteen-year-old girl in the Netherlands, while calling on people at their homes to share Bible truth with them, met her biology teacher and left with him the book <em>Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation? </em>Thereafter, once a week, she studied this publication with him in a quiet corner of the school cafeteria during the lunch break. As a result, the fifty-year-old biology teacher ceased to be an upholder of the evolution theory.</p>

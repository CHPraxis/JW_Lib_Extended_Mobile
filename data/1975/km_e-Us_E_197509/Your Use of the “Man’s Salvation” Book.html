<p id="p1" data-pid="1" class="st"><span id="page3" class="pageNum" data-no="3" data-before-text="3"></span><strong>Your Use of the “Man’s Salvation” Book</strong></p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">What an outstanding thing it was when Jesus, in the Nazareth synagogue, read <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:61:1-23:61:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 61:1</a>, about Jehovah’s anointed one, and then said: “Today this scripture that you just heard is fulfilled”!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:16-42:4:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 4:16-21</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">For all men of faith since then, including us, that certainly was good news. Jesus is the Servant, the Anointed One, concerning whom many of the prophecies in the book of Isaiah deal. He is our means of salvation. That is news worthy of proclamation, and we are eagerly proclaiming it!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">How thrilled we were, then, to receive at the district assembly the book <em>Man’s Salvation out of World Distress at Hand! </em>(<em>sl</em>) It deals with many important portions of Isaiah’s prophecy that directly affect us. If you have already read in the new book, you have noted how full of good things it is. And likely you have already been talking with your brothers and others about it.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">But soon we are going to be able to get better acquainted with its contents. During November we will have four special talks based on the <em>Man’s Salvation </em>book. That will be a fine preview in anticipation of our thorough study of the book beginning in December. Also, these talks, by familiarizing us with the fine things in the book, will aid us to offer it effectively in the field service during November.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong><em>What Will You Do?</em></strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Perhaps you do not expect to deliver any of these talks. So are you at all involved? You definitely are!</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">If you think about the two benefits just mentioned, you can see why. Since <em>you </em>are going to be studying the book at the congregation book study starting in December, do you not want to have an idea of what the <em>Man’s Salvation </em>book has to say? It will be many months before you finish studying it. So the rapid preview in the talks will enable you to know what prophecies of Isaiah are explained in the book and what is the basic application of these prophecies. And there are some adjustments in viewpoint, some “new things,” in the book that you need to fix in mind. Also, when <em>you </em>offer the new book in the field service in November, you will definitely want to know its contents, will you not? Hence, there is no question that these four talks are important for you. How, though, can you best benefit from them?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Undoubtedly the most helpful thing will be to read the material to be covered in the upcoming talk each week. True, that is quite a lot of material, about five chapters a week, and you already do have a full schedule. But before dismissing that possibility, consider this: Reading the chapters will be different from preparing your lesson for the book study. In this case you need not read the questions and determine the answers. Rather, you can read straight through the chapters, moving along rapidly. Doing this will certainly add to your benefit from the talks.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">‘What if I can’t do that?’ you may ask. You know your own situation. But here is another possibility. If you simply cannot read the chapters each week, can you “skim” the material? In just thirty minutes or so each week you can quickly go through the respective chapters and get an idea of their basic contents. For each chapter do this: First read the opening paragraph or two, or even the first page of the chapter. Then for the remainder of the chapter read only the first sentence of each paragraph, also noting any subheadings along the way. This will give you a quick view of the chapter. No, you will not have all the details, but doing just this much will help to make the talks more meaningful for you.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Finally, each week bring your copy of the book with you to the public talk. The speaker will be referring you to it. He may even have certain portions read aloud by persons in the audience. You will become even better acquainted with the book’s contents by following along in it each week. That is a blessing we are all looking forward to, thankful to Jehovah for this spiritual food.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong><em>Speakers</em></strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">In most cases there will likely be sufficient speakers (elders and capable ministerial servants) in one congregation to deliver all four talks. However, if two congregations need to exchange speakers, that can be done.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb">There is no objection to having two speakers for one talk, dividing up the assigned material. The nature of the material in these talks allows for that. (Here are possible divisions of the material: Talk No. 1​—a. [Chaps. 1-3], b. [Chaps. 4, 5]; Talk No. 2​—a. [Chaps. 6-8], b. [Chaps. 9-11]; Talk No. 3​—a. [Chaps. 12, 13], b. [Chaps. 14, 15]; Talk No. 4​—a. [Chaps. 16, 17], b. [Chaps. 18, 19]) If it is decided that two brothers will share in delivering a talk, they should consult together so that they both understand clearly the division of the material and the time. They can also consider how the first speaker will lead into or introduce the second part.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb">To cover in a balanced and reasonable manner eighty or more pages of the book, you will not be able to deal with every detail. The following outlines should help you. Please study carefully the outline assigned to you. Note that some pages are considered, and others are intentionally skipped. This will enable you to focus on some of the highlights <span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span>and new points, not losing the audience in a deluge of hurried details. Concentrate on the scriptures here listed, either reading them yourself or having persons in the audience read them aloud for you. That will help all to be better acquainted with and to understand God’s Word, which is what we all very much desire, is it not?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">You are lovingly interested in your brothers and sisters; that is why you assigned speakers are giving of yourselves to prepare and deliver one of these talks. Something that will add to your effectiveness in helping your brothers is your calling attention to and reading specific paragraphs of the book as you progress. In each outline we have called attention to key paragraphs, marked <em>“note,” </em>which you likely will want to read (or have read) in whole or in part. True, this may take more effort in your preparation and delivery. But the good results obtained from the effort make it well worth it. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:19-44:20:21" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 20:19-21</a>.) And instead of referring to some page or paragraph in the book merely once or twice, try to do it throughout the talk. Thus the brothers in the audience can actually follow along; they will be using the book, looking at it, seeing for themselves the good things it contains.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">If at all possible, these four talks should be presented during November, as was announced in the August <em>Kingdom Ministry. </em>As soon as the local details have been finalized, handbills may be ordered. Then, the week before each talk the congregation should be informed of the talk for the coming week. Urge them to prepare and to bring their books. Also, they can be encouraged to invite newly interested persons to attend​—especially persons who have a copy of the new book and who would like to learn of its contents.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><em>This generation has faced distress, but has reason for hope. </em>(10 min.; chaps. 1, 2) Everyone is interested in future. Many seek information about it from political analysts, fortune-tellers. No man alive is capable of predicting future. Many who are concerned about future know that trouble has marked this generation since turning point in 1914. (Pp. 8-13) Not reasonable for them to turn for guidance to religions that they have abandoned. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:26:11-20:26:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Prov. 26:11</a>) One person who proved he can foretell world events also spoke of our time. He showed himself a reliable commentator by predicting destruction of Jewish system. Has significance for our time, too. (Pp. 15, 17-19, 22, 23, <em>note </em>¶¶17, 18; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 24:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:21-40:24:21" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:24-42:21:24" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> Luke 21:24</a>) This one is Jesus. He proved himself Messiah, and reliable evidence shows he was resurrected. (Pp. 25-29) What can we learn about him that gives us reason for hope as to relief from world distress?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb"><em>Can rest our hope on Jesus Christ, for he has God’s backing. </em>(15 min.; chap. 3) He is not mere babe that sentimental persons adore; neither a shameful criminal. (Pp. 42, 43) Should not view him as did rulers in first century, and as rulers do today. (P. 30) He has been transformed, elevated and given authority. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:13-23:53:12" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Isaiah 52:13-53:12</a> shows why we can look to him with confidence and have hope.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Bible identifies him as Servant of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:13-23:52:13" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Isaiah 52:13</a>. (Relate <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:26-44:8:40" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Acts 8:26-40</a>; p. 37, <em>note </em>¶17.) He was elevated to God’s right hand to await time to exercise rulership. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:2:34-44:2:36" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 2:34-36</a>; pp. 38-41) This contrasts with widespread image of him as ‘disfigured’ lawbreaker undergoing execution. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:14-23:52:14" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isa. 52:14</a>; p. 43) Even today most persons have not heard from clergy facts as to how “Servant” will war against nations; only Witnesses urge people to have affection for him as enthroned ruler. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:52:15-23:52:15" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isa. 52:15</a>; pp. 44, 45; discuss with audience picture, p. 40.) Are you sharing in that? Do you know why we can have confidence?</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb"><em>We can have confidence because of his integrity. </em>(15 min.; chap. 4) Who will have confidence, faith in him? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:1-23:53:1" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isa. 53:1</a>; pp. 46, 48) He had to be born on earth. Had humble beginning, and religious leaders viewed him as unattractive. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:2-23:53:2" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Isa. 53:2</a>; pp. 48-51) Opposers refused to esteem him, though he healed many and stressed spiritual curing. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:3-23:53:3" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Isa. 53:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:7:48-43:7:49" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> John 7:48, 49</a>; pp. 52-54) But why would God allow him to be disgraced? Understanding this should affect our hope for relief. Allowed it so Son could prove that Satan’s challenge, presented in Job’s case, was false. Let Son provide full vindication of Father as rightful Sovereign. (Pp. 58-63, <em>note </em>¶37) That Father had such confidence in Son should build our confidence in him and our hope for future.</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb"><em>Build solid hope on integrity God’s Son showed. </em>(15 min.; chap. 5) We can be thankful that Son was willing to be scapegoat, suffering death for others. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:4-23:53:5" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Isa. 53:4, 5</a>; pp. 64, 66) His interest in aiding imperfect humans is seen in healings he performed; should stimulate our hope as to what he can yet do for those with faith. (P. 67) His endurance of persecution worked for our good. (P. 68, <em>note </em>¶10) Jesus did not fight against dying like a sacrificial lamb. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:6-23:53:7" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Isa. 53:6, 7</a>; p. 70) By not restraining enemies, God allowed Son to be impaled with wicked, killed and buried.

(Pp. 80, 82) He was faithful, as were men such as Noah and Job. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:53:12-23:53:12" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Isa. 53:12</a>; p. 83) Are you grateful that Jesus carried sins of many? Do you appreciate God’s mercy and love that moved him to let Son serve as ransom? Should convince us that Jesus is the one through whom relief from distress will come, and move us to respond appreciatively.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:3:4-56:3:6" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Titus 3:4-6</a>; pp. 88, 89.</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb"><em>We can live in paradise​—it is not just a dream. </em>(15 min.; chap. 6) Widespread pollution stimulates our desire for life in a paradise.

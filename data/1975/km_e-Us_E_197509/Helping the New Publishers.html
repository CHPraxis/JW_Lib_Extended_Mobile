<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Can you remember the first few times you associated with Jehovah’s people? Nowadays with so many new ones flocking to Jehovah’s organization we certainly rejoice and yet at the same time we want to ask ourselves, What can we do to help these many new ones learn all they can and, in turn, be useful in helping still other persons to follow Jehovah’s way?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Some new publishers have said they felt uneasy about answering questions at the book study because some of the brothers did not know their names. So if the publishers would learn the names of the new ones this would make it easier and more comfortable for the new ones to answer and seek counsel as such might be needed. Also, such simple things as filling out a field service report or a subscription slip, which come so easy to us who have been in the truth for a while, can be explained to the new publishers. The elder in charge of the Ministry School can approach newly associated ones and explain in detail the benefits of the school, making sure they get a schedule and learn about some useful tools for personal study, such as <em>“All Scripture Is Inspired,” Sermon Outlines, </em>and so forth. Many of the things we take for granted are things that new ones need help in learning.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><span id="page8" class="pageNum" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span><sup>3 </sup>New publishers can help us to assist them by getting acquainted with the elders, introducing themselves, even on more than one occasion, if necessary. If new ones would introduce themselves to the one conducting the meeting, taking the initiative in this, this would be helpful. Don’t hesitate to ask the older ones for assistance in connection with any of the services mentioned above. If some of the older ones are busy on a particular occasion, don’t take this as an evidence of their lack of concern for you, but seek them out again. This valuable interchange of encouragement will unite us together as a happy family, helping one another to progress in the truth and follow God’s way.</p>

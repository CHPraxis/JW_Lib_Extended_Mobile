<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">For many of us June was the month for attending the “Divine Sovereignty” district assembly program, and what a delightful time we had! Also, it was good to see that the 510,947 who shared in publishing the good news placed 822,358 books and made over 3,000,000 return visits. This is excellent indeed. Incidentally, from September through June, 7,359,773 books were placed in the field service, and as we all make more return visits and cultivate interest In the good news, surely this will result in opening the way for many more Bible studies.</p>

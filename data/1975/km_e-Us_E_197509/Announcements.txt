◆ After the body of elders has considered the August Kingdom Ministry insert and determined who will be the new presiding overseer, field overseer, Bible study overseer, etc., with due regard for the rotation system, announcement should be made to the congregation. However, if the elders have in mind using a brother who is newly being recommended to the governing body for appointment as an elder, they will wait until he is appointed before giving him any definite assignment of oversight. See or book, pp. 67-69, 72.
◆ New presiding overseers should not request that congregation mail be sent to them if mail is already going to a different permanent address. A change should not be requested unless the one receiving it is planning to move or is otherwise unable to give proper attention to delivery. The mail should be delivered as soon as possible, especially sent airmail or sent special delivery or if mail is received for traveling representatives of the Society.

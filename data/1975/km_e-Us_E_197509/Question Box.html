<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● What effect do our conduct and appearance have on those who view us as we share in the field service on the streets ?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">It is evident that our conduct and dress have a bearing on our being effective representatives of the good news. Passersby are drawn to us if our appearance is fitting, our clothes clean and neat, our speech dignified and direct. At times publishers are seen steadily conversing with each other while engaged in the street work. It is good to remember, though, that we engage in this work, not to count time, but to help people. An elderly couple we know of, both over seventy years of age, have outstanding success in the field service, mostly in the street work, placing an average of 35 books and 165 magazines each month between them. What makes them so productive, even though they do not speak the English language well? It is their genuine sincerity coupled with their fine, clean appearance as they approach passersby. Month after month their joy is clearly manifest because of their happiness in giving.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">There are some who are unable physically to approach people on the street, but these brothers and sisters, usually elderly ones, faithfully stick to their assignment and speak to those who come toward them, offering the latest copies of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>We commend our older brothers and sisters for their zealous work. But where physically able to do so, it is best to approach people. Do it in a dignified, friendly way. Avoid arguments and long conversations. Be kind, courteous and tactful. This, of course, applies in all facets of our activity.</p>

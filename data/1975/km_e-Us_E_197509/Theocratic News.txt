◆ Good news from Turkey! The Turkish government, on May 21, 1975, approved the charter of a local religious corporation of Jehovah’s witnesses. Under the provision of the charter, Jehovah’s witnesses are now being allowed to hold public meetings. Also, on November 29, 1974, the 20th District Court of Istanbul ruled that Jehovah’s Christian witnesses are a religious body. According to that decision, each baptized Witness can now officially register his religion.

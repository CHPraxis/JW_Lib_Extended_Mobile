What You Should Know About Drugs
How do drugs affect the life of the user? What does the Bible say about the use of drugs?
The 192-page book True Peace and Security​—From What Source? discusses these questions in the chapter “Respect for the Gift of Life.” Only 25c, postpaid.
Also, if you desire, a qualified person will call at your home and, free of charge, discuss such Biblical matters with you and your family.
Check either or both:
□ Please send the hardbound book True Peace and Security​—From What Source? I enclose 25c.
□ Have one of Jehovah’s witnesses call to discuss the Bible free of charge.

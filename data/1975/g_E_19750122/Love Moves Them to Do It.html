<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">‚óè In Mali, West Africa, there are very few Witnesses of Jehovah. Most of them walk as much as six miles to attend Christian meetings. Deeply concerned about the spiritual welfare of the people, two Europeans and one African volunteered to serve there. Individually, they devote upward of 200 hours each month in proclaiming Bible truth. Though the heat is almost unbearable, often reaching 120 degrees Fahrenheit, they consider their labors of love well worth it. Common laborers, doctors, public officials and other professional people are eager to study the Bible.</p>

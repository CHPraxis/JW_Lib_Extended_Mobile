<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Brooklyn Bethel family were delighted to learn on November 28 that the following brothers had been made members of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s witnesses. These will now serve along with those who are already serving in the Governing Body. The new members are as follows: W. Lloyd Barry, who at present is branch overseer in Japan; John C. Booth, who is working in the office at Watchtower Farm; Ewart C. Chitty of London, England, who is secretary-treasurer of the International Bible Students Association; Charles J. Fekel of Brooklyn, New York, who works in the composition department of the Brooklyn factory; Theodore Jaracz of the United States, who is serving as a circuit overseer; Karl F. Klein of the Brooklyn Bethel, who works in the office; Albert D. Schroeder, who has been serving as an instructor of the Kingdom Ministry School; and Daniel Sydlik, who works in the printing plant at Brooklyn Bethel. All these brothers will eventually be living in the Bethel home in Brooklyn and will attend the regular meetings of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s witnesses held on Wednesday mornings at eight o’clock. They will also take their turns at the head of the Bethel table in weekly rotation alphabetically according to last name.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Governing Body is now composed of eighteen members, all anointed, and the other ten are as follows: Frederick W. Franz, Raymond V. Franz, George D. Gangas, Leo K. Greenlees, John O. Groh, Milton G. Henschel, William K. Jackson, Nathan H. Knorr, Grant Suiter and Lyman A. Swingle.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It is indeed their joy to be serving Jehovah’s witnesses world wide in their capacity as the Governing Body, and their deliberations on spiritual matters will continue to prove very beneficial to all of Jehovah’s witnesses who are enjoying the spiritual paradise in which those who love Jehovah find themselves today.</p>

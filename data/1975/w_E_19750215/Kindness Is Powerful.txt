Kindness Is Powerful
● Kindness can break down even intense opposition. This was the experience of a paralyzed man in the Philippines. His wife bitterly opposed his studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses. The children even threatened that if he became a Witness they would no longer view him as their father. Relatives, on whose property he was living, told him to get off their land. Jehovah’s witnesses in the area quickly came to his aid. They helped him to move his small house to another location and to make some renovations at the same time. What effect did this expression of kindness have on his wife and children? They were moved to begin studying the Bible. Now all are baptized Witnesses.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● A five-mile-deep crack in the earth’s structure runs offshore parallel with the Pacific Coast of South America. Along this fault line tremendous pressure builds up (more than 1,648,000 pounds per square foot), resulting in a pushing of the floor of the Pacific against the landmass of South America. One effect is that Peru experiences a major earthquake once every twelve years, on the average. Another effect is that the Andes mountain chain grows slightly higher each year.</p>

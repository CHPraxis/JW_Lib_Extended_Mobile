<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><span id="page2" class="pageNum" data-no="2" data-before-text="2"></span>Many people just live from day to day, without thought for the future. Some follow the philosophy, ‘let’s eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.’ But really there can be much more than that to life. This booklet explains how you may find satisfying enjoyment in life now and in a grand future that lies ahead. Besides reading these pages, you may wish to discuss these vital matters with one of Jehovah’s witnesses, who will be happy to answer questions that you may have.</p>

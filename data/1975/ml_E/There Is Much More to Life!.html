Men who support their families often work at jobs that they do not enjoy, and not a few constantly face the threat of unemployment. For many housewives, there are long days of drudgery, with little relief day after day and no great satisfaction. Great numbers of young people grow up with a similar life-prospect. Even for the few who feel that life has treated them more kindly, the future is clouded with uncertainty.</p>

But the truth is that such bloodguilty men have simply used the Bible as a cloak for unchristian deeds. The Bible itself strongly condemns their actions, and shows them to be counterfeit Christians.

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[98]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>If we want to find out what life is all about, one of the fundamental questions that must be answered is: What is the origin of life? In other words, Where did we come from? Is there a purpose in our being alive? The Bible says that “God created the heavens and the earth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:1-1:1:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 1:1</a>) But modern-day thinkers ask: Is there really an Almighty God​—a Creator?

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[98]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>Have you ever visited a planetarium? If so, you have no doubt marveled at the intricate mechanism designed to project the exact representation of the heavens on the curved dome, and also at the accurate movement of the model of our solar system. You may have thought, What a fine product of man’s photographic and engineering skill! But think for a moment. If it required talented humans to devise such a likeness of the <span id="page7" class="pageNum" data-no="7" data-before-text="7"></span>universe, surely it required a far more talented Intellect to construct the stupendous universe itself.</p>
<p id="p99" data-pid="99" class="qu">11. What have some learned worldly thinkers been compelled to admit? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:20-45:1:23" data-bid="47-1" class="b">Romans 1:20-23</a>)</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[99]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>It was in the nineteenth century that Charles Darwin theorized that the universe is all a product of evolution. But do you, also, think that no one made all of this? Do you think that life came about by accident? Many intelligent persons find that the evolution theory is deficient. For example, historian Arnold Toynbee stated:</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="si">“I do not think that the Darwinian theory of evolution has given a positive account of an alternative way in which the universe may have been brought into existence.”⁠<sup>1</sup></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Why, even Darwin, in discussing the source of life, admitted:</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="si">“Another source of conviction in the existence of God, connected with the reason and not with the feelings, impresses me . . . This follows from the extreme difficulty or rather impossibility of conceiving this immense and wonderful universe, including man with his capacity of looking backwards and far into futurity, as the result of blind chance or necessity. When thus reflecting, I feel compelled to look to a First Cause.”⁠<sup>2</sup></p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[100]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>Yes, plain logic tells us that there must be a great First Cause, a Creator​—God! And when we reflect that man’s most powerful telescopes can only begin to probe the depths of His marvelous universe, we should humbly acknowledge that man’s wisdom and abilities are indeed dwarfed by the excelling wisdom and power of God. As we shall see, God cannot be left out of the picture if we want to enjoy a happy and meaningful life. He must have had a purpose <span id="page8" class="pageNum" data-no="8" data-before-text="8"></span>in creating the universe, including our earth.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[101]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Let us turn our attention now to this small speck in the expanse of the universe​—earth itself. This earth has a particular beauty. It is clothed with color, and is enriched with a wonderful variety of living things. It has <em>life </em>on it. One of the astronauts that journeyed to the moon described it in these words:</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="si">“In the whole universe, wherever we looked, the only bit of color was back on the earth.

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[102]" class="sb"><span id="page9" class="pageNum" data-no="9" data-before-text="9"></span><sup>14 </sup>It is not too difficult to find out where life came from. A Bible writer pointed to that Source 3,000 years ago when he declared:</p>

<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="sb">Some hardened critics of the Bible have had to concede that God is the Source of life. Even evolutionist Darwin acknowledged that originally life must have been “breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one.”⁠<sup>4</sup> But if God could breathe life into “a few forms,” why would he not in the same way breathe it into hundreds of created “kinds,” each in its turn? The Bible says he did just that! He <em>created </em>each living thing “according to its kind.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:12-1:1:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 1:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:21-1:1:21" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:24-1:1:25" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 24, 25</a>) God’s creation of the first man is described in these words:</p>

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">According to the Bible, that is how human life got to be here, just 6,000 years ago​—<em>by direct creation from God. </em>It is vital that we understand that fact in order to appreciate that there is much more to life.</p>
<p id="p103" data-pid="103" class="qu">15. Could life have come about by chance? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:100:3-19:100:3" data-bid="51-1" class="b">Psalm 100:3</a>)</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" data-rel-pid="[103]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>In contrast with the Bible’s straightforward account of creation, some of the explanations by evolutionists read like fantasies. For example, one evolutionary scientist writes this way:</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="si"><em>“Once upon a time, </em>very long ago, <em>perhaps </em>two and a half billion years ago, under a deadly sun, in an ammoniated ocean topped by a poisonous atmosphere, in the midst of a soup of organic molecules, <span id="page10" class="pageNum" data-no="10" data-before-text="10"></span>a nucleic acid molecule came <em>accidentally </em>into being that could <em>somehow </em>bring about the existence of another like itself​—and from that all else would follow!” (Italics inserted)⁠<sup>5</sup></p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="sb">Does that convince you? Evolutionist Lecomte du Noüy calculated the chance that one protein molecule could produce itself, under favorable conditions, in an ocean of chemicals the size of the earth. He said it could happen only <em>once </em>in 10<sup>243 </sup>(that is the figure 1 followed by 243 zeros) <em>billions </em>of years.⁠<sup>6 </sup>However, a living cell is made up of, not one, but hundreds of protein molecules, as well as many other complex substances! Surely life did not come about by chance!</p>
<p id="p104" data-pid="104" class="qu">16. Why may evolution be termed a “myth”? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:3-54:1:4" data-bid="52-1" class="b">1 Timothy 1:3, 4</a>)</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" data-rel-pid="[104]" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup>There is so much in the evolution theory that conflicts with the facts! For example, it is an unchangeable genetic law for all living things, plant, animal and human, that each can reproduce <span id="page11" class="pageNum" data-no="11" data-before-text="11"></span>only according to its kind. There may be changes <em>within </em>the kind, as can be observed in the many types of dogs. But the dog <em>kind </em>always reproduces dogs. It cannot be crossed with the cat, or with other kinds. Much to the disappointment of the evolutionists, fossil remains in the rocks have failed to come up with the predicted “missing links” between kinds. Moreover, “mutations,” or cellular changes, have almost always been harmful​—the reverse of what evolution claims—​producing in the case of mankind only mongoloids or other deficient humans. No wonder that certain reputable scientists are now describing evolution by such terms as “myth,”⁠<sup>7 </sup>“judicious guessing”⁠<sup>8 </sup>and “the greatest fairy tale ever to masquerade under the name of science.”⁠<sup>9</sup></p>
<p id="p105" data-pid="105" class="qu">17. In what ways is man more wonderfully made than the animals? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:27-1:1:28" data-bid="53-1" class="b">Genesis 1:27, 28</a>)</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[105]" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>But man himself is no “myth.” He lives. His very existence as an intelligent, moral creature, made “in God’s image” and governed by conscience, sets him apart completely from all the lower forms of life. So, there should be much more to life than merely subsisting like animals. A tremendous gulf separates man from the animals. What animal spends as much as twenty years in caring for and training each of its young? <span id="page12" class="pageNum" data-no="12" data-before-text="12"></span>It is man alone that can exercise the marvelous qualities of love, kindness, foresight, inventiveness and appreciation for beauty, the arts and music.

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[106]" class="sb"><sup>18 </sup>Why has evolution found ready acceptance by so many persons today? One reason is that it has been the popular, fashionable thing for a person to go along with it. Also, it has provided an escape route for independent or immoral persons who want to ‘do their own thing’ without feeling responsibility to a Creator or his moral laws. In <em>The Outline of History, </em>H. G. Wells <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>describes how the theory of evolution developed, and says: “It was bringing nothing constructive . . . to replace the old moral stand-bys. A real demoralization ensued.”⁠<sup>10 </sup>It was contributing nothing toward making life worth while.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" data-rel-pid="[106]" class="sb"><sup>19 </sup>Historian Wells tells of a further result of evolutionary teaching as follows: “Prevalent people . . . believed that they prevailed by virtue of the Struggle for Existence, in which the strong and cunning get the better of the weak and confiding. . . . So it seemed right to them that the big dogs of the human pack should bully and subdue.”⁠<sup>11 </sup>Thus evolution provided “Christendom” with self-justification for waging brutal war. The book <em>Evolution and Christians </em>attributes the tragedy of the first world war in 1914 and later the evil excesses of Nazism to Darwinian teaching.⁠<sup>12 </sup>In the same way, evolution must accept its share of responsibility for the rise of Communism. Karl Marx is said to have rejoiced at reading Darwin’s <em>Origin of Species, </em>which he described as giving “the death blow” to God.⁠<sup>13</sup> He also said:</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="si">“Darwin’s book is very important and serves me as a basis for the class struggle in history.”⁠<sup>14</sup></p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="sb"><span id="page14" class="pageNum" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>To this day, Communistic nations pursue their goal of world domination on the basis of the evolutionary teaching of “survival of the fittest.” Other nations join the fight for survival and the result is the massive armaments race of this nuclear age. The life of all humankind is in jeopardy.</p>
<p id="p107" data-pid="107" class="qu">20. How could belief in evolution affect your own life? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:8-51:2:8" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Colossians 2:8</a>)</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" data-rel-pid="[107]" class="sb"><sup>20 </sup>How does this affect your own life? It can be quite damaging for you personally to get caught up in the evolution theory. If evolution were true, life would become purposeless and meaningless. It would be just the “rat race” of struggling to survive, and with only death as the final outcome. Believing in the “survival of the fittest,” the evolutionist has no incentive to love his fellowman, to live a decent moral life or to behave differently from brute beasts. Evolution is entirely negative in its effect on mankind. It cannot give a satisfactory answer to any of the questions about life. But the Bible can.</p>

<p id="p40" data-pid="40" data-rel-pid="[108]" class="sb"><sup>21 </sup>The situation may be compared to a family traveling along a beautiful highway. It leads through a glorious paradise. Everything is favorable <span id="page15" class="pageNum" data-no="15" data-before-text="15"></span>for a good journey. However, they see a broad road to the side with a sign: “Danger​—Do Not Enter.” Curiosity and an independent spirit get the better of them. They enter that road and travel farther and farther away from the highway. At last, there is a steep downgrade. They are now traveling out of control. It is impossible for them to make it back to the highway. Brakes have failed. There is no stopping. They plunge downhill faster and faster.

<p id="p41" data-pid="41" data-rel-pid="[108]" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>The Bible shows it is just like that with mankind.

But they failed to do so. They willfully strayed off the highway and they entered the roadway of sin that leads to death and destruction under God’s judgment. At <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Romans 5:12</a> we read: “Through one man sin entered into <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned.” Thus, because we are the descendants of disobedient Adam, we have all had to travel this disagreeable road, far removed from the perfection that the parents of the human family enjoyed in paradise. How bumpy and unpleasant has that road become in recent years! It is a broad one-way road, and none of the politicians or wise men of the world have been able to show the human family the way back.

At first sight, it looks extremely cramped. It would be difficult to make the turn into it. The large family of people who are now traveling recklessly down the broad road choose to ignore the narrow way. They prefer to go along with the crowd. The great majority of the people keep to the broad road for convenience and for the temporary thrills that it provides. They pay no heed to further warnings of danger ahead. But some alert persons turn into the narrow way. It presents some hardships for them, and they have to be watchful, but, in time, it becomes pleasant for traveling. And in the end it leads them to a restored paradise of plenty. What a pleasure it is for them to feast their eyes on that delightful, peaceful paradise!</p>
<p id="p43" data-pid="43" data-rel-pid="[109]" class="sb"><sup>24 </sup>Again, as the Bible shows, it is the same with <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>the human family. While the majority insist on their independence, and go along with the crowd in traveling the broad road to destruction, a way of return has opened up. While he was here on this earth, Jesus, the Son of God, called attention to this, saying: “I am the way and the truth and the life.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:6-43:14:6" data-bid="8-1" class="b">John 14:6</a>) Because Jesus faithfully did God’s will on earth, even to sacrificing his life in behalf of the human family, God appointed him to be “the Chief Agent of Life.” He also came into the world to “bear witness to the truth” and to make known God’s purposes. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:3:15-44:3:15" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 3:15;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:37-43:18:37" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> John 18:37</a>) He alone is able to show members of the human family the way back to the beautiful highway that leads on to the full enjoyment of a happy life in the earthly paradise of God.</p>

<p id="p45" data-pid="45" data-rel-pid="[111]" class="sb"><sup>26 </sup>It is by exercising faith in God’s Chief Agent of life that we can find the “way” to that life. Living is so different when it has purpose, and when there is firm hope of a satisfying, rewarding life stretching far into the future. And how may we realize that hope? Jesus himself answers, in prayer to his Father: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) By diligently searching the Scriptures, we can learn the truth; and by applying it daily, we can even now start <em>really </em>to live!</p>

<p id="p47" data-pid="47" data-rel-pid="[112]" class="sb"><sup>27 </sup>Admittedly, world conditions are worsening. In the big cities, poverty and crime are on the increase. Wherever you live, you are paying more for your bread, more for your meat, and the cost of just keeping alive is spiraling. In many places, lawlessness walks the streets.

However, God’s time has now arrived to replace Satan’s authority by a harmonious, loving rule of mankind through Christ’s heavenly kingdom. It is His time to bring those who love life right back to the highway to enjoy eternal life in happiness. But Satan refuses to vacate.

<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="ss"><strong>How Bible Prophecy Helps to Save Lives</strong></p>
<p id="p115" data-pid="115" class="qu">30. Why can you be confident that Bible prophecies concerning our day will be fulfilled?

<p id="p51" data-pid="51" data-rel-pid="[115]" class="sb"><sup>30 </sup>Many Bible prophecies have already had a remarkable fulfillment. For example, hundreds of years before Jesus appeared on this earth, these prophecies foretold the exact dates of his preaching activity​—29 to 33 C.E.​—as well as numerous details of his life and death. All these things were fulfilled. Also, Jesus himself spoke some outstanding prophecies. One of these was about “the conclusion of the system of things.” It had a <span id="page21" class="pageNum" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>notable fulfillment on the Jewish system of things in the first century.</p>
<p id="p116" data-pid="116" class="qu">31, 32. How did prophecy help to save lives in 70 C.E.? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:20-42:21:24" data-bid="66-1" class="b">Luke 21:20-24</a>)</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" data-rel-pid="[116]" class="sb"><sup>31 </sup>According to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:15-40:24:22" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> 15-22</a>, Jesus pointed forward to Jerusalem’s being besieged by the “disgusting thing,” the armies of imperial Rome. In his prophecy he said that when Christians saw this they should begin “fleeing to the mountains.” Thirty-four years later, when those armies actually came, they fulfilled many features of Jesus’ prophecy, such as encircling the city by “a fortification with pointed stakes” and penetrating to stand <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>even in the “holy place,” as far as to the western wall of Jerusalem’s temple. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:19:43-42:19:43" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Luke 19:43;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:15-40:24:15" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> Matthew 24:15</a>) But how could the Christians leave the city in this seemingly impossible situation?</p>
<p id="p53" data-pid="53" data-rel-pid="[116]" class="sb"><sup>32 </sup>Suddenly, and without apparent reason, the Roman armies withdrew! In obedience to Jesus’ command, the Christians could now flee for their lives to the mountains across the Jordan River. Later, the Roman armies returned under General Titus, and in 70 C.E. Jerusalem and its temple were razed to the ground. Siege, famine and the sword took the lives of 1,100,000 nationalistic Jews, and 97,000 were led captive into slavery, according to the historian Josephus. But by obeying Bible prophecy those who really loved life escaped with their lives!</p>
<p id="p117" data-pid="117" class="qu">33. What situation today parallels the last days of the Jewish system? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:25-42:21:26" data-bid="67-1" class="b">Luke 21:25, 26</a>)</p>
<p id="p54" data-pid="54" data-rel-pid="[117]" class="sb"><sup>33 </sup>Jesus was using these foretold events of the first century as a pattern of world-shaking happenings yet to occur in the generation from 1914 C.E. onward. Lives need to be saved today too! For now we have arrived at “the conclusion of the system of things,” the entire world system under Satan’s control. How clearly do events since 1914 prove this to be so! In final fulfillment of Jesus’ prophecy, that year saw “a beginning of pangs of distress” as ‘nation rose against nation’ in the bloodbath of World War I. As foretold, this was followed by “great earthquakes, . . . pestilences and food shortages.” A second world war, far more terrible than the first, followed, and the “increasing of lawlessness” is now plaguing the earth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:7-40:24:13" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Matthew 24:7-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:10-42:21:11" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> Luke 21:10, 11</a>) The nations are in anguish.

To aid all of such life-seeking persons, true Christians today engage in a lifesaving work in fulfillment of the further part of Jesus’ great prophecy: “And this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>.</p>

<p id="p56" data-pid="56" data-rel-pid="[119]" class="sb"><sup>35 </sup>Of course, we are most interested in knowing just when “the end will come.” For truly our lives are <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>involved!

For Jesus says concerning persons who <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>saw the “pangs of distress” start in 1914 C.E.: “This generation will by no means pass away until all these things occur.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:34-40:24:34" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Matthew 24:34</a>) Included in “all these things” is the destruction of the corrupted society of today, as Jesus had just described it: “Then there will be great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning until now, no, nor will occur again. In fact, unless those days were cut short, no flesh would be saved; but on account of the chosen ones those days will be cut short.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:21-40:24:22" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Matthew 24:21, 22</a>) If the “great tribulation” were not cut short, mankind would, of itself, perish off the earth! But, happily, all those who love God may escape with their lives. “Jehovah is guarding all those loving him, but all the wicked ones he will annihilate.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:20-19:145:20" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Psalm 145:20</a>) If you heed the Bible prophecy, you, too, can escape and keep on living.</p>

<p id="p58" data-pid="58" data-rel-pid="[120]" class="sb"><sup>36 </sup>Will you be among the survivors? That depends on whether you turn off the broad road that plunges on toward destruction. It depends on your obeying the road signs along the way that leads to life. If you really want to live, it is not too hard. It means learning to love God and neighbor. As <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:3-62:5:3" data-bid="22-1" class="b">1 John 5:3</a> states, “This is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments.” Some of the things that he requires of us are stated earlier in this letter of John’s (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:15-62:2:17" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1Jo 2:15-17</a>):</p>
<p id="p59" data-pid="59" class="si">“Do not be loving either the world or the things in the world.

Furthermore, the world is passing away and so is its desire, but he that does the will of God remains forever.”</p>
<p id="p60" data-pid="60" class="sb">In order to remain alive forever, receiving God’s protection and favor clear through the “great tribulation” and on into the restored paradise, we must turn away from the things that God hates​—the immorality, the greed, the dishonesty, the lying, the thievery and the conflicts of the world. By doing this we can also make life worth living now.</p>

It means we should separate ourselves from the aims and programs of a world that is actually heading for destruction under its god and ruler, Satan the “wicked one.” In our daily lives, we need to be nonparticipants in worldly activities that are in conflict with God’s rule. As <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Matthew 24:3 and</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:31-40:25:31" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Mt 25:31</a> show, the sign of “the conclusion of the system of things” is also the sign of Jesus’ “presence” in heaven with Kingdom power. Therefore, from the year 1914, the prophecy is also fulfilled that “the kingdom of the world did become the kingdom of our Lord [God] and of his Christ, and he will rule as king forever and ever.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:11:15-66:11:15" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Revelation 11:15</a>) Now is the time to give support to that kingdom!

Can we, then, conscientiously support the wars, the revolutions, the political movements or the worldly <span id="page27" class="pageNum" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span>schemes of our time? These are certain to fail in their objectives. For they are claiming to do what God’s kingdom <em>alone </em>can do. The entire system is doomed. So why share in trying to patch it up?

I am making all things new.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:4-66:21:5" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4, 5</a>) In the new system of things, the heavenly king, Jesus Christ, will rule lovingly as an “Eternal Father” over the entire family of mankind. “To the abundance of [his] princely rule and to peace there will be no end.” Justice and righteousness will be the foundations of that kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:6-23:9:7" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Isaiah 9:6, 7</a>) How satisfying and enjoyable life will be under those conditions! It will have purpose, in doing God’s will on earth with love toward our fellowman. Jesus assures us that even those in the graves “will hear his voice” and come forth to enjoy that paradise earth.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="35-1" class="b">John 5:28, 29</a>.</p>

<p id="p70" data-pid="70" data-rel-pid="[127]" class="sb"><sup>43 </sup>This “present wicked system of things” is about to take its plunge off the broad road into destruction. But you need not take the plunge with it. In association with God’s own people​—those who love life—​you may have your life spared when God comes forth to destroy the bloodguilty nations of earth:</p>
<p id="p71" data-pid="71" class="si">“Go, my people, enter into your interior rooms, and shut your doors behind you. Hide yourself for but a moment until the denunciation passes over. <span id="page31" class="pageNum" data-no="31" data-before-text="31"></span>For, look! Jehovah is coming forth from his place to call to account the error of the inhabitant of the land against him, and the land will certainly expose her bloodshed and will no longer cover over her killed ones.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:26:20-23:26:21" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Isaiah 26:20, 21</a>.</p>
<p id="p128" data-pid="128" class="qu">44. What grand opportunity now lies before you? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:30:19-5:30:20" data-bid="80-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 30:19, 20</a>)</p>
<p id="p72" data-pid="72" data-rel-pid="[128]" class="sb"><sup>44 </sup>So, by starting to live the real life now, according to Bible standards, you may share with the zealous, forward-looking society of God’s people in passing alive through the “great tribulation,” and never dying off this earth. Indeed, it can confidently be said, a “great multitude” now living may never die!</p>
<p id="p129" data-pid="129" class="qu">45. (a) What is it that <em>works </em>now and in the future? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:11-54:6:12" data-bid="81-1" class="b">1 Timothy 6:11, 12</a>) (b) How may you show that you appreciate that there is much more to life? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:6:17-54:6:19" data-bid="82-1" class="b">1 Timothy 6:17-19</a>)</p>
<p id="p73" data-pid="73" data-rel-pid="[129]" class="sb"><sup>45 </sup>In the living society of his witnesses throughout the earth, Jehovah has produced something that <em>works </em>right now! It can <em>work </em>too for you! And it will <em>work </em>outstandingly in the paradise earth, where at last “every breathing thing” will praise the great Life-Giver, Jehovah God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:150:6-19:150:6" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Psalm 150:6</a>) Truly, there is much more to life!</p>

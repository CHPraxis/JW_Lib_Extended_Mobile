Question Box
● Are new attenders at our meetings welcome to comment even though their lives are not in harmony with Bible principles?
When people show an interest in the truth, we are happy to invite them to our meetings, knowing they will benefit in many ways. Some, by attending just one meeting, through listening and observation, have become convinced that ‘God is with us.’ We do not inquire into their personal lives before extending such invitations.
Nor do we need to make such inquiry before allowing them to comment. Participation is a part of our educational arrangement, so if a new person raised his hand, we would not refuse to acknowledge it. He would no doubt benefit by sharing, and his participation would probably also encourage others.​—Heb. 10:24, 25.
What of those newly associated who are tobacco users or who have some immorality in their background? Well, would not the above reasoning still apply as long as they conducted themselves in a decorous and respectable manner? Commenting does not make them members of the congregation. They are newcomers and learning. Very likely, as have others in the past, they will make improvement, clean up their lives and make progress toward dedication and baptism. We cannot expect that when they first begin attending they will be completely free of all wrongdoing.
The elders, however, and especially the one conducting, must be alert to watch for any notorious persons who might try to sneak into the congregation to do harm, even as Jude warned. So, in general, nonbaptized, newly interested ones may be called upon to comment, if raising the hand.

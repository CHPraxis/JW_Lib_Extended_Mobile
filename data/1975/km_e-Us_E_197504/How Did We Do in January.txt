How Did We Do in January?
While weather was difficult to cope with in various parts of the country, and there was the added problem of sickness, it was a pleasure to see 524,492 proclaimers of the Kingdom message out in January. This represents a 7.1Â percent increase over January of last year. We obtained 122,536 new subscriptions and placed 624,130 books. What a joy to see so many accepting our Bible study aids, opening additional opportunities for us to make return visits and start Bible studies!

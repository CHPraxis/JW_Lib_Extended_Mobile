<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● F. L. Redefer, professor emeritus of higher education at New York University, does not believe that colleges really prepare people for life. Why? Because these cause them to look at life too narrowly. “What is new about today’s critical problems,” he writes, “is that none of them can be solved on a national basis. . . . Before one becomes a lawyer, a doctor, a business executive, or a teacher, one needs to be a <em>man​</em>—who knows himself and others, who thinks of himself as a man before he thinks of himself as a citizen of any particular country . . . He needs to be a man prepared to live and share with others the planet earth.”</p>

Do the Churches Represent God and the Bible?
Has their influence on the nations been a genuinely Christian one? Have they been a force for peace, or have they fomented wars? Do they uphold Bible standards of morality?
The 192-page book Is the Bible Really the Word of God? presents soundly documented reports on these questions. Read the chapter “Do Christendom’s Churches Represent the Bible?” If you like to hear the truth, you will enjoy it. Only 25 cents, postpaid.
Please send the hardbound book Is the Bible Really the Word of God? I enclose 25 cents.

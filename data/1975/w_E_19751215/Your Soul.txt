Your Soul
◇ Most churches of Christendom teach that you have a soul within you that survives the body and goes on to the spirit realm. But is this doctrine based on the inspired Scriptures?
In the recent book Western Civilization: Its Genesis and Destiny, Professor Norman F. Cantor, admitted that it is not:
“Christian thinkers of the second century, particularly those in Alexandria, emulated Philo’s attempt to synthesize Platonism and Judaism. . . . Their God was pure spirit; man was a union of spirit and matter, of soul and body; and salvation was made possible by the separation of the soul from the body and its flight to join the angelic hosts surrounding the God-Spirit. This view was a marked departure from Hebraic thought, which viewed man as nefesh [soul], the whole, undifferentiated human being.”
The fact is that the entire Bible teaches that man is a soul and that the prospect for future life for one who dies depends upon a future resurrection.

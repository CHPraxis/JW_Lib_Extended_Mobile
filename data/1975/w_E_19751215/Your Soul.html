<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">◇ Most churches of Christendom teach that you have a soul within you that survives the body and goes on to the spirit realm. But is this doctrine based on the inspired Scriptures?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In the recent book <em>Western Civilization: Its Genesis and Destiny, </em>Professor Norman F. Cantor, admitted that it is not:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Christian thinkers of the second century, particularly those in Alexandria, emulated Philo’s attempt to synthesize Platonism and Judaism. . . . Their God was pure spirit; man was a union of spirit and matter, of soul and body; and salvation was made possible by the separation of the soul from the body and its flight to join the angelic hosts surrounding the God-Spirit. This view was a marked departure from Hebraic thought, which viewed man as <em>nefesh </em>[soul], the whole, undifferentiated human being.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The fact is that the entire Bible teaches that man <em>is </em>a soul and that the prospect for future life for one who dies depends upon a future resurrection.</p>

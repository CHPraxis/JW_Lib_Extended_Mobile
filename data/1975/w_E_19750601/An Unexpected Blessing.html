<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">✔ In an African country, violence erupted on the day that a district assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses ended. On returning home, a new Witness, who had formerly belonged to the political party that started the uprising, found soldiers and the local court waiting for him. The question was, What had he been doing during the rebellion? He told them that he had attended the assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses. But that was not enough. They wanted proof. With soldiers accompanying him, the Witness was permitted to get his assembly program. After the entire program was read, the chief declared the Witness innocent and even encouraged him to continue his preaching activity. The villagers marveled at this, saying: “The God to whom you are praying is the living God!” How grateful this Witness was for having attended the assembly!</p>

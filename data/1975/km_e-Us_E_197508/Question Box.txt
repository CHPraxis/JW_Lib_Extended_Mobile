Question Box
● How should congregations handle copies of “EXTRA” magazines received?
When the Society has current magazines left over, after all orders have been filled, these are sent to congregations in rolls with the word “EXTRA” on the address label. The “EXTRA” quantity, about 10 percent of your regular order, is sent about four to six times a year.
Congregations are not charged for “EXTRA” magazines. They are to be placed with publishers on the regular contribution basis, with the money being applied to the magazine account. However, you should not request pioneer credit for “EXTRA” magazines used by pioneers.
If publishers do not take the “EXTRA” magazines on the regular contribution basis, when copies are no longer current they may be given free to publishers to leave at not-at-homes. At any door, please leave only one copy of an older magazine and in an inconspicuous place. Do not use mailboxes, as this is against postal regulations; however, open-ended mail slots may be used.
It would be good for the brother handling the magazines to advise the field overseer when these “EXTRA” magazines arrive, and then the congregation can be notified that extra magazines are available.

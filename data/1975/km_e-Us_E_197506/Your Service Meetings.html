<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="ss"><strong>WEEK STARTING JUNE 15</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>12 min: </strong>Song 9. In opening meeting, discuss <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:28:20-20:28:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 28:20</a> and tie in need for faithfulness with discussion of Branch Letter.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn"><strong>12 min: </strong>“<a class="it" href="jwpub://p/E:201975201/">Faithfulness​—Our Way of Life</a>.” Question-and-answer discussion.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>24 min: </strong>Imitate the Faithfulness of Daniel. Speaker can develop Bible account and let audience answer questions.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Daniel was called by God a very desirable man.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:10:11-27:10:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Dan. 10:11</a>) How fine it is if God can say the same of us. And he does to certain faithful ones, for they are called “the desirable things of all the nations.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/37:2:7-37:2:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hag. 2:7</a>) By considering Daniel’s faithful course we can build up our own faithfulness so that we can be “desirable” in God’s eyes.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">(1) Daniel reflected his earlier training in God’s law when refusing as a youth to pollute himself with the delicacies of the king. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:1:8-27:1:9" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Dan. 1:8, 9</a>) How is he an example for us today when some foods are known to be contaminated with blood or when one is under pressure to take a blood transfusion?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">(2) Daniel never credited himself with wisdom. He did not look to his own ability. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:17-27:2:18" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Dan. 2:17, 18,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:2:28-27:2:30" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 28-30</a>) What does Daniel’s example show about how to get true wisdom?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">(3) Daniel was fearless but respectful in speaking of God’s purposes when before King Belshazzar and his officials. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:5:22-27:5:28" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Dan. 5:22-28</a>) How was Daniel an example in this regard for Christians today?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb">(4) Daniel was not at all ambitious for position, authority or power. He acknowledged Jehovah as the source of the revelations he received. He carried out his responsibilities thoroughly but impartially and did not use his position to bring him special privileges or favors. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:5:16-27:5:17" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Dan. 5:16, 17</a>) How can a knowledge of what Daniel did help us all to have the right viewpoint?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">(5) Daniel kept practicing true worship of God when mischief was framed by law against him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:6:5-27:6:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Dan. 6:5-11</a>) How might we be confronted with a similar situation? What does <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:6:5-27:6:5" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Daniel 6:5</a> show as to what our conduct should be? How does his deliverance give us confidence and assurance in the face of persecution?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:6:16-27:6:24" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Dan. 6:16-24</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">(6) Daniel’s long years of faithfulness resulted in the happy assurance of a resurrection. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:12:13-27:12:13" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Dan. 12:13</a>) How is this a comfort to us?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:6:10-58:6:12" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Heb. 6:10-12</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">In discussing the above points, all or part of the scriptures cited may be read, as time allows. The discussion can then be centered around the scriptures.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Speaker can point out that God’s people are continually being taught by Jehovah. God is directing them in their preaching work and their congregational activities, even as he did in past years. Hence, as individuals, we have reason to appreciate the instruction and direction we are receiving from Jehovah through his organization.</p>

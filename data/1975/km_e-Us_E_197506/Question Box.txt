●  What are some factors to have in mind in arranging for a wedding ceremony at the Kingdom Hall?
It is assumed that a couple desiring to have their wedding at the Kingdom Hall wish to put the emphasis on the spiritual aspects of the wedding. When elders on the service committee grant permission for the use of the Kingdom Hall, it is expected that the hall will not be rearranged beyond simple changes the elders approve of. For example, some adjustments in the seating arrangements may be advisable if the chairs are movable, flowers may be desired, and so forth.
As to a rehearsal, the elders may wish to permit such if it is held at a time that does not interfere with congregation activities. This can aid those in the wedding party to familiarize themselves with the procedure they will follow at the wedding. But reasonableness should also be exercised as to the extent and elaborateness of rehearsals.
If the couple desires that a brief announcement be made at a congregation meeting of the time of their wedding as an event that will take place at the Kingdom Hall, this may be done. Those hearing the announcement can, of course, decide personally whether or not they desire to attend. (In making wedding arrangements a review of the January 15, 1969, and May 1, 1974, issues of The Watchtower will be helpful.)

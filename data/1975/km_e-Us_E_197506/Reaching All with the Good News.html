<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>With the beginning of summer, special efforts are suggested to reach those parts of the territory that may not have been covered recently. This will include rural territory for many congregations. In urban assignments, certain sections or maybe the business territory may need attention. Under the supervision of the field overseer, perhaps group work may be planned to cover all this territory during the summer months. Can you share in this special effort?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>In working rurals and small towns that are some distance away, many have found it possible to spend long days in the field service. This gets the maximum accomplished after spending time traveling to the territory. Some groups have taken along a picnic lunch to eat after their morning service and before spending several hours more in the field service in the afternoon. Many fine experiences have been enjoyed by those who have arranged to share in covering territory worked less frequently. Do not forget that in the summertime there may be vegetables and other items to trade if some desire to have the literature but do not have the money.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>In rural territory where the distance between houses is often great, it is advisable to keep the car groups small. Where a small town is to be worked, part of the car group might be left off there, along with a quantity of literature, while the others work the scattered territory.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4  </sup>When interested ones are located, plans should be made to visit them again in an effort to start a Bible study. If studies cannot be conducted every week, a group might go into an area every two weeks to conduct the studies started. The Bible study overseer might coordinate this as needed. Jehovah’s blessing can be expected on these special efforts to reach people with the good news in the “byways” of our territory assignment.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In harmony with the March theme, “Imitate God by Showing Mercy for Mankind.” 538,980 shared in field service, 31,279 more than last March. The month was climaxed with the Memorial and special talk in 6,929 congregations. Thousands assembled with us for the first time and we rejoice now to be able to help them grow strong in faith.</p>

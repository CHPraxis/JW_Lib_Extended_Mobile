Your Service Meetings
WEEK STARTING JUNE 15
12 min: Song 9. In opening meeting, discuss Proverbs 28:20 and tie in need for faithfulness with discussion of Branch Letter.
12 min: “Faithfulness​—Our Way of Life.” Question-and-answer discussion.
24 min: Imitate the Faithfulness of Daniel. Speaker can develop Bible account and let audience answer questions.
Daniel was called by God a very desirable man.” (Dan. 10:11) How fine it is if God can say the same of us. And he does to certain faithful ones, for they are called “the desirable things of all the nations.” (Hag. 2:7) By considering Daniel’s faithful course we can build up our own faithfulness so that we can be “desirable” in God’s eyes.
(1) Daniel reflected his earlier training in God’s law when refusing as a youth to pollute himself with the delicacies of the king. (Dan. 1:8, 9) How is he an example for us today when some foods are known to be contaminated with blood or when one is under pressure to take a blood transfusion?
(2) Daniel never credited himself with wisdom. He did not look to his own ability. (Dan. 2:17, 18, 28-30) What does Daniel’s example show about how to get true wisdom?
(3) Daniel was fearless but respectful in speaking of God’s purposes when before King Belshazzar and his officials. (Dan. 5:22-28) How was Daniel an example in this regard for Christians today?
(4) Daniel was not at all ambitious for position, authority or power. He acknowledged Jehovah as the source of the revelations he received. He carried out his responsibilities thoroughly but impartially and did not use his position to bring him special privileges or favors. (Dan. 5:16, 17) How can a knowledge of what Daniel did help us all to have the right viewpoint?
(5) Daniel kept practicing true worship of God when mischief was framed by law against him. (Dan. 6:5-11) How might we be confronted with a similar situation? What does Daniel 6:5 show as to what our conduct should be? How does his deliverance give us confidence and assurance in the face of persecution?​—Dan. 6:16-24.
(6) Daniel’s long years of faithfulness resulted in the happy assurance of a resurrection. (Dan. 12:13) How is this a comfort to us?​—Heb. 6:10-12.
In discussing the above points, all or part of the scriptures cited may be read, as time allows. The discussion can then be centered around the scriptures.

18 min:: “They Will All Be Taught by Jehovah.” Enthusiastic talk on 1975 Yearbook, p. 144 ¶3 to p. 168 ¶1. Tell the story, though every point cannot be covered. Emphasize that now, as in the past, God’s servants enjoy divine direction in their activities and are “taught by Jehovah.” (Isa. 54:13; John 6:45) The following questions can be used in presenting the material and, as time permits, a few can be answered by the audience: (1) God’s people expected what to happen in 1925, and how did faithful ones react when those expectations were not fulfilled? (P. 146) (2) Eager to be “taught by Jehovah,” what did the Bible Students eventually do about Christmas and other holidays? (P. 147) (3) Advancement in understanding led to what change in viewpoint regarding the cross? (Pp. 148, 149) (4) How did Jehovah make his people aware of the significance of Isaiah 43:12, especially in the year 1931? And how did A. H. Macmillan express himself about what took place that year in connection with the convention at Columbus, Ohio? (Pp. 149-151) (5) During the Great Depression, how did Jehovah’s witnesses use bartering methods at times to spread Scriptural truth? (Pp. 152, 153) (6) Jehovah’s spirit made his people fearless during the divisional campaigns. What were those campaigns like? (Pp. 153, 154) (7) In 1935, what was learned about the “great multitude,” or “great crowd,” of Revelation chapter seven? (P. 156) (8) How was Kingdom-preaching done with sound cars? (Pp. 157, 158) (9) The phonograph work was carried on in what way? (Pp. 158, 159) (10) Beginning in 1940, how was street work done, and with what public reaction to it? (Pp. 160-164) (11) In 1932, 1937 and 1938, what changes were made in filling positions of responsibility within the Christian congregation? (Pp. 164-166) (12) How did zone service strengthen Jehovah’s people? (Pp. 167, 168)
Speaker can point out that God’s people are continually being taught by Jehovah. God is directing them in their preaching work and their congregational activities, even as he did in past years. Hence, as individuals, we have reason to appreciate the instruction and direction we are receiving from Jehovah through his organization.

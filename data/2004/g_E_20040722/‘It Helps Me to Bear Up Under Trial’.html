<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is how one reader from Connecticut, U.S.A., described the book <em>Draw Close to Jehovah. </em>“I am studying a little of it every day,” she stated. “On those days when depression makes it hard for me even to breathe, a short study helps me to bear up under the trial.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">She continued: “The picture of the tender shepherd on page 69 warmed my heart. And I appreciated the point on page 28, in paragraph 8, about Moses’ experience at the burning bush when ‘even the surrounding ground became holy as a result of its connection with Jehovah!’ If Jehovah can make even the dirt holy, then maybe there is a little hope for me. This thought has profoundly helped me because I deal with recurring depression.”</p>

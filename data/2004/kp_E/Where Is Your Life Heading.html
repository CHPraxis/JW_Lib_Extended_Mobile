<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">• Many people are so wrapped up in the affairs of daily life that they give little thought to where they are heading.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">• The Bible alerts us to wonderful events ahead. It also warns of a coming global upheaval in human institutions. For us to benefit and to avoid calamity, positive action is urgent.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">• There are some people who know what the Bible says and try to apply it but who let the anxieties of life push them off course.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">• Are you happy with the direction that your life is taking? When you plan activities, do you consider how these could affect your long-term goals in life?</p>

<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sc"><strong>Are Your Choices Leading You to Where You Really Want to Go?</strong></p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="se"><strong>CONSIDER THESE QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sc"><strong>ENTERTAINMENT/RECREATION: </strong>Does my choice of recreation refresh me? Does it involve thrills that could endanger my health or even cripple me for life? Is it a form of “fun” that involves excitement for perhaps a few hours but that can bring long-term heartache? Even if the entertainment that I choose is wholesome, am I spending so much time at it that it crowds out more important things?</p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="se"><strong>MY JOB OR MY CAREER: </strong>Does it serve as a means of support, or am I really a slave to it? Does it make demands that are ruining my health? Would I prefer to work overtime on my job or to spend time with my mate or my children? If my employer demands work that disturbs my conscience or that frequently crowds out spiritual interests, will I do that work in order to keep my job?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="se"><strong>MY HEALTH: </strong>Do I take it for granted, or am I consistent about safeguarding it? Does it dominate my conversation? Does the way I treat it show concern for my family?</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="se"><strong>PERSONAL HAPPINESS: </strong>Is this my first consideration? Do I put it ahead of the happiness of my mate or my family? Is the way in which I seek it consistent with being a worshiper of the true God?</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="se"><strong>MY MATE: </strong>Do I view my mate as my companion simply when this happens to suit me? Do I treat my mate with honor, as one who is entitled to personal dignity? Does belief in God influence the way I view my mate?</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="se"><strong>MY PARENTS: </strong>If still a minor, am I obedient to my parents​—answering respectfully, doing assigned chores, coming home at whatever time they set, avoiding associations and activities that they warn against? If an adult, do I listen to my parents with respect, giving them suitable help when this is needed? Is the way I deal with them governed by my convenience or by the counsel of God’s Word?</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="se"><strong>MY CHILDREN: </strong>Do I feel a responsibility to teach my children proper moral values, or do I expect the schools to do that? Do I spend time with my children, or do I expect toys, TV, or a computer to keep them occupied? Do I discipline my children consistently when they ignore God’s reminders, or do I do it mainly when I am irritated?</p>
<p id="p30" data-pid="30" class="se"><strong>A NICE HOME, FINE CLOTHES: </strong>What dictates the attention I give to my appearance and my possessions​—the impression I hope to make on the neighbors? the welfare of my family? the fact that I am a worshiper of God?</p>
<p id="p31" data-pid="31" class="se"><strong>BEING THE BEST AT WHATEVER I DO: </strong>Do I feel that it is important to do things well? Do I strive to be the best? Am I disturbed if someone else does something better?</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="se"><strong>WORSHIP OF GOD: </strong>Is having the approval of God more important to me than the approval of my mate, my children, my parents, or my employer? In order to maintain a comfortable life-style, would I be willing to push service to God into second place?</p>

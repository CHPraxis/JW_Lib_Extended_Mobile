<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sc"><strong>Does God Really Care?</strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sc">  Distressed by shocking events or by severe personal loss, many people wonder why God does not intervene to prevent such things.</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="se"><strong>God does care. </strong>He provides sound guidance and genuine relief now. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:28-40:11:30" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 11:28-30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:16-55:3:17" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 2 Timothy 3:16, 17</a>) He has laid the basis for permanently putting an end to violence, sickness, and death. His provisions show that he cares not merely for people of one nation but for people of all nations, tribes, and tongues.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:10:34-44:10:35" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 10:34, 35</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="se"><strong>How much do we care? </strong>Do you know who the Creator of heaven and earth is? What is his name? What is his purpose? He answers these questions in the Bible. There he tells us what steps he is taking to put an end to violence as well as sickness and death. In order to benefit, what is required on our part? We need to learn about him and his purpose. How can we expect to benefit from his provisions unless we show faith in him? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 3:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:6-58:11:6" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Hebrews 11:6</a>) It is also necessary to obey his requirements. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:3-62:5:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 John 5:3</a>) <em>Do you care </em>enough to do that?</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE Bible, the written Word of God, fills us with hope when it says: “There are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to his promise, and in these righteousness is to dwell.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">What is the “new heavens”? The Bible associates heaven with rulership. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:49-44:7:49" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 7:49</a>) The “new heavens” is a new government that will rule over the earth. It is new because it will replace the present system of rulership; it is also a new development in the outworking of God’s purpose. It is the Kingdom for which Jesus taught us to pray. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:10-40:6:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 6:10</a>) Since God is its Source and he dwells in heaven, it is called “the kingdom of the heavens.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:21-40:7:21" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 7:21</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">What is the “new earth”? It is not a new globe, since the Bible clearly states that the earth will be inhabited forever. The “new earth” is a new human society. It will be new because the wicked will have been cut off. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:21-20:2:22" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:21, 22</a>) All who then live will honor and obey the Creator and will live in harmony with his requirements. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:22:27-19:22:27" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 22:27</a>) People of all nations are being invited to learn those requirements and to bring their lives into harmony with them now. Are you doing that?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In God’s new world, everyone will respect His rulership. Does love for God move you to obey him? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:3-62:5:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 John 5:3</a>) Is that evident in your home? at work or at school? in the way that you are using your life?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In that new world, human society will be united in worship of the true God. Do you worship the Creator of heaven and earth? Does your worship truly unite you with fellow worshipers of all nations, all races, all languages?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:86:9-19:86:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 86:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:2:2-23:2:4" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Isaiah 2:2-4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:3:9-36:3:9" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> Zephaniah 3:9</a>.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sc"><strong>The God Who Promises These Things</strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sc">  He is the Creator of the physical heavens and of planet Earth. He is the one whom Jesus Christ identified as “the only true God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="9-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="se">  The majority of mankind honor gods of their own making. Millions bow before lifeless images. Others glorify human institutions, materialistic philosophies, or their own desires. Even those who claim to use the Bible do not all honor the name of the one it identifies as “the true God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:4:35-5:4:35" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 4:35</a>.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="se">  Concerning himself, the Creator says: “I am Jehovah. That is my name.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:5-23:42:5" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isaiah 42:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:8-23:42:8" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 8</a>) This name appears some 7,000 times in the Bible in its original languages. Jesus Christ taught his followers to pray: “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:9" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="se">  What sort of person is the true God? He describes himself as one who is “merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and truth” and as one who by no means grants exemption from punishment to those who willfully violate his commandments. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:34:6-2:34:7" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Exodus 34:6, 7</a>) The history of his dealings with humankind confirms the truthfulness of that description.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="se">  Both the name and the person represented by that name are to be sanctified, or treated as holy. As the Creator and Universal Sovereign, he is entitled to our obedience and all our worship. Do you personally give these to him?</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sc"><strong>Will You Benefit?</strong></p>
<p id="p24" data-pid="24" class="sc">  God cannot lie!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:2-56:1:2" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Titus 1:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" class="se">  Jehovah declares: “My word . . . will not return to me without results, but it will certainly do that in which I have delighted, and it will have certain success in that for which I have sent it.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:11-23:55:11" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="se">  Jehovah is already creating “new heavens and a new earth.” The heavenly government is already in operation. The foundation for the “new earth” has already been laid.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="se">  After telling about some of the marvelous things that “a new heaven and a new earth” will bring to humankind, Revelation quotes God himself, the Universal Sovereign, as saying: “Look! I am making all things new.” Also, he says: “Write, because these words are faithful and true.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:1-66:21:1" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Revelation 21:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:5-66:21:5" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> 5</a>.</p>
<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="se">  The crucial question is, Are we making the needed adjustments in order to be counted worthy to be a part of that “new earth” under the “new heavens”?</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A woman in Jalisco, Mexico, wrote a letter to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Mexico. She requested: “Please send me a number of the brochures <em>When Someone You Love Dies. </em>I am not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, but I share many of your ideas.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The writer explained the reason for her request, saying: “I want the brochures because I think they would be good to give to some of the people who buy in our flower shop. I am referring to those who come to buy wreaths and who are, at times, the wife, children, or husband of the deceased. I feel that these brochures can be of great help to them.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Perhaps you or someone you know would also receive comfort from reading this 32-page brochure. It answers such questions as: How can I live with my grief? How can others help? What hope is there for those who have died?</p>

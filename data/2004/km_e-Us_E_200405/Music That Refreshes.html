<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Singing and music are an integral part of true worship. In ancient Israel, Asaph and his brothers sang: “Give thanks to Jehovah, you people. . . . Sing to him, make melody to him, concern yourselves with all his wonderful acts.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/13:16:8-13:16:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Chron. 16:8, 9</a>) Today we raise our voices in song to Jehovah at our weekly congregation meetings. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:19-49:5:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Eph. 5:19</a>) What a marvelous opportunity this is to give praise to his name!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:69:30-19:69:30" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 69:30</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Listening to <em>Kingdom Melodies, </em>orchestral arrangements of Kingdom songs, can fill our mind with spiritual thoughts. “As the melodies are played, I hear the words in my mind,” explained one sister. “What a fine way to keep Jehovah in my thoughts while enjoying music!”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:4:8-50:4:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Phil. 4:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Occasions to Enjoy Them: </strong>Playing <em>Kingdom Melodies </em>at home creates a warm, spiritual atmosphere that contributes to family peace. “We play this [music] over and over in our home and car and never tire of the stirring arrangements,” wrote one family. “Often <em>Kingdom Melodies </em>have provided the right peaceful mood when getting ready for Christian meetings or when traveling to an assembly.” A sister said: “They’re a real lift to listen to when I’m doing housework​—whoever thought I’d be joyful while folding laundry? I plan to play this music when I find my spirits down. The music has such an exhilarating effect! . . . Every song evokes happiness.” Are there occasions when such refreshing music would benefit you?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Much of today’s music reflects the world’s spirit. Parents can help their children to cultivate a taste for wholesome music by making good use of the <em>Kingdom Melodies </em>recordings. Many Bible students and interested people would also be pleased to know about these beautiful spiritual songs, which glorify Jehovah and uplift the spirit.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:47:1-19:47:2" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 47:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:47:6-19:47:7" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 6, 7</a>.</p>

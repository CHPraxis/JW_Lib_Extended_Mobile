Show Your Thankfulness
1 Although we live in “critical times hard to deal with,” we have many reasons to be thankful to Jehovah. (2 Tim. 3:1) Foremost among these is the precious gift of his Son in our behalf. (John 3:16) Further, while those in false religion are starving spiritually, we enjoy an abundance of spiritual food. (Isa. 65:13) We are part of a worldwide brotherhood and are privileged to share in the thrilling expansion of true worship. (Isa. 2:3, 4; 60:4-10, 22) How can we show our thankfulness to Jehovah for the blessings he showers upon us?​—Col. 3:15, 17.
2 Joyful, Wholehearted Service: When discussing material giving, the apostle Paul wrote: “God loves a cheerful giver.” (2 Cor. 9:7) This principle also applies to our service to God. Thankfulness is reflected in our enthusiasm for the truth, our joy at Christian meetings, our zeal in the field ministry, and our cheerfulness in carrying out the divine will.​—Ps. 107:21, 22; 119:14; 122:1; Rom. 12:8, 11.
3 In ancient Israel the Law did not stipulate a specific amount for certain offerings. Each worshiper could show his gratitude by giving “in proportion to the blessing of Jehovah” that he had received. (Deut. 16:16, 17) Similarly today, a grateful heart will impel us to do as much as our circumstances allow in the Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work. The summer months often provide added opportunities to show our thankfulness. Some take advantage of time off from work or school and the longer daylight hours to increase their time spent in field service, even to auxiliary pioneer. Can you expand your ministry this summer?
4 Overflowing With Thanks: A major way we express our thanks to Jehovah is in prayer. (1 Thess. 5:17, 18) God’s Word urges us to be “overflowing with faith in thanksgiving.” (Col. 2:7) Even when we are very busy or are under stress, we should always include thanksgiving in our daily prayers. (Phil. 4:6) Yes, by means of our ministry as well as our prayers, may we “be rich with many expressions of thanks to God.”​—2 Cor. 9:12.

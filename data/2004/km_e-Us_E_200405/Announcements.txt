Announcements
▪ Literature offer for May: Feature individual copies of both The Watchtower and Awake! When making return visits on interested people, which may include visiting those who attend the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the organization, concentrate on placing the Worship God book. Every effort should be made to start a home Bible study, especially if some individuals have already studied the Knowledge book and the Require brochure. June: Learn From the Great Teacher. If individuals say that they have no children, offer the Require brochure. When using the brochure, concentrate on starting home Bible studies. July and August: Offer the Knowledge book or the Require brochure. When householders already have these publications, use another appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock.
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on June 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. When this has been done, make an announcement to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.
▪ Donations made by check and put in the local Kingdom Hall contribution boxes for the worldwide work and the Kingdom Hall Fund should be made payable to “Jehovah’s Witnesses.” Donations made by check at district conventions and those sent to the branch office should be made payable to “Watch Tower.” The branch office financial address is Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, c/o Office of the Secretary and Treasurer, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483.
▪ While attending the “Walk With God” District Convention, keep in mind the importance of taking brief notes, which will help you to participate in the oral review to be scheduled on the Service Meeting later in the year.
▪ DISTRICT CONVENTION CHANGE: The dates and location for the Armenian-language district convention have been changed to August 27-29, 2004, at the Assembly Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 1001 Parkridge Ave., Norco, California.
▪ Beginning with the May literature shipment, the annual supply of congregation forms is being shipped to congregations as forms become available. Instructions regarding forms distribution will appear on the shipment packing list. When there is more than one congregation in a Kingdom Hall auditorium, the literature coordinator should make sure that each congregation receives its supply of forms as soon as they arrive.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">True Christians share in the public ministry of spreading the good news. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:17-50:2:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Phil. 2:17</a>) As a means to that end, some basic brochures, tracts, and articles in 20 languages have been on the Internet at www.watchtower.org. This Web site is not designed to distribute current publications to Jehovah’s Witnesses. Its objective is to make available <em>to the public </em>accurate information about what Jehovah’s Witnesses teach from the Bible.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Recently, there has been a significant addition to our official Web site. This is the brochure <em>What Does God Require of Us? </em>in over 220 languages. Also, with the issues of January 1 and January 8, 2004, <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>in all languages began showing our Web address on the back page.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">How can you use this tool? Well, you may meet a person who seems interested but understands only another language. If he has access to the Internet, you can point out the Web address on the back page of <em>The Watchtower </em>or <em>Awake! </em>That way he may be able to examine the <em>Require </em>brochure in his native tongue until you can return with literature in his language. Or you may be able to refer the call to the congregation or group that cares for his language.</p>

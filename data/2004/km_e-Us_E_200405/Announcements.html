<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>May: </strong>Feature individual copies of both <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>When making return visits on interested people, which may include visiting those who attend the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the organization, concentrate on placing the <em>Worship God </em>book. Every effort should be made to start a home Bible study, especially if some individuals have already studied the <em>Knowledge </em>book and the <em>Require </em>brochure. <strong>June: </strong><em>Learn From the Great Teacher. </em>If individuals say that they have no children, offer the <em>Require </em>brochure. When using the brochure, concentrate on starting home Bible studies. <strong>July and August: </strong>Offer the <em>Knowledge </em>book or the <em>Require </em>brochure. When householders already have these publications, use another appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on June 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. When this has been done, make an announcement to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.</p>

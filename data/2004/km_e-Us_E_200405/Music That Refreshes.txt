Music That Refreshes
1 Singing and music are an integral part of true worship. In ancient Israel, Asaph and his brothers sang: “Give thanks to Jehovah, you people. . . . Sing to him, make melody to him, concern yourselves with all his wonderful acts.” (1 Chron. 16:8, 9) Today we raise our voices in song to Jehovah at our weekly congregation meetings. (Eph. 5:19) What a marvelous opportunity this is to give praise to his name!​—Ps. 69:30.
2 Listening to Kingdom Melodies, orchestral arrangements of Kingdom songs, can fill our mind with spiritual thoughts. “As the melodies are played, I hear the words in my mind,” explained one sister. “What a fine way to keep Jehovah in my thoughts while enjoying music!”​—Phil. 4:8.
3 Occasions to Enjoy Them: Playing Kingdom Melodies at home creates a warm, spiritual atmosphere that contributes to family peace. “We play this [music] over and over in our home and car and never tire of the stirring arrangements,” wrote one family. “Often Kingdom Melodies have provided the right peaceful mood when getting ready for Christian meetings or when traveling to an assembly.” A sister said: “They’re a real lift to listen to when I’m doing housework​—whoever thought I’d be joyful while folding laundry? I plan to play this music when I find my spirits down. The music has such an exhilarating effect! . . . Every song evokes happiness.” Are there occasions when such refreshing music would benefit you?
4 Much of today’s music reflects the world’s spirit. Parents can help their children to cultivate a taste for wholesome music by making good use of the Kingdom Melodies recordings. Many Bible students and interested people would also be pleased to know about these beautiful spiritual songs, which glorify Jehovah and uplift the spirit.​—Ps. 47:1, 2, 6, 7.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Book of Exodus</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">IT IS a true story of the deliverance of those who were made to “slave under tyranny.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:1:13-2:1:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Exodus 1:13</a>) It is also an exciting account of the birth of a nation. Astounding miracles, superb legislation, and the construction of the tabernacle are among its absorbing features. In essence, this is what the Bible book of Exodus contains.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Written by the Hebrew prophet Moses, Exodus relates the experiences of the Israelites over a period of 145 years​—from Joseph’s death in 1657 B.C.E. to the completion of the tabernacle in 1512 B.C.E. Yet, the account is of more than mere historical interest. It is a part of God’s word, or message, to mankind. As such, it “is alive and exerts power.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:12</a>) Exodus, then, has real meaning for us.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Jacob’s descendants living in Egypt increase so rapidly that by royal mandate they are made to suffer as slaves. Pharaoh even decrees death for all Israelite male infants. Escaping such an end is a three-month-old baby, Moses, who is adopted by Pharaoh’s daughter. Although he is brought up in the royal household, at the age of 40, Moses sides with his own people and kills an Egyptian. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:7:23-44:7:24" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Acts 7:23, 24</a>) Forced to flee, he goes to Midian. There he gets married and lives as a shepherd. At a miraculously burning bush, Jehovah commissions Moses to return to Egypt to lead the Israelites out of slavery. His brother, Aaron, is appointed to be his spokesman.</p>

Jethro was evidently the patriarchal head of a tribe of Midianites.

Soon, however, he and his military forces are in hot pursuit. But Jehovah opens an escape corridor through the Red Sea and delivers his people. The pursuing Egyptians drown as the sea closes in on them.</p>

There they receive the Ten Commandments and other laws, enter into a covenant with Jehovah, and become a theocratic nation. Moses spends 40 days in the mountain, receiving instructions regarding true worship and the construction of Jehovah’s tabernacle, a portable temple. Meanwhile, the Israelites make and worship a golden calf. Descending from the mountain, Moses sees this and becomes so incensed that he smashes the two stone tablets given him by God. After due punishment is meted <span id="page27" class="pageNum" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span>out to the wrongdoers, he again ascends the mountain and receives another set of tablets. Upon Moses’ return, tabernacle construction begins. By the end of Israel’s first year of freedom, this marvelous tent and all its furnishings are completed and set up. Then Jehovah fills the tent with his glory.</p>

A Day to Remember
THE evening before he died, Jesus Christ passed a loaf of unleavened bread and a cup of red wine to his apostles and instructed them to eat and to drink. He also told them: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”​—Luke 22:19.
This year the anniversary of this event falls on Sunday, April 4, after sundown. Jehovah’s Witnesses around the world will be gathered on this night to observe this Memorial occasion in the manner Jesus commanded. You are most warmly invited to join them. Please check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the exact time and place of this special meeting.

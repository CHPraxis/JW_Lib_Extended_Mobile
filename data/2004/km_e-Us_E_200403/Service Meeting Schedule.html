<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Using Tracts to Start Conversations. Audience discussion. Often the most difficult part of giving a witness is getting the conversation started. Tracts can be used to break the ice in door-to-door witnessing, in business territory, and in public places. Briefly review two or three tracts that might appeal to people in the local territory. What introductory comments might be made when presenting these tracts? How may the illustrations be used? What questions might tactfully be raised? Highlight a paragraph in each tract that could be considered if the householder shows interest. Demonstrate how a conversation may be started using a tract. Have the publisher briefly consider one paragraph from the tract and then conclude by offering the <em>Knowledge </em>book.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:5:1-43:5:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 5:1-3</a>) Select one or two additional examples from the weekly Bible reading for the Theocratic Ministry School. Invite the audience to comment on where those locations can be found in the brochure and how we benefit from consulting the maps.

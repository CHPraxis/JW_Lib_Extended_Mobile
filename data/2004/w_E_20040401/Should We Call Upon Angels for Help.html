<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IS IT proper to call upon angels in times of distress? Many people think so. In fact, the <em>New Catholic Encyclopedia </em>says: “One prays to . . . the angels . . . but only in the sense that they may intercede before God for us.” Should we call upon angels to intercede for us?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">God’s Word provides the names of only two of God’s faithful angels, Michael and Gabriel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:8:16-27:8:16" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Daniel 8:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:12:1-27:12:1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 12:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:1:26-42:1:26" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> Luke 1:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/65:1:9-65:1:9" data-bid="1-4" class="b"> Jude 9</a>) Since these names are mentioned in the Bible, we discern that each angel is a unique spirit person with a name, not merely some impersonal energy or force. Yet, other angels declined to disclose their names. For instance, when Jacob asked an angel who visited him to reveal his name, he refused to do so. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:32:29-1:32:29" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 32:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/7:13:17-7:13:18" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Judges 13:17, 18</a>) No list of names of angels is provided in the Bible, thus preventing humans from giving them undue attention.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Among the duties of angels is the conveying of messages from God to humans. In fact, the original Hebrew and Greek words translated “angel” literally mean “messenger.” However, angels do not serve as intercessors who bring human prayers to the throne of the Most High. God has determined that prayers be addressed to him in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, who said: “No matter what you ask the Father in my name he might give it to you.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:15:16-43:15:16" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 15:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:2:5-54:2:5" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 1 Timothy 2:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jehovah God is never too busy to listen to us if we approach him properly. The Bible gives this assurance: “Jehovah is near to all those calling upon him, to all those who call upon him in trueness.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:145:18-19:145:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Psalm 145:18</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WORLDWIDE, the persistence with which Jehovah’s Witnesses engage in their house-to-house ministry is well-known. Some people wonder why the Witnesses keep calling on them, especially if they have previously shown little interest in the Witnesses’ message. Two letters from Russia help to explain the reason.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“To be honest,” admits Masha, a 19-year-old girl in Khabarovsk, “in the past, I would avoid Jehovah’s Witnesses like the plague.” However, after reading a few copies of the magazines published by the Witnesses, she changed her attitude. “It is all so very interesting and enlightening,” writes Masha, “but most important, it makes you look at the world differently. I slowly began to understand why people are given a life to live.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">From the city of Ussuriysk, about 50 miles <strong>[80 km] </strong>north of Vladivostok, Svetlana wrote: “I have just recently begun to read <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>These magazines are very much needed in our day and age. I enjoy all the articles. They are very interesting, informative, and enlightening. Thank you! Thank you very much for being in this world and for doing such a kind and needed work.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses the world over take seriously the apostle Paul’s thought-provoking question: “How, in turn, will [people] hear without someone to preach?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:14-45:10:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 10:14</a>) Why not take a few minutes to listen the next time the Witnesses visit you? You too may enjoy the message of comfort found in God’s Word, the Bible.</p>

Does God Care About Us?
DO YOU find yourself laboring under an emotional load because of problems with your family, health, work, or other weighty responsibilities? Many people do. And who today is not affected by injustice, crime, and violence? Indeed, it is just as the Bible says: “All creation keeps on groaning together and being in pain together until now.” (Romans 8:22) No wonder that many people ask: ‘Does God care? Will he come to our aid?’
Wise King Solomon said to God in prayer: “You yourself alone well know the heart of the sons of mankind.” Solomon trusted that God not only knows us but also cares about us as individuals. He was able to ask God to “hear from the heavens” and to answer the prayers of each God-fearing individual who reveals to God “his own plague and his own pain.”—2 Chronicles 6:29, 30.
Today, Jehovah God still cares about us and invites us to call on him in prayer. (Psalm 50:15) He promises to respond to heartfelt prayers that are in harmony with his will. (Psalm 55:16, 22; Luke 11:5-13; 2 Corinthians 4:7) Yes, Jehovah listens to “whatever prayer, whatever request for favor there may occur on the part of any man or of all [his] people.” Hence, if we put our trust in God, pray for his help, and draw close to him, we will experience his loving care and guidance. (Proverbs 3:5, 6) The Bible writer James assures us: “Draw close to God, and he will draw close to you.”—James 4:8.

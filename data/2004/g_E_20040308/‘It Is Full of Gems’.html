<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is how the director of a hospice in Illinois, U.S.A., described the brochure <em>When Someone You Love Dies. </em>The brochure and an <em>Awake! </em>magazine had been mailed to him by one of Jehovah’s Witnesses because from reading <em>Awake! </em>the Witness had learned that suicide was very high among the aged. When the hospice director received the literature, he responded immediately.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">After the hospice director noted that <em>When Someone You Love Dies </em>was full of gems, he wrote: “I would be happy to make it available . . . to families who would be comforted by its practical wisdom and Biblical references and discussions.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The Witness immediately phoned the director and made an appointment to visit him personally. The director requested 20 copies of the brochure and asked that the hospice be contacted every two or three months to replenish copies.</p>

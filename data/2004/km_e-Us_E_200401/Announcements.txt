Announcements
▪ Literature offer for January: Any book published prior to 1988 that the congregation may have in stock. If you do not have any of these in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus of older publications on hand that you can use. Congregations that do not have older books may offer Mankind’s Search for God. February: Draw Close to Jehovah. If this publication is not available, you may use the Creation book (large or small size) or the Revelation Climax book as an alternative offer. March: Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. A special effort will be made to start home Bible studies. If people already have this publication, Pay Attention to Daniel’s Prophecy! may be offered. April: Feature individual copies of both The Watchtower and Awake! When making return visits on interested people, include those who attend the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the organization. Concentrate on placing the Worship God book. Every effort should be made to start a home Bible study, especially if some individuals have already studied the Knowledge book and the Require brochure.
▪ Starting in February, and no later than March 7, the new public talk for circuit overseers will be “Whose Values Do You Cherish?”
▪ Congregations should make convenient arrangements to observe the Memorial this year on Sunday, April 4, after sundown. Although the talk may start earlier, the passing of the emblems should not begin until after sundown. Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. Since no meetings other than those for field service are to be held on that day, appropriate adjustments should be made for the Watchtower Study to be conducted at another time. Circuit overseers will need to adjust their meeting schedule for the week according to local circumstances. Although it is desirable for each congregation to hold its own Memorial observance, this may not always be possible. Where a number of congregations normally use the same Kingdom Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the use of another facility for that evening. Where possible, we would suggest a minimum of 40 minutes between the programs so that all may benefit fully from the occasion. Consideration should also be given to traffic conditions and parking, including the dropping off and picking up of passengers. The body of elders should decide what arrangements would be best locally.
▪ For those who wish to make donations to the worldwide work electronically, a set of instructions is available to explain this arrangement. For further information, call 718-560-5000 or write to Watch Tower, Office of the Secretary and Treasurer, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201-2483.

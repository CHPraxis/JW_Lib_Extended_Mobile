Branch Letter
Dear Kingdom Publishers:
Like the early Christians, we today regularly come together at assemblies where “quite a crowd” has gathered. (Acts 11:26) Since 1965, we have been using Assembly Halls for assemblies and conventions where suitable rented facilities are not available. Presently, there are 40 Assembly Halls in the United States branch. A new one is near completion in California, and plans are progressing for another in Georgia. More are needed, and arrangements for these are under way.
During these difficult economic times, the cost of Assembly Hall construction and operation is constantly rising. Thus, the Governing Body has ‘calculated the expense’ and directed that a standard Assembly Hall design be developed. (Luke 14:28) The aim is to build modest-sized halls that utilize simpler, less costly finishings. This will allow projects to move along more quickly with volunteer help. At the same time, efforts will be made to ensure that the buildings are practical, comfortable, and attractive in appearance. Our prayer is that standardizing Assembly Hall design will save money, time, and labor, allowing us to give more attention to the all-important preaching work.​—Matt. 24:14.
It is a pleasure for us to be working together with you in Jehovah’s service. We send our warm Christian love to all of you.
Your brothers,
U.S. Branch Office

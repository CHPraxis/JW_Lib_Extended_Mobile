“There Really Is Someone Out There”
A 13-year-old girl in New Mexico, U.S.A., wrote: “During a discussion in science class dealing with evolution, I spoke out concerning all the evidence that there is a Creator. I took a copy of the book Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? to my science teacher and asked him to read it, explaining that it had helped me. He thanked me kindly and accepted the book.
“A couple of weeks later, he came to me and commented that he had read the book and felt that it was one of the best-written books he had ever read.
“Not long after this, one of the students committed suicide, a pretty 15-year-old girl. Many students were crying and very upset as they came into science class. To my surprise, the teacher opened the matter for discussion by the class. He began by saying: ‘Do you know what helped me deal with this death?’ He then said that it was what I had done for him. He said: ‘She gave me this little book entitled Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? It helped me to know that there really is someone out there who cares about us and that even if no one else will listen to us, he’s there!’ The class seemed calmed and comforted by his words.”
Do you ever wonder if there is solid scientific evidence pointing to the existence of a Creator? And if so, is there reason to believe that he cares about us? We invite you to read this fascinating 192-page book.

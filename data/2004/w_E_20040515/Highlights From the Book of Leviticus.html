<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Book of Leviticus</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A YEAR has not yet passed since the Israelites were liberated from Egyptian bondage. Now organized into a new nation, they are on their way to the land of Canaan. Jehovah’s purpose is to have a holy nation dwell there. However, the way of life and the religious practices of the Canaanites are very degraded. So the true God gives the congregation of Israel regulations that will set it apart for his service. These are recorded in the Bible book of Leviticus. Written by the prophet Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, apparently in 1512 B.C.E., the book covers no more than one lunar month. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:40:17-2:40:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Exodus 40:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:1:1-4:1:3" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Numbers 1:1-3</a>) Jehovah repeatedly urges his worshipers to be holy.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:11:44-3:11:44" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Leviticus 11:44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:19:2-3:19:2" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 19:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:20:7-3:20:7" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 20:7,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:20:26-3:20:26" data-bid="2-4" class="b"> 26</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Witnesses of Jehovah today are not under the Law given by God through Moses. The death of Jesus Christ did away with that Law. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:14-45:6:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Romans 6:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:11-49:2:16" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Ephesians 2:11-16</a>) However, the regulations found in Leviticus can benefit us, teaching us much about the worship of our God, Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>HOLY OFFERINGS​—VOLUNTARY AND COMPULSORY</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:1:1-3:7:38" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Leviticus 1:1–7:38</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Some of the offerings and sacrifices of the Law were voluntary, whereas others were compulsory. The burnt offering, for example, was voluntary. It was presented to God in its entirety, even as Jesus Christ willingly and wholly gave his life as a ransom sacrifice. The voluntary communion sacrifice was shared. One part of it was presented to God on the altar, another portion was eaten by the priest, and still another by the offerer. Comparably, for anointed Christians, the Memorial of Christ’s death is a communion meal.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:16-46:10:22" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:16-22</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Sin offerings and guilt offerings were compulsory. The first atoned for sins committed by mistake, or unintentionally. The second satisfied God when a right was violated, or it restored certain rights for the repentant wrongdoer​—or both. There were also grain offerings made in recognition of Jehovah’s bounty. All these matters are of interest to us because the sacrifices commanded under the Law covenant pointed to Jesus Christ and his sacrifice or to benefits flowing therefrom.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:8:3-58:8:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Hebrews 8:3-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:9-58:9:14" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> 9:9-14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:10:5-58:10:10" data-bid="6-3" class="b"> 10:5-10</a>.</p>

Though not allowed “as an offering made by fire,” it was included among “the firstfruits of . . . <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>the produce of the field.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:31:5-14:31:5" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 31:5</a>) This honey was evidently the juice, or syrup, of fruits.

Around the world, salt is used as a preservative. It was likely presented with offerings because it represents freedom from corruption and decay.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb">Who were given the responsibility of caring for duties involving sacrifices and offerings? That was entrusted to the priests. As directed by God, Moses conducted an installation ceremony for Aaron, the high priest, and for his four sons, who were to be underpriests. The ceremony apparently occupied a seven-day period, and the priesthood began functioning on the following day.</p>

The whole atonement arrangement was based on blood. “Nearly all things are cleansed with blood according to the Law,” wrote the apostle Paul, “and unless blood is poured out no forgiveness takes place.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:22-58:9:22" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:22</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:10:9-3:10:9" data-bid="20-1" class="b">Leviticus 10:9</a>) This suggests that Aaron’s two sons may have been under the influence of alcohol on the occasion here under consideration. However, the actual reason for their death was their offering “illegitimate fire, which [Jehovah] had not prescribed for them.”</p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">Food regulations concerning clean and unclean animals benefited the Israelites in two ways. These regulations protected them from being infected by harmful organisms and strengthened the barrier between them and the people of the surrounding nations. Other regulations dealt with uncleanness from dead bodies, the purification of women upon giving birth, procedures involving leprosy, and uncleanness resulting from male and female sexual discharges. Priests were to take care of matters dealing with uncleanness contracted by individuals.</p>

However, because of the inherited effects of sin, imperfect and sinful life was passed on to the offspring. The temporary periods of ‘uncleanness’ associated with childbirth, as well as other matters, such as menstruation and seminal emissions, called this hereditary sinfulness to mind. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:15:16-3:15:24" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Leviticus 15:16-24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:51:5-19:51:5" data-bid="25-2" class="b"> Psalm 51:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="25-3" class="b"> Romans 5:12</a>) The required purification regulations would help the Israelites to appreciate the need for a ransom sacrifice to cover mankind’s sinfulness and restore human perfection. Thus the Law became their “tutor leading to Christ.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:24-48:3:24" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Galatians 3:24</a>.</p>

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">The most important sacrifices for sins were offered on the annual Day of Atonement. A bull was offered for the priests and the tribe of Levi. A goat was sacrificed for Israel’s nonpriestly tribes. Another goat was sent away alive into the wilderness after the people’s sins had been pronounced over it. The two goats were regarded as one sin offering. All of this pointed to the fact that Jesus Christ would be sacrificed and would also carry away sins.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="sb">Regulations about the eating of meat and <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>about other matters impress us with the need for holiness when we worship Jehovah. Appropriately, the priests were to keep themselves holy. The three annual festivals were occasions for great rejoicing and the giving of thanks to the Creator. Jehovah also gave his people regulations involving the abuse of his holy name, the observance of Sabbaths and of the Jubilee, conduct toward the poor, and the treatment of slaves. The blessings that would result from obedience to God are contrasted with the maledictions that would be experienced for disobedience. There are also regulations about offerings in connection with vows and valuations, the firstborn of animals, and the giving of every tenth part as “something holy to Jehovah.”</p>

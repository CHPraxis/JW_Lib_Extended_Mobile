<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Millions will attend at hundreds of locations throughout the world. The first of the 211 three-day conventions in the United States will be held May 28-30, and the final one, September 10-12. Likely one of these three-day gatherings<wbr />—generally held Friday through Sunday—<wbr />will be in a city near you.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In most places the program will begin at 9:30 a.m. each day with a musical program. Friday’s theme is <strong>“This Is the Way. Walk in It.” </strong>The welcoming address, <strong>“Congregated to Let Jehovah Teach Us His Ways,” </strong>will be followed by a part featuring interviews with ones loyally walking with God. After the talks <strong>“Keep Proving What You Yourselves Are” </strong>and <strong>“Let God’s Word Guide Your Steps Every Day,” </strong>the morning session will conclude with the keynote address, <strong>“Walk With God in Turbulent Times.”</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Friday afternoon’s session will include a three-part symposium, <strong>“Hosea’s Prophecy Helps Us to Walk With God.” </strong>Following it will be the talks <strong>“Do Not Put Apart ‘What God Has Yoked Together’” </strong>and <strong>“Showing Respect for Our Sacred Gatherings.” </strong>The day’s final discourse, <strong>“Good News for People of All Nations,” </strong>will provide encouragement to reach people of all languages with the good news.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The theme for Saturday is <strong>“Keep Strict Watch on How You Walk.” </strong>The morning’s symposium, <strong>“Walking Progressively as Ministers,” </strong>includes a part that offers further suggestions on reaching those who speak other languages. The morning program concludes with the important discourse <strong>“Walking With Jehovah by Appointment,” </strong>after which there is opportunity for qualified people to be baptized.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Saturday afternoon’s talks include <strong>“Avoid ‘Any Cause for Stumbling’” </strong>and <strong>“Wholesome Activities That Refresh.” </strong>The next presentations, <strong>“Jehovah Is Our Shepherd,” “Buying Out the Opportune Time,” </strong>and <strong>“Walking in the Path of Increasing Light,” </strong>each feature encouraging interviews. The session will end with the sobering discourse <strong>“‘Keep on the Watch’<wbr />—The Hour of Judgment Has Arrived.”</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Sunday’s program theme, <strong>“Go On Walking in the Truth,” </strong>is emphasized in the talk <strong>“Youths<wbr />—Walk in the Path of Righteousness.” </strong>Next will be a full-costume drama featuring the ministry of the apostle Paul. Following that will be a talk that emphasizes lessons from the drama. The afternoon program will feature the public address, <strong>“Walking With God Brings Blessings Now and Forever.”</strong></p>

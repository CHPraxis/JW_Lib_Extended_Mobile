2004 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses
Containing Report for the Service Year of 2003
“Keep on the Watch . . .Prove Yourselves Ready.”​—Matthew 24:42, 44.
Consistently, God’s Word reminds us that Jehovah’s day will arrive with shocking suddenness. Hence, our yeartext for 2004 reflects Jesus’ deep love for his disciples, whom he wants to preserve through “the great tribulation.” (Rev. 7:14) How do we remain spiritually watchful and ready? By allowing nothing to distract us from our study of God’s Word and from our privileges of sacred service. This Yearbook contains many examples of loyal Witnesses, who took to heart Jesus’ loving admonition. May you imitate their faith.

Offering Jehovah Our Best
1 Jehovah’s Law to Israel stipulated that animals presented to him in sacrifice had to be “sound.” A defective animal was unacceptable. (Lev. 22:18-20; Mal. 1:6-9) Furthermore, when a sacrifice was made, all the fat​—the richest part—​belonged to Jehovah. (Lev. 3:14-16) As Israel’s Father and Grand Master, Jehovah deserved the very best.
2 As in ancient times, God is keenly interested in the quality of our offerings today. Our service should reflect proper reverence for Jehovah. Of course, circumstances vary from person to person. Yet, we have good reason to scrutinize ourselves to make sure that we are giving him our best.​—Eph. 5:10.
3 Wholehearted Service: In order for our ministry to honor Jehovah and touch the hearts of our listeners, it cannot be perfunctory. Our expressions regarding our God and his grand purposes should spring from hearts brimming with appreciation. (Ps. 145:7) This highlights the importance of maintaining a good program of personal Bible reading and study.​—Prov. 15:28.
4 Giving Jehovah our best also involves imitating his love for people. (Eph. 5:1, 2) Love for people will motivate us to try to reach as many as possible with the life-giving message of truth. (Mark 6:34) It moves us to show personal interest in those to whom we speak. It keeps us thinking about them after the initial call and prompts us to return. It impels us to do all we can to help them progress spiritually.​—Acts 20:24; 26:28, 29.
5 “A Sacrifice of Praise”: Another way we give Jehovah our best is by our diligence in the ministry. When we are well-organized and focused on the work at hand, we can accomplish the most good in the time we have available. (1 Tim. 4:10) Good preparation enables us to speak with clarity and conviction, thereby increasing the likelihood of a favorable response. (Prov. 16:21) As we share the good news with others, our heartfelt expressions can rightly be called “a sacrifice of praise.”​—Heb. 13:15.

“Remarkably Rich in Meaning”
THIS comment about the pictures in the literature of Jehovah’s Witnesses was made at an international art exhibition in Kassel, Germany. Sixteen-year-old Katja relates what happened when she and her fellow students visited the exhibition and were looking at some religious works of art:
“Our guide asked the students whether they had ever looked through the magazines of Jehovah’s Witnesses. When all said no, he started speaking in glowing terms about the illustrations in The Watchtower and Awake! He said that the pictures were exceptionally well painted and the photographs well chosen and that they were also ‘remarkably rich in meaning.’
“He told us that we would do well to take a closer look at these interesting pictures,” saying that the modern portrayal of Biblical events makes it easy to see how these apply to our time. He then urged the students to accept the magazines when they are offered, saying that they should not limit themselves to looking at the pictures but should read the very informative and interesting articles as well.

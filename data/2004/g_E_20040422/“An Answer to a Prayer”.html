<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is how a mother of a nine-year-old son described the release of the book <em>Learn From the Great Teacher </em>at a district convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Ireland. “It brought tears to my eyes!” she exclaimed. “It was especially a blessing because only last week I was concerned because I didn’t know quite what to study with my son.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I had prayed to Jehovah,” the woman explained, “to help me teach him meatier Bible truths in a simple way that is appealing, and I didn’t know where to start. So receiving this beautiful, well-illustrated book was an answer to a prayer.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A mother of five children in California, U.S.A., wrote similarly. “On our way back to the hotel from the convention,” she said, “I found my three youngest children reading, looking at, and discussing together what captivated them in the pages of <em>Learn From the Great Teacher.”</em></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">She noted: “The joy I felt at receiving this gift from Jehovah was simply overwhelming<wbr />—like a birth, a wedding, a baptism, a privilege received from the Creator of the universe. Sometimes I am sure our tears of joy express to our loving Father, Jehovah, what mere words cannot.”</p>

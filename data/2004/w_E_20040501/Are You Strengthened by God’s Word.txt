Are You Strengthened by God’s Word?
WHEN faced with challenges, how do you cope? In Jesus’ case, recalling an appropriate scripture helped him to face Satan’s challenges. (Matthew 4:1-11) Likewise, when King David faced personal trials, he was strengthened by God’s Word. He said: “When my disquieting thoughts became many inside of me, your own consolations began to fondle my soul.”—Psalm 94:19.
In a similar manner, recalling a favorite scripture can console us or give us strength when we face challenges. For example, Rex, who is now 89 years of age, has been a full-time evangelizer since 1931. Yet, he says: “I often felt inadequate when given a special assignment in the ministry.” How did he cope? “I recalled my favorite scripture, Proverbs 3:5, which says: ‘Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding.’ Recalling and applying this scripture helped me to carry out my assignments successfully.”
Even young ones benefit from having a favorite scripture. Six-year-old Jack says that his favorite scripture is Matthew 24:14. This scripture motivates him to go preaching with his parents. He says: “I like going witnessing every Saturday with my mum, dad, and sister.”
Like Jesus, do you sometimes face direct challenges to your faith? Then Philippians 4:13 may become one of your favorite scriptures. Like King David, do you suffer from “disquieting thoughts”? Then recalling Philippians 4:6, 7 may help you to cope. Do you sometimes worry that your service to God is in vain? Then remembering 1 Corinthians 15:58 will give you strength.
By memorizing appropriate scriptures, we allow God’s Word to exert power in our lives. (Hebrews 4:12) Such favorite scriptures can provide us with both strength and comfort.—Romans 15:4.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHEN faced with challenges, how do you cope? In Jesus’ case, recalling an appropriate scripture helped him to face Satan’s challenges. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:4:1-40:4:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 4:1-11</a>) Likewise, when King David faced personal trials, he was strengthened by God’s Word. He said: “When my disquieting thoughts became many inside of me, your own consolations began to fondle my soul.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:94:19-19:94:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 94:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In a similar manner, recalling a favorite scripture can console us or give us strength when we face challenges. For example, Rex, who is now 89 years of age, has been a full-time evangelizer since 1931. Yet, he says: “I often felt inadequate when given a special assignment in the ministry.” How did he cope? “I recalled my favorite scripture, <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:3:5-20:3:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 3:5</a>, which says: ‘Trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding.’ Recalling and applying this scripture helped me to carry out my assignments successfully.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Even young ones benefit from having a favorite scripture. Six-year-old Jack says that his favorite scripture is <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 24:14</a>. This scripture motivates him to go preaching with his parents. He says: “I like going witnessing every Saturday with my mum, dad, and sister.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Like Jesus, do you sometimes face direct challenges to your faith? Then <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:4:13-50:4:13" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Philippians 4:13</a> may become one of your favorite scriptures. Like King David, do you suffer from “disquieting thoughts”? Then recalling <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/50:4:6-50:4:7" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Philippians 4:6, 7</a> may help you to cope. Do you sometimes worry that your service to God is in vain? Then remembering <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:15:58-46:15:58" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:58</a> will give you strength.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">By memorizing appropriate scriptures, we allow God’s Word to exert power in our lives. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:12</a>) Such favorite scriptures can provide us with both strength and comfort.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:15:4-45:15:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Romans 15:4</a>.</p>

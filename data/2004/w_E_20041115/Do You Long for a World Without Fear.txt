Do You Long for a World Without Fear?
“We’re living in a ‘chronic heightened state of alertness and . . . helplessness,’ prompted by a ‘poorly defined . . . danger that could strike at any time in any form without warning.’”
THESE words, quoted last year in Newsweek magazine, reflect the feelings of many people living in today’s turbulent world. Jesus Christ indicated that such emotions would intensify in the near future. He foretold a time when there would be such anguish among nations that they would not know the way out and men would become faint out of fear and expectation of the things coming upon the earth. We, though, will not need to feel fearful or helpless, for Jesus added: “As these things start to occur, raise yourselves erect and lift your heads up, because your deliverance is getting near.”​—Luke 21:25-28.
Describing the living conditions of his people on earth after that deliverance, Jehovah God declared: “My people must dwell in a peaceful abiding place and in residences of full confidence and in undisturbed resting-places.” (Isaiah 32:18) Through his prophet Micah, Jehovah said: “They will actually sit, each one under his vine and under his fig tree, and there will be no one making them tremble.”​—Micah 4:4.
What a contrast that is with life today! No unknown danger will loom over mankind. Instead of a chronic state of alertness and helplessness, there will be an unending state of peace and happiness.

How Much Can Your Child Learn?
Adults are often unaware of a child’s capacity to learn. Yet, children usually learn a new language faster than their parents. By the time they are four years old, some speak two or more languages. Last year, Rhonda, a woman from Auburn, Washington, U.S.A., who had questioned a child’s capacity to learn, wrote: “Thank you for allowing me to admit that I was truly wrong.”
Rhonda explained that she had come across an experience in the August 1, 1988, issue of The Watchtower, our companion magazine, and stated: “On page 13, there is a comment from a mother of a boy four and a half years old who said that when she was reading from My Book of Bible Stories and paused, her son continued the story word for word. She added that he had memorized the first 33 stories of the book, including difficult names of places and people. I have to admit that at the moment, I thought to myself that it was impossible. Well, I was wrong. I am now the mother of a four-year-old daughter who has herself memorized many of the stories from the Bible Stories book.”

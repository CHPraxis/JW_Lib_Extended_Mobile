<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Adults are often unaware of a child’s capacity to learn. Yet, children usually learn a new language faster than their parents. By the time they are four years old, some speak two or more languages. Last year, Rhonda, a woman from Auburn, Washington, U.S.A., who had questioned a child’s capacity to learn, wrote: “Thank you for allowing me to admit that I was truly wrong.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Rhonda explained that she had come across an experience in the August 1, 1988, issue of <em>The Watchtower, </em>our companion magazine, and stated: “On page 13, there is a comment from a mother of a boy four and a half years old who said that when she was reading from <em>My Book of Bible Stories </em>and paused, her son continued the story word for word. She added that he had memorized the first 33 stories of the book, including difficult names of places and people. I have to admit that at the moment, I thought to myself that it was impossible. Well, I was wrong. I am now the mother of a four-year-old daughter who has herself memorized many of the stories from the <em>Bible Stories </em>book.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A mother who discerns and cares for the needs of her children makes diligent efforts to supply them with nutritious physical food. She manifests the same diligence in providing spiritual sustenance.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Recently, a woman in Brazil wrote to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in that country expressing appreciation for the publication <em>What Does God Require of Us? </em>“The brochure simply touched me,” she wrote. “On glancing through a lesson about practices that God disapproves, it immediately occurred to me that I should share this important information with my children<wbr />—two girls, aged 10 and 11, and a 5-year-old boy.” She added: “How important it is to have literature like this to teach God’s ways to my family!”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">She also requested additional Bible-based publications.

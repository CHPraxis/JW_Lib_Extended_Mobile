<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">As foretold in the Bible, we are living in “critical times hard to deal with.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1</a>) Family turmoil, health problems, and financial stresses are just some of the obstacles that may afflict you. At times, you may feel that you cannot endure. Nevertheless, you can thrive in the midst of adversity. Consider the following illustration.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Teide violet grows at an altitude of nearly 12,000 feet <strong>[3,700 meters] </strong>on the island of Tenerife off the coast of North Africa. Pico de Teide, the volcanic peak from which the violet gets its name, dominates the subtropical island. Its upper slopes seem devoid of vegetation. But in the spring, melting winter snows provide just enough water to allow these tenacious violets to revive and deck the throat of the volcano with a purple garland. Yes, this flower may appear frail and delicate, but it manages to survive and even thrive in this barren, hostile environment.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Like the Teide violet, you too can endure in the midst of adverse circumstances. The Bible has helped many of Jehovah’s Witnesses to do so even in the worst of times. For example, those who were imprisoned in concentration camps in Nazi Germany managed to thrive. “They were treated worse than any other group,” says Swedish journalist Björn Hallström, “but they managed, through their belief in God, to survive better than any others.”</p>

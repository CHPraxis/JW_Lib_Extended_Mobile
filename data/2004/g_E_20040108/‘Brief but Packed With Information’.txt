‘Brief but Packed With Information’
That is how one woman described the brochure What Does God Require of Us? She then went on to explain what prompted her remark. “Through the use of this brochure,” she said, “Gloria, who is an elderly woman, has had her desire to read the Bible reinvigorated. She has gone from not being able to sit still and concentrate to studying for up to two hours. She prepares all her lessons ahead of time and examines all the scriptures.”
What Does God Require of Us? is a 32-page publication, the same size as this magazine. It shows clearly what God’s purpose is for mankind and tells what we need to do to receive his approval. Its appealing lessons include “Who Is God?,” “Who Is Jesus Christ?,” “What Is God’s Purpose for the Earth?,” and “What Is the Kingdom of God?”

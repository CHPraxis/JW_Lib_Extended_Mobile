Probe Into God’s Word!
That is what the book Worship the Only True God will help you to do. It is a publication designed to help students of the Bible to apply the teachings of God’s Word in their lives. A Bible teacher in Nigeria, West Africa, observed: “What interested me the most were the thought-provoking questions provided in each chapter, which help the reader absorb what he is reading and meditate upon it.”
A woman who has been a Bible teacher for years noted: “This book is written so simply! It’s a real joy to conduct studies in it.”
Perhaps you will feel similarly about this book when you examine such chapters as “The Issue That We All Have to Face,” “What We Learn From God’s Permission of Wickedness,” “The Power of the Resurrection Hope,” and “Listen to Counsel, Accept Discipline.” You may request a copy of the 192-page paperback book Worship the Only True God by filling in the accompanying coupon and mailing it to the address provided or to an appropriate address on page 5 of this magazine.

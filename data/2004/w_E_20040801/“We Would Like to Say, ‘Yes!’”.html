<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Nigeria recently received a letter that, in part, says the following:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Our son, Anderson, died when he was 14. Before his death, he was raising two chickens. He wanted to sell them and then send the money to the branch office as a contribution to the worldwide preaching work. But he died before they could be sold.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“In view of his desire, we, his parents, raised the chickens and sold them. We are sending the money to you as Anderson’s contribution. Because of Jehovah’s promise, we are confident that we will soon<wbr />—very soon—<wbr />see Anderson again. We would like to say, ‘Yes!’ when he asks if we carried out his heart’s desire. Indeed, we look forward to seeing not only Anderson but also a ‘great cloud of witnesses’ who will be resurrected.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:12:1-58:12:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:5:28-43:5:29" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> John 5:28, 29</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">As clearly reflected in the above letter, belief in the resurrection is a hope that sustains true Christians. What joy millions of families will experience when they, like Anderson’s family, welcome back loved ones whom they have lost to the enemy death!<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:15:24-46:15:26" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 15:24-26</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">God’s Word holds out this comforting hope of the resurrection as one of the many marvelous things that will soon be realized in the righteous new world under God’s Kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:13</a>) Speaking of what God will do for people at that time, the Bible says: “He will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4</a>.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb">JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES strive to live by the principles found in God’s Word. As a result, they enjoy a fine reputation in many lands. At times, however, they have been misrepresented. For example, a government official in the city of St. Petersburg, Russia, recalled: “Jehovah’s Witnesses were presented to us as some kind of underground sect sitting in the darkness and slaughtering children and killing themselves.” But after working with Jehovah’s Witnesses in connection with an international convention, the same official observed: “Now I see normal, smiling people . . . They are peaceful and calm, and they love one another very much.” He added: “I really do not understand why people tell such lies about them.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:16-60:3:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Peter 3:16</a>.</p>

<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>The persecution of true worshipers has a long history, reaching all the way back to “righteous Abel.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:23:34-40:23:35" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matthew 23:34, 35</a>) It has not been limited to a few isolated incidents.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:22-40:10:22" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Matthew 10:22</a>) Further, the apostle Paul wrote that all of God’s servants​—including each one of us—​should expect to be persecuted.

<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 4. How does the Bible reveal the source of all unjustified hatred?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>God’s Word reveals that from the beginning, there has been an unseen instigator. Consider the brutal killing of the first man of faith, Abel. The Bible states that his murderous brother, Cain, “originated with the wicked one,” Satan the Devil. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:12-62:3:12" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 John 3:12</a>) Cain took on Satan’s disposition, and the Devil used him to carry out his wicked aims. The Bible also sheds light on Satan’s role in the vicious attacks on Job and Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:12-18:1:12" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Job 1:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:2:6-18:2:7" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 2:6, 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:37-43:8:37" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> John 8:37,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> 44;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:27-43:13:27" data-bid="10-5" class="b"> 13:27</a>) The book of Revelation leaves no doubt as to the source of the persecution of Jesus’ followers, stating: <em>“The Devil </em>will keep on throwing some of you into prison that you may be fully put to <span id="page13" class="pageNum" data-no="13" data-before-text="13"></span>the test.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:2:10-66:2:10" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Revelation 2:10</a>) Yes, Satan is the source of all unjustified hatred against God’s people.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 5. What is behind Satan’s hatred of true worshipers?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>What is behind Satan’s hatred of true worshipers? In a plot that betrays colossal conceit, Satan has pitted himself against “the King of eternity,” Jehovah God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:1:17-54:1:17" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Timothy 1:17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:3:6-54:3:6" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 3:6</a>) He contends that God is unduly restrictive in his rulership over his creatures and that no one serves Jehovah with a pure motive, that people do so only for selfish gain. Satan claims that if allowed to put humans to the test, he can turn every one of them away from serving God. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:3:1-1:3:6" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Genesis 3:1-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:1:6-18:1:12" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Job 1:6-12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:2:1-18:2:7" data-bid="13-3" class="b"> 2:1-7</a>) In vilifying Jehovah as an oppressor, a liar, and a failure, Satan seeks to establish himself as a rival sovereign. Thus, his rage against God’s servants is driven by his craving to be worshiped.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:8-40:4:9" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Matthew 4:8, 9</a>.</p>

<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Do you see how this issue touches your life? As a servant of Jehovah, you have likely found that while doing God’s will requires earnest effort, the benefits of doing so are surpassing. What, though, if circumstances in your life made it difficult, even painful, for you to continue to comply with Jehovah’s laws and principles? And what if you seemed to receive no benefit in return? Would you conclude that it is not worthwhile to go on serving Jehovah? Or would love for Jehovah and deep appreciation for his magnificent qualities move you to continue to walk in all his ways? (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:10:12-5:10:13" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 10:12, 13</a>) By allowing Satan to bring a measure of hardship upon us, Jehovah has given each of us the opportunity to furnish our personal answer to Satan’s challenge.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Proverbs 27:11</a>.</p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 7. What is one tactic the Devil uses to try to turn us away from Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Let us now consider more closely one of the crafty acts Satan uses in an effort to prove his side of the issue​—his use of lying reproach. Jesus called Satan “the father of the lie.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:44-43:8:44" data-bid="17-1" class="b">John 8:44</a>) The descriptive name Devil, meaning “Slanderer,” identifies that one as the foremost slanderer of God, his good word, and his holy name. The Devil employs innuendos, false accusations, and outright lies in challenging Jehovah’s sovereignty, and he uses these same tactics to malign God’s loyal servants. By heaping reproach on these Witnesses, he can make a severe trial even more difficult for them to bear.</p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 8. How did Satan bring reproach on Job, and with what effect?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Consider what befell Job, whose name means “Object of Hostility.” In addition to causing the loss of Job’s livelihood, his children, and his health, Satan made Job appear to be a sinner who was being punished by God. Though he had been highly respected, Job came to be despised, even by his relatives and close friends. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:19:13-18:19:19" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Job 19:13-19;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:29:1-18:29:2" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 29:1, 2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:29:7-18:29:11" data-bid="18-3" class="b"> 7-11</a>) <span id="page14" class="pageNum" data-no="14" data-before-text="14"></span>Further, by means of false comforters, Satan sought to ‘crush Job with words,’ first insinuating that he must have committed some serious sin and then directly condemning him as a wrongdoer. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:4:6-18:4:9" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Job 4:6-9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:19:2-18:19:2" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> 19:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/18:22:5-18:22:10" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> 22:5-10</a>) How disheartening that would have been for Job!</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>As the foremost upholder of Jehovah’s sovereignty, God’s Son became the chief object of Satan’s hostility. When Jesus came to earth, Satan sought to make him look spiritually disfigured, as he had Job, making Jesus appear to be a sinner.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:27:38-40:27:44" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matthew 27:38-44</a>) In maintaining perfect integrity, Jesus endured much “contrary talk by sinners.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:12:2-58:12:3" data-bid="25-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:2, 3</a>.</p>

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>In modern times, the remaining ones of Christ’s anointed followers have likewise become objects of the Devil’s hostility.

Yet, “through glory and dishonor, through bad report and good report,” the anointed brothers of Christ, supported by their “other sheep” companions, have humbly endeavored ‘to observe the commandments of God and do the work of bearing witness to Jesus.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:8-47:6:8" data-bid="29-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 6:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:10:16-43:10:16" data-bid="29-2" class="b"> John 10:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:12:17-66:12:17" data-bid="29-3" class="b"> Revelation 12:17</a>.</p>

<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>Often, the efforts of opposers backfire. In one African community, many terrible falsehoods had been spread about Jehovah’s Witnesses, including that they were Devil worshipers. Because of this, whenever the Witnesses visited, Grace ran behind her house and hid until they left. One day the pastor of her church held up one of our publications and told all present not to read it because it would cause them to leave their faith. This aroused Grace’s curiosity. The next time the Witnesses called, instead of hiding she engaged them in conversation and received her personal copy of the publication. A Bible study was started, and in 1996 she was baptized. Grace now uses her time to search out others who may have been misinformed about Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>18 </sup>Since Satan can lash out with unjustified hatred at any time, it is vital that we fortify our faith now. How can we do this? A report from a country where Jehovah’s people have been persecuted noted: “One thing has become very evident: Those with good spiritual habits and a deep appreciation of Bible truth have no problem in holding firm when tests arrive. But those who in ‘favorable season’ miss meetings, are irregular in field service, and compromise on small issues often fall when under a ‘fiery’ test.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:2-55:4:2" data-bid="55-1" class="b">2 Timothy 4:2</a>) If you see areas in which you need to make improvement, <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>put forth the effort to do so without delay.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:60-19:119:60" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Psalm 119:60</a>.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu">19. What does the integrity of God’s servants in the face of unjustified hatred accomplish?</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>19 </sup>The integrity of true worshipers under the scourge of satanic hatred is a living testimony to the rightfulness, deservedness, and righteousness of Jehovah’s sovereignty. Their faithfulness makes God’s heart rejoice. Though men may heap reproach on them, the one whose dignity is above earth and heaven “is not ashamed of them, to be called upon as their God.” Indeed, regarding all such loyal ones, it can rightly be said: “The world was not worthy of them.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:16-58:11:16" data-bid="57-1" class="b">Hebrews 11:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:11:38-58:11:38" data-bid="57-2" class="b"> 38</a>.</p>
<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sf"><strong>[Footnote]</strong></p>
<div id="fn1" class="fcc"><p id="p27" data-pid="27">In the Scriptures, the word “hate” has several shades of meaning. In some contexts, it simply means to love to a lesser degree. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:21:15-5:21:16" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 21:15, 16</a>) “Hate” may also signify a strong dislike but without any intent of bringing harm to the object, seeking instead to avoid it because of a feeling of loathing toward it. However, the word “hate” may also denote intense hostility, sustained ill will often accompanied by malice. It is this sense of the word that is discussed in this article.</p></div>

<p id="p50" data-pid="50" class="sc"><strong>They Discerned the Real Issue</strong></p>
<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="sc">  One of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Ukraine, where the Kingdom-preaching work was under ban for over 50 years, observed: “The situation in which Jehovah’s Witnesses found themselves should not be evaluated merely in the context of human relations. . . . Most of the officials were merely doing their job. When the government changed, the officials changed loyalties, but we remained the same. We realized that the real source of our troubles had been revealed in the Bible.</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sc">  “We did not view ourselves simply as the innocent victims of oppressive men. What helped us to endure was a clear understanding of the issue raised in the garden of Eden​—the issue of God’s right to rule. . . . We took a stand for an issue linked not only to the personal interests of humans but also to the interests of the Sovereign of the universe. We had a much loftier understanding of the real issues involved. This made us strong and enabled us to keep our integrity even under the most extreme circumstances.”</p>

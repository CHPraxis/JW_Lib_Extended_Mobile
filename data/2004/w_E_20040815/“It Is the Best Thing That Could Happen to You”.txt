“It Is the Best Thing That Could Happen to You”
ALEXIS is a five-year-old boy in the city of Morelia, Mexico, whose parents study the Bible and attend meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses. While attending a circuit assembly with his family, he observed a demonstration about preaching from house to house. He spontaneously turned to his father and asked, “Daddy, Daddy, why don’t you go out and preach?” His father answered, “I am still studying so that I can do that.” Alexis responded enthusiastically, “Daddy, it is the best thing that could happen to you.”
This young child saw the need to act in harmony with his knowledge of Jehovah. Since some of his young cousins live in the same house as he does, he first prayed to Jehovah and then spoke to them about what he had learned with his parents’ help from My Book of Bible Stories. Though Alexis did not yet know how to read, he knew the contents of the book very well from the pictures illustrating the stories. He even said he wanted to visit people in their homes to share with them what he was learning about God’s purposes.
Indeed, both young and old can bring their lives into harmony with what Jehovah, “the Holy One,” expects of them and thus have the superlative privilege of giving a witness about him among the nations. (Isaiah 43:3; Matthew 21:16) Without doubt, that is one of the best things that can happen to a person.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">CHILDREN happily playing with their loving parents<wbr />—who does not enjoy watching such a scene? The children feel totally secure in the presence of caring parents. Yet, for many young ones, such moments of happiness hardly exist. Instead, some children have to worry every day about where they will find a place to sleep for the night. Is there any hope for such homeless children and others who live without security?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Although the future may look grim, God’s Word provides hope. The prophet Isaiah foretold that the day will come when all will live in total security. He wrote: “They will certainly build houses and have occupancy; and they will certainly plant vineyards and eat their fruitage. They will not build and someone else have occupancy; they will not plant and someone else do the eating.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:65:21-23:65:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 65:21, 22</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">But is this hope well-founded? After all, the word “hope” does not always indicate certainty. For example, in Brazil, one often hears the expression: <em>“A esperança é a última que morre.” </em>It literally means, “Hope is the last thing that dies.” This implies that many people remain hopeful even when there is no real basis for hope. However, the hope that the living God extends to us is different. The apostle Paul wrote: “None that rests his faith on [God] will be disappointed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:10:11-45:10:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Romans 10:11</a>) Bible prophecies that have already been fulfilled give us the confidence that all other promises made by Jehovah God will also come true. When those promises become realities, the conditions that force children to live in the street will be a thing of the past.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Even today the practical counsel found in the Bible can help those without hope to improve their lives and find true security. How is that possible? Jehovah’s Witnesses in your community will be happy to assist you in finding the answer to this question.</p>

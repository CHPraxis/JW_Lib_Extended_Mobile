“I Couldn’t Put It Down”
That was the comment made by Lenita, a reader of the book Pay Attention to Daniel’s Prophecy! In her letter of appreciation, Lenita exclaimed: “Wow! It sounds like a cliché, but I couldn’t put it down. The beginning reads like a historical novel, and throughout my reading I felt as though I were living Daniel’s life with him. I’ve never felt this familiar with the book of Daniel before.”
She added: “On top of that, it’s a great history book—explaining the world powers, the battles, and the people who were involved. Our young home-schooled daughter has started reading it, and I plan to encourage her to finish it and to use it for history lessons.”

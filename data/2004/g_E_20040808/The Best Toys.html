<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">What kind of toy should I get for my child? How much money should I spend? If you are a parent, probably you have asked these questions many times. Well, the good news is that the best toys may be the ones that are the least expensive.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Kids benefit more from active manipulation and exploration than from passive watching, so simple toys that demand imagination are better than flashy battery-powered cars or talking dolls, which limit what your child can do,” says the book <em>Motivated Minds<wbr />—Raising Children to Love Learning. </em>The latter toys may be “fun at first, but children usually lose interest in them quickly because they don’t allow them to experiment, explore, or create.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Depending on a child’s age, mentally stimulating toys include things as simple as building blocks, empty boxes, paper, art materials, and even sand and water. “Small toys, like farm animals,” says <em>Motivated Minds, </em>“will give [a child] a chance to match, group, and compare, and to develop his language skills by making up stories.” The book also suggests simple musical instruments<wbr />—if you are prepared to endure the noise—<wbr />because these allow children to explore sounds and their patterns.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Children have vivid imaginations, and they are eager both to learn and to play. So why not help them in all three areas by choosing their toys wisely.</p>

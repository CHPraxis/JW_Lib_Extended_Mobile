<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That was the comment made by Lenita, a reader of the book <em>Pay Attention to Daniel’s Prophecy! </em>In her letter of appreciation, Lenita exclaimed: “Wow! It sounds like a cliché, but I couldn’t put it down. The beginning reads like a historical novel, and throughout my reading I felt as though I were living Daniel’s life with him. I’ve never felt this familiar with the book of Daniel before.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">She added: “On top of that, it’s a great history book<wbr />—explaining the world powers, the battles, and the people who were involved. Our young home-schooled daughter has started reading it, and I plan to encourage her to finish it and to use it for history lessons.”</p>

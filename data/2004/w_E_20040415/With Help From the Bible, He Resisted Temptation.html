<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Temptations abound in the world today. Upholding Bible standards is not easy. For instance, it may be a challenge to heed the Bible’s counsel: “Flee from fornication.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:6:18-46:6:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of Jehovah’s Witnesses, whom we will call Sebastian, worked for a Scandinavian company in Poland. He had to fight hard to maintain his integrity.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Sebastian became known as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. His supervisors, appreciating his industriousness and fine character, rewarded him with various privileges. It turned out, however, that these privileges included business meetings where questionable entertainment was involved.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Soon Sebastian began to have doubts. “My boss knows that I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. That is why he trusts me and counts on me. If I refuse to participate, I will lose the job, which was so hard to find. What if I am only an observer?”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Then Sebastian found out more. He would be expected to “take care” of foreign customers by providing “girls” for immoral purposes to accompany them in the evening. What would he do?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Sebastian decided to remind the supervisor about his Bible-based attitude toward immorality. Soon it became clear that Sebastian did not fit in and that sooner or later he would have to quit his job. He found a new job with a lower salary but without such temptations. Now he has a clean conscience.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">What would you do if someone pressured you to share in or to condone immorality? Would you be willing to make a drastic change? That is what Joseph of old did, as reported at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:39:7-1:39:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 39:7-12</a>.</p>

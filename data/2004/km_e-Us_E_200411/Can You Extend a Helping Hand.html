<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Jehovah is always looking for ways to extend a helping hand to his loyal servants. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/14:16:9-14:16:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Chron. 16:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:10-23:41:10" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Isa. 41:10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:41:13-23:41:13" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 13</a>) Likening him to a caring shepherd, Isaiah wrote: “With his arm he will collect together the lambs; and in his bosom he will carry them. Those giving suck he will conduct with care.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:11-23:40:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isa. 40:11</a>) Consider some ways in which we can imitate Jehovah’s loving concern.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Reach Out to New Ones: </strong>We can extend a helping hand by inviting new ones to enjoy upbuilding association with us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:13:20-20:13:20" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Prov. 13:20</a>) Recalling how others reached out to him when he began associating with the congregation, one brother said: “On several occasions, a family included me in their family study. As I progressed, a young pioneer couple regularly invited me to join them for full days in the ministry. We always had great spiritual conversations.” He added: “Before becoming a Christian, I used to go out on Friday and Saturday nights. But the time I spent with the brothers filled my need for association.” The loving interest of the congregation helped this brother to become well rooted and stabilized in the faith, and he now serves as a member of the Bethel family.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:2:6-51:2:7" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Col. 2:6, 7</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Build One Another Up: </strong>We may discern an opportunity to extend a helping hand when our brothers face challenging circumstances. Could you arrange to do telephone witnessing with an infirm publisher or invite him to accompany you on a Bible study, perhaps even bringing the student to his home? Might a parent with small children appreciate a helping hand when sharing in the ministry? Are there timid ones who would welcome your assistance when making return visits or when engaging in some other facet of the ministry? Loving interest in our brothers will move us to look for ways to build them up.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:14:19-45:14:19" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Rom. 14:19</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>As we imitate Jehovah’s tender concern for his servants, we strengthen one another, help draw the congregation together in love, and glorify our heavenly Father.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:4:16-49:4:16" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Eph. 4:16</a>.</p>

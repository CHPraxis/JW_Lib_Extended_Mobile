Question Box
▪ How should we care for congregation assignments?
The orderly functioning of a congregation of Jehovah’s people is the result of united effort. (1 Cor. 14:33, 40) Think of what is involved with just one congregation meeting. Besides the program itself, there is much activity before and after the meeting as brothers and sisters care for various assignments. Other duties that are cared for out of public view are also important. How can each of us contribute to this arrangement?
Make yourself available. Those with a willing spirit will find plenty of things to do. (Ps. 110:3) Show concern for the sick and elderly. Assist with the cleaning of the Kingdom Hall. We can perform many beneficial deeds without a special invitation. We simply need a desire to help.
Serve modestly. Modest people are happy serving others. (Luke 9:48) Modesty will prevent us from taking on more than we can realistically handle. Further, modesty will keep us from exceeding the limits of our authority.​—Prov. 11:2.
Be trustworthy. Moses was encouraged to select “trustworthy men” to handle positions of responsibility in ancient Israel. (Ex. 18:21) This same quality is needed today. Conscientiously care for each assignment you receive. (Luke 16:10) If you are unable to fulfill an assignment, make sure that appropriate arrangements are made for someone to care for it in your absence.
Give your best. Christians are exhorted to work whole-souled even in secular matters. (Col. 3:22-24) There is greater reason to do so when working to advance true worship. Even if a task appears to be lowly or insignificant, it is a blessing to the congregation when it is done well.
Each assignment provides us with an opportunity to demonstrate our love for Jehovah and our brothers. (Matt. 22:37-39) May we faithfully care for whatever duties are entrusted to us.

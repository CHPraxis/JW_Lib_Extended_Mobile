<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHILE traveling home from work one day, Charles, an employee at a university in Kenya, lost his cellular phone. In Kenya, these are still a costly luxury item.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I didn’t expect anyone to return it,” said Charles. A few days later, however, he was surprised to receive a phone call from the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Kenya. He could hardly believe what he was hearing when he was asked to come and claim his cell phone! It turned out that a full-time minister of Jehovah’s Witnesses had ridden in the same vehicle as Charles and had found the phone. In an effort to find the owner, the minister brought the phone to the branch office, and the volunteer workers there eventually located Charles by tracing the number displayed on the phone.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I very much appreciate the efforts made to contact me despite the hardships involved,” said Charles in a letter he wrote to the branch office. “I sincerely thank the members of your organization who found the cell phone, traced it to me, and returned it. It is not easy to find an honest person today, but it is encouraging that we have a few who stand out as true Witnesses of Jehovah God.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses everywhere are known for their honesty. They imitate the apostle Paul, who said: “We trust we have an honest conscience, as we wish to conduct ourselves honestly in all things.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:13:18-58:13:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:11:1-46:11:1" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 11:1</a>) They appreciate that such conduct gives glory to Jehovah God, as Jesus said: “Let your light shine before men, that they may see your fine works and give glory to your Father who is in the heavens.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:5:16-40:5:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 5:16</a>.</p>

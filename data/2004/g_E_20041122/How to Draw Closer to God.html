<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Many people have recommended reading the book <em>Draw Close to Jehovah. </em>Wrote one reader: “I just finished reading it, and never before have I been so moved. Thank you for all the reminders of what a loving, caring, kind, and concerned Father Jehovah really is.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Another person expressed how she felt, explaining: “The book gives me an opportunity to get to know my Father more intimately<wbr />—his awesome thoughts and deep loving feelings for us all. It’s like holding a precious diamond, brilliant and beautiful, and turning it slowly to examine each facet<wbr />—each new chapter being even more exquisite than the last.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Still another woman observed: “I have just finished reading <em>Draw Close to Jehovah. </em>As I reached the last two paragraphs, I had to take breaks and pray because I was so overwhelmed with awe and love. My appreciation for Jehovah has been brought to such unfathomable depths!”</p>

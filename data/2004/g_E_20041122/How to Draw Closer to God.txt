How to Draw Closer to God
Many people have recommended reading the book Draw Close to Jehovah. Wrote one reader: “I just finished reading it, and never before have I been so moved. Thank you for all the reminders of what a loving, caring, kind, and concerned Father Jehovah really is.”
Another person expressed how she felt, explaining: “The book gives me an opportunity to get to know my Father more intimately—his awesome thoughts and deep loving feelings for us all. It’s like holding a precious diamond, brilliant and beautiful, and turning it slowly to examine each facet—each new chapter being even more exquisite than the last.”
Still another woman observed: “I have just finished reading Draw Close to Jehovah. As I reached the last two paragraphs, I had to take breaks and pray because I was so overwhelmed with awe and love. My appreciation for Jehovah has been brought to such unfathomable depths!”

It Affected This Child’s Life
Years ago, Savinien, a nine-year-old boy from a small town in Pennsylvania, U.S.A., wrote a letter expressing appreciation for My Book of Bible Stories. The youth explained that he had just finished reading the book, which is filled with pictures that feature people and events in the Bible.
“I feel,” he wrote to the book’s publishers, “that you should keep printing this book so that you can keep on encouraging little kids like myself to know more about the Bible.
“What I’ve learned from this book is that everything in the Bible is true and that it was written to teach us, in order that we may have hope for the future.
“I would not have known this if it wasn’t for your taking an interest in us young people and breaking down this information so that we can better understand it.”

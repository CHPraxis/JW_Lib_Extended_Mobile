<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A woman in Veracruz, Mexico, was given an <em>Awake! </em>magazine that addressed a problem existing in her family. “It interested me very much,” she wrote, “because I could identify with the subject.” Her letter to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses continued: “This information will be of help to me and also to my husband and children.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The woman added this request: “I would like to know more about Jehovah’s Witnesses and the location of the nearest congregation. I want to attend with my family because I believe that we need to draw closer to God.” Featured on the last page of the issue of <em>Awake! </em>that had so impressed the woman was the book <em>The Secret of Family Happiness. </em>So she requested a copy.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In that book there is something for every member of the family<wbr />—husbands, wives, parents, children, grandparents—<wbr />yes, everyone. Among its instructive chapters are “Train Your Child From Infancy,” “Help Your Teenager to Thrive,” “Protect Your Family From Destructive Influences,” and “Maintain Peace in Your Household.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">You may request a copy of this book by filling in the accompanying coupon and mailing it to the address shown on the coupon or to an appropriate address on page 5 of this magazine.</p>

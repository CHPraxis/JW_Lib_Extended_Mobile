Help for Family Problems
A woman in Veracruz, Mexico, was given an Awake! magazine that addressed a problem existing in her family. “It interested me very much,” she wrote, “because I could identify with the subject.” Her letter to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses continued: “This information will be of help to me and also to my husband and children.”
The woman added this request: “I would like to know more about Jehovah’s Witnesses and the location of the nearest congregation. I want to attend with my family because I believe that we need to draw closer to God.” Featured on the last page of the issue of Awake! that had so impressed the woman was the book The Secret of Family Happiness. So she requested a copy.
In that book there is something for every member of the family—husbands, wives, parents, children, grandparents—yes, everyone. Among its instructive chapters are “Train Your Child From Infancy,” “Help Your Teenager to Thrive,” “Protect Your Family From Destructive Influences,” and “Maintain Peace in Your Household.”

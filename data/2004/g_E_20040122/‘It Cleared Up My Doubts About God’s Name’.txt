‘It Cleared Up My Doubts About God’s Name’
A Spanish-speaking man from San Diego, California, said the above in a letter to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the United States. He explained: “Although I am not a member of your organization, I enjoy reading your literature. I am writing now to congratulate you. Three days ago a brochure that had been thrown in the trash caught my attention. I picked it up, although it was wet. It was entitled The Divine Name That Will Endure Forever. After drying it, I examined it carefully.
“Never before have I been so fascinated by a publication. I don’t think that there is anything like it in the entire world. It cleared up all my doubts about God’s name. I am already using this damaged copy to teach my religious friends about the divine name. I ask them, ‘What is God’s name?’ but they can’t answer! Then I show them the brochure. Please send me three new copies in Spanish.”

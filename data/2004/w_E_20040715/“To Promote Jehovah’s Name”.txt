“To Promote Jehovah’s Name”
WORLDWIDE, The Watchtower and its companion magazine, Awake!, are appreciated for their spiritual content and instructive value. Reflecting this, a reader in France recently wrote the following letter:
“I am a young woman, originally from Africa, with very little schooling. Not long ago, I began reading your magazines. Drawn by the subjects, I am discovering the value of reading. Thanks to you, I have improved my vocabulary and can write a letter with fewer mistakes in it.
“I am amazed that you handle everything having to do with humans, the planet, and the Creator. These articles are so explicit that they make a person want to become an avid reader. No one else has the ability to teach all kinds of people at the same time.
“I am also amazed when I see that all of this is not done for commercial ends but simply to promote Jehovah’s name. I know that you have his approval, and I thank you. Please continue to draw strength from the Creator in order to teach.”
Jehovah’s Witnesses are currently pursuing their Bible educational work in 235 lands. The Watchtower is published in 148 languages and Awake! in 87. These journals are not printed to bring praise to any human. The Bible-based counsel and up-to-date information found in them is designed to honor the Creator, who says: “I, Jehovah, am . . . the One teaching you to benefit yourself.” (Isaiah 48:17) May you benefit yourself by reading the Holy Scriptures regularly with these Bible study aids in hand.

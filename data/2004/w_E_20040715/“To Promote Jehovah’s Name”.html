<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WORLDWIDE, <em>The Watchtower </em>and its companion magazine, <em>Awake!, </em>are appreciated for their spiritual content and instructive value. Reflecting this, a reader in France recently wrote the following letter:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I am a young woman, originally from Africa, with very little schooling. Not long ago, I began reading your magazines. Drawn by the subjects, I am discovering the value of reading. Thanks to you, I have improved my vocabulary and can write a letter with fewer mistakes in it.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I am amazed that you handle everything having to do with humans, the planet, and the Creator. These articles are so explicit that they make a person want to become an avid reader. No one else has the ability to teach all kinds of people at the same time.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“I am also amazed when I see that all of this is not done for commercial ends but simply to promote Jehovah’s name. I know that you have his approval, and I thank you. Please continue to draw strength from the Creator in order to teach.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses are currently pursuing their Bible educational work in 235 lands. <em>The Watchtower </em>is published in 148 languages and <em>Awake! </em>in 87. These journals are not printed to bring praise to any human. The Bible-based counsel and up-to-date information found in them is designed to honor the Creator, who says: “I, Jehovah, am . . . the One teaching you to benefit yourself.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:48:17-23:48:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 48:17</a>) May you benefit yourself by reading the Holy Scriptures regularly with these Bible study aids in hand.</p>

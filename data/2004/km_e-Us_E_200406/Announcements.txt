Announcements
▪ Literature offer for June: Learn From the Great Teacher. If individuals say they have no children, offer the Require brochure. When using the brochure, concentrate on starting home Bible studies. July and August: Offer the Knowledge book or the Require brochure. When householders already have these publications, use another appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock. September: Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? As an alternative offer, you may feature Life​—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?
▪ The branch facilities in Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, will be closed on the following Saturdays: September 11, 2004 (Gilead graduation); October 2, 2004 (annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania); March 12, 2005 (Gilead graduation); and May 14, 2005 (spring cleaning). There will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on those dates.
▪ In order to ensure the security of the Kingdom Hall, the last person to leave the building should lock the door and engage any other security measures. If that person is unable to secure the building, he should call someone who can and then wait until that one arrives before leaving. The elders should maintain an updated list of responsible publishers who have been issued Kingdom Hall keys.
▪ A consideration of the video Respect Jehovah’s Authority will be outlined in the September issue of Our Kingdom Ministry. Copies of the video are available in American Sign Language, Chinese, English, Japanese, and Spanish. All congregations are reminded to request these with their next literature request as needed.

Jehovah Helps Those Who Trust Him
1 Many people view money, power, and human ability as keys to success. (Ps. 12:4; 33:16, 17; 49:6) However, those who fear Jehovah and place their trust in him have the Bible’s assurance that “he is their help and their shield.” (Ps. 115:11) Let us consider two areas in which we need to demonstrate trust in Jehovah.
2 As Christian Ministers: Whenever we handle assignments in the congregation or teach in the field ministry, we must rely on our God. Consider Jesus’ example. Although he was God’s Son, he did not trust in his own wisdom or ability but relied completely on his heavenly Father. (John 12:49; 14:10) How much more so do we need to do the same! (Prov. 3:5-7) Only with Jehovah’s blessing will our humble efforts honor him and benefit others.​—Ps. 127:1, 2.
3 We demonstrate our reliance on Jehovah by praying for his guidance and the help of his holy spirit. (Ps. 105:4; Luke 11:13) In addition, we show our trust in God by basing our teaching on his Word, the Bible. Its message has the power to touch hearts and transform lives. (Heb. 4:12) When we “minister as dependent on the strength that God supplies,” Jehovah is glorified.​—1 Pet. 4:11.
4 Dealing With Problems: We also need to look to Jehovah for help when facing pressures and problems. (Ps. 46:1) For example, an employer may hesitate to give us time off to attend an assembly, or we may face a challenging situation in our family life. We show our trust in Jehovah by earnestly petitioning him and applying the guidance that he provides through his Word and organization. (Ps. 62:8; 119:143, 173) By so doing, Jehovah’s servants experience his helping hand in their lives.​—Ps. 37:5; 118:13, 16.
5 Jehovah himself assures us: “Blessed is the able-bodied man who puts his trust in Jehovah, and whose confidence Jehovah has become.” (Jer. 17:7) May we demonstrate our trust in him in all that we do!​—Ps. 146:5.

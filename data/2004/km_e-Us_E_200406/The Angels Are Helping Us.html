<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>“Look! I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.” How encouraging those words are to all those heeding Jesus’ command: “Go therefore and make disciples”! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:18-40:28:20" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 28:18-20</a>) One significant way that Jesus is with true Christians is by means of his angels. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:13:36-40:13:43" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 13:36-43</a>) How thrilling it is to declare the “everlasting good news” in unison with these faithful spirit creatures!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:6-66:14:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Rev. 14:6, 7</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>In Our Ministry: </strong>The Bible reveals that the angels are sent “to minister for those who are going to inherit salvation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:1:14-58:1:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Heb. 1:14</a>) In the first century, the angels were involved in directing Jesus’ followers to deserving ones. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:8:26-44:8:26" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Acts 8:26</a>) Today, God’s servants continue to see evidence of angelic direction. On many occasions, householders have said that they had been praying for help when a Witness came to their door. How we, along with the angels, rejoice when such ones respond to the Kingdom message!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:15:10-42:15:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Luke 15:10</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>Facing Opposition: </strong>Daniel, his three young Hebrew companions, the apostle Peter, and many others who have undergone great tests have experienced Jehovah’s protection by means of angels, “mighty in power.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:103:20-19:103:20" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Ps. 103:20;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:3:28-27:3:28" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> Dan. 3:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:6:21-27:6:22" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 6:21, 22;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:11-44:12:11" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> Acts 12:11</a>) Although at times we may feel helpless in the face of opposition, we can be encouraged by the experience of Elisha’s attendant when he learned that “there are more who are with us than those who are with them.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:6:15-12:6:17" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Ki. 6:15-17</a>) Even if we are forcibly separated from our Christian brothers, we need not despair. God’s Word assures us: “The angel of Jehovah is camping all around those fearing him.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:34:7-19:34:7" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 34:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Soon angelic armies will ride forth to remove all opposition to Christ’s kingship. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:11-66:19:11" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Rev. 19:11,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:19:14-66:19:15" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 14, 15</a>) While we await that day, may we continue boldly praising Jehovah, fully confident of the powerful support of heavenly armies under Christ’s command.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:22-60:3:22" data-bid="11-1" class="b">1 Pet. 3:22</a>.</p>

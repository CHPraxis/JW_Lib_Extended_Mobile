<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Finning his way along the base of a rocky ledge, a scuba diver saw a two-foot- <strong>[60 cm]</strong>long cuttlefish hovering in a recess, almost perfectly camouflaged in its blue-gray surroundings. When the diver got closer, the cuttlefish flushed a brilliant, shimmering crimson. When he backed off, it returned to its original color. Have you ever wondered how these amazing mollusks accomplish that feat<wbr />—an ability they share with certain species of octopus and squid?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Their secret lies in chromatophores, pigment-bearing cells in the skin. Nerves cause muscular contractions that regulate the size of these cells, thus causing the creature to vary its color and create changing patterns of color.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In addition to controlling color, many species of squid even produce their own light, doing so in a way similar to that of the common firefly. This bioluminescence, which is seen in many other marine creatures<wbr />—from jellyfish to shrimp—<wbr />results from complex chemical reactions in cells called photocytes or in organs called photophores. It can also result from the activity of luminous bacteria that enjoy a symbiotic relationship with their host.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In the former case, the light-emitting cells and organs contain a chemical called luciferin, which reacts with oxygen in the presence of an enzyme, creating light that is usually blue to green in color. Some luminous organs, says the journal <em>Scientific American, </em>“are elaborate devices with lenses for focusing, a color filter, or an adjustable flap that serves as an off/on switch. Squid that have both photophores and chromatophores within their skin can control both the color and the intensity of light produced.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Creatures that glow by employing luminous bacteria accommodate their microscopic guests in special light organs, which are endowed with a rich supply of blood. The blood carries nutrition to the microbes, in effect paying the “light bill.”</p>

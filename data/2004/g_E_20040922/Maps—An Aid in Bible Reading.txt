Maps—An Aid in Bible Reading
When you read in the Bible about people and the places to which they traveled, do you ever try to visualize the route they took or the land they visited? Now with the help of the recently published Bible atlas “See the Good Land,” you can add to your knowledge of Bible geography.
A woman in Ireland who received a copy of the brochure “See the Good Land” explains: “Every morning as I do my Bible reading, my brochure gets a workout. How thrilling to trace the footsteps of the people—the prophets, the kings—imagining the difficulties in travel, the distances, and the locations where they lived. I add my own little notes to the maps as I go along. I’m still in the Hebrew Scriptures but look forward with great anticipation to the Greek Scriptures.”

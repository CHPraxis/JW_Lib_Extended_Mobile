<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“Put on the complete suit of armor from God that you may be able to stand firm against the machinations of the Devil.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:11-49:6:11" data-bid="1-1" class="b">EPHESIANS 6:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="qu">1, 2. In your own words, describe the spiritual armor Christians need to put on.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb">ROME was at the height of its power during the first century C.E. The strength of the Roman legions enabled the city to control much of the then known world. One historian described this army as “the most successful military organization in history.” Rome’s professional army was made up of well-disciplined soldiers who underwent rigorous training, but their success as an effective fighting force also depended on their armor. The apostle Paul used a Roman soldier’s armor to illustrate the spiritual equipment Christians need in order to battle successfully against the Devil.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>We find a description of this spiritual armor at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:14-49:6:17" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:14-17</a>. Paul wrote: “Stand firm . . . with your loins girded about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness, and with your feet shod with the equipment of the good news of peace. Above all things, take up the large shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the wicked one’s burning missiles. Also, accept the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, that is, God’s word.” Viewed from a physical standpoint, the suit of armor that Paul described provided a Roman soldier with considerable protection. Then, too, he wielded a sword, his principal weapon for individual combat.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 3. Why should we obey the instructions of Jesus Christ and follow his example?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Apart from equipment and training, the success of the Roman army depended on the soldiers’ obedience to their commander. Similarly, Christians must obey Jesus Christ, whom the Bible describes as a “commander to the national groups.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:55:4-23:55:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 55:4</a>) He is also “head of the congregation.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:23-49:5:23" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ephesians 5:23</a>) Jesus gives us instructions for our spiritual warfare and provides a perfect example of how to wear spiritual armor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:21-60:2:21" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:21</a>) Since a Christlike personality has much in common with our suit of spiritual armor, the Scriptures advise us to “arm” ourselves with the mental disposition of Christ. <span id="page16" class="pageNum" data-no="16" data-before-text="16"></span>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:1-60:4:1" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Peter 4:1</a>) As we analyze each piece of our spiritual armor, then, we will use the example of Jesus to demonstrate its importance and effectiveness.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>Protecting the Loins, the Breast, and the Feet</strong></p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 4. What role did a girdle play in a soldier’s armor, and what does it illustrate?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><em>Loins girded about with truth. </em>In Bible times, soldiers wore a wide leather belt, or girdle, that was from two to six inches <strong>[5-15 cm] </strong>wide. Some translators suggest that the verse should read, “with truth as a belt tight around your waist.” The soldier’s belt helped to protect his loins, and it provided a convenient support from which to suspend the sword. When a soldier girded his loins, he was getting ready for battle. Paul used the soldier’s belt to illustrate the extent to which Scriptural truth should influence our lives. It should be tightly wrapped around us, as it were, so that we live in harmony with the truth and can defend it on any occasion. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:43:3-19:43:3" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 43:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:3:15-60:3:15" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 3:15</a>) To that end, we need to study the Bible diligently and meditate on its contents. Jesus had God’s law ‘within his inward parts.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:40:8-19:40:8" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 40:8</a>) When questioned by opposers, he could therefore respond by quoting the Scriptures from memory.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:19:3-40:19:6" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Matthew 19:3-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:23-40:22:32" data-bid="9-2" class="b"> 22:23-32</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 5. Explain how Scriptural advice can help us in times of trial or temptation.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>When we allow Bible truth to guide us, it can protect us from faulty reasoning and enable us to make wise decisions. During times of temptation or trial, the Bible’s guidelines will strengthen our resolve to do what is right. In effect, we will see our Grand Instructor, Jehovah, and will hear a word behind us saying: “This is the way. Walk in it.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:30:20-23:30:21" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Isaiah 30:20, 21</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 6. Why does our figurative heart need protection, and how can righteousness effectively safeguard it?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup><em>Breastplate of righteousness. </em>The breastplate of the soldier protected a vital organ, the heart. Our figurative heart​—the person we are on the inside—​needs special protection because it is inclined toward what is wrong. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:8:21-1:8:21" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Genesis 8:21</a>) We must therefore get to know and love Jehovah’s righteous standards. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:97-19:119:97" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Psalm 119:97,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:105-19:119:105" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 105</a>) Our love of righteousness leads us to reject worldly thinking that ignores or waters down Jehovah’s clear guidelines. Moreover, when we love what is right and hate what is wrong, we avoid pursuing a course that can ruin our lives. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:99-19:119:101" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Psalm 119:99-101;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/30:5:15-30:5:15" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Amos 5:15</a>) Jesus is exemplary in this regard, for concerning him, the Scriptures say: “You loved righteousness, and you hated lawlessness.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:1:9-58:1:9" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Hebrews 1:9</a>.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p39" data-pid="39" class="qu"> 7. Why did a Roman soldier need good footwear, and what does it illustrate?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup><em>Feet shod with the equipment of the good news of peace. </em>Roman soldiers needed adequate shoes or sturdy sandals, since during a campaign they often marched 20 miles <strong>[30 km] </strong>each day while wearing or carrying some <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>60 pounds <strong>[27 kg] </strong>of armor and equipment. Paul appropriately used footwear to represent our readiness to preach the Kingdom message to everyone who will listen. This is important because how will people come to know Jehovah if we are not ready and willing to preach?​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:13-45:10:15" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Romans 10:13-15</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu"> 8. How can we imitate Jesus’ example as a preacher of the good news?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>What was the most important activity in the life of Jesus? He told the Roman Governor Pontius Pilate: ‘I have come into the world to bear witness to the truth.’ Jesus preached whenever he found a hearing ear, and he enjoyed his ministry so much that he gave it priority over his physical needs. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:5-43:4:34" data-bid="16-1" class="b">John 4:5-34;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:18:37-43:18:37" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 18:37</a>) If we, like Jesus, are eager to declare the good news, we will find many opportunities to share it with others. Furthermore, our being absorbed in our ministry will help keep us spiritually strong.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:18:5-44:18:5" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Acts 18:5</a>.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>The Shield, the Helmet, and the Sword</strong></p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu"> 9. What protection did a large shield offer a Roman soldier?</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup><em>The large shield of faith. </em>The Greek word translated “large shield” refers to a shield that was large enough to cover most of the body. It would provide protection from the “burning missiles” referred to at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:6:16-49:6:16" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:16</a>. In Bible times, soldiers used darts made out of hollow reeds having small iron receptacles that could be filled with burning naphtha. One scholar describes these darts as “one of the most dangerous weapons in ancient warfare.” If a soldier did not have a large shield to protect himself from such missiles, he could be gravely injured or even killed.</p>
<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">10, 11. (a) What “burning missiles” of Satan could undermine our faith? (b) How does Jesus’ example show the importance of faith during times of trial?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span><sup>10 </sup>What “burning missiles” does Satan employ to undermine our faith? He may promote persecution or opposition in the family, at work, or at school. A desire to possess more and more material things and the lure of immorality have also proved spiritually devastating in the case of some. To protect ourselves against such threats, “above all things, [we must] take up the large shield of faith.” Faith comes from learning about Jehovah, regularly communicating with him in prayer, and discerning how he protects and blesses us.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:23:14-6:23:14" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Joshua 23:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:17:5-42:17:5" data-bid="19-2" class="b"> Luke 17:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:10:17-45:10:17" data-bid="19-3" class="b"> Romans 10:17</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>When Jesus was on earth, he demonstrated the importance of having strong faith during critical times. He totally trusted his Father’s decisions and was delighted to do God’s will.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Proverbs 27:11</a>) If we have similar confidence in Jehovah, we will not let criticism or opposition weaken our faith. Instead, our faith will be strengthened if we rely on God, show love for him, and keep his commandments. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:19:7-19:19:11" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Psalm 19:7-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:5:3-62:5:3" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 1 John 5:3</a>) No material rewards or fleeting sensual pleasure can compare with the blessings Jehovah has in store for those who love him.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:10:22-20:10:22" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Proverbs 10:22</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>The sort of confidence that Jesus had is not automatic. If we fill our mind with the dreams and goals of this system of things instead of keeping in mind the hope ahead, our faith in God’s promises will get weaker.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>When he was tempted by Satan in the wilderness, Jesus effectively used the sword of the spirit to fend off false reasoning and cunning temptations. To each challenge of Satan, he replied: <em>“It is written.” </em>(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:4:1-40:4:11" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Matthew 4:1-11</a>) David, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Spain, likewise found that the Scriptures helped him to overcome temptation. When he was 19 years old, an attractive young woman who worked in the same cleaning company suggested that they “have a good time together.” David rejected her advances and asked his supervisor for work in a different area so that the situation would not arise again. “I remembered the example of Joseph,” David said. “He rejected immorality and immediately got out of the way.

Regarding Roman soldiers, the Jewish historian Josephus wrote: “Every soldier is every day exercised, and that with great diligence, as if it were in time of war which is the reason why they bear the fatigue of battles so easily.” In our spiritual warfare, we need to use the Bible. Moreover, we must ‘do our utmost to present ourselves approved to God, as workmen with nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of the truth aright.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:15-55:2:15" data-bid="36-1" class="b">2 Timothy 2:15</a>) And how much satisfaction we experience when we use the Scriptures to answer an interested person’s sincere question!</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Book of Deuteronomy</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE year is 1473 B.C.E. Forty years have passed since Jehovah delivered the sons of Israel from Egyptian bondage. Having spent these years in the wilderness, the Israelites are still a nation without a land. At last, though, they stand at the threshold of the Promised Land. What awaits them as they take possession of it? What problems will they encounter, and how should they deal with them?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Before Israel crosses the Jordan River into the land of Canaan, Moses prepares the congregation for the great task ahead. How? By delivering a series of discourses that encourage and exhort, admonish and warn. He reminds the Israelites that Jehovah God deserves exclusive devotion and that they must not follow the ways of the surrounding nations. These speeches make up the main part of the Bible book of Deuteronomy. And the counsel given in them is just what we need today, for we too live in a world in which giving Jehovah our exclusive devotion is a challenge.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Written by Moses except for the last chapter, the book of Deuteronomy covers a period of a little over two months.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:1:3-5:1:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 1:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/6:4:19-6:4:19" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Joshua 4:19</a>) Let us see how what is stated there can help us to love Jehovah God with all our heart and serve him faithfully.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>‘DO NOT FORGET WHAT YOUR EYES HAVE SEEN’</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><strong>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:1:1-5:4:49" data-bid="3-1" class="b"><strong>Deuteronomy 1:1–4:49</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">In the first discourse, Moses recounts some of the wilderness experiences​—particularly those that will be helpful to the Israelites as they prepare to take <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>possession of the Promised Land. The account of the appointment of judges must have reminded them that Jehovah organizes his people in a way that ensures loving care. Moses also relates that the bad report of the ten spies led to the failure of the preceding generation to enter the land of promise. Think of the impact this warning example must have had on Moses’ listeners as that land lay before their very eyes.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Recalling the victories that Jehovah had given the sons of Israel before they crossed the Jordan must have infused them with courage as they stood ready to begin their conquest on the other side of the river. The land they were about to occupy was rife with idolatry. How fitting that Moses gives a stern warning against idol worship!</p>

Why? Because they were the offspring of Jacob’s brother. The Israelites were not to molest or war against the Moabites and the Ammonites, for they were descendants of Abraham’s nephew Lot. However, the Amorite Kings Sihon and Og had no such claims to the land under their control. Hence, when Sihon refused to let the Israelites pass through and Og came to meet them in battle, Jehovah commanded the Israelites to demolish their cities, leaving no survivors.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">In his second speech, Moses recounts the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai and restates the Ten Commandments. Seven nations are specified for complete destruction. The sons of Israel are reminded of an important lesson they learned in the wilderness: “Not by bread alone does man live but by every expression of Jehovah’s mouth does man live.” In their new situation, they must “keep the whole commandment.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:8:3-5:8:3" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 8:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:11:8-5:11:8" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> 11:8</a>.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">As they settle in the land of promise, the Israelites will need laws not only regarding worship but also respecting judgment, government, war, and everyday social and private life. Moses reviews these laws and <span id="page26" class="pageNum" data-no="26" data-before-text="26"></span>emphasizes the need to love Jehovah and obey his commandments.</p>

The Israelites used the same garments and footwear they started out with, likely passing them on to others as children grew up and adults died. Since the two censuses taken at the beginning and at the end of the wilderness trek revealed that the number of Israelites did not increase, the original supply of these items would have been sufficient.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:2:32-4:2:32" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Numbers 2:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:26:51-4:26:51" data-bid="14-2" class="b"> 26:51</a>.</p>

A foreigner and an alien resident who did not become proselytes were not under the Law and could use unbled dead animals in various ways. The Israelites were permitted to give or sell such animals to them. The proselyte, on the other hand, was bound by the Law covenant. As indicated at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:17:10-3:17:10" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Leviticus 17:10</a>, such a person was forbidden to eat the blood of an animal.</p>

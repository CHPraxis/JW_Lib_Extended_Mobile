<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">CHILDREN love to play. But “this is not trivial or empty activity,” explains the book <em>The Developing Child. </em>“It is the stuff on which much of cognitive development seems to be built.” By playing, children learn to use their senses, understand their environment, and interact with others.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Starting at age four or five, children will begin to enact adult roles as part of their games. Jesus once spoke about children at play. Some wanted to play “wedding,” others wanted to play “funeral” and, as children often do, they argued among themselves because some did not want to participate. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:11:16-40:11:17" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 11:16, 17</a>) This type of game playing can serve to imprint meaningful roles on the mind of the developing child.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The children in the pictures are playing the roles of a Bible teacher and a student. Theirs is not a real Bible study, but the idea of sharing the Bible’s message is clearly on their mind. And this lesson is an important one, for Jesus commanded all his followers to make disciples and teach people to observe all the things he had taught them.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Parents whose children like to pretend to conduct Bible studies, give talks, or preach from house to house can deservedly feel proud of themselves. Naturally, children imitate what they observe the grown-ups around them do. Children’s Bible games reflect that they are being brought up “with the sort of education and counsel the Lord approves.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:6:4-49:6:4" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ephesians 6:4</a>, <em>Charles B. Williams.</em></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Jehovah wants children to have a share in true worship. He told Moses to include “the little ones” when the Law was read. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:31:12-5:31:12" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 31:12</a>) If young children feel involved, their games will likely reflect it. And the child who plays at being a minister of God is taking the first step on the road to becoming one.</p>

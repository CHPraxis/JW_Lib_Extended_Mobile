▪ Literature offer for October 1-17: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Where interest is shown, offer the Require brochure, making a special effort to start Bible studies. October 18–November 14: Special campaign distribution of Keep on the Watch! November 15-30: Learn From the Great Teacher. If individuals say they have no children, offer the Require brochure. When using the brochure, concentrate on starting home Bible studies. December: The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. As an alternative offer, you may use My Book of Bible Stories, The Bible​—God’s Word or Man’s?, or You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. January: Any book published prior to 1990 that the congregation may have in stock. If you do not have any of these in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus of older publications on hand that you can use. Congregations that do not have older books may offer Worship the Only True God.
▪ Since October will have five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.

▪ If you are admitted to a hospital and want visiting local elders and, in larger cities, elders serving on a Patient Visitation Group to have access to your name, what must you do? When identifying yourself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, you should also explain that you are willing to have a minister of Jehovah’s Witnesses visit you. A recently enacted federal law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), protects your privacy, but with your consent, the law allows for the elders to learn of your admission and provide spiritual encouragement.

District Convention Stimulates Us to Walk With God
How the “Walk With God” District Convention echoed Jehovah’s clear direction: “This is the way. Walk in it, you people”! (Isa. 30:21) Applying the instruction we received will help us to ‘keep strict watch on how we walk.’ (Eph. 5:15) Meditating on what we learned will assist us as we “go on walking in the truth.”​—3 John 3.

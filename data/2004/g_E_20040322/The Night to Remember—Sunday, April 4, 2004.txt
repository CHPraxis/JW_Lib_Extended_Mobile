The Night to Remember—Sunday, April 4, 2004
ON THE night before he died, Jesus Christ instituted the Memorial of his death. At a simple meal with his apostles in which he used wine and unleavened bread as symbols, Jesus commanded: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”—Luke 22:19.
Jehovah’s Witnesses warmly invite you to share with them in remembering this annual Memorial. This year it will be held after sundown on Sunday, April 4, the date that corresponds to Nisan 14 on the Bible’s lunar calendar. Please check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the exact meeting place and time.

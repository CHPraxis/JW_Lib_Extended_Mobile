<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IN THE White Mountains of the western United States at 10,000 feet <strong>[3,000 m] </strong>above sea level lives what is thought to be the oldest tree in the world<wbr />—a bristlecone pine called the Methuselah Tree, also known as the Old Man. Estimated to be over 4,700 years old, Methuselah is the senior member in a grove of ancient bristlecone pines known as the Methuselah Grove.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">These trees endure a brutal environment. “Average precipitation is less than 30 centimetres [12 inches] a year, most of which falls as snow, so there is very little moisture,” says a report in the journal <em>New Scientist. </em>“And the trees stand on dolomite, a form of limestone that contains very few nutrients.” Additionally, “the temperatures are extreme and the wind blows ferociously.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Yet, these very conditions are linked to the trees’ longevity. “Conditions are so dry that even viruses and bacteria find it hard going. And [bristlecone pine] wood is so dense and resinous that it is impenetrable to insect pests. Lightning is a danger, but the trees are far enough apart for fire not to spread,” explains <em>New Scientist.</em></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The trees’ growing season lasts about 45 days. They conserve their limited energy reserves by growing very slowly. Their girth increases by as little as an inch <strong>[25 mm] </strong>a century, and their needles (leaves) last up to 30 years. The tallest tree stands about 60 feet <strong>[18 m] </strong>high. Researchers estimate that the oldest pines may have another five centuries of life left in them.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In recent years, people who want to extend the human life span have taken a keen interest in the bristlecone pine, hoping to uncover its secrets. The real key to longevity, however, is much more readily available than something that might be found high on a mountain in a gnarled old tree. Says the world’s most ancient book, the Bible: “This means <em>everlasting life, </em>their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 17:3</a>) That knowledge is available to all. Why not investigate it for yourself?</p>

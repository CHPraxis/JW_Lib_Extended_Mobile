Benefit From the Video No Blood​—Medicine Meets the Challenge
How well-informed are you about the options that are available in the field of bloodless medicine? Do you understand what some of the transfusion alternatives are and how they work? Watch this video, and test your knowledge with the following questions.​—Note: Because the video includes brief surgical scenes, parents should use discretion in deciding whether their young children should see it.
(1) What is the main reason why Jehovah’s Witnesses refuse blood transfusions, and where is that principle found in the Bible? (2) When it comes to medical care, what do we desire? (3) What basic right do patients have? (4) Why is it rational and responsible to reject blood transfusions? (5) When severe blood loss occurs, what two urgent priorities do doctors have? (6) What health risks are associated with blood transfusions? (7) What are some of the tools that surgeons have available to them to minimize blood loss during surgery? (8) What should you want to be informed about regarding any transfusion alternative? (9) Can serious and complicated surgeries be performed without the use of blood transfusions? (10) What are a growing number of physicians willing to do for Jehovah’s Witnesses, and what may eventually become the standard of care for all patients?
Acceptance of any treatments presented in the video is an individual, conscientious decision.​—See the June 15, 2004, Watchtower, pp. 22-4, 29-31, and the October 15, 2000, Watchtower, pp. 30-1.

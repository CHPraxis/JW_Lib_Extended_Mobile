<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>December: </strong><em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. </em>As an alternative offer, you may use <em>My Book of Bible Stories, The Bible−God’s Word or Man’s?, </em>or <em>You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. </em><strong>January: </strong>Any book published prior to 1990 that the congregation may have in stock. If you do not have any of these in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus of older publications on hand that you can use. Congregations that do not have older books may offer <em>Worship the Only True God. </em><strong>February: </strong><em>Draw Close to Jehovah. </em>If this publication is not available, you may use the <em>Creation </em>book (large or small size) or the <em>Revelation Climax </em>book as an alternative offer. <strong>March: </strong><em>Keep on the Watch! </em>Where genuine interest is shown, offer the <em>Knowledge </em>book, making a special effort to start Bible studies.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ The cover series “Understanding Your Doctor” appearing in the January 22, 2005, issue of <em>Awake! </em>is designed to help people to deal more understandingly with their physicians. However, the articles will no doubt be of interest to doctors themselves, since the series addresses why some physicians have been attracted to the Bible’s message of hope. You may wish to order extra copies and make a special effort to give a copy to your doctor as well as to other health care professionals. Congregations should notify the branch at once of any increased orders for this issue.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ The Memorial invitations for <strong>2005 </strong>in the primary language of each congregation will soon be sent to the congregation. If other languages are spoken in your territory and you would like a supply of invitations in those languages, these should be requested as soon as possible on a <em>Literature Request Form </em>(S-14). A listing of the languages in which Memorial invitations are available will appear in the “Announcement to All Congregations,” which is mailed each month. Please request only those languages needed for your territory.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ Please note that the Memorial for the year <strong>2006 </strong>will be on Wednesday, April 12, after sundown. This advance notice is given so that brothers may make necessary reservations or contracts for available halls when there are several congregations using the Kingdom Hall and other facilities must be found. In such instances, the elders should have an agreement with the management ensuring that there will be no disturbances from other activities in the building so that the Memorial observance can proceed in a peaceful and orderly manner.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ Because of the importance of the Memorial, the body of elders should select one of the more qualified elders to be the speaker instead of simply taking turns or using the same brother every year. If there is an elder of the anointed who is able to give the talk, he should be selected.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ Beginning the week of June 27, 2005, we will study <em>Pay Attention to Daniel’s Prophecy! </em>at the Congregation Book Study.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The Governing Body has approved combining the essential elements of the durable power of attorney (DPA) document and the <em>Advance Medical Directive/Release </em>card into a single legal document, which we shall refer to generally as a DPA card. A DPA card has been prepared for each state. The actual title of the DPA card varies from state to state.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">You will need to fill out the DPA card for your state of residence only. The DPA card is valid indefinitely anywhere in the United States and will serve as a statement of your wishes when you travel internationally. In the future, you should fill out a new DPA card if (1) you need to make any changes to your DPA card, such as changing your wishes, health-care agents, addresses, and telephone numbers, or (2) your DPA card has been lost or destroyed.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The DPA card should be prayerfully considered and carefully filled out at home. However, before signing the card, it is important that the legal formalities be closely followed. For example, if your card says that two witnesses are required to see you sign, they should be present when you sign it. Book study overseers may periodically check with those who have not filled out new cards to see if assistance is needed.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Before folding the DPA card, make good-quality photocopies for your health-care agent, alternate health-care agent, and doctor as well as for your own records. You may also want to provide copies for other family members and the congregation secretary. Copies should be single-sided on standard-size (8 1/2ʺ x 11ʺ) paper, with the DPA card centered on the page. The original DPA card, not a photocopy, should be kept on your person.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The <em>Identity Card </em>with the print date of 3/99 for unbaptized children of Witness parents has not changed. Parents should ensure that a card for each minor child is properly filled out and signed and that the child carries it at appropriate times.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Unbaptized publishers may adapt the language of the DPA card and <em>Identity Card </em>in order to write out health-care instructions for themselves and their children. The secretary should provide a DPA card for all newly baptized publishers during the year.</p>

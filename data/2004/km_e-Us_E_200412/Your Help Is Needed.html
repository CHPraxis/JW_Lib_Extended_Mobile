<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>“Thank you for all you do in behalf of all of us. It really makes a difference.” That comment well expresses the gratitude we feel for our elders and ministerial servants. As God’s organization continues to expand, there is an ongoing need for mature men to serve in the nearly 100,000 congregations worldwide. If you are a baptized brother, your help is needed.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:5-55:4:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Tim. 4:5</a>) Take a sincere interest in the welfare of fellow believers. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:13-45:12:13" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Rom. 12:13</a>) Be a good student of God’s Word, and develop the “art of teaching.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:9-56:1:9" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Titus 1:9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:13-54:4:13" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 1 Tim. 4:13</a>) Diligently care for the assignments entrusted to you by the elders.

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Serving in an appointed capacity involves hard work and requires a spirit of self-sacrifice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:5:17-54:5:17" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Tim. 5:17</a>) Therefore, in reaching out, focus on humbly serving others.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:16:1-44:16:2" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Acts 16:1, 2</a>) As you cultivate the spiritual qualities needed to handle added privileges and apply any counsel for improvement that you receive, “your advancement [will] be manifest to all persons.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:15-54:4:15" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Tim. 4:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>Parents, Train Young Ones to Help: </strong>Children can begin learning to help from an early age. Train them to pay attention at meetings, to preach, and to be exemplary in conduct at the Kingdom Hall and at school. Get them involved in serving others, doing things such as assisting with Kingdom Hall cleaning, helping the elderly, and so forth. Allow them to experience the happiness that comes from giving. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:35-44:20:35" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Acts 20:35</a>) Such training can help them to become the pioneers, the ministerial servants, and the elders of tomorrow.</p>

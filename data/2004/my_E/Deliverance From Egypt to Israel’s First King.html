<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Moses led the Israelites from captivity in Egypt to Mount Sinai, where God gave them his laws. Later, Moses sent 12 men to spy out the land of Canaan. But 10 of them returned with a bad report. They caused the people to want to go back to Egypt. For their lack of faith, God punished the Israelites by having them wander for 40 years in the wilderness.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Finally, Joshua was chosen to lead the Israelites into the land of Canaan. To help them take the land, Jehovah caused miracles to happen. He made the Jordan River stop flowing, the walls of Jericho to fall down, and the sun to stand still for a whole day. After six years, the land was taken from the Canaanites.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Beginning with Joshua, Israel was ruled for 356 years by judges. We learn about many of them, including Barak, Gideon, Jephthah, Samson and Samuel. We also read about such women as Rahab, Deborah, Jael, Ruth, Naomi and Delilah. In all, Part THREE covers 396 years of history.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">LOT and his family lived together with Abraham in the land of Caʹnaan. One day Abraham said to Lot: ‘There isn’t land enough here for all our animals. Please, let us separate. If you go one way, then I will go the other.’</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Lot looked over the land. He saw a very nice part of the country that had water and a lot of good grass for his animals. This was the District of the Jordan. So Lot moved his family and animals there. They finally made their home in the city of Sodʹom.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The people of Sodʹom were very bad. This upset Lot, because he was a good man. God was upset too. Finally, God sent two angels to warn Lot that he was going to destroy Sodʹom and the nearby city of Go·morʹrah because of their badness.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The angels told Lot: ‘Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters and get out of here!’ Lot and his family were a little slow in going, and so the angels took them by the hand and led them out of the city. Then one of the angels said: ‘Run for your lives! Don’t look back. Run to the hills, so that you won’t be killed.’</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Lot and his daughters obeyed and ran away from Sodʹom. They didn’t stop for a moment, and they didn’t look back. But Lot’s wife disobeyed. After they had gone some distance from Sodʹom, she stopped and looked back. Then Lot’s wife became a pillar of salt. Can you see her in the picture?</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">We can learn a good lesson from this. It shows us that God saves those who obey him, but those who do not obey him will lose their lives.</p>

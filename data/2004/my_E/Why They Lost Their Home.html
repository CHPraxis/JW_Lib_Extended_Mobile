<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">SEE what’s happening now. Adam and Eve are being put out of the beautiful garden of Eden. Do you know why?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It is because they did something very bad. And so Jehovah is punishing them. Do you know the bad thing Adam and Eve did?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">They did something God told them not to do. God told them they could eat food from the trees of the garden. But from one tree God said not to eat, or else they would die. He kept that tree as his own. And we know it is wrong to take something that belongs to someone else, don’t we? Well, what happened?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">One day when Eve was alone in the garden, a snake spoke to her. Think of that! It told Eve to eat fruit from the tree from which God told them not to eat. Now, when Jehovah made snakes he did not make them so they could talk. So this can only mean that someone else was making the snake speak. Who was that?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">It wasn’t Adam. So it had to be one of the persons that Jehovah had made long before he made the earth. Those persons are angels, and we cannot see them. This one angel had become very proud. He began thinking that he should be a ruler like God. And he wanted people to obey him instead of obeying Jehovah. He was the angel that made the snake talk.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">This angel was able to fool Eve. When he told her that she would become like God if she ate the fruit, she believed it. So she ate, and Adam did too. Adam and Eve disobeyed God, and that is why they lost their beautiful garden home.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">But someday God will see to it that the whole earth is made as pretty as the garden of Eden. Later we will learn how you may share in making it this way. But now, let’s find out what happened to Adam and Eve.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">IF SOMEONE were walking toward you and he was as tall as the ceiling in your house, what would you think? That person would be a giant! At one time there really were giants on the earth. The Bible shows that their fathers were angels from heaven. But how could that be?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Remember, the bad angel Satan was busy making trouble. He was even trying to get God’s angels to be bad. In time, some of these angels started to listen to Satan. They stopped the work that God had for them to do in heaven. And they came down to earth and made human bodies for themselves. Do you know why?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The Bible says that it is because these sons of God saw the pretty women on earth and wanted to live with them. So they came to earth and married these women. The Bible says that this was wrong, because God made the angels to live in heaven.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">When the angels and their wives had babies, these babies were different. At first they may not have looked very different. But they kept growing bigger and bigger, and getting stronger and stronger, until they became giants.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">These giants were bad. And because they were so big and strong, they would hurt people. They tried to force everyone to be bad like themselves.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Eʹnoch had died, but there was one man on earth now who was good. This man’s name was Noah. He always did what God wanted him to do.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">One day God told Noah that the time had come for Him to destroy all the bad people. But God was going to save Noah, his family and many of the animals. Let’s see how God did this.</p>

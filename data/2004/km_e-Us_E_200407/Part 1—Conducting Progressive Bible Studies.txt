Part 1​—Conducting Progressive Bible Studies
What Is a Bible Study?
1 Worldwide, about six million Bible studies are being conducted by God’s people each month. By using good teaching methods, we can help these Bible students progress to the point of dedication and baptism and become “adequately qualified to teach others.” (2 Tim. 2:2) Would you like to help your student to make such progress? Starting with this issue, Our Kingdom Ministry will feature a series of articles that will explain basic aspects of conducting progressive Bible studies.
2 When to Report a Bible Study: If you regularly and systematically have Bible discussions, though brief, using the Bible along with one of the recommended publications, you are conducting a Bible study. This is true even if the study takes place on the doorstep or over the telephone. The study may be reported when it has been conducted two times after the study arrangement is demonstrated and if there is reason to believe that the study will continue.
3 The Require brochure and the Knowledge book are publications used for conducting many Bible studies. After they have been completed, if it is evident that a person is making progress, even slowly, and that he is developing appreciation for what he is learning, then the study may be continued in the Worship God book. The brochure You Can Be God’s Friend! may be used to study with people who have limited education or reading ability.
4 The Bible study work has been effective in assisting millions to become true disciples of Jesus Christ. (Matt. 28:19, 20) By applying the suggestions offered in upcoming articles of this series, you can conduct a progressive Bible study.

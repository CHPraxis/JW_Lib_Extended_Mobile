Announcements
▪ Literature offer for July and August: Offer the Knowledge book or the Require brochure. When householders already have these publications, use another appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock. September: Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? As an alternative offer, you may feature Life−How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? October: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Since October will have five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.
▪ Starting in September, circuit overseers will give the public talk entitled “Facing the Future With Faith and Courage.”
▪ Congregation secretaries should maintain an adequate supply of the forms Application for Regular Pioneer Service (S-205) and Application for Auxiliary Pioneer Service (S-205b). These can be ordered on the Literature Request Form (S-14). Maintain at least a one-year supply.
▪ Before submitting applications for regular pioneer service to the branch office, the congregation secretary should review the forms to make sure they are complete. If applicants cannot recall the exact date of their baptism, they should estimate the date and keep a record of it. The secretary should note this date on the Congregation’s Publisher Record card.
▪ Whenever personal travel plans include attending congregation meetings, an assembly, or a district convention in another land, your request for information regarding dates, times, and locations must be directed to the branch office that oversees the work in that land. Addresses of branch offices are listed on the last page of the current Yearbook.

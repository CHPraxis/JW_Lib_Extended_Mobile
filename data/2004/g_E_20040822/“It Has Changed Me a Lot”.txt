“It Has Changed Me a Lot”
That is what a 12-year-old boy from Virginia, U.S.A., wrote regarding the new book Learn From the Great Teacher. He said that it taught him some things he didn’t know and had never heard of. He explained:
“Learn From the Great Teacher has taught me always to love God, to talk about him to everybody, and to talk to him in prayer. It has also taught me to ask God for help and protection. I learned that anyone who loves God and does what God commands will be in Paradise.
“It has changed me a lot. I used to lie all the time, but when I started reading this book, I stopped lying. The things I have learned from this book gave me the desire to read more books like it. So I would be glad to read and find out more about God.”
Possibly you will feel the same way when you read this beautifully illustrated 256-page book with the same page size as this magazine. You too may enjoy reading such chapters as “Jesus Teaches Us to Pray,” “A Lesson on Being Kind,” “The Way to Be Happy,” and “Why We Should Not Lie.” You may request a copy by filling in the accompanying coupon and mailing it to the address provided or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what a 12-year-old boy from Virginia, U.S.A., wrote regarding the new book <em>Learn From the Great Teacher. </em>He said that it taught him some things he didn’t know and had never heard of. He explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><em>“Learn From the Great Teacher </em>has taught me always to love God, to talk about him to everybody, and to talk to him in prayer. It has also taught me to ask God for help and protection. I learned that anyone who loves God and does what God commands will be in Paradise.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“It has changed me a lot. I used to lie all the time, but when I started reading this book, I stopped lying. The things I have learned from this book gave me the desire to read more books like it. So I would be glad to read and find out more about God.”</p>

Branch Letter
Dear Kingdom Publishers:
We rejoice to announce that, with Jehovah’s blessing, the new presses and bindery at Wallkill are now in operation. We warmly invite all of you to tour these streamlined facilities. How grateful we are to the brothers and sisters from seven nearby Regional Building Committees who have thus far contributed over 67,000 man-hours to this project! One such volunteer remarked: “It was more than a privilege. It was a dream come true for me.”
In Brooklyn, brothers are now working diligently to renovate the 117 Adams Street complex in preparation for the laundry and other essential support departments that are relocating there after the recent sale of the 360 Furman Street building. Hundreds of skilled workers from Regional Building Committees across the country are ‘offering themselves willingly’ in response to a special invitation to assist in this effort. (Ps. 110:3) The first of these volunteers arrived in August. Your heartfelt support of the expansion of pure worship endears you to us and to our appreciative God, Jehovah.−2 Cor. 9:7.
We are pleased to report that a new peak of 2,303,015 attended the observance of the Lord’s Evening Meal. Along with you, we look forward to “having plenty to do in the work of the Lord” as we begin the 2005 service year.−1 Cor. 15:58.
Your brothers,
U.S. Branch Office

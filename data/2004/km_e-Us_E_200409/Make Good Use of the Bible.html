<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="qu"> 1. What might you do in preparation for the field ministry?</p>
<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[16]" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Regardless of what literature we plan to offer in the ministry, it is beneficial to select a thought-provoking scripture to share with those who will listen. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Heb. 4:12</a>) Selecting a scripture that is used in the publication you are offering would contribute to an effective transition to the publication. In some areas, publishers have found it beneficial to carry the Bible in their hand when approaching a person or when working from house to house.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="qu"> 2. (a) How can we open our presentation with a scripture? (b) What Scriptural subjects interest people in the territory?</p>

This quickly directs attention to God’s Word. Would some of these introductions be effective in your territory?</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">With what do you associate the ancient names Korah, Dathan, and Abiram? Rebellion! Against what? Godly authority. The details of their tragic course are recorded in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:16:1-4:16:50" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Numbers chapter 16</a>, and an overview of the matter is provided in the article “Loyally Submit to Godly Authority” in the August 1, 2002, <em>Watchtower. </em>You would find it beneficial to read this material and then view the sobering portrayal of it in the video <em>Respect Jehovah’s Authority. </em>You will see the conflict that developed between the faithful sons of Korah and their rebellious father, who was on a collision course with the Sovereign of the universe. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/4:26:9-4:26:11" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Num. 26:9-11</a>) This true-life drama should inspire all of us to develop our loyalty to Jehovah even more fully.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">As you watch the video, look for the evidence that Korah and his fellow rebels failed the test of loyalty in six crucial areas: <strong>(1) </strong>How did they disrespect godly authority? <strong>(2) </strong>How did they let pride, ambition, and jealousy affect them? <strong>(3) </strong>How did they focus on the deficiencies of those appointed by Jehovah? <strong>(4) </strong>What complaining attitude had they developed? <strong>(5) </strong>Why had they become dissatisfied with their privileges of service? <strong>(6) </strong>How did they let friends and family take precedence over loyalty to God?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Consider how the lessons learned in this Bible drama apply to our personal view of godly authority today: <strong>(1) </strong>How should we respond to the decisions of elders in the congregation, and why? <strong>(2) </strong>How can we counteract any improper motives within us? <strong>(3) </strong>How should we react to the imperfections of those appointed to take the lead? <strong>(4) </strong>What should we do if a complaining spirit begins to develop in our heart? <strong>(5) </strong>How should we feel about any privileges we have been given? <strong>(6) </strong>Who should never take priority over our loyalty to God, and when might this become a difficult test for us?</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">After this information is discussed in the congregation, why not watch the video again? Let it doubly impress upon your mind the reasons why we must always respect Jehovah’s authority!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:18:25-19:18:25" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 18:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:28-19:37:28" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 37:28</a>.</p>

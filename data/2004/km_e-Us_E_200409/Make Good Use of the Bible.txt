Make Good Use of the Bible
 1. What might you do in preparation for the field ministry?
1 Regardless of what literature we plan to offer in the ministry, it is beneficial to select a thought-provoking scripture to share with those who will listen. (Heb. 4:12) Selecting a scripture that is used in the publication you are offering would contribute to an effective transition to the publication. In some areas, publishers have found it beneficial to carry the Bible in their hand when approaching a person or when working from house to house.
 2. (a) How can we open our presentation with a scripture? (b) What Scriptural subjects interest people in the territory?
2 Open With a Scripture: Some publishers open their presentation by asking the householder a simple viewpoint question on a Bible text that they then proceed to read. This quickly directs attention to God’s Word. Would some of these introductions be effective in your territory?
▪ “If you had the power to do so, would you bring about these changes?” Read Revelation 21:4.
▪ “Why are we living in such critical times?” Read 2 Timothy 3:1-5.
▪ “Do you think our community would be a better place if everyone followed this advice?” Read Matthew 7:12.
▪ “Do you think your children will be able to enjoy the conditions described here?” Read Psalm 37:10, 11.
▪ “Do you think the day will ever come when these words come true?” Read Isaiah 33:24.
▪ “Are you familiar with the change of government mentioned here?” Read Daniel 2:44.
▪ “Have you ever wanted to ask God this question?” Read Job 21:7.
▪ “Is it possible to see our dead loved ones again?” Read John 5:28, 29.
▪ “Do the dead know what the living are doing?” Read Ecclesiastes 9:5.
 3. How can we help people to understand the Bible texts we read?
3 Explain, Illustrate, Apply: When a person is willing to converse, do not rush through the discussion. Take time to explain, illustrate, and apply the scripture that you read so that the person understands it. (Neh. 8:8) When people understand and accept what God’s Word teaches, it can bring about marvelous changes in their lives.​—1 Thess. 2:13.
 4. How can we make good use of the Bible on return visits?
4 Continue to make good use of the Bible as you cultivate the interest. You can use this same method when making return visits: (1) Select an appropriate scripture. (2) Raise a simple viewpoint question regarding the text. Then read it. (3) Explain, illustrate, and apply it. Strive to add to the person’s knowledge of God’s Word each time you visit. You may soon be conducting a Bible study!

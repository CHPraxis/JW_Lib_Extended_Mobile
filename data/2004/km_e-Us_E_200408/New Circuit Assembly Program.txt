New Circuit Assembly Program
In these “critical times hard to deal with,” we need godly wisdom to gain and retain Jehovah’s approval. (2 Tim. 3:1) The circuit assembly program for the 2005 service year will provide us with practical counsel and encouragement as it develops the theme “Be Guided by ‘the Wisdom From Above.’”​—Jas. 3:17.
The first symposium, “Manifesting ‘the Wisdom From Above’ in Our Life,” will help us to see what is involved in being chaste, peaceable, reasonable, and ready to obey. Then the circuit overseer will give attention to three other aspects of heavenly wisdom. The district overseer will conclude the first day by showing how Christian ministers, although viewed by some as “unlettered and ordinary,” are equipped to speak God’s wisdom.​—Acts 4:13.
On the second day, a symposium entitled “Pursue the Things That Are Upbuilding” will help us to identify and avoid things that can tear us down spiritually. It will also show us how we can build up others at congregation meetings, in the field ministry, and in the family circle. The public talk, “How Godly Wisdom Benefits Us,” will deepen our appreciation for the benefits we receive as we apply divine principles in our lives. The concluding talk, “Acting Upon Divine Wisdom Safeguards Us,” will strengthen our resolve to turn to Jehovah for wisdom during these last days.
A highlight of every assembly is the baptism of new disciples. The Theocratic Ministry School and the Watchtower Study for the week will also be featured on the program. Jehovah desires all of us to benefit from the wisdom he provides. We will be spiritually enriched by the counsel and encouragement that await us at our circuit assembly.​—Prov. 3:13-18.

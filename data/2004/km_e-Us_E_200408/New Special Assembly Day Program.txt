New Special Assembly Day Program
If we see or hear a warning signal but do not act on it, the results could be disastrous. It is even more important to act on the spiritual direction that Jehovah provides. This will be emphasized in the special assembly day program for the coming service year. The theme is “Pay Attention to How You Listen.”​—Luke 8:18.
In his first talk, the visiting speaker will consider how the counsel in the opening chapters of Paul’s inspired letter to the Hebrews applies to us today. In the concluding talk, “Pay Constant Attention to Divine Instruction,” he will help all to examine whether they are truly listening to Jehovah, his Son, and “the faithful and discreet slave.”​—Matt. 24:45.
Several parts on the program will be especially beneficial for families. “Families That Listen Without Distraction to God’s Word” will help us to keep the things of the world from choking our spirituality. It will include interviews of those who have made changes in order to put spiritual things in first place. “How Attentive Listening to God’s Word Fortifies Our Youths” will include interviews of youths who have taken a stand for the truth at school, with their peers, or in the ministry. “Little Ones Who Listen to God and Learn” will help us not to underestimate the learning ability of young ones. Interviews with young ones and their parents will help us to see the good that comes from training children from infancy in Jehovah’s ways.
While Satan “is misleading the entire inhabited earth,” Jehovah is showing his faithful servants the way in which they should walk. (Rev. 12:9; Isa. 30:21) Listening attentively to his counsel and obediently applying it in our lives make us wise, bring us happiness, and lead to everlasting life.​—Prov. 8:32-35.

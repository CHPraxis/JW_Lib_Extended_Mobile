This material will be used to preview and review the circuit assembly program for the 2005 service year. The article “New Arrangement for Reviewing Assembly Programs,” which appears on page 4 of this insert, explains how this is to be handled. During the review, apportion the time so that all the questions are asked. The review should focus on how we can apply the information that was presented.

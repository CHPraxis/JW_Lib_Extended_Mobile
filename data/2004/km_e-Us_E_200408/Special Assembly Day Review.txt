Special Assembly Day Review
This material will be used to preview and review the special assembly day program for the 2005 service year. The article “New Arrangement for Reviewing Assembly Programs,” which appears on page 4 of this insert, explains how this is to be handled. During the review, apportion the time so that all the questions are asked. The review should focus on how we can apply the information that was presented.
MORNING SESSION
 1. Why is there an ever-growing need to listen to Jehovah? What does it mean to listen? (“Why Listen to Jehovah’s Voice”)
 2. How can families maintain a good program of spiritual activity? (“Families That Listen Without Distraction to God’s Word”)
 3. How have those in the circuit taken advantage of opportunities to witness informally? (“Doing All Things for God’s Glory”)
 4. What lessons can we learn from the warning example found in Hebrews chapters 3 and 4? How is Jehovah speaking to us today? (“Listening When God Speaks Safeguards Us”)
 5. How did you benefit from the baptism talk? (“Dedication and Baptism”)
AFTERNOON SESSION
 6. What can we discern about Jesus as a youth, and how are youths in the circuit imitating his example? (“How Attentive Listening to God’s Word Fortifies Our Youths”)
 7. What are some ways in which parents can begin training babies and young children in Jehovah’s ways? (“Little Ones Who Listen to God and Learn”)
 8. What are some specific areas in which we need to pay attention to Jehovah, his Son, and “the faithful and discreet slave”? (Matt. 24:45) Why is it vital that we do so? (“Pay Constant Attention to Divine Instruction”)

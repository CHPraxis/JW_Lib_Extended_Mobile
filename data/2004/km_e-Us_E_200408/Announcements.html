<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>August: </strong>Offer the <em>Knowledge </em>book or the <em>Require </em>brochure. When householders already have these publications, use another appropriate brochure that the congregation has in stock. <strong>September: </strong><em>Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? </em>As an alternative offer, you may feature <em>Life​</em>—<em>How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation? </em><strong>October: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. Where interest is shown, offer the <em>Require </em>brochure, making a special effort to start Bible studies.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Since October will have five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on September 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. When this has been done, make an announcement to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ Congregations should begin requesting the <em>2005 Calendar of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Examining the Scriptures Daily​—2005, </em>and the <em>2005 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses </em>with their next literature request. A listing of the languages in which these items are available will appear in the “Announcement to All Congregations,” which is mailed to all congregations each month.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ The annual inventory of all literature and magazines on hand should be taken on or as close as possible to August 31, 2004. This inventory is similar to the actual count taken monthly by the literature coordinator, and the totals should be entered on the <em>Literature Inventory </em>(S-18) form. The total number of magazines on hand should be obtained from the magazine servant(s). The secretary of the coordinating congregation should supervise the inventory. He and the presiding overseer of the coordinating congregation will sign the form. Each coordinating congregation will receive three <em>Literature Inventory </em>(S-18) forms. <em>Please mail the original to the branch office at 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483, no later than September 6. </em>Keep a copy for your files. The third copy may be used as a work sheet.</p>

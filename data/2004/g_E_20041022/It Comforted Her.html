<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A young adult from Japan recently wrote about suffering depression even as a preteen. What gave her comfort, the girl said, was a picture of a child in the arms of its father, which was published in our companion magazine, <em>The Watchtower. </em>The caption said: “Like the warm embrace of a loving father, Jehovah’s consolations can soothe our anxiety.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The girl explained that reading the book <em>Learn From the Great Teacher </em>gave her similar comfort. How so? “It is written in the style of a papa talking to a little child. When reading it, I feel as though I am in Jehovah’s arms, and I cannot hold back my tears. Sometimes I would just like to have someone listen to me and other times talk to me so that I could listen to him. But that is something a young child would ask for, and I can’t tell anyone to hold me in their arms or that I want them to talk to me. So, for now, Jehovah is doing this for me through the book.”</p>

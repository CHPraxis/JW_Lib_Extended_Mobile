It Comforted Her
A young adult from Japan recently wrote about suffering depression even as a preteen. What gave her comfort, the girl said, was a picture of a child in the arms of its father, which was published in our companion magazine, The Watchtower. The caption said: “Like the warm embrace of a loving father, Jehovah’s consolations can soothe our anxiety.”
The girl explained that reading the book Learn From the Great Teacher gave her similar comfort. How so? “It is written in the style of a papa talking to a little child. When reading it, I feel as though I am in Jehovah’s arms, and I cannot hold back my tears. Sometimes I would just like to have someone listen to me and other times talk to me so that I could listen to him. But that is something a young child would ask for, and I can’t tell anyone to hold me in their arms or that I want them to talk to me. So, for now, Jehovah is doing this for me through the book.”

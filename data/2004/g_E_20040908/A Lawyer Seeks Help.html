<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A lawyer, saddened by the number of marriages ending in divorce, wrote the following to the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Brazil: “Many of the clients who come to my office are already in the process of separation. It is so frustrating to hear them relate the reasons for ending their marriage, such as poor communication and a lack of genuine love. They are completely unaware of the advice contained in your publications.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Since he was familiar with Jehovah’s Witnesses, the lawyer wrote: “I would be grateful if you could send me material that I could pass on to my clients to help them reflect on the seriousness of marriage, reconsider their decision, and once again enjoy a harmonious and happy life together.”</p>

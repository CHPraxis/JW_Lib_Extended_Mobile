<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">For years readers, young and old alike, have been saying that the book <em>Questions Young People Ask<wbr />—Answers That Work </em>provides just what youths need to know. A girl in her mid-teens from Sinaloa, Mexico, requested ten copies of the book for some friends. She said that although she is not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, she really liked the book, explaining, “I have great respect for you.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">She noted: “I have many friends who have a lot of questions about their life today. I have shown them the book, and they liked it very much. The book is excellent and has everything that a youth would want to know.” She asked if the books could be delivered before the summer vacation break.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The <em>Young People Ask </em>book has 39 chapters. These include: “How Can I Get My Folks to Give Me More Freedom?” “How Can I Make Real Friends?” “What About Sex Before Marriage?” and “How Do I Know If It’s Real Love?” You may request a copy of this 320-page book by filling in the accompanying coupon and mailing it to the address provided or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.</p>

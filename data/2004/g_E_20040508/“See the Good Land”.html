<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“This wonderful instrument is just what I needed,” wrote a woman after reviewing <em>“See the Good Land,” </em>a recently published brochure of Bible maps. “The places and people and situations in the Scriptures have now come to life for me.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This 36-page, full-color brochure helps students of God’s Word to visualize Bible accounts. “To see the contrast between the elevation of the temple and that of the surrounding land really brings home the scriptures that speak of Jehovah’s ‘elevated’ worship,” she continues. “It is a great help to see clearly how the cities of refuge were laid out, as well as other sites in both the Hebrew and the Greek Scriptures. I started to use this lovely brochure in studying the Bible book of Acts.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">This woman concluded: “I can see myself using this beautiful gift constantly as I travel through God’s Word.”</p>

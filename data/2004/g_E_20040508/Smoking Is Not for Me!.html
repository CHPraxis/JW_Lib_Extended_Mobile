<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THAT topic was provided to hundreds of students participating in a statewide writing contest sponsored by the Missouri State Medical Association (MSMA) in the United States. Some 675 students from 42 schools submitted entries. The award went to 12-year-old Breanna, and her winning poem was printed in the MSMA journal <em>Missouri Medicine. </em>Breanna also had opportunity to read her poem to delegates attending the annual convention of the MSMA. Before doing so, Breanna told her audience:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, and all the facts in the poem came from <em>Awake! </em>magazine. As a matter of fact, the idea for one of my favorite lines of the poem came from the front cover of this issue. It shows a skull with a cigarette hanging out of its mouth and says: ‘Death for Sale.’ Over the years <em>Awake! </em>magazine has published many articles about the dangers of smoking.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses shun the use of tobacco. They believe that deliberately using any product that pollutes the body shows disrespect for the gift of life as well as for the Creator. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:17:24-44:17:25" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 17:24, 25</a>) Hence, they follow the Scriptural admonition: “Let us cleanse ourselves of every defilement of flesh and spirit.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/47:7:1-47:7:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Like other Witness youths, Breanna strives to live by Bible principles. Certainly all such young ones make the heart of their Creator rejoice.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:27:11-20:27:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 27:11</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">TO VISUALIZE events, you will find it helpful to be familiar with places you read about. For example, consider the missionary trips of the apostle Paul, related in the Bible book of Acts. On his first missionary tour, he started from Antioch, where Jesus’ followers were first called Christians. From there he traveled to such places as Salamis, Antioch of Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe. Can you visualize where these places were?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Perhaps not, unless you have a map. In the new 36-page brochure <em>“See the Good Land,” </em>such a map is included. A reader from Montana, U.S.A., comments appreciatively: “I can see Paul’s journeys and try to imagine his form of travel and the work he and other early ones did in spreading the good news. Thank you for such a beautiful visual aid.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The map of Paul’s journeys is but one of many in this brochure that will help the reader to visualize what is related in the Bible.

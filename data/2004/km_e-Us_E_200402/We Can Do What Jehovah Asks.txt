We Can Do What Jehovah Asks
 1. What feelings may we have to contend with at times, and why?
1 Complying with Jehovah’s laws and principles is the best way of life today, and it helps us to lay a fine foundation for an eternal future. (Ps. 19:7-11; 1 Tim. 6:19) However, Satan’s world puts us under much stress. Our own imperfect flesh adds to the challenge. In trying to fulfill our Scriptural responsibilities, we may at times feel overwhelmed. (Ps. 40:12; 55:1-8) We may even wonder if we can do all that Jehovah asks of us. At such times, what can help us to maintain our spiritual balance?
 2. How is Jehovah reasonable in what he expects of us?
2 Jehovah’s Commandments Not Burdensome: Jehovah never places unreasonable demands upon us. His commandments are not burdensome but are for our good. (Deut. 10:12, 13; 1 John 5:3) He takes into account our human frailties, “remembering that we are dust.” (Ps. 103:13, 14) God mercifully accepts our best efforts to serve him, even if these are limited by our circumstances. (Lev. 5:7, 11; Mark 14:8) He invites us to throw our burdens on him, and he assures us that he will make it possible for us to remain faithful.​—Ps. 55:22; 1 Cor. 10:13.
 3. How does Jehovah strengthen us to endure?
3 Need of Endurance: Bible accounts of integrity keepers such as Elijah, Jeremiah, and Paul show the need of endurance. (Heb. 10:36) Jehovah sustained them in times of adversity and discouragement. (1 Ki. 19:14-18; Jer. 20:7-11; 2 Cor. 1:8-11) And we are stirred by the loyalty of our brothers in modern times. (1 Pet. 5:9) Meditating on such examples can help us not to give out in our souls.
 4. Why is it important to keep God’s promises in focus?
4 Hope in God’s promises is “an anchor for the soul.” (Heb. 6:19) It moved Abraham and Sarah to accept Jehovah’s request to leave their home and ‘reside as aliens in the land of promise.’ It empowered Moses to take a fearless stand for true worship. It fortified Jesus to endure a torture stake. (Heb. 11:8-10, 13, 24-26; 12:2, 3) Keeping God’s promise of a righteous new world burning brightly in our hearts will likewise help us to remain steadfast.​—2 Pet. 3:11-13.
 5. Why can it be encouraging to reflect on our own past acts of loyalty?
5 Recalling our own past acts of loyalty, self-sacrifice, and boldness can also energize us in our service. (Heb. 10:32-34) It reminds us of the joy we experience when we give Jehovah what he asks of us​—our whole-souled devotion.​—Matt. 22:37.

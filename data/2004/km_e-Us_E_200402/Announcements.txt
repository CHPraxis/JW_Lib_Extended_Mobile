Announcements
▪ Literature offer for February: Draw Close to Jehovah. If this publication is not available, you may use the Creation book (large or small size) or the Revelation Climax book as an alternative offer. March: Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life. A special effort will be made to start home Bible studies. If people already have this publication, Pay Attention to Daniel’s Prophecy! may be offered. April and May: Feature individual copies of both The Watchtower and Awake! When making return visits on interested people, which may include those who attend the Memorial and/or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the organization, concentrate on placing the Worship God book. Every effort should be made to start a home Bible study, especially if some individuals have already studied the Knowledge book and the Require brochure.
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts on March 1 or as soon as possible thereafter. When this has been done, make an announcement to the congregation after the next accounts report is read. Read any acknowledgment of contributions the congregation has made to the worldwide work and to any other fund sponsored by the organization.
▪ The secretary and the service overseer should review the activity of all regular pioneers. If any are having difficulty meeting the hour requirement, the elders should arrange for assistance to be given. For suggestions, review the annual S-201 letters.
▪ The special public talk for the 2004 Memorial season will be entitled “Be Courageous, and Trust in Jehovah.” See the related announcement in the September 2003 Our Kingdom Ministry.

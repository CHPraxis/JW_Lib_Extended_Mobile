A Work Backed by God
1 Among God’s servants today, few possess outstanding education, wealth, or prominence in the present system of things. For that reason, some people dismiss our ministry as of little account. (Isa. 53:3) However, the Bible educational work that we do has brought comfort and hope to millions of people around the globe. How have ordinary people achieved such outstanding results? Only with God’s backing. (Matt. 28:19, 20; Acts 1:8) “God chose the weak things of the world,” explained the apostle Paul, “that he might put the strong things to shame.”​—1 Cor. 1:26-29.
2 The apostles and other first-century Christians were largely “unlettered and ordinary.” (Acts 4:13) Yet, they boldly pursued their commission to preach the good news, and Jehovah blessed their efforts. Despite obstacles and opposition, ‘the word of Jehovah kept growing and prevailing in a mighty way.’ Nothing could stop the work because it was backed by God. (Acts 5:38, 39; 19:20) The same has been true in modern times. Not even determined opposition by powerful rulers has been able to keep the good news from prevailing and growing.​—Isa. 54:17.
3 All Credit to God: Does our favored position as God’s ministers give us reason to boast in ourselves? Not at all. Referring to the Christian ministry, Paul wrote: “We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the power beyond what is normal may be God’s and not that out of ourselves.” (2 Cor. 4:7) Paul appreciated that he was able to carry out his ministry only in the strength that God supplied.​—Eph. 6:19, 20; Phil. 4:13.
4 We likewise recognize that it is only because we have “obtained the help that is from God” that the preaching work is being accomplished. (Acts 26:22) By such worldwide proclamation, Jehovah is using us in a mighty way to send a tremor through the nations​—a portent of the judgmental shattering soon to come. (Hag. 2:7) How privileged we are to be “God’s fellow workers” in the grand spiritual harvest!​—1 Cor. 3:6-9.

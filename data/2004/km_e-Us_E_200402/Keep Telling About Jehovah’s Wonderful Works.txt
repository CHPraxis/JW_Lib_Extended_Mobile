Keep Telling About Jehovah’s Wonderful Works
 1. What are some of Jehovah’s wonderful works that you particularly appreciate?
1 No one can compare to our great God, Jehovah! David wrote: “Many things you yourself have done, O Jehovah my God, even your wonderful works and your thoughts toward us; there is none to be compared to you.” (Ps. 40:5) Jehovah’s wonderful works include the creation of the universe, the Messianic Kingdom, acts of loving-kindness toward his people, and the worldwide preaching campaign. (Ps. 17:7, 8; 139:14; Dan. 2:44; Matt. 24:14) Love for Jehovah and appreciation for all that he has done move us to tell others about him. (Ps. 145:5-7) During March, April, and May, we will have opportunity to do this more fully.
 2. How do we personally benefit by auxiliary pioneering?
2 As an Auxiliary Pioneer: Can you arrange your schedule to spend 50 hours in the ministry during one or more of these months of special activity? It will surely be worth any adjustments you make in your routine. (Eph. 5:16) Many have found that auxiliary pioneering helps them to improve the quality of their ministry. They become more comfortable at the door and make greater use of the Bible. Spending more time in the ministry makes it easier to follow up any interest they find, and some who had not previously conducted a Bible study have started one while auxiliary pioneering. Because auxiliary pioneering involves expending ourselves in behalf of others, it is a joyful activity.​—Acts 20:35.
 3. How have some been able to auxiliary pioneer even with challenging circumstances?
3 Do not be quick to conclude that your circumstances do not allow you to have a share. One elder who auxiliary pioneered last year has two children and a full-time job. How did this busy brother do it? Since he works during the week, he planned long days in service on the weekends, starting with street witnessing at 7:00 a.m. on Saturdays. Several in the congregation who had similar circumstances also pioneered, and they supported and encouraged one another. In another congregation, a 99-year-old sister decided to pioneer in May after being invited by her daughter to join her. Others in the congregation assisted this elderly sister to go from door to door and on Bible studies by pushing her wheelchair. She also engaged in telephone witnessing, street witnessing, and letter writing. She is convinced that this was done, not in her own strength, but only with Jehovah’s help.​—Isa. 40:29-31.
 4. What factors might we consider when making a schedule to auxiliary pioneer?
4 Try writing out a schedule that best fits your circumstances. The sample schedules in this issue may be helpful. Do you work full-time or go to school? A schedule that utilizes primarily the weekends may be the most practical for you. If you have health problems and your energy does not allow for long days in the ministry, a schedule that calls for spending a little time each day may be best. Talk with others about your desire to auxiliary pioneer. Perhaps they will also make it their goal.
 5. What goals can youths set for March, April, and May?
5 Ways That Youths Can Share: Jehovah is pleased when young ones tell about his wonderful works. (Ps. 71:17; Matt. 21:16) If you are young and are baptized, perhaps you can auxiliary pioneer during a month that includes a school vacation. If you cannot serve as an auxiliary pioneer, can you set specific goals to increase your share and improve the quality of your ministry during these months? If you have been sharing in the ministry with your parents but are not yet an unbaptized publisher, now would be a good time to try to qualify. You need not feel that you must be an expert at answering Bible questions or that you have to know as much as baptized adults. Do you understand basic Bible teachings? Do you adhere to the Bible’s moral standards? Do you want to be identified as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses? Then talk with your parents about this. They can arrange to approach the elders with you to see if you meet the requirements.​—See the Our Ministry book, pages 98-9.
 6. How can we help Bible students to become publishers of the good news?
6 Helping Others to Preach: Progressive Bible students may qualify to join us as publishers during the upcoming months of special activity. If you have a Bible student who is making good progress, enlist the help of your book study overseer or the service overseer. One of them can join you on the study to evaluate the student’s progress. If the student qualifies and has the desire to become a publisher, the presiding overseer can arrange for two elders to meet with you and the student. (See The Watchtower, November 15, 1988, page 17.) Once the student is approved, begin training him in the ministry right away.
 7. How might irregular and inactive publishers be assisted?
7 Book study overseers will want to give special attention to any who are inactive or irregular in their group. Extend a personal invitation to them to work with you in the ministry. If they have been inactive for a long time, it is advisable that two elders first speak with them to see if they qualify. (See the November 2000 Our Kingdom Ministry Question Box.) The zeal of the congregation during these months of special activity may stimulate them to make the ministry a regular feature of their lives once again.
8, 9. What can the elders do to build enthusiasm for the special activity?
8 Prepare Now for Increased Activity: Elders, begin now to build up enthusiasm in the congregation for auxiliary pioneering. You can do much by your positive comments and good example. (1 Pet. 5:3) What was the congregation’s previous peak of auxiliary pioneers? Can it be exceeded this year? Book study overseers and their assistants should seek ways to encourage all in the group to increase their activity. Service overseers may schedule additional meetings for field service. Inform the congregation in advance what is arranged. Make sure that capable publishers are assigned to take the lead and that meetings for service start and conclude on time. (See the September 2001 Our Kingdom Ministry Question Box.) The service overseer should also arrange for there to be sufficient territory, magazines, and literature.
9 Last year the elders of one congregation started enthusiastically and well in advance to encourage auxiliary pioneering, with several of them submitting applications. They arranged additional meetings for field service​—one at 5:30 a.m. for street witnessing, another at 3:00 p.m. for those getting out of school, and a third at 6:00 p.m. for those getting off work. In addition, three meetings for field service were arranged on Saturdays. The congregation responded with 66 enrolling as auxiliary pioneers in April!
10. How can families prepare to increase their activity?
10 Why not set aside time during your next family study to set realistic goals for the coming months? With good cooperation and planning, some or all in the family may be able to auxiliary pioneer. If that is not possible, set goals to increase your activity by lengthening your usual service periods or by going out on additional occasions. Make it a matter of prayer as a family. You can be confident that Jehovah will bless your efforts.​—1 John 3:22.
11. (a) What wonderful things did Christ’s sacrifice accomplish? (b) What is the time and location of the local Memorial observance?
11 God’s Most Wonderful Work: Jehovah’s greatest expression of love is the gift of his Son as a ransom in our behalf. (1 John 4:9, 10) The ransom sacrifice provides the legal basis for redeeming mankind from sin and death. (Rom. 3:23, 24) Jesus’ shed blood validated the new covenant, making it possible for imperfect humans to be adopted as God’s sons with the prospect of ruling in the heavenly Kingdom. (Jer. 31:31-34; Mark 14:24) Most important, Jesus’ course of perfect obedience sanctified Jehovah’s name. (Deut. 32:4; Prov. 27:11) On Sunday, April 4, after sundown, the Memorial of Christ’s death will be commemorated around the world.
12. How can attending the observance of the Lord’s Evening Meal benefit interested ones?
12 Observance of the Lord’s Evening Meal magnifies Jehovah’s wonderful works. The discourse builds appreciation for what Jehovah did in providing the ransom. Interested ones in attendance will be able to observe other wonderful works of God. They will be able to see the unity and warm love Jehovah has taught his people to display. (Eph. 4:16, 22-24; Jas. 3:17, 18) Attendance on this important occasion can have a real impact on a person’s thinking, so we want as many as possible to be present.​—2 Cor. 5:14, 15.
13, 14. Whom should we invite to the Memorial, and how?
13 Inviting Others to Attend: Begin preparing right away by making a list of those to invite. Your list should include unbelieving family members, neighbors, acquaintances from work or school, past and present Bible students, and all your return visits. Book study overseers should include on their list any inactive publishers.
14 Use the printed Memorial invitations, and type or neatly write on them the time and location of the Memorial. Or you may wish to use the invitation that appears on the back cover of the March 15, 2004, Watchtower or the March 22, 2004, Awake! As April 4 draws closer, give those on your list a reminder, either in person or over the telephone.
15. How can we demonstrate hospitality on the night of the Memorial?
15 At the Memorial: Try to arrive early on the night of the Memorial. Demonstrate hospitality by warmly greeting new ones. (Rom. 12:13) You have a special responsibility toward the guests you invite. Make them feel welcome, and introduce them to others from the congregation. Perhaps you can help them find a seat near you. And if any do not have a Bible or a songbook, arrange for them to look on with you or someone else. After the observance, be available to answer any questions they may have. If some are there for the first time, ask whether they would like to learn more about God’s Word and purpose. Offer to conduct a home Bible study with them.
16. What can be done to help those who attended to make spiritual progress?
16 Continue Assisting Those Who Attended: In the weeks following the Memorial, those who attended may need further assistance. This includes those who once regularly attended meetings but who now have only limited association with the congregation. The elders will be alert to see that such ones are not overlooked, seeking to determine why they stopped making spiritual progress. Impress on them the urgency of the times. (1 Pet. 4:7) Help all to see the benefit of obeying the Scriptural exhortation to gather together regularly with God’s people.​—Heb. 10:24, 25.
17. Why should we keep telling about Jehovah’s wonderful works?
17 Jehovah’s works are too wonderful for us to grasp fully even if we live forever. (Job 42:2, 3; Eccl. 3:11) Therefore, we will never run out of things for which to praise him. This Memorial season we can demonstrate our appreciation for Jehovah’s wonderful works by making a special effort to expand our ministry.

How to Cope With Discouragement
ARE you discouraged? In this age of uncertainty and strife, many people are. Some are discouraged because they are unemployed. Others are coping with the aftermath of an accident. Still others are struggling with family problems, a serious illness, or feelings of loneliness.
If you are discouraged, where can you turn to for help? Millions worldwide have found comfort by reading God’s Word, the Bible. They are reassured by the words of the apostle Paul, who said: “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our tribulation.” (2 Corinthians 1:3, 4) Why not read this and other Bible passages in your own Bible? Doing so will ‘comfort your heart and make you firm.’—2 Thessalonians 2:17.
Help to cope with discouragement can also be found through association with those who serve Jehovah. Proverbs 12:25 says: “Anxious care in the heart of a man is what will cause it to bow down, but the good word is what makes it rejoice.” When we attend Christian meetings, we hear that “good word,” which is “sweet to the soul and a healing to the bones.” (Proverbs 16:24) Why not attend a meeting at a Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses to experience for yourself what a strengthening effect such a gathering can have on you?
You can also benefit from the power of prayer. If you feel overwhelmed by life’s anxieties, share your deepest feelings with the “Hearer of prayer.” (Psalm 65:2) Our Creator, Jehovah God, understands us better than we understand ourselves. We can count on his help. His Word promises us: “Throw your burden upon Jehovah himself, and he himself will sustain you. Never will he allow the righteous one to totter.” (Psalm 55:22) Yes, “those who are hoping in Jehovah will regain power.”—Isaiah 40:31.
Jehovah God has given us powerful provisions that can help us to cope successfully with discouragement. Will you use them?

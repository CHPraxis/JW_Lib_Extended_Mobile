<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Book of Genesis​—II</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">FROM the creation of the first man, Adam, to the death of Jacob’s son Joseph, Genesis covers 2,369 years of human history. The first 10 chapters as well as 9 verses of the 11th chapter <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:1-1:11:9" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ge 1:1–11:9</a>, covering the account from creation to the tower of Babel, were discussed in the preceding issue of this magazine.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> This article considers highlights from the remainder of Genesis, pertaining to God’s dealings with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>ABRAHAM BECOMES GOD’S FRIEND</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:11:10-1:23:20" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Genesis 11:10–23:20</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Some 350 years after the Flood, a man who proves to be very special to God is born in the line of descent of Noah’s son Shem. His name is Abram, later changed to Abraham. At God’s command, Abram leaves the Chaldean city of Ur and becomes a tent dweller in a land that Jehovah promises to give to him and his descendants. Because of his faith and obedience, Abraham comes to be called “Jehovah’s friend.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:23-59:2:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">James 2:23</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Jehovah takes action against the wicked inhabitants of Sodom and its nearby cities, while Lot and his daughters are preserved alive. A promise of God is fulfilled in the birth of Abraham’s son Isaac. Years later, Abraham’s faith is tested when Jehovah instructs him to offer this son as a sacrifice. Abraham is ready to obey but is stopped by an angel. There is no doubt that Abraham is a man of faith, and he is assured that by means of his seed, all nations will bless themselves. The death of his beloved wife, Sarah, brings much sorrow to Abraham.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:21:8-1:21:14" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Genesis 21:8-14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:4:29-48:4:29" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Galatians 4:29</a>) It ended with the deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage in 1513 B.C.E.</p>

Lot was prepared to do that. He bravely went out to the mob, closed the door behind him, and faced them alone. By the time he offered his daughters, Lot likely realized that his guests were messengers from God, and he may have reasoned that God could protect his daughters as He had protected his aunt Sarah in Egypt. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:12:17-1:12:20" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Genesis 12:17-20</a>) Indeed, as the matter turned out, Lot and his daughters were kept safe.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:2:6-61:2:8" data-bid="18-1" class="b">2 Peter 2:6-8</a>) The very fact that Lot’s daughters got him intoxicated suggests that they realized that he would not consent to having sexual relations with them while he was sober. But as aliens in the land, his daughters felt that this was the only way to prevent the extinction of Lot’s family. The account is in the Bible to reveal the relationship of the Moabites (through Moab) and the Ammonites (through Benammi) to Abraham’s descendants, the Israelites.</p>

Jehovah, in turn, reassured him. The result? Abraham “put faith in Jehovah.” If we open our hearts to Jehovah in prayer, accept his reassurances from the Bible, and obey him, our faith will be strengthened.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" class="sb">Abraham arranges for Isaac’s marriage to Rebekah, a woman having faith in Jehovah. She gives birth to the twins Esau and Jacob. Esau despises his birthright and sells it to Jacob, who later receives his father’s blessing. Jacob flees to Paddan-aram, where he marries Leah and Rachel and tends the flocks of their father for some 20 years before departing with his family. By Leah, Rachel, and their two maidservants, Jacob has 12 sons as well as daughters. Jacob grapples with an angel and is blessed, and his name is changed to Israel.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:7:13-22:7:13" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Song of Solomon 7:13</a>) While the Bible does not reveal Rachel’s motive for the exchange, she may have thought that the mandrakes would help her conceive and end her reproach of being barren.

<p id="p33" data-pid="33" class="sb">Jealousy moves Jacob’s sons to sell their brother Joseph as a slave.

In <span id="page29" class="pageNum" data-no="29" data-before-text="29"></span>time, he is brought forth from prison to interpret Pharaoh’s dreams, which foretell seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine. Joseph is then made Egypt’s food administrator. His brothers come to Egypt seeking food because of the famine. The family is reunited and settled in the fertile land of Goshen. On his deathbed Jacob blesses his sons and utters a prophecy that gives sure hope of great blessings in centuries to come. Jacob’s remains are taken to Canaan for burial. When Joseph dies at the age of 110, his body is embalmed, eventually to be transported to the Promised Land.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:13:19-2:13:19" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Exodus 13:19</a>.</p>

Sheepherders may simply have been near the bottom in the Egyptian caste system.

The commander’s staff is a long rod denoting his power to command. Jacob’s reference to these indicated that significant authority and power would reside with the tribe of Judah until the coming of Shiloh.

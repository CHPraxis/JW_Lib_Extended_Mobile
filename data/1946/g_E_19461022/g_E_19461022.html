<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Will World Education Establish Peace?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HERE is no question that there is a need for peace and unity throughout the world at the present time. The question is, How can such desired peace be established ? Since all efforts to outlaw war through treaty agreements have failed, many leaders of the world say that peace will come only through education, education of the whole world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">While many are willing to admit that peace and unity can be attained through world education, not many are willing to agree on the method and system to be employed. &quot;What kind of textbooks shall be used? What system of instruction shall be employed' Who shall supervise the education of the world? These are the knotty questions that must first be decided correctly before any globeencircling peace can be attained through world education.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hitlor and his gang thought that they could unify the whole world by seizing the children in their cribs and, by brute force, educating them in the Nazi way of thinking. Bnt such totalitarian world education did not and could not establish a genuine and lasting peace. The older method of world education employed by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy during the heyday of the •(Holy Roman Empire&quot; also failed to estahlish peace. Their method consisted of educating. only the clergy to Tead and wdte and speak, while the masses were educated in the art of being silent and subservient to papal Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With the </span><span class="font6">corning </span><span class="font8">of the Reformation light that Dark </span><span class="font6">Ago </span><span class="font8">method of education in superstition and fear vanished from many parts of the earth, and great advancements in science and learning were soon </span><span class="font6">made </span><span class="font8">Even during the last quarter-century a great battle has been won against illiteracy. It is said that 30i000,000 in Inclia, 40,000,000 in China and 100,000,000 in Russia have been taught to read. Nevertheless, peace has not come as a result of such education, but rather wars. The most terrible and peace-shattering wars in all human history have come with the advancement made in the education of the masses. Why is this!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After a year of study the Vienna History Teachers Association of Austria has come to the conclusion that one of the greatest faults in the educational program is in the history books used in the schools of the world. In such textbooks militarism and hero-worship have been stressed, and this glorifying of past wars is thought to be the cause for modern-day wars. Consequently Austria is revising all her history hooks to show primarily tJie history of economic and cultural pnrsnits, with the record of wars placed in a secondary position. It is a mistake, however, to thinli that such revision will lead to world peace, as will be shown subsequently.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>What System Shall Be Adopted?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">If the educational systems of the de-ftated </span><span class="font7">''Axis&quot; </span><span class="font8">powers are to he discarded. what svstew is to be used in their </span><span class="font6">l</span><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font6">l</span><span class="font8">ace </span><span class="font7">l It:; the </span><span class="font8">American system or the Ttussian type a satisfactory model for </span><span class="font7">world </span><span class="font8">education? Consider for a moment the American system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A11 wi</span><span class="font7">l</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">l </span><span class="font8">agree that the present generation ol' American 11 ‘n and women have had the greatest educational advantages </span><span class="font7">of </span><span class="font8">any pcopJp 011 this earth. .More </span><span class="font7">of </span><span class="font8">her hoys and girl:-; have gone and are going to college titan </span><span class="font7">hi </span><span class="font8">all the rest </span><span class="font7">of </span><span class="font8">the world put together. However, this does </span><span class="font7">not </span><span class="font8">warrant the </span><span class="font7">conclusion </span><span class="font8">that they enjoy greater peace aud nnHy among themselves than other nations, as a result of such education. The juvenile delinquency aml parpn t </span><span class="font7">eli’ </span><span class="font6">l</span><span class="font8">in</span><span class="font7">q</span><span class="font8">uenc.y too, the inability of </span><span class="font7">parents </span><span class="font8">tn govern Ilieir immediate </span><span class="font7">fmnil </span><span class="font8">ir’s, do not testi l'y </span><span class="font7">that </span><span class="font8">the educational svstem ol' America </span><span class="font7">is </span><span class="font8">the best. The fact that America has more criminals than all the rest oJ tlte world pnt together does nol ; </span><span class="font7">argue </span><span class="font8">in favor of America's twentieth-century system of education. Nor do the race riots and hatreds of mi-Jiorities </span><span class="font7">in </span><span class="font8">th</span><span class="font7">is </span><span class="font8">ronntry recommend the American system ns the means of gaining world-wide unity among a thousand tongues and creeds. No, the American sy:-;tern of education, though admittedly far superior to the totalitarian system of tlte Nnzis or the authoritarian system </span><span class="font7">of </span><span class="font8">tJie Hierarchy, is, nevertheless, wholly inadequate as </span><span class="font5">a </span><span class="font8">means of establishing world peare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What </span><span class="font7">about </span><span class="font8">the </span><span class="font7">Russian system? Is it </span><span class="font8">an ideal model of edneation? </span><span class="font7">Notwith</span><span class="font8">standing the fact that Russia spends four times </span><span class="font5">m; </span><span class="font7">much </span><span class="font8">on the education of her people al'i the United States, yet her system must he rejected at the very outset. Common log</span><span class="font7">i</span><span class="font8">c will not accept the Russian system, since its very foundation and structure is </span><span class="font7">wrOng. </span><span class="font8">If a totalitarian state brand or education under a label of Fascism or Nazism is a proyed failure, then with like force totalitarian methods of education that bear the Communist </span><span class="font7">label </span><span class="font8">are </span><span class="font7">unsatisfactory.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Corrective Measures</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">.At its first peacetime conference at Buffalo, N. Y., the National Education Association considered many problems facing the educators oi the country. Much of the time of </span><span class="font7">the 3,000 </span><span class="font8">delegates was spent in discussing the lowering of standards for teachers that took place during </span><span class="font7">the </span><span class="font8">war, nnd ah-m the low wages paid teachers todav. Admitting that incompetence is a p</span><span class="font5">r</span><span class="font8">e</span><span class="font7">s</span><span class="font8">e</span><span class="font5">n</span><span class="font8">t menace, yet the question is asked: Did the high standards teachers had to nwet in prewar days prevent World War II, or will the mere raising of teachers' salaries prevent </span><span class="font6">World </span><span class="font7">War lilt </span><span class="font8">Raise the pny of teachers, and raiRe tlio </span><span class="font7">requirements </span><span class="font8">teachers nave to meet, will this prevent school children from becoming vandals and destroying property </span><span class="font7">worth </span><span class="font8">t Itonsands of dollars, such as they did on sevoral occasions in New </span><span class="font7">York city </span><span class="font8">within the last year! Since international banditry is only a glorified form of juvenile vandalism, more drastic changes than these must be made in the educational systems </span><span class="font7">if </span><span class="font8">world peace is to be secured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The conference of the National Education Assoriation did not dismiss until it had made its re&lt;'ommendations for solv-• ing the problem </span><span class="font7">of </span><span class="font8">world education </span><span class="font7">a:; a </span><span class="font8">means of establishing pencf'. Mr. Benja</span><span class="font7">min </span><span class="font8">Fine, who covered the Buffalo meetings for the New </span><span class="font7">Y</span><span class="font8">o</span><span class="font7">rk Times, </span><span class="font8">reported:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Looking beyond immediate professional problems, however, the cducalors adopted a world-wide point of view. Complete support was given to the United Nations Educational, Scientific aud </span><span class="font7">Culturol </span><span class="font6">Organization; many of the leaders urged that teachers everywhere build their st'hool curriculum around the work of the United Nations. . </span><span class="font8">. </span><span class="font0">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the first jobs for UNESCO, the educators suggested, mig</span><span class="font8">ht </span><span class="font6">be a revision of textbooks to eliminate hiasetl and ultranation-alistic s</span><span class="font8">t</span><span class="font6">a</span><span class="font7">t</span><span class="font6">eme</span><span class="font8">nt</span><span class="font5">s</span><span class="font0">. </span><span class="font6">It was proposed that a universal history book, </span><span class="font7">p</span><span class="font8">r</span><span class="font5">es</span><span class="font6">e</span><span class="font7">n</span><span class="font8">t</span><span class="font6">i</span><span class="font8">n</span><span class="font7">g </span><span class="font5">311 </span><span class="font6">impartial and fair account of the contributions of every nation, should be prepared for general school </span><span class="font7">use.

<p><span class="font8">That Buffalo conference thus set the stage for the world conference of educators that took pl</span><span class="font5">a</span><span class="font8">ce n few weeks later.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Tile results of this educational work were openly manifest at the recent international convention of these teachers held at Cleveland, Ohio, August 4-11 (see the September 22 issue of Awake!). At that convention there were upward of 60,000 delegates in attendance, from </span><span class="font6">32 </span><span class="font7">nations, and sessions were held in 20 different languages.

<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Education Makes the Difference</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">If the sanie education were given in the public schools of the world as given Jehovah's witnesses, then tlteTe would be no strife between men, no hatred between races, no wars between nations. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Like </span><span class="font7">Peter, they would exclaim: &quot;Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: but in every nation be that feareth Jim, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.&quot;—Acts 10:34, 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is no fanciful word-picture that is here painted. It is a fact that is testified to by the thousands upon thousandR of men and women of every nationality, namely, Jehovah's witnesses. Did anyone ever hear of these witnesses' being Nazis or Fascists or Communists, though they Jived in those countries? No, Jehovah's witnesses were the ones that were tortured in the concentratjon camps at. the hands of the totalitarians. Did anyone ever hear of the &quot;witnesses&quot; of one nation fighting their brethren of another nation on the Lattlefields' No, never f But the world has heard of Catholics of Italy fighting Catholics of America, and Protestants of Germany fighting Protestants of Britain, all because of their wrong education.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>History Is Important</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">To say that history as taught in the past is the cause of war is foolishness. The fact that God's true worshipers are lovers and -pursuers of peace is not because they have avoided reading presentday history books. History is important. By studying secular history lovers of righteousness learn how selfish politics, greedy commerce and hypocritical religion have heen the moving forces behind every war that lias ever been fought. Consequently, when tlu&gt;Re elements whip up an open conflict today righteously disposed persons, heeanse of their right education, avoid becoming involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Today, when reactionary forces are so anxious to seize the history books ann censor from them the history of man's past bloody course on this ear-th under the pretense that it wil establish peacei lovers of freedom of aU nations should rise up n1 vigorous protest. What or-gmiizatimis hnve iii times past burned Bibles ancl destroyed histoi’Y books? All wlto know their history well know that Ilie Roman Catholic Hierarchy is notorious for its Bible-burning exploits. They know, too, that the Catholic-supported Fascist and Nazi regimes of Italy, Spain and Germany have ravished. the Hln’aries of those countries, destroying much historical evidence of the Vutican's rage and rape of the nations. Beware, then, ye liberty-loving educators, when sinister forces today endeavor to &quot;cleanse&quot; the books oJ ‘vhat the Hierarchy calls “biased material&quot;: for such Jesuitic proposal to rewrite the history books is in a wrapper falsely Jaheled democracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Again the question is forced upon us: </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Wil </span><span class="font7">peace be established by education of the world? This time we have the answer at hand. There can be no peace ; not nnJess there are more radical changes made than the ones that are now proposed by the world's ediiNttors. It is all too obvious that uo effort to educate the world by any modification of this old world's systems, by rewriting the textbooks, or by any confederate super world organization with its censorship</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">and suppression of the truth, will ever pave the way to a lasting peace on earth between the nations. Peace on earth will be established only when the hearts and minds of men of good-will are educated in the precepts and commandments of the great Theocrat, Jehovah, who is the ''God of peace&quot;.—Bomans 16:20.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Cl. </span><span class="font5">On September 11, 1946, Mrs. Ida Stover Esenhower died in Abilene, Kans. Private services were conducted at the home, and publie services followed at the graveside. Both services were handled by an army chuplain irom Ft. Riley. Was that in respect for Mrs. Eisenhower f Pnllbea;:er$ were three American </span><span class="font6">Le</span><span class="font5">gionnaires nnd three Veterans of Foreign Wars. Was that appropriate </span><span class="font6">Y</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Though </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Time </span><span class="font5">magazine claimed Ida Stover Eisenhower was a member of the River Brethren, a Mennonite sect, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font5"> was merely con tinuing its consistent policy of slander in all that pertains to .Jehovah's witnesses. She was never a River Brethren. She was one of Jehovah's witnessps, Th&lt;‘ frst study in the Watchtower magazine </span><span class="font7">in </span><span class="font5">Abilene, Kans., started in her home n 1895. Her bnme </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">\'\'tiS </span><span class="font5">the meetingplace till 1915, when </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">hall was obtained. She continued a </span><span class="font7">reegular </span><span class="font5">publisher with Jehovah’s witnesses till 1942, when failing health rendered ber inactive; but she remained a stannch be-iiever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1942 her husband, also one of Jehovah's witnesses, died. One of Jehovah's witnesses preached the funeral service. Mrs. I. </span><span class="font7">S. </span><span class="font5">Eisenhower, like nll Jehovah's witnesses, believed religion a rucket and the clergy in general, including army chaplans, to be hypocrites. She harbored no special pridc for &quot;General Ike&quot;; she was opposed to his West Point appointment. It was gross disrespect l.o the deceased for an army Chaplain to officiate nt the funeral.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As for the pallbearers. The American </span><span class="font6">Le</span><span class="font5">gion particularly, and a]so the Veterans of Foreign Wnrs, are repeatedly ringleaders in mob violence against Jehovah's witnesses. Hundreds of instances could be cited, but ilhistrn-tive s the one occurring the Sunday before Mrs. Eisenhower's death, in near-by Imva. There wu veterans broke utp a public Bible </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">OCTOBER </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">22, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">1946 </span><span class="font5">meeting of .Jehovah's witnesses, doing much physical violence. HuCUy appropriate, then, was it, for such to act as pa.lbearers'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Only death could keep the body of Mrs. Eisenhower from wnlking away from a funeral so disrespectful of all that she stood for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Murderers</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Cl. </span><span class="font5">Fifty-four prominent clergymen of New York have signed a statement approving euthanasia, or &quot;mercy&quot; </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">killin</span><span class="font5">g. They declared in their statement that such killng &quot;should not be re-gtnded as contrary to the teachings of Christ or to the principles of Christianity&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Clergy-like, they offered no proof. The fact that they say it makes it unquestionable, they reason. Once mnre they would lead the people astray. We wouldn't expcrjt the fifty-four presumptuous ones to know it, but the Bible re-e.ords a &quot;mercy&quot; killing. In anguish wounded King Saul asked a young man to kill him. The man did, because he was &quot;sure that he could not live after th&amp;t be was fallrn&quot;. But God's representativr, King David, ordered the mercy-killer e'!ecutcd. (2 Samuel 1: 5-15) The defenseless sick, such as incurable lepers, were not to lie killed in mook &quot;mercy&quot;. The Bible is against it. The Nazis practiced it, and now clergy sponsor it here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Blasphemy</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Cl. </span><span class="font5">The Dodgera of Brooklyn, baseball club in the National League, finished their season under a handicap.

The club lost the next game; also the pennant. The hypocrite's cheap stunt was only to horn il on Dodger publicity. He got it, his picture praying in front of a grinning crowd appealing in the paper.

<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font8">RIS!NG tide of immorality rolls over the earth. And on the crest of tile wave perches the grim specter of venereal diseases. Desperately hut vainly frantic hmuanity tries to unseat this unwelcome rider of the tide. Excited forums chatter out thE'i: proposed hattie strategies against the dreaded foe. Wagging tongues of religious and social workers husily flood out their remedies, talking, talking, talking. But in their multitude of words doeR an enr attuned to God&quot;: Word ever catch a mention of the only real remedy, the remedy that is so siu e, yet so simple and well known </span><span class="font7">1 </span><span class="font8">If so., it is soon drowned in the din of </span><span class="font7">cminary </span><span class="font8">babble. </span><span class="font7">lt </span><span class="font8">is like a •voice crying nut in the wilderness’ to call for a square-faeing of the issue and to advise God's remedy. This old world that so prides itself on being realistic cannot take that remedy. It plugs its cars and struggles desperately to go on in its lustful way in immunity, to mock Gocl by sowing evil without reaping the results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Bu1 Jehovah god is not mocked. not by this world':-; social workers, not by its educator’s, not by its religious advisers, no, not even by the brightest minds of its brainiest scientists. All their' remedies return unto them void; evil crops sown are gathered in time of harvest. God's Word is true wlien it says: &quot;Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh ::;baJI of the flesh reap corruption; hut he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everla::;ting.” (Galatians </span><span class="font7">(j; 7, 8) </span><span class="font8">Or, to make the text more pointed through the modern English of An </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">American Translation,</span><span class="font8"> it may read: &quot;God is not to be sneered at. A man </span><span class="font7">wil </span><span class="font8">reap just what lie sows. The man who sows to gratify his physical cravings will reap destruction from them, and the main who sows to benefit the spirit will reap eternal lite from the spirit.''</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In other words, and bluntly put, moral degeneracy brings with it many woes, among which are venereal djseases. At a forum held in Louisiana on March 4i </span><span class="font7">Hl46, </span><span class="font8">Dr. Agee, formerly connected with the ::;tate department of health, declared that one of the main indexeg of syphilis has shown </span><span class="font7">44 </span><span class="font8">out of every </span><span class="font7">1,000 </span><span class="font8">persons in the Uuite.d States to be infected, and warned that it was steadily becoming a greater public menace. He further stated : &quot;The number of deaths directly at-trihutable to syphilis are surprisingly higli. A large percentage of ou:r insanity cases ean he traced to a venereal disease, while at feast </span><span class="font7">15 </span><span class="font8">percent of all blindness can he blamed on the same thing. </span><span class="font7">Heart </span><span class="font8">disease may be caused by the same disease j while we liate to admit this </span><span class="font7">fnei, </span><span class="font8">it nevertheless is true.” According to this doctor, the_life expectancy of one infeetecl is cut 18 to </span><span class="font7">30 </span><span class="font8">percent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">When the vaunted sulfa drugs and penicillin were discovered a few year::; back, loudly were they hailed as rapid cures for venereal diseases. They came as a license to sow immoralities without l'ear of the dreaded harvest of disease. Thousands flocked to rapid-treatment centers for social diseases.

<p><span class="font8">The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">News </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle,</span><span class="font8"> July 13, 1946, reports:</span></p>

Two hundred and sixty-four American troops </span><span class="font7">in </span><span class="font6">every 1,000 had venereaJ disease on June 21, compared with </span><span class="font8">74 </span><span class="font7">p</span><span class="font6">e</span><span class="font7">r </span><span class="font6">1,000 on VE Day.

<p><span class="font8">Following is the chaplain-supported countermeasure adopted by the army, but not the one recommended by God's •Word. It was published in the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Herald Tribune,</span><span class="font8"> August 30, 1946.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Frankfurt am Main, Aug. 29—A &quot;rogues' gallery&quot; which includes the picture of every gii'l </span><span class="font7">in </span><span class="font6">the Bavarian city of Landshut who has been found to be infected with venereal disease has been posted on every company bulletin board of the American 16th Infantry Regiment, as a new contribution </span><span class="font7">t</span><span class="font6">o </span><span class="font7">the </span><span class="font6">fight against the rising </span><span class="font7">YD </span><span class="font6">rate. The girls whose pictures are placurded were picked </span><span class="font5">lip n </span><span class="font6">spot raic.ls by vice squads in night clubs and other iiu;tallations frequented by G.I.s. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Chaplains Corps wil actively participate i</span><span class="font8">n </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">drive throughout </span><span class="font7">the American </span><span class="font6">oc-cupa.t.ion zone of Germany, opening September </span><span class="font7">1, </span><span class="font6">to reduce the VD rate which has become the highest in army history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That is a rather lopsided approach to the problem. Infected women are identified as rogues to be shunned as dangerous, but infected men go ou to specially concentrate on clean girls. That program should insure the contamination of ali women, in time. Women who ai’e clean are benefited by no warning “rogues’ gallery&quot; of infected men. But this selfish, nationalistic approach is not the noteworthy point so much as is the religious chaplains' support and their pinning hopes </span><span class="font7">011 </span><span class="font8">the remedies and arrangements of men. If they are God's servants, if they are champions of His commandments, why are their tongues silent on the very basic nrjd elementary remedy clearly expounded in the Bible?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Religion Fears to Advocate</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">tlze Bible Remedy</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That sure remedy is simply put in the seventh of the Ten Commauiments: &quot;Thou shalt not commit adultery.” In five little words the world has the remedy. Wlia.t sJia.rp contrast with the volumes of babblings that gush forth froui the worlds false physicians and healers ! Of course, it is true the Mosaie law was replaced by a new covenant at the time of' Christ's tirst advent; but the righteous principle of this Seventh Commandment was carried over. The apostle Paul wrote under inspiration: &quot;Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">adulterers,</span><span class="font6"> nor </span><span class="font8">effeminatei nor abusers of tHetnselves witJi mankind, iior thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.&quot;—Exodus 20: 14; 1 Corinthians 6:9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The clergy of Christendom know these Bible commands, but they do not vigorously preaeli them because such religious leaders fear </span><span class="font6">to </span><span class="font8">swim against the rising tide of delinquent humanity, many of whom are pious church members. The clergy betray their trust to adults, to youth, and to God. They rear men more thau they fear God. They fear to face an issue</span><span class="font3">, </span><span class="font8">to be </span><span class="font3">•</span><span class="font8">unpopular with the crowd or wi tli </span><span class="font3">&quot;</span><span class="font8">this preseii </span><span class="font7">t </span><span class="font8">evil world'', to meet up w</span><span class="font7">i</span><span class="font8">th any p</span><span class="font7">o</span><span class="font8">s</span><span class="font7">s</span><span class="font8">ible persecuti o</span><span class="font7">n</span><span class="font8">. Moreover, they fear a los::; of revenue in the church roffers; ami hence tlwy babble ont their vain philosophizings an</span><span class="font7">U </span><span class="font8">eartickli</span><span class="font5">n</span><span class="font8">g platitudes to court the approval of m </span><span class="font3">,</span><span class="font8">n. God is too far removed from them for them to take Him into consideration. AVhy, the leading religions sect of Christendom </span><span class="font7">claims to </span><span class="font8">grant absolution, for a money consitlerat iun, for immorality; bnt </span><span class="font5">sucli </span><span class="font8">fakery brings no absolution from the ravages of VD.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">No, it seems that the Bible command ''Thou slialt not commit </span><span class="font7">a</span><span class="font8">dultery&quot; is not acceptable to the nations colleetively and hypocritically called &quot;Christendom”, or to their armies or navieH, or to their broad-minded chaplain; anU clerg</span><span class="font7">y </span><span class="font8">gE:m-erallv. These jneii who love to I.Je titled &quot;Jteverend” and &quot;F'atlwr&quot; and &quot;Rabbi&quot;, contrary to Bihlo commands (.Job 32: :21, 22; Matthew </span><span class="font6">23:</span><span class="font8">1-12), carry the Bible only for effect, Just </span><span class="font7">ns </span><span class="font8">t</span><span class="font7">l </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">h? scribes and </span><span class="font7">Pharisees of J</span><span class="font8">e</span><span class="font7">s</span><span class="font8">ns</span><span class="font3">' </span><span class="font8">day donned an outward form of godliness m</span><span class="font5">e</span><span class="font8">re</span><span class="font7">ly </span><span class="font8">to be seen of men. So these </span><span class="font5">popular w</span><span class="font8">orldly religionists ha</span><span class="font5">ve </span><span class="font8">not the courage to emn-paign for morality a</span><span class="font7">m</span><span class="font8">l de</span><span class="font5">c</span><span class="font8">eucy till a time of proper marriage with a clean companion as the remed</span><span class="font7">y </span><span class="font8">for VD. Such clean conduct, like tLe Bible, is considered too old-Fashioned for the d</span><span class="font5">e</span><span class="font8">l</span><span class="font7">i</span><span class="font8">nquents of this modern world, this smart world, whose wisdom is foolish to God and His Word, the Bible.—1 Corinthians 3:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The moral degenerates raucously claim their lewd conduct is o</span><span class="font7">n</span><span class="font8">ly natural. PTiey err. Naturalness is to live clean lives and marry and have children and raise such children d</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font8">cently</span><span class="font3">. </span><span class="font8">Lust is to roam about and satisfy perverted passion </span><span class="font7">in</span><span class="font8">discr</span><span class="font7">im</span><span class="font8">i</span><span class="font7">n</span><span class="font8">at</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font8">ly and without regard for cons</span><span class="font5">e</span><span class="font7">q</span><span class="font8">uence</span><span class="font7">s </span><span class="font8">or responsibility, without regard for anything, in fact, hut oneself'. That is not naturalness, but ultraselfishness. Delinquents cannot blame the Creator for their immoralities, in </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font8">futile attempt at ::;elf-justification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So on comes the mounting tide of immorality, and still </span><span class="font5">011 </span><span class="font8">the crest </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font8">its wave triumphantly perches the grim specter of venereal diseases. </span><span class="font7">It </span><span class="font8">is Noah's day of a wicked </span><span class="font5">world all </span><span class="font8">over again; it is the per</span><span class="font7">i</span><span class="font8">lous times of the </span><span class="font3">&quot;</span><span class="font8">last days&quot;.

<p><span class="font8">Meii who are aitists mix pigments with their oils to produce their</span><span class="font6">r </span><span class="font8">colors, and the:-;e pigments are definite chemical compounds.

Besides this green col</span><span class="font7">o</span><span class="font8">rmg matter there are other color snbstaiices present in the leaves.

<h4><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Overthrowing the Kings of the Earth</span></h4>
<p><span class="font8">^^URING the last year, the first in this postwar era, the world has witnessed the toppling of several kings from</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8">their thrones. Japan's ancient dyuasty of the mikado has been ''democratized&quot;.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">The Italian House of Savoy has been ousted. The king of Siam was shot to death under suspicions circumstances. The people of Bulgaria overwhelming})? </span><span class="font7">votP(l </span><span class="font8">to exile their king. Only Greece and Trans-Jordan seemingly have gone against this popnlar tide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The trend of the past thirty y</span><span class="font5">e</span><span class="font8">ars seems to point to a date in the not too distant future when royalty will disappear altogether, being classified among the extinct races. The people of </span><span class="font7">the </span><span class="font8">present generation, most of whom have never lived under the deHpo</span><span class="font7">t</span><span class="font8">ism of a monarchy. should take a last look at this disappearing race of regal &quot;blue-hloods&quot;, especially in view of the fact that the monardiial system is one of the world's oldest institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jt was that mighty lumter Nimrod who set up the first kingdom, at Babel, on the banks of the Euphrates, shortly after the flood of Noah's day. Nimrod the king was exalted and worshiped as being even above or before Almighty God. (Genesis </span><span class="font9">10:8, </span><span class="font8">9) In such historical fact is found the origin of the doctrine “the divine right of kings&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Since then despotic rulers, whether calling themselves king, emperor, czar or mikado</span><span class="font9">, </span><span class="font8">have followed the original pattern and have blasphemously claimed that they rule &quot;by the grace of God''. Under this cloak of &quot;divinity&quot; kings of the earth have regimented their subjects and warred upon neighboring kingdoms. Indeed the chapters of man's history con</span><span class="font7">t</span><span class="font8">ain the story of one bloody struggle after another bebveen one king and another, between one dynasty and another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Egypt witb its Pharaohs was the first world power. Assyria, to the north, in time became the second; and Babylon, the third empire to dominate the world. Then came the </span><span class="font3">.</span><span class="font7">M</span><span class="font8">edes and Persians, later the Greeks, and in time the iron rule of the Roman empire under its Caesars he-C'ame the dominant world power. This was followed by an incompatible mixture of </span><span class="font7">dnurdi </span><span class="font8">and </span><span class="font7">states </span><span class="font8">known as the &quot;Holy l{omnn Empire&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Reformation did mnch to drain continental Europe of the foul stench caused by that illicit pope-king decadent rule. Howe\er, such reforms did not remove the hean-, burdensome and unproductive clan of society called '•royalty''. That bejeweled clique, for the great</span><span class="font3"></span><span class="font8">er part. continued to hang on </span><span class="font7">t</span><span class="font8">he necks </span><span class="font7">of </span><span class="font8">the people as a curse until </span><span class="font7">the twen</span><span class="font8">tie</span><span class="font7">t</span><span class="font8">h century.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Twentieth-Century Purge</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">At the outset of \VorlU War </span><span class="font7">I, </span><span class="font8">in 1914, there were some </span><span class="font7">41 </span><span class="font8">sovereign rulers sitting upon the thrones of their ancestors in Europe. Not more than </span><span class="font6">15 </span><span class="font8">were on their thrones at </span><span class="font7">the </span><span class="font8">end of the war. The rest tumbled down with the Russian revolution and the collapse of the Oer-man-A.ustro-Hungarian federations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During tJie years that followed </span><span class="font7">that </span><span class="font8">great war one by oM the crowns on the heads </span><span class="font7">ol </span><span class="font8">the remaining kings began to slip. Some found it expedient to abdicate and go into exile, where they lived </span><span class="font7">hi </span><span class="font8">luxury, hoping that their people would some day heg them to return. Their greatest loss, so it would se</span><span class="font5">e</span><span class="font8">m. was the glory, praise and worship that they thought their due. In some instances it was this \anity, wliich they preferred to call &quot;dignity”, that came between them and the dictators that replaced them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For one reason or another the &quot;divine rigli t</span><span class="font7">s</span><span class="font8">&quot; of the Bourbons of Spain, Zog of Albania, Carol of Rumania., Leopold , of Belgium, </span><span class="font7">P</span><span class="font8">eter of Yngo8lavia, Hirohito of Japan, the House of Savoy of Italy, the </span><span class="font7">S</span><span class="font8">axe-Coburg and Gotha family of Bulgaria, and George </span><span class="font7">II </span><span class="font8">of Greece ( notwithstanding the fact tba t he is now back 011 the throne for the third time) have ali been trampled upou during recent years. Today there are only a handful of inwnarchs left</span><span class="font7">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">WJmt have been the b</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font8">nefits to the world since the jewel-ei-owned rulers have descended io the level of other- peo-ple'Y Has there been ushered in an abundance or freedom and liberty with an enduring peace </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">'1</span><span class="font8"> One has only to look at the chaotic confusion in the world today for the answer. But what is the </span><span class="font6">causin' </span><span class="font8">Is it because the mmiarchies, as bad as they were, were tLe Lost form of rule • that men can devise? Or did the people miscalculate and think they were getting rid of despotism when they broke the scepter of their kings?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Let no royalist say that the tuTmoil of the world is due to the replacement of monarchies witJi other forms of government. Let no earthly lting rejoice in the suffering of the people luider their present rulers. Satan the Devil and his demons are in control of earth's affairs today even as they were when monarchs bela the spotlight of worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But some God-fearing men may say: ''The Bible prophesied that wlien the kings of the earth were overturned then a righteous government would be established. Why, then, instead of peace, is there so much trouble in the earth since the eclipse of the kingly houses of the Bourbons, Hapsburgs, Hohenzollerns, Romanovs, Savovs and kwazolms t</span><span class="font6">&quot; </span><span class="font8">It is because the prophecies did not refer exclusively or particularly to these individual sovereigns called </span><span class="font6">&quot;</span><span class="font7">li</span><span class="font8">ngs</span><span class="font6">&quot;</span><span class="font8">. &quot;IGnings of the earth,</span><span class="font6">&quot; </span><span class="font8">as that term is used in the Bible, refers to the rulers who hold in their bands the power of government and who exer</span><span class="font5">c</span><span class="font8">ise rule over the people, regardless of whether they are called king, emperor, czar, generalissimo, il Duce, caudillo, der Fuehrer, mikado, or are just culled j)remier, regent, or piesi-dent. In Bible language they are all &quot;kings”, for they hold the scepter of power. For example, no king or potentate ever exercised greater power over a larger populatioji than did the president of the United States during World \Var II.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">E</span><span class="font6">'</span><span class="font8">rrthermore, it is the rulers of today tliat ind themselves in the position spoken of in the second Psalm: &quot;The kings of the earth set themselves, and the </span><span class="font7">rul</span><span class="font8">ers take counsel together</span><span class="font6">, </span><span class="font8">against J eho</span><span class="font6">-</span><span class="font8">vah, and against his anointed&quot; King, Christ </span><span class="font7">Jesus.

Jesus’ human death as a martyr also served to provide a ransom sacrifice in behalf of every tuan and woman that ac-eepts </span><span class="font7">Him </span><span class="font8">as Savior and obeys Him. —Hebrews </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">5:</span><span class="font7"> S, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jcsus' heing </span><span class="font5">a </span><span class="font8">fleshly human creature wf.s meant to he only temporary; for the sufferings in the fiesli </span><span class="font5">must </span><span class="font8">\)e the. patli He must tread to heavenly glory. Thus, too, He must pioneer the way to heaven for all His followers who are faithful to the death. This required </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font8">special way in which God must deal with Jesus in order tn bring Him foi-tb as a Son unto glory. This act must also l)e by means of the spirit or active foree of God, just as it was so in the case of .Jesus' human birth. However, in bringing Him to glory, </span><span class="font7">the </span><span class="font8">procedure was just the reverse of His being horn as a man. Forasmuch as the glory to come was heavenly and came after His death as a man, therefore God dealbwitb Jesus to bring Him forth anew as a heavenly Son, able to eiijoy the glory above. Once more no human father, and, in fact, no human parent at all, not even Mary, was involved </span><span class="font7">in </span><span class="font8">this bringing forth of Jesus as a Son unto heavenly glory, as the Captain of the salvation of those who should be His spiritual brethren. Again the spirit of God was put into action, and this was at the time that Jolm baptized Jesus. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Emphatic Diaglott </span><span class="font8">* translation of Matthew </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">3:16, </span><span class="font8">17 reads: •'And Jesus being immersed, went up from the water; and, behold! instantly the heavens were opened, and the spirit of God appeared, descending, like a dove, and resting </span><span class="font7">on </span><span class="font8">him. And, behold! a voice from the heavens, saying: &quot;This is nry Son, the beloved, in whom I delight.' &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God's acknowledgment then of Jesus as His beloved Son is open proof that Jesms was there begotten of the heavenly Father and that begetting was by the spirit or active force of God. It was not the ljegettal in the womb of any human virgin: such liegettal was already past for Jesus and had served its purpose. Jesus was for years a human Son of God, and, now that He was turning His hack npon things human and was denying himself to take up the course of suffering even to a human death, God begot Jesus by the spirit to become a spiritual Son of God with heavenly gloi'y m view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was therefore as a spiritual Son, and not as a human Son, that God testified concerning Jesus by the voice from heaven. Jesus' baptism in water was to symbolize His consecration to God to do His Father's will, and God's will was that Jesus should suffer to the death in proof of His faithfulness to God and that thereafter He should live as a spirit creature in heavenly glory. rhus Jesus, </span><span class="font7">with </span><span class="font8">Gocl's </span><span class="font7">wwil definitely </span><span class="font8">set before Him and with a heavenly calling and hope of life, now had GoTs spirit Test-hig upon Him and was a new creature, a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">spiritual</span><span class="font8"> son of GoU with heavenly exaltation in view. This was the first time such a thing had eNer occurred on earth, and thus Jesus was a pioneer in this way to cplestial glory. It illustrates how Jesus' followers, who, just as He was, are human to begin with, may become sons of God.—2 Corinthians </span><span class="font7">5: 16j 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That Jesus by His course opened up this opportunity for His followers, we rend, at John </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">1:11-13: </span><span class="font8">&quot;He carne tmto his own, and his own received him not.

<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Pious Pressure on Politicians</span></h4>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HE international Conference of Church Leaders on the Problem of •World Order met in Cambridge, England, August </span><span class="font7">4-7 </span><span class="font8">chiefly to consider how they might influence the politicians of the world and bring them into line with what the religious gentlemen considered proper order. Twenty mttions, represented by 75 delegates, were expected to be present, but those actually in attendance numbered </span><span class="font7">70.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The American delegation included a prominent layman, Dr. John Foster Dulles, a Presbyterian and the chairman of the Commission on a Just and Durable Peace of the Federal Conncil of Churches of Christ in America. Bishop Bromley Oxiiam, president of tln council, was also a delegate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One of the first thiugs the delegates had put up to them, even before the conference got under ‘vay, was the proposition of joint action with the Vatican in putting the churches' idea hefore the statesmen of the world. This information was solicited in a questionnaire and only eight nations represented cautiously expressed themselves as having no objection, if some kind of co-operation was arranged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the conference itself delegates were told, &quot;If it is appropriate for labor and business to put pressure on the United Nations organization, it is necessary for churches to do the same thing,&quot; It was realized, however, that &quot;something more than pious phrases would be neces-' sary&quot; to impress the politicians. A new &quot;technique'' had to be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ab-. </span><span class="font8">Dulles declared tba.t the World Couneil of Churches was seeking to &quot;redeem the political life of the world from failure&quot; and trying to channel the world's &quot;moral and spiritual forces&quot; </span><span class="font7">l </span><span class="font8">Evidently .Mr. Dulles has not yet learned to see 'that the whole world lieth in the wicked one'. (1 J olm 5: 19) Hence he by-passes the Scriptural assurance that this world is destined to meet its destruction in the battle of that great day of God Almighty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The church leaders agreed at their conference to set up a commission &quot;to make the voice of Protestant and Eastern Orthodox churches heard in international political and economic questions&quot;, but there were decided differences of O}jiniun ns to how it should operate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the course of tie conference, Walter W. Van </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">K</span><span class="font8">irk, of New York</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font8">secretary of the Commission for a Jiist and Durable Peaee, said, ‘‘The United Nations may die, but we do not want it to die because the Christian clmreh is too weak.&quot;' It is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jnteresting side lights on the religious situation developed after the return of the delegates to their respective lands. When Bishop Oxnam was scheduled to speak at Knoxville, Tenn., quite a foi'-midable movement to prevent him from so dohig developed. Parents of school children took a leading part in this effort to compel officials of the East Tennessee Education Association to drop him from its list of speakers at the convention to be held there. Oxnarn was accused of being Communistic. There may ltave been no connection between this bit of intolerance and Oxnamis well-known part in the request to President. Truman to recall Taylor as Vatican envoy. But anyone wlio does not cater to the Vatican automatically becomes a &quot;communist&quot;, whether he is or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Finally</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font8">the papers gave wide publicity to the 1act that .J. F. Dulles' son joined the Jesuit Novitiate of St. An-drews-on-H ndson at Poughkeepsie, N. Y., an institution for the training of Jesuit Catholic priests. Of Dulles himself it was said, in reports of the conference, that he &quot;advocates bringing about a peaceful solution to international </span><span class="font7">diffi</span><span class="font8">culties alqng apparently Vatican-inspired lines&quot;. And so &quot;Protestants'' continue to &quot;protest'&quot;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">H</span><span class="font8">A</span><span class="font7">yg you ever heard of two men attacking another, one holding him as the other mercilessly beat the victim V The two culprits would be guilty of a cowardly conspiracy to make him helpless by denying him lijs right of selfdefense l Or course you stty that dastardly act wunld be vehemently condemned by every fair person as wicked. Self-defense is recognized by every civilized nation. It was ordained by .Almighty God as one of the heritages of every creature. It is recognized and practiced by even beasts, wild and domestic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The United States Constitution guarantees the right to defend oneself in the courts ag-ainst the attack of an adversary. So well known is the right that a judge denying it to orte would be condemned as unfair and incompetent. Suppose a judge, at the behest of a prosecutor, cuts out the only defense the law allowed an accused, instructing the -jury to convict. Would yon not also say that such judge and prosecutor had committed a wrong as grave as that committed by the two cowardly thugs against their victim'?</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Do you know that during the last five years the federal comts throughout the United States of America illegally denied four thousand missionary evangelists their right to defend against charges in such courts </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">'I</span><span class="font7"> Do you lrnow that such denial resulted in those thousands of upright men being committed to prison for terms ranging from 1 to </span><span class="font9">5 </span><span class="font7">years? ‘‘Preposterous </span><span class="font8">J </span><span class="font7">you say, adding, ('Is not tJiis the land of liberty, where the courts protect rights of the people, even agaiust the government '&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yes, such lawless denial </span><span class="font8">of </span><span class="font7">the right to defend oneself in court is startling; but it is true, as you will see. Notorious mistreatment of </span><span class="font8">J </span><span class="font7">ehovah's witnesses under the 1940 American Draft Act is the lawlessness referred to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Act provides for exemption of regular and duly ordained ministers of religion. The Beledive Service Regulations, under which draft boards were organized in evei’Y community of the country, all:io provide that ministers of religion customarily preaching or teaching the principles of a recognized religious organization, whether ordained oi' not, are exempt and shall be placed in Class IV-D.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">'the National Headquarters of the Selective Service System had general supervision over the draft boards of the nation. From time to time it gave the boards directions to follow. In .June 1941 it advised them that Jehovah's witnesses are considered to be a &quot;'recognized religions organization&quot; under the Act. (Opinion No. H, June 12, 1941) That advice also provided that whether </span><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font7">ehovah's witnesses were to be exempted as ministers of religion should be decided by the draft boards on the basis of &quot;whether or not they devote their lives </span><span class="font8">in the furtherance of the beliefs </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">o</span><span class="font7">r </span><span class="font8">J eho-vah's witnesses</span><span class="font7">, </span><span class="font8">whether or not they perform functons which are normally performed by regular or duly ordained ministers of other religions, and. finally, whether or not they are regarded by other [of] Jehovah's witnesses in the same manner in which regular or duly ordained ministers of other religions are ordinaril y regarded”. (Paragraph 5, Opinion No. </span><span class="font7">1±, June 12, 1941)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Proof of Ministry Off</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ered Boards</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Proof offered hv </span><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font8">ehovah •s w</span><span class="font7">i</span><span class="font8">tiiesses showed that they are regular aiid duly ordained ministers of re ligion under tl te Act and &quot;Regula turns. The draft board:; were slum n that .Jehovah’s witnesses preacli like Christ Jesus and the first Christian ministers</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font8">His apostles</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font8">Like them, it appeared, Jehovah's witnesses went from door to door with the message and taught publicly upon the streets</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font8">As part of their preaching</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font8">as Jehovah</span><span class="font4">'</span><span class="font8">s witnesses also showed, tliev made return .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">visits to the homes of the people to explain the Bible. Moreover, they showed that they conducted Bible studies in liornes of interested persons. Additionally, it was sliown tliat, ns opportunity afforded, -Jehovah’s witnesses also preached publicly from the platform to assembled congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font8">ehovah</span><span class="font4">'</span><span class="font8">s witnesses also showed that they were a society of missionary evangelists. Each is a minister whose congregation is in the homes of the people visited? He does not expect the people to come to liim to sit at </span><span class="font7">his </span><span class="font8">feet to l)e taught. Tliis practice of serving at the homes, it \\‘as shown, was followed </span><span class="font7">be</span><span class="font8">cause it is apostolic. Also, t hat statistics show more than 70,000,000 pnople in the United States tlo not helong to any church or religion; and many mon‘ millions nominally alTiliatNl with the various r</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font8">ligions do not attend ehureli. Therefore, it was necessary for </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font8">ehovah's witnesses to preach </span><span class="font7">in </span><span class="font8">tl</span><span class="font7">w </span><span class="font8">primitive fashion </span><span class="font7">in </span><span class="font8">order to meet t.li4i need to provide such persons with spiritual food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">\Vhrn tliose proofs were presented to the draft hoai'ds differtmt results appeared. Soiiie hoards were fair. Desiring </span><span class="font7">to </span><span class="font8">foilow tiiP advice from National IT eadquarters, </span><span class="font6">1 </span><span class="font8">hey granted thousands of Jehovah’s wihwsses their exemption</span><span class="font4">. </span><span class="font8">They properly </span><span class="font7">held </span><span class="font8">that such missioji-ary evangelists were ministers of the gospel</span><span class="font4">. </span><span class="font8">Such were excused from military training und service under the Act so tltai tltey could &lt;&gt;any 011 tlte good work </span><span class="font7">of </span><span class="font8">preaching God's kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">H </span><span class="font7">nnd </span><span class="font8">reds, if not thousands, of other draft boards were arbitrary and capri</span><span class="font4"></span><span class="font8">cious. They flouted the Act and the &quot;Regulations. They rejected the advice of the N atiunal Headquarters concerning Jehovah A witnesses. Because of prejudice many boards denied exemption to these ministers. Denial nn tltat ground is prohibited by the Hegul ations. Hundreds of boards refused to class Jehovah’s witnesses as “ministers&quot; because they did not conllne their preaching activity to church bnilding:.;, as du the orthodox elergy. Sueli hoards hel&lt;l that, since Jehovah's wiinesses went to the people instead of requiring the people to come to tltem in church edifices, </span><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font8">ebovnlis witnesses were not entitled to exemption.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">From time immemorial ministers of the gospel, more often than not, have been forced to do secular work during six days of the week in order to </span><span class="font6">sup</span><span class="font8">port themselves and their families. When the pioneer •'settlers&quot; pushed </span><span class="font7">into the midwest </span><span class="font8">auU </span><span class="font7">west and then through </span><span class="font8">to the Pacific coast the preachers went along with </span><span class="font7">them. The </span><span class="font8">ministers worked on rarml:i, in tile woods and fields, following various secular occupations during tile week. Regularly and customarily they preached eve</span><span class="font7">ry </span><span class="font8">Sunday. This method of rctrulur preaching has been </span><span class="font7">c</span><span class="font8">ustomary. P has continued down to this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Surely Congress, in pro</span><span class="font7">vi</span><span class="font8">ding the ex</span><span class="font7">emption, did not intend to </span><span class="font8">say </span><span class="font7">that the </span><span class="font8">exemption extended only to clergymen supj)orted by wealthy congregations. The exemption is not limited to big town and citT ministers. To thus limit it would exclude the ministers of the poo</span><span class="font7">rer </span><span class="font8">congregations. It would oust ministers in small towns and rural communities who were unable or unwilling to escape the need to labor to support themselves in order to continue in the ministry. This would deny equal protection of the laws. Tlte draft boards did that in refusing to exempt Jehovah's witnesses under the Act.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Jehovah's witnesses have been denied exemption, whereas all of Jehovah's wjt-nesses are ministers. In summarily declaring they were not and could not be ministers tile boards compared them to a congregation of laymen gathered to listen to a clergyman preach. </span><span class="font7">Such </span><span class="font8">a comparison is arbitrary. It ign?res the true facts about Jehovah’s witnesses. Each of them must preach to be one of Jehovah's witnesses. One who does not prencli is not one ol Jehovah's witnesses. Tl</span><span class="font6">i</span><span class="font8">ey all are a society of missionary evangelists. It is not unusual to hear of a society of ministers. 'the .Jesuit organization is a society of priests. Various foreigu-mi;sionary societies of </span><span class="font6">the </span><span class="font8">orthodox religious denominations consist exclusively of ministers and missionaries. </span><span class="font7">It </span><span class="font8">'is highly unfair to compare a congregation of missionaries or ministers like Jehovah's witnesses with </span><span class="font5">u </span><span class="font8">lay congregation or &lt;&lt;fiock&quot; of an orthodox clergyman. Jehovah's witnesses are not ministers merely because they claim to be. </span><span class="font7">It </span><span class="font8">is by their work or fruits that they can and do constantly piove that they are ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Therefore there has been </span><span class="font7">inconsis</span><span class="font8">tency in enforcement </span><span class="font7">of </span><span class="font8">the Draft Act by many hundreds of boards as to Jehovah's witnesses. Fair-minded board members have unhesitatingly given Je</span><span class="font7">hovah's witnesses the exemption to </span><span class="font8">which they are entitled. The unfair ones, discriminating, have reached the opposite conclusion on the same facts. In Indiana, for example, one draft board complained to its State Director about the unfairness of another board in denying Jehovah's witnesses exemption as ministers. In its lettE&gt;r, umong other things, it stated :</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While it is trie that this sect may not be held in such high esteem by various of the religious and others, inasmuch as it </span><span class="font7">is </span><span class="font6">recognized in Washington under the Seleetive Service Act </span><span class="font7">the </span><span class="font6">same consideration should he given </span><span class="font5">tt </span><span class="font6">minister of this faith as is accorded those of other rnore recognized faiths. </span><span class="font0">• . </span><span class="font6">.

<h5><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Boards Ordered Ministers to War</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">Failure of hundreds of draft hoards to give the same consideration to Jehovah's witnesses that those hoards have given to the more popular religions clergy during tJie pa::;t five years caused more than four thousand of Jehovah’s witnesses to be ordered lip for training and service. This was contrai’v to the Act and Regulations. Those thousands of Jehovah's witnesses, believing </span><span class="font7">the </span><span class="font8">draft boards had violated the law by denying tJteit exemptions, failed to report for induction iuto the armed forces. Also when the draft boartls ordered them to do compromise work iu a concentration camp in the forest or wilderness, as conscientious objectors! they refused to respond. The 1‘enson was that they refused to compromise by assuming a false status as pacifists. Being minis</span><span class="font7">ter'; of the gospel of the </span><span class="font8">K</span><span class="font7">ingdo</span><span class="font8">m of Almighty God, exempt from training and service, Ihey &lt;lid not compromise. 'l'hey did not say they would do work that the law exempted them, as ministers, from doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They believed that lawless, arbitrary orders of draft boards could be challenged in court. Tliey believed tlmt they could defemd when and if prosecuted. T!ic‘y thought the law would allow them to show tliey had no dnty to comply with the lawless orders, because </span><span class="font7">they </span><span class="font8">were exempt aR ministers. For their refusal to comply, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">J</span><span class="font8">eliovah’s witnesses wei'e prosecuted by the Department of </span><span class="font6">.T </span><span class="font7">ns-</span><span class="font8">tice </span><span class="font7">ot' </span><span class="font8">the federal goYerment. They were charged with failing to comply with the boards' orders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In court it was contended by Jehovah's witnesses that Congress had exempted ministers from duty. They argued tlint they wen*e ministers of the gospel of God's kingdom, regularly preaching. They pleaded that tJiey were eiilitled to clajm the exemption. Tlwy argued tliat tbey should te allowed to prove the in</span><span class="font6">validity </span><span class="font8">of the orders on which the against them were based. They asserted tltat the courts ancl juries should determine whether it was the draft boards that violated the law, instead of Jehovah's wirnesses. They contended that if the courts and juries should </span><span class="font7">fmcl </span><span class="font8">tlmt they were exempt as ministers the prosecutions should he dismissed and they should be discharged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The inferior federal courts, when bearing the prosecutions, ruled out the urged defenses. Thereby they made Jehovah's witnesses defenseless against tlieir prosecutor, the federal government. The courts held it was a crime to refuse to ol)ey a </span><span class="font7">void </span><span class="font8">and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">lawless</span><span class="font8"> draft-bonrd order. Those trial courts held that unless the illegal order was first complied with it could not be challenged. The Act provided only that those who violated a duty imposed </span><span class="font5">011 </span><span class="font8">them by the Act and HegnJations should be convicted. Concedeclly tliose exempted by the Act bad no duty to comply. The courts held tJiat one who liad no duty could nevertheless be convicted, the assigned reason being that lie had defied the di'aft-board order commanding him (even thougli illegally and falsely} to perform </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font8">duty. This is a most novel reason.</span></p>

Any sensible person, with the least sense of fairness, would say </span><span class="font7">the first </span><span class="font8">thing the court trying the ease should fiuc.l out was whether the policeman liad legal authority or lawful right </span><span class="font7">to </span><span class="font8">givE&gt; the onler. </span><span class="font7">I </span><span class="font8">f, in the first place, the police officer had no legal authority to give tlw order, the accused would be entitled to acquittal. \Vere a judge </span><span class="font7">in such </span><span class="font8">case to rule that the policeman's order was supreme and unimpeachable. btfyond question by tlte court, l</span><span class="font7">i</span><span class="font8">e would be accused </span><span class="font7">of </span><span class="font8">dereliction of duty by all honest person!&quot;. Yet the federal courts did just that. They made tliat sort of ruling in holding that draft hoards could not be questioned in the prosecutions against Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The courts had to resort to snme fan-tastjc legerdemain </span><span class="font7">to </span><span class="font8">justify ilie lawle::;s denial of the riglii nf .Jehovah's witnesses to defend. </span><span class="font7">Surlt </span><span class="font8">conrts justified themselves by attempting to make Jeho- ' vah's witnesses appear to be ln’N violators. Tliey said that Jehovah's witnesses should have reportfid and submitted to induction into the armed foTc-es, or should have gone to a concentration work camp as conscientious </span><span class="font7">ohjpC'-</span><span class="font8">tors. </span><span class="font7">D </span><span class="font8">pon their thus complying with the illegal dTaft-ljoard order, saicl the courts, there would have become available to Jehovah's witnesses their onlv remedy to show the invalidity of the order bv way of a writ of habeas corpus. The courts illegally concluded that sbjce such procedure liacl not been followed by Je-hovali's witnesses they were law violators regardless of how invalid the draftboard orders were.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In many different ways tliat argmn.ent </span><span class="font7">oi </span><span class="font8">the courts was exposed as ridiculous. To begin with, Congress exempted the vice-president of the United States, members of Congress, judges, members </span><span class="font7">of </span><span class="font8">the state legislatures, governors, aud ministers of religion from all training and service. It is wholly unreasonable to contend that sucli statntoTily e</span><span class="font7">x</span><span class="font8">empt persons, when o</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">r</span><span class="font8">dered to submit to induction by draft boards acting in defiance of law. must take an oath and thereby join the army, rmt on the uniform, ami tlwn return to court to prove their exempt status—as the '&quot;price&quot; for having t.hp court determine that Congress had exempted them in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Tbf' Select</span><span class="font7">i</span><span class="font8">ve Training aud Service Act of </span><span class="font7">1940 </span><span class="font8">was pa8sed to raise an army. Bnt it was also enacted to protect the institutions of the country, sucli as the legislatures, tie courts and the religious institutions, \vhile the total war was he-:ing waged. It is um:easonable to suppose that Congress intended that the draft boards conld close down tliese institutions for many mouths. To establish by habeas corpus that Congress e</span><span class="font7">x</span><span class="font8">empted the nwmhers of such institutions requires many months. Congress did not intend to give such boards unlimited })oweT over the persons exempted by the Act. Congre</span><span class="font7">ss </span><span class="font8">did not intend that they could not be questioned except upon compliance with their lawless mandate to such persons. Confining attack to habeas corpus proceedings makes necessai'Y the illegally classj fled exempt person's re</span><span class="font5">m</span><span class="font8">aining ill custody for many months while lus habeas corpus case is making its way through the courts. Surely no one of the persons e</span><span class="font7">x</span><span class="font8">empted by Con</span><span class="font7"></span><span class="font8">gress could perform the duties eor which Congress exempted him if he had to spend months ill the custody of the armed forces or at a coneentration camp for conscientious ob</span><span class="font9">j</span><span class="font8">ectors to establish his right to exemption. His detention would make impossible his performing his duties as legislator. judge or preach- </span><span class="font7">• </span><span class="font8">er, and thus the statutory exemption would l</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">i</span><span class="font8">e frustrated.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>Attempted to Force Ministers into Trap</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">The writ of haliea::; corpus, after induction, was a wholly illusory remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Often the r</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font8">gist</span><span class="font5">ran</span><span class="font8">t was required to submit to inductio</span><span class="font7">n </span><span class="font8">at a place many (if not hundreds or even thousands of) miles from his residenc</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font8">, the place where his draft board was located</span><span class="font7">. </span><span class="font8">Being far removed from friends aiid relatives, the possjbiJity of bringing habeas corpus proceeding</span><span class="font7">s </span><span class="font8">was maUe difficult. if not impossible. Moreover, he was so far away from his witnesses and the draft board that frequently it was impossible to get proo£. In rase of a registra</span><span class="font6">n</span><span class="font8">t ordered to report for induction into the armed forces there was always the possibility that he would be removed hundreds or thousands of miles away for training purposes. Often the inductee was removed all the way across the country</span><span class="font7">. </span><span class="font8">It js po</span><span class="font7">s</span><span class="font8">sible that one inducted into the army mi</span><span class="font7">g</span><span class="font8">ht be moved overseas before he could institute a habeas corpus proceeding. After departure from the country the remed</span><span class="font7">y </span><span class="font8">of habeas corpus would not be available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Furthermore, requiring one to submit to induction as a condition to getting an exemption placed him </span><span class="font7">iii </span><span class="font8">a predicament. If he was a minis</span><span class="font7">t</span><span class="font8">er claiming his neutrality, maintainjng his integ</span><span class="font5">r</span><span class="font8">ity, on refusing military training lie would become subject to court-martial. For infraction of the smallest military rule he could be severely punished. Certainly it was not intended that as a condition to ob</span><span class="font7">t</span><span class="font8">ai</span><span class="font5">n</span><span class="font8">ing judicial relief one should place himself in a predicame</span><span class="font5">n</span><span class="font8">t. h aving to undergo extreme penalties</span><span class="font7">, </span><span class="font8">and thereby subject hhnsel.f to greater penalties than if he had stayed away entirety. Thp most that one who stayed away entirely could be given under the draft act was five years in a federal prison. But for violation of an order of the armed forces one in military custody may be tientenced to death.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>Trial by Ordeal</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">Denial of a defense in </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font8">criminal case because of the failure of th</span><span class="font7">e </span><span class="font8">registrant to submit to induction as a condition to judicial relief is equivalent to a trial by ordeal. Anciently, in trials by ordeal, the victim &quot;Yas required to walk on hot aoals. </span><span class="font7">U </span><span class="font8">l1e blistered his feet he \\‘as eonsidcrecl to be guil-y. </span><span class="font7">If </span><span class="font8">he emerged umsinged he was considered innocent. That was impossible. Often the victim was thrown into water. </span><span class="font7">If </span><span class="font8">he sank and failed to come up he was innocent. If he came to the surface for air he \vas guilty. Jehovah’s witnesses were subjected </span><span class="font7">to </span><span class="font8">precisely that kind of trial. In the trials of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">J </span><span class="font8">eho-vah's \vi tnesses under the doctrine announced in the fedeTal courts they had as little chance to be declared innocent as did the victims in the trials by ordeal. The cases were decided by the court and jury on the question of whether or not the registrants reported. They were not decided </span><span class="font5">011 </span><span class="font8">whether the boards had authority to issue the orders. </span><span class="font7">If </span><span class="font8">they did not report, tliey were adjudged guilty, irrespective of whether the Act placed a duty upon them to report. Under this theory it was impossible for the government to lose a ca,se.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Being unable to get justice in the lower federal courts, Jehovah's witnesses took many test cases to the appellate courts. Every federal court of appeals held that the lower trial courts were right. They said Jehovah's witnetises were wrong in their contention. They also hold that under the Act no defense of illegaJity of the orders \vas available in response to </span><span class="font7">the </span><span class="font8">indictments, fer the reason that they had failed to report for and submit to induction.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>Fight Reaches Climax in Supreme Court</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">Time and again efforts were made to bring cases into the United States Supreme Court for review. Repeatedly Ihat court refused to review the unlawful holdings. Finally, in 1943, the Supreme Court agreed to review the conviction of Nick Falbo, one of .Jehovah's witnesses. On January 3, 1944, that high court affirmed the judgment of ltis conviction. It held tliat Falbo should have reported at the conscientious-objector concentration camp to complete the selective process. But the court was not clear on what it intended to hold in that decision. Tt merely left the controversy suspended in mid-air. It neither accepted nor rejected the statements of the lower courts that it was necessary to report for induction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">TJh&amp;</span><span class="font8"> court merely held that one wlio had failed to repoTt is properly convicted. It erroneously construed the Regulations when it held that Falbo had not completed the selective process, saying he could still be rejected at the camp on . a physical examination. (Prior to going to t.lte i mep he had been examined and accepted.) The Supreme Court's decision on this pouit was ridiculous and withheld the only defense, on a preposterous theory. </span><span class="font7">If </span><span class="font8">was unreasonable and arbitrary to withhold from him his defenses. The court held that it was necessary for him to go to the camp and take a second physical examination to determine whether he would be accepted. It erroneously held that lie might still have been rejected at the camp. rhis was impossible liecanse he had already been declared aeceptable upon a pre-induction physical examination. It was impossible for him to escape liability through another physical examination. the court was wrong wlien it said that lie 'may still be rejected at the civilian public seTvice camp'. The court held tliat since there may have been a change in his physical condition, entitling him to another examination, he might esctl.pe liability. In other words, had Falbo been struck by lightning, run down by an automobile or overtaken by gaJoping tuberculosis, between the time of his first examination and the date he was to report for worlt at the camp, there might still be a chance for him to escape liability </span><span class="font7">011 </span><span class="font8">reporting at the camp and then being examhied anew to determine his acceptability to perfonu work of national importance. Possibility of that escape was </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">so</span><span class="font8"> slight that it was ridiculous for the Supreme</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Court to deny judicial review 011 such a vague contingency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Falbo</span><span class="font8"> case the decisions of the lower courts and the Supreme Court were in disregard of the fundamental principles previously amjounced </span><span class="font7">by </span><span class="font8">the United States Supreme Court. In </span><span class="font6">IVinil-</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">sm</span><span class="font8"> v. lVlcVei,qh, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">93</span><span class="font8"> U.

This is a principle of natural justice, recognized as such by the common intelligence and conscience of all nations.' In </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">McVeiqh </span><span class="font8">v. </span><span class="font7">Uniteil States, 11 </span><span class="font8">Wall. 259, 267, the court said tliat where one is assailed </span><span class="font7">by </span><span class="font8">an indictment or proceeding in the United States District Courts &quot;he could defend there.

A different result would </span><span class="font0">• </span><span class="font8">be a </span><span class="font7">hlot </span><span class="font8">upon our jurisprudence and civilization.

<p><span class="font8">rageous denial of the right to be heard. That was the courageous and outstanding champion of the Bill of Hights on the Supreme Court, Mi’. Justice Murphy. He did not capitulate to wartime hysteria that caused aU other members of the court to lose their vision. In protest bis dissenting opinion, among other things. says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Individual rights have been recognized by our jurisprudence only after long and costly struggles. They should not be struck down by anything Jess than the gravest. necessity. </span><span class="font0">• • . </span><span class="font6">Petitions, a membej' of .Jehovah's wit-</span><span class="font7">nesst&gt;.s, claimed </span><span class="font6">to be </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">n </span><span class="font6">minister exempt from both military training and civilian work im-der the Aet. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Common sense anl justice dictate that </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font6">eitzen accused of a crime should have the fullest hearing possihle, plus the opportunity to present every reasonable defense, Only an unenlightened jnrisprudence condemns an individual without according </span><span class="font7">Ihim </span><span class="font6">those rights. </span><span class="font0">• . . </span><span class="font6">Experience demonstrates that </span><span class="font7">in </span><span class="font6">time of war incUvidual liberties cannot always be entrusted safely to uncontrolled administrative discretion. Ulustrativc oi </span><span class="font7">this </span><span class="font6">proposition is the remark attributed to oue of the members of petitioner's local board to the effect that &quot;I do not have any damueU use for Jehovah's witnesses&quot; </span><span class="font0">. • • •</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Finully, the effective prosecution o:f the war in no way demands that petitioner be denied a full hearing in this case. We m:e concerned with a speedy and effective mohili-zation of urmed </span><span class="font7">forces. </span><span class="font6">But that mohilizal ion is neither impeOed nor augmented by the availability of judicial review of loca </span><span class="font5">1 </span><span class="font6">hoard orders in criminal proceedings. In </span><span class="font7">the </span><span class="font6">rare case where the accused person e;m prove the arbitrary aml illegal nature of the administrative action, the induction order should never have hcen issued ancl the armed, forces are deprived of no one who should have been ioducted. And where the defendant is unable to prove such a defense or where, pursuant to this court's opinion, he is forbidden even to assert this defense, the p</span><span class="font7">ri</span><span class="font6">so</span><span class="font8">n </span><span class="font7">rather </span><span class="font6">than the nrmy </span><span class="font7">oi‘ </span><span class="font8">navy </span><span class="font6">is the recipient of his presence.

Especially is this so where neither public necessity nor rule of law or statute lends inexorably to such a harsh result. The law knows no finer hour than when it cuts through formal concepts a,nd transitory emotions 1o protect unpopular citizens against discrimination and persecution, I ean perceive no other cotu’se for the law to take In this case.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">In the wake of the Supreme Court's adverse decision jn the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Falljo</span><span class="font8"> case came the flood of wartime prosecutions whereby Jehovah’s witnesses were sent to prison. Courts were used as “rnhlier stamps&quot; of draft boards to execute judgment of illegal and arbitrary fiat. The impetus of these prosecutions piled high a mountain of flesh-nnd-blood testimony proving the injustice of the denial to Jehovah's witnesses of their right to be heard in their defense. Such denial, imposed mercilessly by federal courts of the en</span><span class="font7">tire </span><span class="font8">nation under a pernicious alien doctrine, catapulted those thousands of upright men, Christian ministers, into prison. Ugly scars tliereby left upon tJie fair face of .Justice continue to this day as a warning to the entire judiciary. As the prosecutions continued, it became ever plainer that the uprooting of that alien doctrine, exposure of all its hideousness, and destruction of it, were imperative. Could it be destroyed!

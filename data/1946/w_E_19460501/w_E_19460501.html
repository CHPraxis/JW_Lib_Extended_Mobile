<p><span class="font4">THE BIBLE CLEARLY TEACHES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JEHOVAH Is the only true God, from everlasting to everlasting, and Is the Maker of heaven and earth and Giver of life to his creatures; that the Word or Logos was the beginning of his creation and his active agent in creating all other things; and that the creature Lucifer rebelled against Jehovah and raised the issue of His universal sovereignty;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT GOD created the earth for man, made perfect man for the earth and placed him npon it; that man yielded to unfaithful Lucifer, or Satan, and willfully disobeyed God's law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE LOGOS was made human as the man Jesus and suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient men: that God raised up Christ Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every other creature and clothed him with all power and authority as head of God’s new capital organization;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT GOD’S CAPITAL ORGANIZATION Is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus Is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the new world; that the faithful anointed followers of Christ Jesus are Zion’s children, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are His witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to Jehovah’s supremacy and declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed In the Bible;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE OLD WORLD, or Satan’s uninterrupted rule, ended A.D. 1914, and Christ Jesus has been placed by Jehovah upon the throne, has ousted Satan from heaven, and now proceeds to vindicate His name and establish the “new earth”;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples can come only by Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has begun; that His next great act is to destroy Satan’s organization and establish righteousness completely in the earth ; and that under the Kingdom the people of good-will surviving Armageddon will carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with righteous offspring, and that the human dead in the graves will be raised to opportunities of life on earth.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark7"></a>RULE OF THE NATIONS WITH A ROD OF IRON</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;And she brought forth a Son, who is to rule all the nations with an iron sceptre; and her child was snatched away to God, even to his throne.&quot;—Rev. 12:5, The Emphatic Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">J</span><span class="font6">EHOVAH God has decreed a rule of the rod of iron for the nations of this twentieth century. This is now the age of the atomic bomb. However, it would be a mistake to think that the rule with the iron scepter applies to any holding of worldly nations in line with the new United Nations organization by using the threat of the atomic bomb and the steel of other hideous weapons of an international police force. The A bomb, the radio-controlled rockets, shells and torpedoes, and the destructive devices which military science will yet invent, make up no part of the armaments of the Lord God Jehovah. He has no use for them in His armory. Their purpose is different from that of his decreed iron rule.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> The Security Council of the world has refused to yield to the many entreaties to scrap the A bomb and other terrific machines of warfare. It claims its purpose in holding on to such dangerous things is in order to implement the international organization and to make it strong and able to command obedience. The idea is that of backing up the world peace by force. At the same time such a peace means the keeping of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">status quo</span><span class="font6"> more or less; that is, it means the further preservation of the political governing bodies of this world. With such mighty means of warfare in their hands the power of these human governments increases, while the power of the people decreases and their helplessness increases. Such a peace will never be the peace of the kingdom of Jehovah God by his Messiah, but -will be opposed to such Messianic peace as long as this world stands. Therefore if the people are to be ushered into the endless peace of God’s kingdom, the rule of the iron scepter becomes necessary. Hard though it may sound, the rule of all the nations with a rod of iron will deliver the people from cruel oppression, for it will put an end to all the grinding down of mankind by the combined political-commercial-religious rule of this world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> Both sacred prophecy and examples of history</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1. What has Jehovah decreed for the nations of this century? and why does it not refer to the police force of the United Nations?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Why does the world’s Security Council hold on to such means of warfare? and how will endless peace and freedom from oppression come? 3. Who will wield the iron scepter, and how and why? </span><span class="font6">make clear just what the wielding of the iron scepter will mean. The wielding will be done by the One whom Jehovah appoints to shepherd the nations, and it will not be to treat the nations in tenderness like sheep. The nations of this world will see the side of the Shepherd that will be very hard upon them, whereas the sheeplike people will see His tender side and will receive the loving care and protection of the Shepherd. Men and women who do not want to feel the iron rod together with the nations will interest themselves in learning what they must do now in order to come under the Shepherd’s keeping. No time must be lost. The rule of the rod of iron is certain, and this rod is irresistible by the nations, even with their atomic bomb. That Jehovah God has decreed this final destiny to the nations of earth is revealed in the last book of the Bible, at Revelation 12:5, which reads: “She gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to shepherd all the heathen with a staff of iron; and her child was caught up to God, to his throne.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Goodspeed)</span><span class="font6"> The “male child”, or what it symbolizes, has been brought to birth and has been put on the throne by divine power. The unwillingness of the nations to recognize him will not alter the situation and shield them from the rod in the male child’s hand. In fact, their stubborn refusal to grant him recognition in this postwar epoch will make it even more certain that he will wield the staff of iron against them.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH AND HIS SHEPHERD</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">* The shepherdly attention that is to be given to the nations of this world in due time will be quite different from what Jehovah God once gave the nation of Israel in times of old. He regarded the people of this nation as His sheep, and they in turn looked up to him as their great Shepherd amid all the hostile powers and forces of this world. </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font6">ong the forefathers of that nation were the patriarch Israel or Jacob, and his sons Joseph and Benjamin, and his grandsons Ephraim and Manasseh. The twelve tribes of Israel strayed from the Lord God and came under </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">4. What nation In ancient time did Jehovah treat as his sheep? and how only could they enjoy hie keeping and his sheepfold?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">his disfavor for a while. Then it was that the repentant “sheep” of their nation prayed to Him, in the words of Psalm 80:1-19: “Give ear, 0 Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that sittest above the cherubim, shine forth. Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up thy might, and come to save us. . . . Turn us again, O Jehovah God of hosts; cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font6"> At that time the twelve tribes of Israel were under threat of the rising power of the mighty militaristic Assyria, and they could be safe only under the pastoral guardianship of the Most High God, who sat enthroned among the heavenly cherubim. The one way for them to enjoy the protection of his sheepfold was for the tribes to the north, such as Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the other tribes that had strayed and got lost in religion, to return to the worship of &quot;Jehovah God of hosts”.—2 Chron. 30:1-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ The call to worship the Great Shepherd is expressed at Psalm 95: 6,7: “Oh come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before Jehovah our Maker: for he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To-day, oh that ye would hear his voice!” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Am. Stan. Ver.) </span><span class="font6">Today, in all of “Christendom”, no nation worships this Great Shepherd. None can produce the facts to show that Jehovah God has been its shepherd since the founding of it as a nation. The nations do not have his leading today nor follow it; and when, shortly, he displays himself to them as a shepherd, it will not be to them as to sheep but it will be to them as to those who prey upon his true sheep. The nation of Israel, however, did have the historic records to prove that he was their great invisible Shepherd. From the very time that he organized them as his Theocratic nation and established his worship among them according to Iris law by Moses, the Lord God took them in charge as his chosen people and led them. He made them as an independent nation; and to do this he led them out from the house of slavery. He wrested them out of the beastly jaws of Egypt, which was fattening itself upon them like inoffensive sheep and plotting to destroy them by an enslaving “works program” for their exhaustion and extermination.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> How God delivered them from the dragonish effort of Egypt and cleared the way for them through the Red sea is the theme of a song of deliverance, in these words: “Thy way was in the sea, and thy paths in the great waters, and thy footsteps were not known. Thou leddest thy people like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.” (Ps. 77:19, 20, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">5. Why cannot the worldly nations show God Is their shepherd? and how could the nation of Israel show it?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">6. (a) Through what did Jehovah clear the way for them in ancient time? and why does he remind himself of that now? (b) Why will modern Egypt feel the iron rod?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ver.)</span><span class="font6"> And in this day, when His true sheep need deliverance and salvation from mightier powers than ancient Egypt, Jehovah remembers what he did back there. He rouses himself to an act of an even greater deliverance. As it is prophetically written with reference to our day: “Then he remembered the days of old, Moses and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock? where is he that put his holy spirit in the midst of them? that caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses? that divided the waters before them, to make himself an everlasting name? that led them through the depths, as a horse in the wilderness, so that they stumbled not? As the cattle that go down into the valley, the spirit of Jehovah caused them to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.” (Isa. 63:11-14, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font6"> The nations of &quot;Christendom” and heathendom do not pause to consider the name that Jehovah God made for himself in that crisis of long ago. The people, together with the nations, choose to ignore his name. Therefore they will soon learn to know his name, when he again makes it glorious by the rule of the iron rod. Modern Egypt and her peoples will feel the rod, but Jehovah’s sheep will experience his salvation and become his everlasting witnesses to his glorious name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ Note this one thing: That in caring for His sheep on earth the Lord God used a certain one in the capacity of shepherd as His visible representative. In the case of rescuing Israel from bondage in Egypt God used Moses like a shepherd, and his brother Aaron was attached to him in his shepherdly duties. For forty years Moses had been a literal shepherd on the Arabian peninsula tending his father-in-law Reuel’s sheep. He was engaged in this pastoral work with literal sheep when God called him at the miracle of the burning bush and appointed him to be the visible shepherd over His nation of Israel. (Ex. 3:1-10) In this capacity Moses was a prophetic picture, but not of the pontiff of Vatican city, although the Roman Hierarchy have created and applied to their pope the titles “The Chief Pastor—Pastor of Pastors”, “Chief Pastor and Teacher,” and “Moses in Authority”. Do the persecuted Jews, who now court favor with the Vatican pontiff, allow to the pope those titles as due him Scripturally and according to Moses’ law and God’s Word? One of the leading Jewish Christians, the apostle Peter, did not say that he himself or any other apostle was “Moses in Authority”.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> Peter, in unmistakable words, declared at' the temple in Jerusalem that Moses foreshadowed Christ Jesus. Let Roman Catholics and Jews and other reli-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">7, As regards Jehovah’s caring for bis sheep, what one thing should we note? and of what religious pastor was Moses not a type?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">8. Of whom, then, is Moses Scripturally declared to be a type? </span><span class="font6">gionists read these words pronounced by Peter: “He shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began. For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.” (Acts 3: 20-23; Deut. 18:15-18) Those Jews who now seek the doubtful help of the Roman pontiff should study the words of Jesus Christ, who said to the unbelieving Jews of his day: “Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust. For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.”—John 5:45,46.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>9</sup> Therefore Christ Jesus is the Shepherd like Moses, and he is over the sheep of the true flock of Jehovah God in this postwar epoch. The pressing question of the day is, therefore, this: Do the peoples, both Jew’s and Gentiles, care to know the Shepherd Christ Jesus as the Egyptians learned to know the shepherd Moses or do they want to know Him as God’s chosen nation came to know Moses? When Moses stretched forth his shepherd’s rod over Egypt it brought devastating plagues, and, when raised against Pharaoh at the Red sea, it brought tire waters of the sea over all the hosts of Pharaoh and destroyed them. (Ex. 7:20; 8:5, 16, 17; 9:23; 10:13; 14:16, 26-28) This destructive use of the rod typified what Christ will do now.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ROYAL SHEPHERD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup> To further illustrate the rule of the iron rod which is near we turn to another man whom Jehovah God raised up as His visible representative to shepherd his chosen people. That one was David. To begin with, he was a shepherd of Bethlehem-Judah. In his day a kingdom had been established over the nation of Israel by request of the people. The then reigning king, Saul of Gibeah, proved to be an unfaithful shepherd over God’s flock. Therefore the great Owner of the flock anointed another man to be visible leader and caretaker of it, David. In due time, after great persecutions by the jealous Saul, David came to the throne. He took complete possession of the city of Jerusalem and placed his throne in its stronghold named </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Zion.</span><span class="font6"> For that reason Jerusalem, the new capital city, came to be known also as “Zion”. David was of the tribe of Judah. So, in choosing David for the kingship on Mount Zion, Jehovah God passed by</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">9. What Is the pressing question of this day as to knowing this true Shepherd?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">10. What shepherd did Jehovah raise up to the throne of Israel? and why may he be likened to a Hon? </span><span class="font6">the tribe of Ephraim, Joseph’s chief son, and selected Judah. This was in harmony with His prophecy: “Judah is a lion’s whelp: . . . The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh [the Peaceful One] come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.” (Gen. 49:9,10) According to such symbolic speech, David was a flion of the tribe of Judah’.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>11</sup> God’s choice of the Judean shepherd, David, to serve as a pastoral king over His flock is described at Psalm 78: 67-72 thus: “Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim, but chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved. And he built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he hath established for ever. He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds: from following the ewes that have their young [God] brought him, to be the shepherd of Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font6"> King David was only a visible human shepherd, but he represented the real Owner and Shepherd of the national flock, namely, the Lord God, whom David worshiped. When sitting upon the throne on Mount Zion David was said to sit upon God’s throne, and his successor was said to sit “on the throne of Jehovah as king instead of David his father”. (1 Chron. 29:23, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font6"> Being just a man of flesh and blood, David could not sit upon the throne at the right hand of Jehovah God in the spiritual heavens. However, David pictured a certain One who should do so in God’s appointed time. “For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thy foes thy footstool.”—Acts 2: 34, 35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>12</sup> King David was a faithful shepherd over God’s flock because he was faithful in leading the nation in pure worship of the great national Shepherd, Jehovah. Because of David’s faithfulness to the right worship of the true and living God, Jehovah made a covenant with him for an everlasting kingdom, an everlasting Theocratic Government. In presenting this covenant for the Kingdom Jehovah spoke of the special service for which he raised up David. Thereby Jehovah indicated the service to be rendered by the permanent Heir to this Kingdom covenant in behalf of God’s people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> God’s prophet Nathan said to David: “Thus saith Jehovah, Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in: for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">11. As a royal shepherd, whom did King David represent? and why could not David sit on the right band of that one<sup>T</sup>s throne?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">12. Why was King David a faithful shepherd? and what did God indicate by the special covenant He made with David?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">13. What house did God not permit David to build? but what bouse did God covenant with David to build? </span><span class="font6">brought up Israel, unto this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another. In all places wherein I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedar?... Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, I took thee from the sheep-cote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over my people Israel: and I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth. ... I will subdue all thine enemies. Moreover I tell thee that Jehovah will build thee a house.... I will set up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons;... and I will establish his throne for ever.... I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be established for ever.”—1 Chron. 17:4-14, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">“It is perfectly plain why the One who was to become permanent heir to this covenant with David should be called “the Son of David”. Though lung of Israel, David personally could not fulfill that covenant because he was mortal and died. For a like reason, neither could any of David’s successors to the throne fulfill the covenant, as they were under the condemnation of death inherited from Adam the sinner. The One who could and would be the Heir of that kingdom as “the Son of David” is the One who has the power of an endless life, that is, immortality. Who this “Son of David” turned out to be, and how he came into possession of an endless life, is explained for us by the apostle Peter, at Acts 2: 29-33: “Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day. Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption. This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses. Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the holy [spirit], he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.” With such inspired words the apostle Peter identifies the Heir and Son of David to be Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1S</sup> Peter confirms this fact by adding: “For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thy foes thy footstool. Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">14, 16. Why could not David and bis sinful descendants fulfill that Kingdom covenant? and how does Peter identify the heir to the covenant? </span><span class="font6">God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.”—Acts 2:34-36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ Since Christ Jesus was nailed to the tree and died thereon, it must be that he received the power of an endless life or immortality when Jehovah God raised him up from the dead, not leaving Jesus’ soul or life to the lasting possession of hell or the grave. Hence Christ Jesus, in his apocalyptic vision to the apostle John, said: “I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.” (Rev. 1:18) The God of heaven invited the shepherd lad David of Bethlehem to sit upon the material throne of Jehovah on Mount Zion in Jerusalem, because David was a mortal creature of flesh and blood. But thereafter, in fulfillment of the Kingdom covenant with David, God invited Christ Jesus, the Son of David, to sit .upon the heavenly throne at the right hand of the Most High God himself. Thus he took his seat in the heavenly Zion or capital organization, which was foreshadowed by the earthly Zion in Palestine. Later, when telling of this to John, Christ Jesus as the overcomer of this world said: “I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.” (Rev. 3: 21) When he thus sat down in the throne, God’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ivoman, </span><span class="font6">that is to say, God’s organization which is above, brought Christ Jesus forth in a complete sense as her Seed, which Seed had been wounded in the heel by the Serpent but would in God’s predetermined time bruise the head of this Serpent.—Gen. 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE TYPICAL ROD OF IRON</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1T</sup> The earthly lang David did not use the rod of iron toward his own people. They were the flock of God, and David loved them. He was much concerned about their best interests, to lead them in the true paths of God’s worship, to feed them with God’s Word, and to protect them from their political and religious enemies. He tenderly cared for them just as he did for his father Jesse’s sheep in the fields round about Bethlehem. Once David made a grievous mistake and God afflicted the subjects of David as an expression of divine displeasure. Then David sorrowfully confessed and said: “Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father’s house.” (2 Sam. 24:17) Not even when he was being tracked down like a wild beast by his persecutor, Saul the king, nor ever did David strike a blow against the flock of God and use the rod of iron against them. When thieves arose inside the nation and tried to steal away the sheep by a conspiracy under David’s own son, Absalom, King David</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">16. (a) When did Jesus receive the power of an endless life and where did God make him sit? (b) As whose seed was he thus brought forth? 17. Why did David not use the iron rod against the nation of Israel? and against whom did he use it? </span><span class="font6">used strong measures to put down the conspiracy and to uphold God's covenant for the kingdom. But when it came to the hostile heathen enemies round about who were occupying the territory which the God of all the earth had promised to give to the Seed of Abraham, against these demon-worshiping nations King David did use the iron rod.—Gen. 15:18-21.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> David was Jehovah’s anointed one, being anointed with oil by the prophet Samuel as the future king of Israel. In the Hebrew language, which David spoke, the anointed one is called </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Mashiahh,</span><span class="font6"> that is to say, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Christ</span><span class="font6">. In the day when his God had rescued him out of the hand of all his enemies, including Saul, David composed a psalm which ended with these words: “Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to Ms </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">anointed [mashiahh'],</span><span class="font6"> to David, and to his seed for evermore.” (Ps. 18:50) The divine purpose is to have the Anointed One triumph over the enemies; and to show this the psalmist wrote: “For Jehovah hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation. There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">anointed [mashiahh'].</span><span class="font6"> His enemies will I clothe with shame; but upon himself shall his crown flourish.” —Ps. 132:13,17,18, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>19</sup> Inescapably all the nations that are the enemies of Jehovah’s Anointed King who was foreshadowed by David are due for a severe treatment at God’s hands, according to the following prophetic words: “I have exalted one chosen out of the people. I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him: with whom my hand shall be established; mine arm also shall strengthen him. The enemy shall not exact from him, nor the son of wickedness afflict him. And I will beat down his adversaries before him, and smite them that hate him. But my faithfulness and my lovmgkindness shall be with him; and in my name shall his horn be exalted. My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. Once have I sworn by my holiness: I will not lie unto David: His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me. It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as the faithful -witness in the sky.” (Ps. 89:19-24, 34-37, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font6"> That covenant for the everlasting Idngdom will no more fail than will the sun and moon. Hence those who suffer reproach because they follow the footsteps of God’s Anointed will enjoy God’s loving-kindness and -will see the iron rod used upon all enemies of the Messiah: “Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest unto David in thy faithfulness ? Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in my bosom</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">18, 19. (a) As the anointed king what was David called? and what God’s purpose as to the enemies of his Anointed One? (h) How permanent is his covenant for the Kingdom? </span><span class="font6">the reproach of all the mighty peoples, wherewith tMne enemies have reproached, O Jehovah, wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">anointed [mashiahh].”—</span><span class="font6">Ps. 89:49-51, A.S.V.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>20</sup> During King David’s reign the enemies, national and individual, did feel the iron rod of Jehovah’s anointed one. It was in a small-scale way and for a picture of greater things to happen now. Hardly had </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font6">g David seated himself upon his throne on Mount Zion, when the persistent foes of God’s flock who had many times raided his sheep set in motion their military policy against David. As it is recorded: “And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed lang over all Israel, ail the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of it, and went out against them. And the PMlistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim [near Jerusalem].” Then Almighty God delivered these enemies of the typical anointed one into David’s hand to be beaten down with an iron rod, and David said: “God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters.” “And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.” Philistia’s gods had failed in the first effort, but the Philistines came against Jehovah’s anointed Icing with a second army. Once more the Lord God of hosts delivered up the enemies to be battered and bruised with the rod of iron. “David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer. And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the Lord brought the fear of him upon all nations.”—1 Chron. 14:8-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>21</sup> Later on in David’s reign other heathen nations in the Promised Land rose against David and the typical Theocracy which he ruled in God’s name. All were dashed into subjection by the iron rod of Jehovah’s warfare by his anointed king. Indicating against whom' the Lord’s anointed ruler wielded the scepter of iron, the Record says: “Vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass: which also king David did dedicate unto the Lord, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued; of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the PMlistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah. And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men. And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David’s servants. And the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went. And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20. How did the Philistines come to feel the iron rod in David’s band’’ 21. According to the Record, against what other nations did David use the iron rod?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">judgment and justice unto all his people.”—2 Sam. 8:10-15.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>22</sup> Such facts as those provide an illuminating background against which to understand the Second Psalm. With David, Jehovah’s anointed king, enthroned on Mount Zion, the heathen nations in the Promised Land raged and tumultuously assembled against him to prevent being brought under the bonds of Jehovah’s typical Theocracy. The heathen peoples, being regimented by their rulers for war, meditated a vain thing. They plotted in vain to stop the increase of Jehovah’s typical kingdom and to wipe out his kingdom covenant with David. Almighty God's decree against them must stand. He had decreed that his king on Zion must proceed against all those insubordinate and opposing nations and must dash them to shivers as a potter would dash clay vessels with a rod of iron. So shattered they were, as reported by Psalm Two, in the following words:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>23 tr</sup>Why do the nations rage, and the peoples meditate a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against Jehovah, and against his anointed </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[mashiahh: Christ],</span><span class="font6"> saying, Let us break their bonds asunder, and cast away their cords from us. He that sitteth in the heavens will laugh: the Lord will have them in derision. Then will he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure: [saying] Yet I have set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. I will tell of the decree: Jehovah said unto me, Thou art my son; this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”—Ps. 2:1-9, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE GREATER DAVID AND HIS ROD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>23</sup> The foregoing Psalm Two, and the historic facts which it had as its background, were all prophetic of events in this twentieth century, especially from A.D. 1914. David was a prophetic figure pointing to Jehovah’s everlasting Anointed King on the heavenly throne. That is perfectly clear from the Holy Scriptures. The nations and peoples of “Christendom” have claimed to be God’s flock. Their political, financial and religious rulers have claimed to be ordained of God and to have the rulership over the peoples by right divine, but they have been merciless, selfseeking shepherds over the peoples subject to them. They have scattered those who are the real sheep of Jehovah God, in the endeavor to break up their organization and to starve them spiritually into a</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">22, 23. How was Psalm Two thus fulfilled In a typical way?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">24. 25. (a) As described by the prophet Ezekiel, what kind of shepherds have been the rulers of the worldly nations? (b) By what shepherd does God declare the relief of the people will come? </span><span class="font6">compromise with this world. Many men have meek qualities which would lead them to become the sheep of Jehovah’s great flock, but these cruel, oppressive shepherds of this world try to keep them scattered and away from seeking and finding the fold of the Great Shepherd, Jehovah. The rulers have been like strong animals among the professed flock of God and have selfishly pushed aside the others in order to have the first and the best for themselves. The way the nations have hated and persecuted the witnesses of Jehovah during the World War of 1914 and since then fully substantiates this. Ezekiel, chapter 34, foretold this which is true of our day. He then showed the relief that the Eternal One, Jehovah, would bring to his sheep by means of a David greater than the ancient king by that name. We read:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>25</sup> “This is what the Lord the Eternal says: T myself will take action. You plump creatures, you have pushed the lean sheep away, with your sides and shoulders, butting at these feeble creatures with your horns till you have scattered them abroad! Now I will rescue my flock, they shall be a prey no longer, and I will judge between sheep and sheep. Also I will place a single ruler over them, that is, my servant David, who shall feed them and be their shepherd; I the Eternal will be their God, and my servant David shall be prince among them; I the Eternal proclaim this.’ ” (Ezek. 34: 20-24, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt’)</span><span class="font6"> “They [the sheep of spiritual Israel] shall no longer befoul themselves with idols or detestable practices or any other transgressions; I will keep them clear of all the rebelliousness with which they have sinned, and I will purify them; so shall they be my own people, and I will he their God. My servant David shall be king over them, their sole shepherd. They shall live by my laws, and observe and obey my orders. They shall live in the land that I gave to my servant Jacob, where their fathers lived; there shall they live, they and their children and their children’s children for all time, with my servant David as their perpetual prince.” —Ezek. 37:23-25, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>20</sup> The David here meant is not the faithful David of old who is soon to be resurrected from the dead to life on earth under God’s kingdom, but is Christ Jesus. Jehovah God has clothed him with immortality to be a &quot;perpetual prince” in the heavens at His own righthand. Hence Psalm Two applies to Christ Jesus as the </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font6">g anointed with Jehovah’s spirit. It is by no private interpretation of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> that we apply the psalm. Putting on record the first or miniature fulfillment of the psalm, the inspired Bible, at Acts 4 : 24-27, applies the psalm for us, saying: “Lord, thou art God, . . . who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Why did the heathen rage,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">26. Who Is that promised David? and why is it by no private Interpretation of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> that we apply Psalm Two to him? </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">and the people imagine vain things? The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord</span><span class="font6"> [Jehovah], </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">and against his Christ. </span><span class="font6">For of a truth, against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together.” But still another witness, the inspired apostle Paul, applies Psalm Two to Christ Jesus, saying: “And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers, God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.”—Acts 13: 32-34.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>27</sup> God raised up Christ Jesus from the dead. God exalted him to the everlasting heavenly throne first after Rome’s governor and the Jews who had chosen to have Caesar as their friend had conspired and raged against Christ Jesus and had vainly imagined to kill him off for ever and so keep him from becoming King. It is evident, however, that such was only a first or miniature fulfillment of the prophecy of Psalm Two. Why is this evident? Because when Christ Jesus ascended to heaven and sat down at Jehovah’s right he did not at once enter into his active reign upon Mount Zion. This fact is manifest because the political nations of the earth have not wanted Christ’s kingdom to be established in place of them and yet they have not been ‘dashed in pieces like a potter’s vessel’ and brushed off the earth. No one can say, within sense or Scripture, that the preaching of the gospel to the nations during the past nineteen centuries has dashed the nations to pieces, either literally or figuratively. Certainly no person of sense will argue that the preaching of the gospel to the meek has been the wielding of the iron scepter or rod. The gospel preaching has not shattered the nations as pagan or heathen nations, because, despite the name “Christendom” which the false religious shepherds have applied to them, the nations are as heathenish as ever. In fact, they are worse than the out-and-out pagans and heathen, because they practice their political, commercial, religious heathenism in the name of God and Christ and bring great reproach upon the name of Jehovah and confuse the peoples as to the true kingdom of God by Christ Jesus.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>2S</sup> The apostles Peter and Paul apply Psalm 110 to the Greater David, Christ Jesus. This psalm declares that Christ Jesus, on being seated at Jehovah’s right</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">27. From what facts of the past nineteen centuries is it evident that such was only the first or miniature fulfillment of Psalm Two?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">28. To whom does Psalm 110 apply? and what does it show regarding his waiting? </span><span class="font6">hand in the heavens, must wait unto God’s scheduled time to put all his enemies under Christ’s feet in order that they may be dashed to pieces. Says Paul: “But Christ has offered for all time one sacrifice for sin, and has taken his seat at God’s right hand, from that time waiting for his enemies to be made his footstool.” (Heb. 10:12,13, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Goodspeed)</span><span class="font6"> He has waited during all the centuries of this “Christian era”, so called, during which time the “church of God”, or “flock of God”, has been taken out from the world. This church or flock of God is called to be joined with Christ in his reign on the heavenly throne. (Rev. 3:14, 21) They are taken into the Kingdom covenant with him.—Luke 22: 29.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>22</sup> The faithful ones of the church of Jehovah God must overcome the world just as their Head and Leader Christ Jesus did. This they do by not conforming themselves to this world or becoming a part of its organization or maldng any compromise whatever with it. They conform themselves to Christ’s example in worshiping his heavenly Father and preaching the good news of God’s kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>30</sup> Says the glorified Christ to the members of the church: “He that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father?’ (Rev. 2:26,27) This proves that Christ Jesus, immediately upon ascending to his Father’s right hand in the heavens, did not actively enter upon his reign and begin dashing the nations to pieces. Why so? Because his faithful followers who overcome this world and die in faithfulness must wait for his second coming in order for them to be raised out of death as spirit creatures to be associated with him in his kingdom. That is to say, they must wait until he comes into the Kingdom, which kingdom he told them he must go away to receive from his Father, after which he would return. (Luke 19:12,15; Mark 13:34-37) His first coming was in order to bear witness to Jehovah to preach God’s kingdom to mankind. His second coming is to enter in upon his kingdom. His entering into his kingdom means the end of this old world, for it interrupts Satan’s rule of this world. Christ Jesus then raises the church to join him in breaking the nations to shivers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>31</sup> In support of the foregoing, Christ’s revelation of “things which must shortly come to pass” discloses these events: “And there followed great voices in heaven, and they said, The kingdom of the world is become the kingdom of our Lord, and of his Christ: and he shall reign for ever and ever.... We give thee thanks, 0 Lord God, the Almighty, who art and who</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20 How do his Kingdom associates overcome this world?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">30. What rulership over the nations did Jesus promise such overcomers? and what does this prove as to the use of the iron rod?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">31. 32. How does Revelation 11:15*19 show the rule with the iron rod does not begin before the resurrection of the dead saints? </span><span class="font6">wast; because thou hast taken thy great power, and didst reign. And the nations were wroth, and thy wrath came, and the time of the dead to be judged, and the time to give their reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to them that fear thy name, the small and the great; and to destroy them that destroy the earth. And there was opened the temple of God that is in heaven.”—Rev. 11:15-19, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>32</sup> The nations gave no thanks to Almighty God for taking his power and setting up his kingdom and conferring kingdom authority upon Christ Jesus. They were angry and full of wrath. Hence Almighty God’s wrath deserved to come against such nations, and the wrath he expressed would be through Christ his enthroned King. Notice, everybody, that when the kingdom of the new world becomes the kingdom of God and of his Christ, and when the wrath of the worldly nations breaks out and God’s wrath comes against such nations, there also comes the due time for God to deal with his dead servants, the saints, to give them their reward. Hence the giving to these saints power over the nations, to rule such nations with a rod of iron and to break them to shivers like vessels of a potter, could not occur before the saints were resurrected at that time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>33</sup> Notice that after the opening of God’s temple in heaven Christ Jesus gave the vision of the birth of the man-child in heaven. John, who saw the vision, tells it in these words: “And a great portent was seen in heaven, a woman clad in the sun—with the moon under her feet, and a tiara of twelve stars on her head; she was with child, crying in the pangs of travail, in anguish for her delivery. Then another portent was seen in heaven! There was a huge red dragon, with seven heads and ten horns and seven diadems upon his heads; his tail swept away a third of the stars of heaven and flung them to the earth. And the dragon stood in front of the woman who was on the point of being delivered, to devour her child as soon as it was born. She gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron flail; her child was caught up to God and to his throne.” (Rev. 12:1-5, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt)</span><span class="font6"> The ‘shepherding of all the nations of this world with an iron flail, rod or scepter’ must therefore come after the birth of the male child and his enthronement. The vision of this, Christ Jesus gave to John more than a half century after He was ascended to heaven; and he gave the vision as a prophecy of things due to come to pass after John’s day. Hence the birth of the man-child ruler and his enthronement do not apply to Jesus’ ascending to heaven and sitting down at God’s right hand nineteen</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">33. According to Revelation 12:1-5, when must the rule with the iron rod come?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">centuries ago, but do apply to Jesus’ entering into Kingdom rule with his Father at the end of the time of waiting for him to make the enemies Christ’s footstool, namely, A.D. 1914. Then Christ was brought forth from God’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">woman</span><span class="font6"> or organization as King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SMITING WITH THE ROD</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’‘Elsewhere in Watchtower publications it has been proved, by Bible and by fact, that A.D. 1914 marked the end of the “seven times” of the Gentiles, which had compelled Christ Jesus to wait. Hence 1914 marked the birth of the man-child ruler and his enthronement, because then Almighty God took His power to reign and he laid Kingdom authority upon Christ Jesus and commanded him to act. Psalm 110:1,2 foretold this, saying: “Jehovah saith unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Am. Stan Ver.)</span><span class="font6"> In 1914, therefore, when the nations of “Christendom” became angry in World War I, Jehovah sent forth the rod of our Lord Jesus from his throne in the heavenly Zion. At once the making of his enemies to be his footstool began. According to Christ’s revelation to us we know what followed, for we quote from his words: “And there was war in heaven: Michael [the manchild like God, Christ Jesus] and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.” —Rev. 12:7-9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>35</sup> The cry that was raised in the heavens at the ousting of the Devil and his angels therefrom proves that the man-child’s birth and enthronement symbolizes the birth of Jehovah’s government by Christ Jesus A.D. 1914. “And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">KINGDOM OF OUR </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">God,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> AND THE POWER OF HIS CHRIST I </span><span class="font6">for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. Therefore, rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” —Rev. 12:10,12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>33</sup> The Devil is filled with great wrath at the established kingdom of God by his Messiah, and he stirs up to wrath against that Theocratic Government all the nations and governments of this old world. Both </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">34. How was the man-child’s birth and enthronement accomplished in 1914? and what Immediately followed?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">35. How does the cry then in heaven prove that the man-child’s birth and enthronement symbolizes the Kingdom’s establishment?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">36. Due to what knowledge does the Devil stir up the nations to wrath against the Kingdom?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">World War I and World War II were fought by the nations, not in the interest of Jehovah’s Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus, but in the interest of world domination by themselves. The Devil stirs them up to wrath because he knows that it is a dead certainty now that Jehovah’s Theocratic King, Christ Jesus, will in a short time smite the nations of the Devil’s world organization with his scepter or rod of iron. That will mean the dashing of all of Satan’s visible organization among men to bits. This wrecking of Satan’s earthly dominion will be followed up immediately by the bruising of that Old Serpent’s head, namely, the destruction of his invisible demon organization. He will no longer be head of any dominion in God’s universe, but will be sealed up in the bottomless pit or abyss of complete impotency. —Kev. 20:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3T</sup> Jehovah God has therefore enthroned his Shepherd Christ Jesus, the King greater than David. To correspond with the ancient international conspiracy against David’s reign on Mount Zion, today all nations of this world are gathering together into a world plot against Jehovah’s Anointed King reigning in the heavenly Zion. The international organization for the peace and security of this world, together with its atomic bomb, represents the capping of their conspiracy against God’s kingdom, even if it does have the blessing of the clergy, Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, and heathen. The international organization is of this old world, not of the new world which God creates. Hence it is not for Jehovah’s kingdom by Christ Jesus. Its atomic bomb was not brought forth for Jehovah’s Theocracy by Christ. It was brought forth for democracy, ostensibly; and postwar democracy has brought forth and brings forth rulers who are in the great world plot against Jehovah’s Theocratic rule by his Christ. But such raging of the nations is in vain, and the peoples imagine a vain thing, as their earthly lungs set themselves and their rulers take counsel together against Jehovah and his Anointed King. His King is enthroned on the heaven-</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">37. How does realm 2:1-9 apply to this time? </span><span class="font6">ly Zion to stay. Jehovah, by his witnesses, has spoken for many years to the nations in his wrath. Soon now He will vex them in his sore displeasure by the final universal war of Armageddon. He will signal to his King, and Christ Jesus will shepherd the opposing nations with his rod of iron.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>38</sup> The going of Jehovah’s King into action with his rod against the world conspiracy is pictured for us, at Revelation 19:11-21: “Then I saw heaven thrown open and there appeared a white horse. His rider was called Faithful and True, and he judges and wages war in uprightness. His eyes blazed like tire. There were many diadems on his head, ... The garment he wore was spattered with blood [of his foes], and his name was the Word of God. The armies of heaven followed him mounted on white horses and clothed in pure white linen. From his mouth came a sharp sword with which he is to strike down the heathen [the nations]. He will shepherd them ■with a staff of iron, and will tread the winepress of the fierce anger of God Almighty. On his clothing and his thigh he has this title written: King of kings and Lord of lords. . . . 'Come 1 Gather for God’s great banquet, and eat the bodies of lungs, commanders, and mighty men, of horses and their riders—the bodies of all men, slaves and freemen, high and low.’ Then I saw the animal and the kings of the earth and their armies gather to make war on him who was mounted upon the horse and upon his army.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">{Goodspeed)</span><span class="font6"> The result, which is next symbolically described, will be the iron rod’s battering to pieces all the world combine and those who back it up.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>39</sup> If we are the devoted sheep of this kingly Shepherd, the use of his iron rod will be a great comfort, for it will clear the way for his peaceful reign of blessing to all who become his sheep. All “men of good will” who would avoid being smitten by his iron rod at Armageddon are now under the great urgency to hear the Good Shepherd’s voice and to flee from this world to the fold of God.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">38. How does Revelation 19:11-21 picture the King’s going Into action with the iron rod, and the result?</span></p></li>

<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark11"></a>SPEAKING IN TONGUES THE WRONG SIGN</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font5">T WAS Pentecost of A.D. 33, the fiftieth day after the resurrection of Christ Jesus from the dead. Ten days before the resurrected Christ had told his followers to tarry in Jerusalem until they had received the promised holy spirit from on high. (Luke 24:49-53) On this day of Pentecost about a hundred and twenty faithful followers were assembled in a house in Jerusalem. Suddenly a sound as of a rushing wind filled the house, and a cloven tongue like as of fire was upon each of them. They began to speak, not in their native tongue, but in foreign tongues heretofore unknown to them. The amazing news spread like wildfire throughout the city, and many foreigners that were in Jerusalem at the time came to see for themselves. To their astonishment they heard the gospel preached in their own native tongues. (Acts 2:1-11) Jehovah God through Christ Jesus had poured out upon His witnesses the promised holy spirit or active force. It was manifested to all by the astounding use of foreign tongues for gospel-preaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today, more than nineteen centuries later, certain religionists insist on miraculously given “tongues” as proof of true Christianity. It is certain that if God wanted his servants to now exercise the power of tongues it would be for use in Kingdom service. The fact that he does not impart this gift shows that at this time he has other means of fulfilling his purpose that “this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations”. (Matt. 24:14) And so he has. Since 1922 Jehovah’s witnesses have distributed more than 470,000,000 books and booklets and Bibles in fulfillment of the command of gospelpreaching. These publications have gone out in more than eighty languages, the principal languages of the world. Add to this imposing figure millions of magazines and untold millions of tracts, all in many languages, and on top of this consider the thousands of recorded Bible lectures in many languages that have been reproduced by phonograph and sound-car and sound-boat, and you may begin to appreciate how Jehovah God through his witnesses has preached the gospel to literally hundreds of millions scattered over the face of the earth, which unnumbered millions heard and read in their native tongue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who today insist on the “gift of tongues” should answer this question: How much preaching do they do in “tongues” outside of their religious meeting-places? They will have to admit, None! Their “gift” they possess only for a time, when seized by some strange power. Then no one present, not even the one whose tongue babbles, understands. No one is profited or upbuilt in the knowledge of God. Which ones, then, are fulfilling God’s purposes of gospel-preaching and evidencing His spirit in getting the work done, Jehovah’s witnesses or the religionists speaking in “tongues”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the time of Pentecost the tongues were for a sign to unbelievers and that foreigners could hear the Kingdom message and understand without an interpreter. (1 Cor. 14: 22) Those at religious meetings who babble in what they think is a foreign tongue, to the understanding and profit of none of the hearers, feel puffed up thereat and never consider the words of the apostle Paul, who said: “I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all: yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.” (1 Cor. 14:18,19) Not all Christians spoke with tongues even in Paul’s day: “Do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?” (1 Cor. 12:30) Then in the following chapter Paul shows that to “speak with the tongues of men and of angels” is not the real test of a Christian, but love and devotion to Jehovah God as expressed by obedience and faithfulness to Him. Furthermore, the apostle showed that in course of time the gift of tongues to Christians would stop: “whether there be tongues, they shall cease.” They did cease, at the death of the apostles through whom the gift of tongues was given to others, and at the death of those to whom the gift of tongues was imparted through the apostles.—Acts 19:1-6; 8:14-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this day the sign of “tongues” does not mark one as a Christian. Religionists who now claim to possess at times the miraculous gift of tongues are at such times possessed of the demons and by them made to babble, and thus are the dupes of the Devil, who always counterfeits God’s methods. In now looking for such an out-of-date sign rather than obeying God’s clear commission to his witnesses, let such religionists take heed to Jesus’ warning words that “an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign” and that the sign such a generation demands will not be given to it, because contrary to God’s will. Immediately after those words of condemnation Jesus warned the religionists against becoming possessed by demons or “unclean spirits”. (Matthew 12:38-45) The demons blind and lead their</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">deceived dupes to destruction. The prayerful study of and and protection. Then you will not be deceived by any wrong faithful obedience to God’s Word is your only safe course “sign” sponsored by the demons.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark13"></a>THROUGH BRITAIN ON TO BALTIMORE</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font5"> COLD wave had settled over the British Isles at the end of 1945, bringing with it much illness among the people. This, however, was not enough to keep Theocratic-minded Britishers from turning out in goodsized numbers to the series of assemblies that then began on the occasion of the arrival from Scandinavia of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society’s president, N. H. Knorr. Disembarking from a Norwegian ship at Newcastle-on-Tyne, England, on December 31, Brother Knorr and his secretary, M. G. Henschel, proceeded to serve the first of the assemblies, at this port. At the City Hall they addressed an audience of 800 made up of publishers of God’s kingdom and interested persons of good-will. Brother Knorr particularly dealt with the crucible of persecution and suffering through which the witnesses of Jehovah God passed during the last decade of Nazi-Fascist ascendancy, and also related to his intense listeners the experiences of his business trip on the European continent and the interesting information and observations he had acquired during the two months of travel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the close of the meeting Brother Knorr invited the full-time pioneer publishers to meet with him if interested in service opportunities in other lands for which special training would be given at the Watch Tower Society’s expense at the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead in America. Large numbers of pioneers turned out in response both here at Newcastle and throughout the series of assemblies, and finally several hundred pioneers had filed their preliminary applications for entry into the college.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Assembly program was practically the same at all places visited by Brothers Knorr and Henschel, at Edinburgh, Glasgow, Sheffield, Lincoln, Bradford, and Stockport. A number of Jehovah’s witnesses from Ireland found it convenient to attend the meetings in Scotland, at Edinburgh and Glasgow; it was good to see them present and to hear their stories. This Assembly tour was made by motor car, together with Brothers Hughes and Robb from the Society’s London office. They both spoke at the Stockport meeting during the afternoon session. All the brethren along the route were very enthusiastic and took much comfort from the postwar visit of the Society’s president. Many found the meetings so refreshing and beneficial that they began planning at once to attend the coming London Assembly as well. One week was spent on the road, and the attendances at these meetings with the president are as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">telephone messages and mail from all comers of the land about accommodations and arrangements for the London Assembly, scheduled for January 12 and 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REPORT FROM THE CHANNEL ISLANDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among those who came to London early were some brethren from the Channel Islands. One of these, a company servant from the island of Jersey, was invited to speak at a meeting of the Paddington unit of the London company of Jehovah’s witnesses. This proved of great interest and pleasure for Brothers Knorr and Henschel and the Paddington publishers. According to the story of the witness from Jersey, in 1940 two of the Kingdom publishers were walking down a lane on the island, when they spied a German plane overhead, the forerunner of the invasion forces that were to occupy the Channel Islands for the duration of the war. There were just five Kingdom publishers in Jersey then; but their fewness did not become a cause for fearful retirement from God’s service. On they went with their regular door-to-door preaching and distributing of literature and the making of return visits on the interested. When only a small supply of literature remained, they determined to loan books instead of leaving them indefinitely with the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was not long before the Nazis banned all going from house to house for any purpose, and meetings were banned. But that meant nothing to Jehovah's witnesses, because their Co</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font5">ander Christ Jesus had given them a definite procedure of faithfulness to follow and they could not change from it because of orders from mere men, especially the Nazi army. As they carried on their Christian ministry their numbers increased and soon there were three meetings of them going on in different parts of the island. The new ones joined in the good work, and with the ending of the war and the return to normal communications with England it was their happy privilege to report a total of forty publishers as active in God's service. And ninety persons had attended an assembly held in Jersey toward the close of the occupation. This result deserves commendation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">London assembly</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During January the United Nations Organization Assembly was meeting in London. Hence obtaining a suitable place to hold the proposed Theocratic convention presented quite a problem. All large auditoriums that remained unoccupied by the military were requisitioned by the government, with the exception of Royal Albert Hall, well known to all Londoners. Only evening sessions were open for Saturday and Sunday there on January 12 and 13. Since there was no other choice, Royal Albert Hall was engaged. For the Sunday afternoon session two halls were booked about a mile from the Kingdom Hall in central London. The main hall for Sunday morning and afternoon was to be the Seymour Hall near Marble Arch; the other hall was the Victorian Music Hall or Metropolitan Theatre, one of London’s oldest. Arrangements were sought with the Government Post Office Telecommunications engineers to broadcast by land-line from Seymour Hall to the Metropolitan Theatre and also the Kingdom Hall-Central London, the headquarters of the Paddington unit of the London company. Despite the great pressure under which the department was working in providing miles of connection for the UN conference, the department agreed to accept instructions to link up the Sunday afternoon programs that all might be able to hear the Watch Tower president and other brethren in the three halls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It being now evident that the Royal Albert Hall would barely hold the many persons of good-will and the Kingdom publishers, permission was sought from the police at New Scotland Yard to relay the public lecture through powerful loud-speakers from the rear of the hall. This great circular building has accommodations outside at its rear for many hundreds of people. The police rejected the application, but an appeal to the commissioner himself effected the granting of permission just thirty hours before the public lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After much rain and bitter wintry weather, January 12 brought a sunny sky with favorable weather. For field activity in the grand announcement, “Be Glad, Ye Nations,” 1,978 publishers reported. Placards were carried in the heart of London’s West End during the morning and afternoon by 1,200 publishers, causing a great stir among the busy, crowded streets. For the previous seven days the publishers, in their suburban districts, had extended a wide announcement by leaflet, placard and letters of invitation to all of good-will. Saturday was the climax. The aim was to complete the distribution of one million handbills then, or no later than Sunday noon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For the benefit of out-of-towners catering arrangements were provided by the convention staff at Kingdom Hall, just across the pleasant Kensington Gardens from Albert Hall. Meals were provided on both Saturday and Sunday, 150 willing volunteers serving in the cafeteria. The strict British rationing regulations brought some difficulties, the purchase of anything but bread and cakes being prohibited. But the London brethren rallied to the support of the cafeteria and supplied necessary foods to make the arrangement a success. In all ten thousand cookies and over a thousand loaves of bread were used to feed the conventioners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The accommodations department was overwhelmed with applications from all over the country. An urgent appeal was sent out, repeated, and repeated again, asking the London brethren to offer some kind of sleeping accommodations in their homes. The splendid response provided over a thousand beds in the brethren’s homes or of people of good-will, and other accommodation was found to complete the assignment of over 1,600 brethren. Hotel accommodation was impossible, thousands of bedrooms being used by military forces and the newly arrived UN delegates and persons interested in UN affairs. Emergency beds were found for thirty publishers on Saturday and fifteen on Sunday in Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Saturday evening the first session was to begin at the Royal Albert Hall at 6:30 p.m. The doors were to open at six o’clock. Those conventioners who arrived just at 6 p.m. were amazed to see the typically British queue stretched right around the elliptical-shaped Hall. As the doors were thrown open how the eager publishers and friends poured into the Hall! Quickly the 2,000 mark was passecL Soon they were filling the top gallery, as the 4,000 mark was passed. Still they poured in. At 6:30 p.m., when Brother Hughes as chairman stepped to the microphone to announce the opening talk by Brother Henschel on “The Publishers Good News”, 6,000 joined in a great roar of applause. At 7 p.m. Brother Knorr mounted the platform to bring them his talk “Jehovah’s witnesses in the Crucible” and a brief report on his tour of the European countries. Even just that one talk relating the exciting and exemplary stories about the faithfulness of fellow witnesses in many parts of the earth made them all feel satisfied that they had come to London. At the conclusion the chairman stepped forward and proposed that the audience express their appreciation for the good news and also their love for the brethren in all the world. Would they send their greetings to brethren whom Brother Knorr was soon to visit in America? Why, of course. The answer was unanimous; and Brother Knorr was glad to carry their message along with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sunday morning, January 13, featured a talk by JI. F. Anderson, who had been a member of the Bethel family at Brooklyn, N.Y., and who was then in London en route to Norway’s Branch office, which he has since reached. He spoke on “Seek Ye First the Kingdom”, which served to spur the publishers on as they departed to the field for carrying on the 1946 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscription campaign and announcing for the last time the public lecture. Meantime, at 10 a.m., Brother Knorr addressed over 800 British pioneers, stressing the present necessity for door-to-door service in Britain and the distributing of the Kingdom literature widely as the first step in making the people of good-will outside glad. Then he explained the purpose of the Watchtower Bible College and offered preliminary applications for admission to those who were interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the afternoon 5,300 publishers pressed into the three auditoriums, and all heard perfectly by means of the telephone lines as H. F. Zinser, a College graduate on his way then to the Society’s Branch office in the Netherlands, reported some thrilling news of the Kingdom service in Canada where he had served as a servant to the brethren. Then C. H. Holmes, a College graduate then en route to the Belgium office, spoke on “Organized for Action”. Brother Henschel next came on with a brief talk pointing out the issue of “The Service First” and the wonderful opportunities open to young and old now to share in full-time service, or at least in increased service. As final speaker, Brother Knorr used the subject “Stronghearted for the Postwar Era”. He wound up with very timely and straightforward remarks as to the need for enlivened activity in the British field. Literature was once more available for use by the British publishers. They should seize their good opportunities now to put it into the hands of hungry persons of goodwill quickly. The listeners appreciated his plainness of speech, t</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">akin</span><span class="font5">g to heart the admonition given for their welfare and the improvement of their service. They were working hard; but some things had been overlooked. Now they would give diligent attention to these.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Royal Albert Hall was to open its doors at 6:30 p.m. for the public lecture. What a sight it was to see a queue stretched six deep completely around the Albert Hall. Evidently not all would find room inside. By 7 p.m. the Hall was packed to overflowing, and many hundreds were still outside. The ushers directed these crowds to the rear of the building, where 900 heard the public talk through the outside loud-speakers and then received free booklets. Persons in neighboring apartment houses opened their windows and also heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The 8,000 packed tightly inside the great auditorium broke into loud acclaim as the Society’s president rose from his seat on the platform to deliver “Be Glad, Ye Nations”. It was a pleasure for him to talk about such a comforting message to such an appreciative and responsive audience, describing how the Lord God had foretold the blessings of his anointed servants and of those of the nations who are now coming into association with His people to rejoice with them. It was a forceful witness and a great encouragement to the British brethren. Many persons of good-will were also in attendance, for at the close of the meeting more than 4,000 copies of the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The &quot;Commander to the Peoples&quot;</span><span class="font5"> were given away free. It was a glorious climax to the week-end witness in London, a witness that saw 107 books, 955 booklets and a million folders distributed by 2,694 individual publishers in 8,167 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BACK. TO AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Monday, January 14, was a beautiful sunny day in London. The good weather was especially pleasing to our Brothers Knorr and Henschel, for that was their day of departure from England by Pan American Airways. The time had come for them to bid good-bye to the beloved London Bethel family and the three American brothers en route to service at the Society’s branch offices in Europe. Some of the brethren were at Airways House in London for a last-minute visit with the departing brethren and waved farewell as they left in the British Overseas Airways Corporation bus for Hum Airport, a four-hour trip to the south. There were twenty passengers listed for the trip to New York, many of whom were British wives of American soldiers, and there were two infants. Due to delay of the plane that was coming over from America the time of departure from Hurn was delayed until 11 p.m. Meantime the passengers were taken to Sandacres Hotel at Poole along the coast. At 9 p.m. word was phoned through that everything was in readiness for flight to America via Ireland; and so, back to the airfield at Hurn! It was a beautiful moonlit night, and as the bus approached the airfield the huge silver plane could be seen glistening in the moonbeams. Promptly at eleven o’clock the passengers were taken aboard, the door was locked, passengers fastened their seat-belts, and plane motors started. Before many minutes passed, the mechanical “roc” was winging its way westward toward the Irish Free State. A smooth landing was made at 1:30 a.m., January 15, at Shannon Airport beside the River Shannon. A faulty motor or engine was fixed up, and at 4:15 a.m. everything was found to be in order and all engines working properly. The big Douglas transport plane taxied down the field and then took off for Newfoundland. After about five hours of flying, which covered 900 miles, reports came in to the radio operator of a bad storm over Newfoundland and eastern Canada, making visibility so poor that a landing could not be made safely. There was no other course to take than to turn back to Shannon. What a surprise some of the passengers had upon awaking, when they noticed that the plane was headed toward the rising sun instead of turning its tail on “old Sol”. The return to Eire was quicker, because of tailwinds, than had been the flight out, and shortly after noon the passengers and crew were seated in the terminal dining room being served a meal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The captain checked further weather reports and it was decided that no further flight would be attempted until about 10:30 that night. This layover allowed for transporting the passengers by bus through the interesting Irish countryside to the F</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">alls</span><span class="font5"> Hotel near Ennistymon. They hoped they would not be forced to stay for the night, and were made glad when their meal was interrupted with the announcement that definite word had been sent to depart at 9 p.m. for the airport, about thirty-six miles away. After a bouncing ride over the Irish roads the bus pulled into the terminal yard just after 10 p.m., passengers were unloaded, and tea was served in the lounge room. After a while a flight steward came by with the news that take-off would be at 11:40. At that time orders came to board the plane. This time the flight conditions were a little different and the trip was completed to Newfoundland. The route chosen was the longest ever flown by the captain, being some 1,900 miles; but he said it was necessary to fly within 150 miles of Greenland because of the weather. On arrival at Gander, Newfoundland, coffee and sandwiches were served in one of the hangars. At 8 a.m. the steward guided all the passengers back to the waiting plane. From there the flight by daylight down the Atlantic coast proved very interesting. The captain gave his passengers an opportunity to see from the air Portland, Maine, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Boston, Massachusetts, and Hartford, Connecticut. How good it was to see the unique skyline of New York city once again! The huge plane made a big circle over Astoria, Long Island, and then landed at LaGuardia airfield at 1 p.m. There, to greet the returning president and his secretary, were three brothers from Brooklyn headquarters and a number of Watchtower Bible College graduates. The realization now that their wonderful European journey had been safely and successfully completed filled the hearts of Brothers Knorr and Henschel with deep gratitude and appreciation to Jehovah God for their many blessed experiences and privileges of service. All of us give thanks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">NORTHEASTERN SEABOARD ASSEMBLY AT BALTIMORE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The above-mentioned European trip in ^Jie interests of God’s kingdom furnished the reason for a local assembly at Baltimore, Maryland, on February 8-10, for it was felt appropriate that the Society’s president and his secretary should give a verbal report. A special letter of notification and invitation to a limited number of companies of Jehovah’s witnesses within a radius of several hundred miles thrilled the brethren who were thus favored, but the “grapevine route” reached out to inform others, who availed themselves of the opening to attend. When the president gave his verbal report Saturday night, February 9, about 11,000 were present to hear, to thrill, to have tears well up in their eyes, and to applaud and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">cheer!</span><span class="font5"> The Assembly was’ held in the Fifth Regiment Armory, a spacious place, and complaints by prejudiced and misguided &quot;patriots” failed to budge the military captain from his proper American stand of letting the misrepresented, persecuted witnesses of Jehovah have the use of this adequate facility. In view of the anticipated overflow attendance especially for the public event, the president’s speech on &quot;Be Glad, Ye Nations”, the Lyric Theater just a few blocks away was also engaged, that those there might hear by special telephone line and public-address system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hours of zealous activity day and night for weeks in advance, by more than a hundred Watchtower College graduates and other pioneers, together with the local brethren of the Baltimore company units, laid the foundation for the entertainment of the visiting brethren at one of the most blessed assemblies yet held. Thousands of accommodations were obtained by house-to-house canvassing in the private homes of Baltimoreans; and although hundreds of homes canceled their arrangements the Lord through his servants provided others and the general hospitality of the people of Baltimore was noteworthy. This pre-convention activity was accompanied by the placing of 355 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font5">subscriptions and 1,369 books and 65,793 booklets. Then,’ when this was augmented by the field activities of the three-day Assembly itself, by house-to-house witnessing, store-to-store and sidewalk work with the Society’s magazines, information walking with placards by publishers, and public-lecture handbills, and signs on autos and streetcars and billboards, besides special letter invitations, Baltimore received the greatest barrage of Kingdom witness it has thus far gotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A cafeteria was installed in the basement, center, and all the various service and accommodations booths and counters were arranged round about along the walls; and thousands of collapsible chairs were set up on the parade-floor upstairs of the Armory. Friday morning, February 8, the Armory doors opened wide to the steady influx of conventioners. A morning service meeting, not announced on the program but held for convenience, gave impetus to the day’s activities in the field by the conventioners, pushing the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> campaign. At the convention’s formal opening, at 7 p.m., fully 8,000 were in attendance, and the biggest convention that Baltimore had listed on its schedule of conventions for 1946 was under way. An orchestra, which finally increased to 32 instrumentalists strong, led in all the convention singing of songs of praise to Jehovah and his Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Assembly chairman, Grant Suiter, a Watch Tower Society director, gave a hearty address of welcome to this convocation of ordained ministers of the Kingdom gospel, and particularly dwelt on the theme of their irrevocable consecration to God and their obligation to Him to carry it out. Now followed a series of talks, by E. Keller, a College instructor, on “Preliminary to the Feast”, and by F. W. Franz, a Watchtower director, on “Let Us Keep the Feast”, and by N. H. Knorr on “Keeping the Feast Now”. Besides these treatises, which were published in the March 1 issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> Brother Knorr added an extemporaneous afterspeech on enjoying “holy freedom” by keeping busy in God’s active service and took the conventioners by surprise by introducing and announcing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News </span><span class="font5">No. 15, headed “World Conspiracy Against the Truth”. Station WBBR broadcast part of this session, from 6:45 to 8 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On Saturday, February 9, the convention swelled to an attendance of 10,945. Heartfelt singing, and experience accounts by specially selected Watchtower College graduates from the platform, preceded the afternoon speeches, presented by four organization directors in succession. T. J. Sullivan spoke on &quot;Changed to See God”; Lyman Swingle, on &quot;The Hope of Things Not Seen”; H. C. Covington, on “Perfection”; and F. W. Franz, on “Bringing in Perfection”; all of which presentations have since been published in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> to date. If the conventioners felt richly repaid for coming by the heart-satisfying doctrine they had thus far received, they felt their cup of joy and blessing filled to overflowing after the Saturday evening session. This was the occasion of Brother Knorr’s report. Not only the 11,000 at Baltimore heard this in its fulness, but also about 200 other brethren assembled at Brooklyn headquarters and at Station WBBR by direct landwire. To top off his gripping report, announced on the program as “Organization and Field Work in Europe”, Brother Knorr evoked repeated cheers of delight by announcing to this Baltimore Assembly the arrangements to hold an International Convention, at Cleveland, Ohio, for eight days, to wit, August 4 to 11, inclusive, and with the Society’s bringing over representative brethren from Europe and other parts of the world to serve on the program. Brother Knorr concluded, “Our next stop will be Cleveland!” Small wonder that the parting words between brethren at this local assembly were, “See you at Cleveland.” Till then, all roads lead to Cleveland, and Jehovah’s glad people are planning and working to attend, and pray His blessing upon the convention preparations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sunday, the final day, after several hours of field activity to bring the people of good-will to the afternoon public lecture, the convention renewed its session in the afternoon, with songs, and College graduate reports; and at 2: 30 p.m. came the report “Europe After the War”, by Brother Henschel, to complement Brother Knorr’s report of the night preceding. During this informative talk Station WBBR came on the air at 3 p.m. and from then on broadcast the remainder of the Assembly program. After a short intermission came the intensely advertised public event, the president’s address on “Be Glad, Ye Nations”. The audience of 12,400 overflowed into the Lyric Theater. They listened with unabated interest to Brother Knorr’s forceful delivery which at times aroused to applause, and clapped their hands with an outburst of appreciation at his announcement that the speech was now available for them in print, in the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Be Glad, Ye Nations&quot;,</span><span class="font5"> which he displayed to their bright-flashing eyes; and that a copy would be given to each one present for study with his Bible. A brief closing announcement by the Assembly chairman dismissed the great gathering, and as they left the Armory and the Lyric Theater their eager hands reached out to the distributing ushers for copies. All together, 34,960 copies of this new booklet, fresh off the press, were thus given away gratis at this memorable event in the Lord’s great educational program now on, extending the gracious divine invitation, “Be glad, ye nations, with his people.”</span></p>

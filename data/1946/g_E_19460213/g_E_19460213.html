<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Gets 59 Innocent, Useful Men Fired</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">♦ It takes a peculiar kind of greatness to get fifty-nine innocent, useful men fired off their jobs for no reason at all, but it has been done. In midsummer of 1944, when the United States was needing the services of every man, the Hearst press in California, having done all possible in that part of the world to create antagonism between Japanese-Amerieans and other Americans, sent one of its most efficient troublemakers on to Chicago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Being an expert in that line, he got results right away. When he arrived the Illinois Central railway had 59 Japanese-American track laborers, rendering honest and faithful service. The next day after he arrived, the A. F. of L. Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees began to talk- strike unless these men were chased out of their jobs. On the third day the local Hearst fright began to scream of Japanese dangers in Illinois, using American Legion officials to mouth their hallucinations. On the fourth day the union called its strike meeting, and on the fifth day the United States army, needing to use the railway, asktid the Illinois Central to take these efficient men off their jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In due time the readfirs of the Hearst publications .will understand how they have been hoodwinked, but it sometimes takes many years for truth to come to the front. For instance, the true story of how Chicago’s great fire of 1871 was started was not revealed until 73 years afterwards. Id stead of being begun by Mrs. O’Leary’s cow kicking over a lantern, it was actually started when a group of boys shooting dice overturned the lantern. Being unable to extinguish the blaze which- they had started, they lied it onto the cow. The last one of the boys to die recently told the truth of the story on his deathbed.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>

<p><span class="font2">Persecution in Poland</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A</span><span class="font10">T ELEVEN minutes past five, on the morning of September 1, 1939, Hitler ordered his troops to attack Poland, Seventeen days later, the Russians advanced on a five-hundred-mile front from the east and occupied Poland’s territory east of the Bug river. And on September 28, in less than a month’s time, the Germans entered Warsaw and the conquest was complete. Such is the terse history of Poland’s tragic defeat. The Poles then suffered beneath the double yoke of Nazism and Communism until in June, 1941, the declaration of war on Russia by Germany transformed their country again into a bloody battlefield. Still later, in 1944, the surge of battle once more swept over the country, this time from east to west, as the Russians drove the Nazis back to total defeat. All together, five and a half years of war plowed up Poland, making desolate her cities and people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In addition to all the horrors of war, beaten Poland had to suffer under the oppressive and cruel heel of Nazi conquerors. Not only did they feed themselves off the land, but they also plundered and robbed the country, stripping it of all materials and equipment of any value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Polish Jews Slaughtered</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The “superman” program instituted in Poland, as in all other occupied territory, listed the Jews for extermination. Before the war one-tenth of the population, or about 3,500,000, were of Jewish nationality. A few of these escaped to Siberia, but the great majority suffered a gruesome death in the infamous gas-chambers at Oswiecim and Lublin. The “master plan” calling for a Jew-free Europe by 1946 almost succeeded in Poland ; only a remnant, estimated at 80,000, survived this fiendish mass slaughter. It taxes the imagination to the limit to think of a crime of such magnitude. Over 3,000,000 men, women and children murdered in cold blood!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another policy of the Nazis was that of making the Poles work as slave labor for their war machine. Orders were issued, accompanied with a threat of violence if not complied with, and the people had their choice of either obeying or suffering the consequences. Poles, however, do not make willing slaves. It is against their nature. Many, therefore, openly rebelled against these tyrant methods and brought down the wrath of the Gestapo not only upon their own heads but also upon the heads of their countrymen as well. Privileges were withdrawn; many were arrested, beaten and imprisoned; large groups were rounded up and forcibly deported to Germany; and the general sufferings and hardships of the people were increased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Persecution of Catholics</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The American and British press have published a great deal about the inhuman treatment of Poles by the godless Nazis, claiming that it was a case of religious persecution because such victims were Catholics. There is no denying that these people unjustly suffered many atrocious outrages and indignities. But the question arises: Were they persecuted because they were Catholics or because they were Poles?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Poland, like Ireland, has been so steeped in Catholicism that it may seem to some almost impossible to distinguish between their national patriotism and their religious fervor. But if an overall jview of the matter is taken.it will help to answer the question. Consider how the Nazis treated other Catholic countries that they took over. Austria, Hungary and Slovakia were all Catholic countries, as well as Belgium and France in<sub>:</sub> the west. But were these people persecuted like the Poles? The reports of the press indicate that they were not. The conclusion must be drawn, then, that the Polish people were not persecuted because they were Catholics but because they were Poles. They w’ere not persecuted because they were Catholics, but, rather, in spite of it. This opinion is also shared by others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That H ill cPs violent destruction of Poland had nothing to do with Poland's Catholicism as such is seen from his entirely different treatment of other Catholic nations such as Slovakia (whose president is a Catholic monsignor) and Hungary. It is clear that he would have treated the Poles in the same way whether they were Orthodox Catholics or Mohammedans. He persecutes the Poles not because they are Catholics, but because they are Poles; he persecutes them not because of their Catholicism but in spite of it.—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Converted Catholic,,</span><span class="font8"> April, 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Never-changing Church” Changes</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At the beginning of the war the Hierarchy openly admitted its intimacy and close relationship with the Fascist-Nazi beast. Thus we read in the New' York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font10"> in 1939:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Catholic bishops of Germany have issued a pastoral letter stating: ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“In this decisive hour we admonish our Catholic soldiers to do their duty in obedience to the Fuehrer and be ready to sacrifice' their whole individuality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“We appeal to the faithful to join in ardent prayers that the; Divine Providence of God Almighty may lead this war to blessed success and peace for our fatherland and nation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The archangel is shown, brandishing a battlesword and piercing a dragon with a holy lance, on the front page of Catholic papers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And a dispatch from Vatican City, in the same year, sent after Germany and Russia had split Poland between them, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The church under the present Pope has no fight against totalitarianism as such and its relations with totalitarian Italy are currently good. [ Baltimore Sun]</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But when the totalitarian war monster began losing ground the Roman Catholic Hierarchy endeavored to cover up her illicit relationship with Fascism and Nazism. So the fusion, or rather confusion, in the minds of the general public on the subject of Polish nationalism and Catholicism served the Vatican’s purpose very well. The Catholic press in the western democracies seized upon Poland’s fate and wept that it was a persecution of the “Church” by the Nazis. And the simple and ignorant were moved by these artificial tears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">However, well-informed individuals knew of the close alliance between the Catholic Church and the Nazis. They recollected that Hitler had signed a concordat or secret agreement with the Vatican. They remembered that when the Nazis marched into Austria Cardinal Innitzcr was the first to congratulate Hitler, while at the same time the sw<sup>T</sup>astika was flown atop the Catholic cathedrals. They recalled how the Catholic priest, Tiso, of Slovakia had been made head of that puppet state by </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">Hi</span><span class="font10">tler. They knew also that Catholic Petain, whom the pope called “the good marshal’’, was put at the head of Vichy France by the Nazis. They had not forgotten either how King Leopold of Belgium, because he was a devout Catholic, had betrayed his country to the Nazis. Yes, wide-awake and thinking people were not deceived by the weeping and wailing of the Hierarchy that their church was being persecuted by the Hitlerites in Poland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another pin was stuck in the Vatican’s Western propaganda balloon when two nuns in New York spoke out of turn. They had just returned from Poland after living there under the Nazi occupation for some time, and hence were ignorant that they were letting this “persecution” gas, generated by the American Hierarchy, out of the bag. When interviewed upon their arrival in New York they innocently told the truth of <sub>t</sub> matters as they had experienced them. Their story revealed that the Nazis, while inflicting great suffering on the Polish people, were at the same time very careful to protect the official Catholic Church. Says the New York Times (February 10, 1940):</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Two American nuns of the Franciscan Order returned to the United States yesterday aboard the Italian motorship Saturnia with praise for the German behavior toward their convent near Warsaw during the occupation of Poland. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The German troops, mostly men from Bavaria and the Austrian Provinces, were “very nice”, Sister Bogumila asserted, brought wounded .and orphan children to the convent for care . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">German soldiers and officers, Sister Bogumila said, helped the sisters to obtain food. The Germans, she added, made the convent staff headquarters, but took nothing from the premises except some food, for which they paid. Stores of coal were untouched. <sub>;</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I can’t exaggerate in saying how nice the German soldiers were to us,” she said. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cardinal Hlond “Persecuted”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some will recall reading about the arrests of Catholic priests, and especially about the disappearance of Cardinal Hlond, of Poland. At the time a great cry'went up about the “terrible persecution” of the Church. Much space was taken up in the public press telling of the “grave concern” expressed by the Vatican and members of the Hierarchy over the incident. Surely this was an outstanding example of Catholic persecution! said the papists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At the time the whole matter was shrouded in mystery. Not until the year 1945 did the world learn that the story about the cardinal’s suffering at the • hands of the brutal Nazis was a hoax. The Chicago </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Sun,</span><span class="font10"> April 9, 1.945, after telling how Hlond went to Rome in 1939, and later to France, where he lived far away from all the horrors of war that , were ravaging his own country, continues and says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He remained for a few months in Lourdes with the Bishop of Tarbes and was then interned by the Nazis in a Benedictine monastery in the Haute Savoie. Subsequently he was removed to Paris and then to Germany, where he lived in the convent of the Sisters of Christian Charity at Wicdenbrueck.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It was here that the Allies found him living on Easter day. When asked concerning all those “terrible” things the press had said he suffered under the Gestapo, the cardinal answered, as reported by the Chicago </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Sun,</span><span class="font10"> “Those little personal things are unimportant.” And they must have been, for, instead of finding him weak from starvation, suffering malnutrition, emaciated and beaten like the other prisoners of the Nazis, it is said by the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font10"> “The Primate appeared in excellent spirits and fine health.” And all along the world had been led to believe that Hlond was suffering the tortures of a concentration camp. Instead, this “redcap” was enjoying the benefits of a Benedictine monastery and the comforts of a convent!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And why did the Nazis hold this prince of the church in protective custody?; Was it to persecute him or his church? “Polish sources asserted that he was one of the most important hostages held by the Germans, and that they had hoped to use him and others, such as King Leopold of the Belgians, in a human ‘horse trade’ for the lives of Nazi</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">leaders.” (New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font10"> April 9, 1945) All facts considered, it is absolutely certain that the Hitler government did not hold Hlond because of any quarrel with the Church of Rome; they were nTerely shrewd “horse traders” and knew a good one when they saw it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ersecution of Christians</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We have learned of the persecution of</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19460213_files/g_E_19460213-2.png" alt="" style="width:12pt;height:17pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">Jews in Poland. And we have heard of the persecution of Catholics. But have we ever heard of the persecution of Christians in that country? What? are not devout religious Catholics'the same as Christians? No; there is a great difference between the two. It goes without ■ saying, and will not be disputed by anyone, that the Catholic Church is very much a part of this old world of politics, commerce and religion. The ambassadors and diplomats of the various political nations of this world are officially assigned to the Vatican court, and in exchange papal nuncios and prelates are sent as political emissaries of the “Church” to practically every country. Devout Catholics approve of such a system and give it their whole support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On the other hand, Christians'are followers of Christ Jesus, who said, “My kingdom is not of this world.” (John 18:36) Furthermore, He tells true Christians that they are to be no part of this old Satanic world, and for such reason they would be persecuted and hated by it. He says: “If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.” (John 15:19) Unpretentiously these Christians go throughout all nations preaching, as commanded, “The kingdom of heaven is at hand.” And because they testify to this fact they are known as Jehovah’s ' witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The public press being part and parcel of this present evil world, it is not surprising to find that it overlooked and ignored the persecution of these faithful Christian^ in Poland. Nevertheless, the population of Poland was aware of the wicked mistreatment endured by ‘ this small minority, and now others may learn of this from some of the eyewitness reports received from these witnesses themselves. Christians in that country were afflicted and tormented by the demonized Nazis because they were announcing- the establishment of God’s government, and because they refused to give up such important work in order to work for the totalitarians. One report reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One of the Warsaw brethren who was ordered to dig went to the German police and told them that he could not do so. The police commissioner would not listen. He ordered him to report and told him that when he got before the Gorman officer he would change his mind. The brother appeared for work and told the German officer that for conscience’ sake he could not do the work, and gave him a witness. The officer took his revolver and pointed it at his head. The brother made a motion with his index finger across his throat as if to say, “1 am ready.” (Hp could not speak German and needed an interpreter.) Then the German officer put his revolver away and said to the Polish policeman not to send him people like that any more. The brother was released. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another report from the witnesses living in the vicinity of the Bug river tells of a similar experience:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the spring of 1944, the Germans started to prepare the defense line along the Bug river and all families were requested to work. When one of our brethren in the village on the Bug told the commander that he could not do such work, be was told he would be shot. And to give effect to the threat, anti to make an example, the brother w<sup>f</sup>as placed on a raised stand to be seen by everybody. The officer now took his revolver and aimed it at him. The brother was quiet, commending his spirit to the Lord. The officer, finding that he could get nowhere in this manner, tried to talk to him. But in this way neither could he get anywhere. Then he realized that the brother had some buttered bread in his pocket and he told him to go ahead and eat it. The brother said, “There is no good reason to do so, for I’m going to be shot.” This stand amazed everyone. It was a great witness before all neighbors and friends who lived in the neighborhood of the brother and had heard him often on other occasions proclaim the Kingdom. But now they saw </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">tin act. </span><span class="font8">All those who claimed to be good Christians (Catholics) had not the courage to take such a stand. The commander told the brother, “There are many like you in Germany and they are for a long time in concentration camps.” Then he ordered that the brother be locked up in a barn to remain until the evening to make a decision. And if he did not decide to dig, then he would be shot. When evening came, they called the brother out of the barn. “Will you dig?” they asked. “No,” was the answer, “I cannot be unfaithful unto God.” Then he was released to go home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Women Forced to Dig Trenches</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Nazi war lords regimented Polish women as well as men and boys to dig their trenches for them. This meant that the faithful sisters of the Lord Jesus Christ had to risk their lives like the brothers in taking an open stand for God and His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When this question of digging trenches came up one of the sisters had to report at a certain place. There she declared that she was one of Jehovah’s witnesses and could not' dig any trenches. Without consideration, they ordered her to accompany the others in a ear. They arrived at a section where the commander was a uniformed member of the Party. He tried to force the sister to dig. She again stated that she was decoded not to do it, and gave him a witness. The two or three hundred people who were there, mostly neighbors and relatives of the sister, and knowing her to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses, took the side of the occupation forces. They cried, “We all have to dig. Why should she, with her heresy faith, not do the same ?” Others cried, “Communist! Shoot her!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Here is an example of Polish Catholics digging ditches for the Nazis and muttering that they were being perse^-cuted thereby; while at the same time, observing the faithful course of a true Christian in their midst, they cried, “'Communist! Crucify her!” exactly like the hypocritical religionists of Jesus’ day. It is very evident which ones were the bogus Christians. Continuing, this report says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The commander sought to reason with her again. When even this didn’t shake her determination, the commander ordered her to go to a haystack and he would shoot her in the back. He loaded his gun. She did as commanded. But when she heard him loading the gun she turned around and said, “You can shoot me from the front.” That was too much for the people. Instead of doing as they intended, they ordered her to sit beside a man near by and wait. From then until evening the sistey looked on while the “Christians” dug trenches. The German officer told the Polish bailiff not to send him any more people like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Previous to this incident, the report says, this particular sister had spent some time in jail because a Catholic priest had denounced her. Which brings us to the discussion of a very interesting point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Catholics Persecute Christians</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Why would Catholics, and especially the priests, persecute Christians? Did Christ ever stir up mob action, or was it the religious Pharisees and priests? Did Christ charge the religionists as being seditious against-Caesar, or did the chief priests make sudh a wrongful charge against Christ? Did Christ betray anyone to the secular authorities, or was that Judas? If you are in doubt as to the answers to any of these questions you may look them up. (Matthew 26:65-68; Luke23:2-5; John 19:6,12,15; Matthew 26:14-16,47-49) Likewise, in these last days, it was the priests of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in Poland, as in other countries, that instigated mob violence and wickedly laid the charge oh sedition against faithful Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Catholic mobs broke up and destroyed . the homes of Jehovah’s witnesses and beat them unmercifully. Catholic priests maliciously' lied to the Nazis that these _ Christians were connected with the underground movement. While at the same time in America and Britain the Harlot - Press bawled about the persecution of</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Catholic priests in Poland!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the larger centers Jehovah’s witnesses suffered mostly under the Nazi cudgel, but in the rural districts the tormentors were mainly' their own countrymen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Here the persecutions were predominantly made by the strong conservative elements of . the fanatic, superstitious, Catholic population, led by the clergy. In accordance with Catholic Action they organized regular gangs which broke into the homes of the brethren, maltreated them terribly, and tried to force them to deny their faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the district of Lublin lived a sister with her family. Her husband was favor/ able to the truth but did not claim to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses. One day an armed gang of Catholic men forced entrance to their home. After cruelly mistreating this man they' forced him to swear that he would deny the teachings of Jehovah’s witnesses as heresy and avoid them. Also that he would hang up on the walls pictures of “saints” and worship them. Then the demonized gang completely demolished the inside of the home, and, upon leaving, threatened him that if he did not comply' with their orders they' would return and kill him. The result of such &quot;Catholic Action was that the man had his ey<sup>r</sup>es opened to the fact that religion is of the Devil. So he made . a full consecration to the Lord to be a faithful Christian henceforth, cost what it might in persecution and suffering. When the Catholic mobsters returned the second time they tortured him unmercifully' in the most inhuman way, believing that they could bend him as they had done the first time; yet to no avail. He remained unshaken, and it resulted in a powerful witness. Says the report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Similar cases happened often in that region.They came and hung up some crucifixes and pictures of saints on the walls of the brethren’s homes and tried through whipping to force them to worship the images. The demonized members of Catholic Action came again and again. When they saw that the idols were removed, they ill-treated the brothers and sisters with the most bestial brutality. They' called them Jews, ordered them to pray and worship pictures of their family that were hanging on the walls. Often the brethren recognized .among those who ill-treated them some people from neighboring villages. Yet they did not try to revenge themselves. They left it to the Lord, who says: “Vengeance is mine, and recompense.” (Deuteronomy 32:35, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Sta-n. Ver.)</span><span class="font8"> On one occasion a detachment of Polish soldiers of the Partisans, that was encamped in a near-by forest, saw the demolished home of a brother, and, hearing about those crimes, the officers wanted to know w'ho were the guilty' ones so that they could be found and shot. But the brother, although he knew them, did not deliver them up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ Besides bringing mob action to bear against Jehovah’s witnesses in Poland the clergy' made false accusations before the Nazis against the brethren, and caused them to suffer even death. To cite one such instance:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">- In May, 1944, two brethren from the neighborhood of Myslcnice were arrested and tak-■ cn down to the prison of Cracow. They were arrested because of a charge that had been made by' a strong Catholic section in their home town, of which the spiritual leader was the Catholic priest. The claim was that they belonged to the secret'home army (A.K. Polish Resistance Movement) and that they' had arms in their possession. It was well known throughout the town that this was a calumny. The brethren were, since 1941, known as Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the beginning of the war, when they did not know the truth, they' had belonged to that movement and at that time they' had the favor of their present Catholic denouncers. But when they recognized the truth, in 1941, they' gave up everything and from that time on they hair no more arms. This was the circumstance that caused the enmity of the leaders of the town, the Catholic-controlled nationalists and, above all, the clergy, who were not ashamed to deliver their own Polish people to the hated occupation army, and accuse them of something that they themselves approved. The two brethren were later sent to the concentration camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Many Christians Were Shot</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The course of least resistance is to go along with the world and comply with all of their rules and regulations whether such are right or wrong, whether they violate God’s law or not. This is the course that all religionists take. Christians, on the other hand, are commanded to obey God’s supreme law at all'times regardless of what it requires of them ■in the way of suffering. Were such not told by Christ that they would experience the^e things at the hands of Satan’s tools? Did He not tell them that some of them would be killed? (See Matthew 10:16-18; 24:9,10.) The following experiences, then, do not shake the faith of Jehovah’s witnesses, but rather give assurance to all that there are still faithful and true Christians in the world that are not afraid to die as martyrs, if need be, to maintain their integrity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Two brethren from Kielce (30 and 24 years old), hardly two months in the truth, were assigned to dig trenches. After they refused to dig and explained their reason, they were shot immediately as an example to the others. In another village in the neighborhood of Miediow the district bailiff, with the help of Polish police, gathered the people to dig trenches. But the work entrusted to him by the occupation government had many difficulties because the people did not willingly listen to his orders. One day the state police appeared in the village to oversee the execution of the orders. The bailiff wanted to frighten the brethren. So he called, without orders of the state police, a brother and his wife to appear before the state police. The two came immediately and declared that they could not dig because they were Jehovah's witnesses, and they gave him a witness. The state policeman, not understanding what was going on, felt himself threatened and shot both of them on the spot with his M.P. revolver. All the neighbors of the village and all around were very much disturbed through this event and confessed that those people lost their lives innocently and for their faith. The bailiff felt himself responsible for the death of the brother and sister. They left a few children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Shortly there came news from Breslau that an older brother and sister refused to do some digging and were shot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Not all of Jehovah’s witnesses were shot. But nearly all those that came through alive can tell of narrow escapes from many perils. Even in the eastern territories of Poland from 1939 to 1941, under Russian control, the brethren also had a hard fight to maintain their integrity, One report from this section says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The brethren had severe tests when they refused to do military service. For instance, one brother they tried to force by all means. First they talked to him, then there were whippings and threats to shoot him. The Russian officer could not understand his position. Finally, when the officer saw he could not change the opinion of the brother, he concluded to let him go free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After a short time when the Russians were pushed back by the Nazis it happened that the people shot at the Russian soldiers out of the windows. Immediately the house was surrounded and the inhabitants, among whom was a brother, had to line up in the street to be shot. An angry officer reviewed them. When he saw the brother, he suddenly stopped, and said, “This one did not shoot.” It was the same officer before whom the brother refused military service. The brother was allowed to leave, and so escaped death. All the rest were shot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Priest’s “Blessing” Turned into a Curse</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font8">young sister, carrying food from the country to a town, was taken with a whole trainload of passengers. They were locked in </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">building which was closely watched, biit</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">where she naturally fulfilled her duty as a witness of Jehovah, and eagerly told of the Kingdom . . . Two days later she was carried to the station with a company Of others glosely guarded, and all were to be sent to Germany as forced labor. A Catholic priest came to “bless” and “comfort” them and en-&gt; courage them to do their duty to the “higher j powers”. The sister, with her Bible under her arm, stood on one side. Being asked of the priest whether she didn’t want his blessing, she replied that she had her Bible and that was quite sufficient for her. In the last moment before the train left, in a second, she managed to slip away despite the closest vigilance of the guards. Full of joy she came home to her grieving family, who then wept tears of joy and thanked Jehovah for Uis goodness and mercy. [ From the lieport on Poland, taken-from the 1946 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah's witnesses]</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Does it seem strange that a Catholic priest was out “blessing” and encouraging poor Polish Catholics to work as slave labor for tlje Nazi wa?' machine? No, it was not strange at all; for the truth of the matter is that the Catholic Church worked hand in glove with the Nazi slave-drivers. This is just anothef evidence of it. But -what might seem strange to some is the fact that the girl who disdainfully refused this priest’s “blessing” was the only one reported to have escaped from that slave transport while those who were “blessed” by that agent of the pope perhaps never returned alive. However, this should not seem strange either; for that girl with Bible in hand ‘put not her trust in priests and princes’, but in the Almighty One whom she served, namely, Jehovah God.—-Psalm 146: 3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another instance of the futility of putting one’s hope and trust in religion and its idolatry to save one in a time of dire need is the following taken from an eyewitness account of the Warsaw' revolt </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">in</span><span class="font10"> ] 944. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;।</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the beginning of the revolution the city was mostly under the control of the revolutionary.- But when the help expected by the Russians failed; the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">SS </span><span class="font8">troops fighting against the revolutionary encircled.them. After </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">few days the revolutionary were pushed back. Now began a “cleanup” job by the support troops of the German army, those renowned for their murder lust. The civilian population was shot down in the beginning, and their houses set afire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On order of the pope there was erected in each courtyard an altar before which the household gathered themselves daily to pray for peace (already before the revolution started). And now you saw the people near to desperation and insanity. They pulled out their hair and cried to God for help. Others spit on the altar and blasphemed their god who had left them. Others kneeled down before it and stupidly mumbled the rosary. With all this were mixed' the wild cries of the enclosing cleanup troops. The crack of the revolvers of the M.P.’s and the cries and howls of the helpless women and children filled the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">During this revolt thousands perished. All their rosaries, altars and priests, though they were sanctified with “holy water” and “Hail Marys”, were of no avail. Their god of religion was of no account; it had failed them. But let us here again remember that they suffered these things not because they were 'Catholics, but rather in spite of it, and because they had revolted against the Nazi rule, which rule had the pope’s blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Continued Persecution Since the</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> IFar</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When Hitler and his gang passed out of the picture it was expected that persecution in Poland would cease. Yet reports continue to tell of anti-Semitism still flourishing in Poland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">November 26, 1945—Representative Samuel Diekstein, Democrat, of New York, said today that he had received what he believed to be authoritative evidence that Jews now being repatriated to Poland are currently becoming “the object of vicious and unprovoked maltreatment and in many cases have .been massacred or threatened with death”. He blamed the Poles for this “outbreak of antiSemitism”. [New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times] ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now; who are the ones doing the persecuting this time? It is not the Germans, but the Poles themselves. And if Poles, then Catholies: Catholics carrying on an anti-Semitic campaign of persecution the same as the Nazis. No wonder the seventy Jewish delegates that called on the pope, November 29, were disappointed when they asked for relief and were callously told, as reported, that he could not intervene in matters that were “purely political and territorial” in nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But the cry of persecution of Jews today in Poland is drowned out by the loud and persistent sobbing of the press about “persecution” of the Catholic Church. Following the Yalta conference there has been a concerted and well-organized effort made to discredit the present Polish government. This has been called by some the “poor little Pound” campaign, and, because it has been so well rehearsed, this lamentation has» lost its ring of sincerity. To quote one stanza of the dirge:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Scoring the treatment of Poland by the Lublin government as a “violation of the laws of man and God” and a threat to .“America’s honor”, the Association of Homan Catholic Priests of Polish Descent in the Springfield Diocese today issued a statement signed by forty-three priests. [New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font8"> February 8, 1945]</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In direct contradiction, Boleslaw Bierut, acting president of the Lublin government, issued tills statement (same date, same paper): “ 'Full religious freedom will be given to Roman Catholics in Poland and to all other groups,’ Bierut stated in an interview.” So, then, the “persecution” of the Catholic Church must be that referred to in the statement about religious freedom being extended “to all other groups” as well as the Roman variety. Ah, yes, where education rules ignorance suffers; where freedom of worship reigns the “Church” is “persecuted”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some may object to the citing of Bie-</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FKBRUARY 13, 1946 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">rut on the question of Catholic freedom in Poland, on the ground that he is connected with the Lublin government. If so, then we must call in the testimony of a neutral observer, Mr. W. H. Lawrence, a well-known correspondent of the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times.</span><span class="font10"> Being in Poland at the time and having a first-hand knowledge of the matter, he wired the following, on January 9, 1945:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">First of all, in dealing with the Roman Catholic Church the government has been meticulously and scrupulously correct. Church leaders with whom I have talked assure me that they have complete liberty of religious education, religious services and church administration, although the last problem naturally is somewhat complicated by wartime transport and communications difficulties ... In rewoonig Peasant party supporters of the division of landed estates the Polish Committee of National Liberation was careful to exclude the large properties owned by the church. This policy will be continued by the new Provisional Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">More “Persecution” of Catholics</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another charge made to support the false claim that Catholics were persecuted was that relief supplies sent to Poland never reached Catholics. Irving Brant, however, writing in the Chicago </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Sun</span><span class="font10"> (November 12, 1945), makes this deliberate misrepresentation look rather silly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Among the falsehoods which some antigovernment Poles attempt to plant on American newspapermen is one that UNRRA’s medicines go only to members of the Workers Party, and, especially, not to Catholics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This statement Is nonsensical because no medicines go to individuals and nearly all Poles are Catholics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Medical supplies are distributed in two categorics—first to hospitals, health centers and the army medical department, and then to pharmacies for general sale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To cheek further on this matter, I went to the pharmaceutical division of the ministry of health and asked to see individual order</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">sheets, showing the distribution of UNRRA medicines .from warehouses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If they are going to the Workers Party and not to Catholics, the Communists must be _ adopting strange names. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Records showed shipments of medicine, beds, mattresses and the like to such institutions as the Asylum of the Holy Virgin, the Asylum of God’s Providence, the Asylum of the Immaculate Sisters—all of Warsaw— and to the hospitals of St. Peter at Grojee, <sub>(</sub> St. Charles at Pulawy, St. Lazarza at Krakow, St. Vincent and Paolo at Lublin, and Jesus Hospital in Warsaw.-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At the same time the Catholic press was bewailing the so-called ‘mistreatment of the Church’ their agencies started a similar sympathy campaign in the United States Senate in an effort .to force^the American government into the Polish controversy on the- side of the “Church”. However, the cry for “democracy” in Poland by these senators was not well taken in the light of Poland’s fascist rule before the war. The copyrighted weekly newsletter </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">In Fact, </span><span class="font10">April 30, 1945, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The sudden Congressional converts to “democracy” in Poland including Bushfield, Vandenberg, Wheeler, O’Konski, Butler, et al., are completely silent about the fact that there was no trace of democracy in Poland during most of the past 25 years. Not one of these politicians has ever risen on the floor of the Senate to protest the fascist regime established by Pilsudski and continued by various premiers, or national Polish anti-Semitism, or the 32 Polish families who controlled 90 percent of the land and wealth of Poland and who used Polish workers as serfs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This Pilsudski was a fascist dictator of Poland from 1926 to 1935. He gained his rulership not by peaceful democratic election but by a coup d’etat. On May 12, 1926, he entered Warsaw at the head of his troops and seized the reins of government. Under his rule the Catholic church flourished, the people suffered, and Rome was happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Polish Concordat Severed *</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On February 10, 1925, a concordat, or working contract,. went into effect between the See of Rome and Poland. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Britannica,</span><span class="font10"> speaking of the strangle hold the Hierarchy gained on the people’s freedom, yea, on their very life through this agreement, says: “The Catholic Church was granted absolute freedom of execution of her authority and jurisdiction in Poland; the assistance and support, of the state being assured her in this respect.” It was of no small importance, then, when on September!, 1945, fifteen out of the nineteen Cabinet ministers of Poland voted in favor of denouncing this twentyyear concordat, thus bringing it to an end. For the church this was another great calamity added atop all the others. It would be expected that the howl of “persecution” would go up with, an even greater volume as a result of such action. And so it did. Members of the Hierarchy blasted forth that it was an “antireligious act”. Later they tried to comfort themselves by saying that the Polish Provisional Government was only a puppet government and hence did not represent the Polish people, and, therefore, the concordat could not be annulled. Maybe such stupid reasoning gave the trepidating ecclesiastics a little consolation, the poor fellows 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All of this was merely the rise of Catholic Action foam in the Polish pot due to the cancellation of the concordat. But what was the reason, at the bottom that caused the termination? The Polish government explained that the concordat was discontinued because the Vatican had'violated certain of its Articles in that they worked with the Nazis in appointing </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">German</span><span class="font10"> bishops and archbishops to Polish dioceses. More evidence, you will note, of the close accord between the Hitler government and the Vatican.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Poland’s Break for Freedom</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Poland’s foreign minister, Rzymowski, •</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">elucidated further on the matter of persecution of the Catholic church in Poland when he was in America recently to sign the United Nations Charter. Quoting the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font10"> (October 25):</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Poland’s Provisional Government of National Unity aims to Westernize rather than to Sovietize its shattered land, Wincenty Rzymowski, minister of foreign affairs in the Warsaw government, declared here yesterday. ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As far as the domestic program of the provisional regime is concerned, Mr. Rzymow-ski declared that “essential liberties” granted in many other countries more than 100 years </span><span class="font7">ago </span><span class="font8">were being “introduced just now” in Poland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In 1939, he recalled there was no freedom of religion, for example, because all other faiths were “stamped out” by the “ruling Catholic Church”. Besides religious liberty (a decree making anti-Semitism a criminal offense is now being formulated) the foreign , minister said that free education, abolition of class distinctions and improvement of the general standard of living were on his government’s program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Already huge estates have been divided among thousands of peasants, with individual ownership of the land the basis for a nonCommunist economy, Mr. Rzymowski asserted. As further evidence that Communism was being held in check, he cited government encouragement of private and co-operative trade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Freedom .of the press has been assured in Poland except in cases where it has been necessary to destroy Fascist remnants, he held. “The Polish government is firm in its decision to uproot these reminders,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Rzymowski asserted that as many foreign correspondents as possible, “the more the better,” will be welcomed in Poland and permitted to gather news with “really no restrictions”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This statement about freedom of the press and the suppression of fascist publications may explain why the Polish Catholic, press has not<sub>&gt;</sub> “recuperated”. The Catholic paper </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Denver Register </span><span class="font10">lists this as an evidence of “persecution” of the “Church”. It says (September 11): “The once vigorous Polish Catholic press has not recuperated, although some weeklies are allowed to publish discussions of purely religious matters.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But is it persecution to give to the Polish people the liberties enjoyed by Western democracies? Is it persecution to break the shackles that have bound Poland hand and foot? Is it persecution to dissolve the union of Church and state in order that freedom of worship for all may be established? In answer to these questions the Hierarchy will moan, ‘Yes, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">persecution.’</span><span class="font10"> Liberty-loving Poles, however, will rejoice to learn of this break for freedom, the first in a hundred years I</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Freedom from Persecution—When?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">While the breaking of the concordat is a long step in uprooting persecution in Poland, one wonders to what extent the new Provisional Government will succeed in preventing future assaults on individuals and their property. Jews may expect some relief from mistreatment if the government is powerful enough to enforce its legislation on antiSemitism. But, at the best, such relief is only transitory. Complete freedom from fear must come from an eternal source of power and justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The severance of the concordat was a relief measure for even the Catholic population themselves in Poland. For beneath the crushing burden of Church and state for many years the people were ground down to poverty. Now the suffering of honest Polish Catholics due to ignorance and superstition will be alleviated in proportion to the knowledge of the truth they receive as contained in the Bible. For Christ says to such: “The truth shall make you free.” (John 8:32) However, to the extent that this liberation from religious bond-, age and fear is given to the Polish people, even to that degree may we expect the Hierarchy to weep and howh that</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ their church is being persecuted. And we have it on the best authority that such will be the case. God Almighty says by His prophet Jeremiah (25:36), “A _ voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an . howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the Lord hath spoiled *■ their pasture.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As long as this old world under Satan’s rule continues Jehovah’s witnesses do not expect freedom from persecution, notwithstanding the mighty claims of men to outlaw the same. The only hope of relief for these Christians is in the Theocratic Government, under Christ as King. Hence these witnesses will continue to act as its ambassadors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Freedom in its largest degree, not only from persecution but from all other evils, will come when thi$ Theocratic Government dashes to pieces every vestige of Satan’s demonic organization. Thereafter Poles, whether they now are called Jews,' Catholics or Christians, if they love righteousness and meekness, will live in that New World of peace and perfection without fear from any quarter.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Spiritistic Phenomena of the Early Nineteenth Century</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font10">HE following is taken from </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Historical Collections of the Great West; </span><span class="font10">by Henry Howe, author of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Historical Collections of Virginia and Ohio,”</span><span class="font10"> Vol. 1, published by Henry Howe at E. Morgan &amp;&nbsp;Co., Ill Main street, Cincinnati, Ohio, 1854:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Aboqt the commencement of the present century, the religious' meetings of the west were attended by singular mental and physical phenomena, resembling somewhat in some of their phases the mesmeric phenomena of our day. They were not exclusively confined to any one denomination, or those who have been considered the most excitable and enthusiastic, for even the phlegmatic New England Presbyterians of the reserve came under their influence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They, however, exhibited themselves with greater power at the earlier forest gatherings of the Methodists. On those occasions the feelings and mental exercises were contagious, and often spread like an epidemic through a congregation, hundreds being smitten down. They could not be accounted for by any known laws of our mental organization, and therefore were, mostly ascribed to a supernatural agency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font8">clerical writer classifies their different manifestations respectively as “the falling”, <sub>(</sub> “the jerking,” “the rolling,” “the dancing,” and “the barking” exercises together with “visions and trances”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The last named was the most common affection. In this the subject was thrown into a state of ecstasy of mental reverie, attended with the loss of all muscular power and consciousness of external relations or objects, similar to a protracted catalepsy. Yet the mind appeared wholly absorbed in delightful contemplations, which often lightened up the countenance with a rapturous, angelie expression. This condition continued from a few hours to two days, during which there was an entire suspension of all the animal and voluntary functions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The most singular and alarming of those affections was the jerking exercise, which, although common to both sexes, was more frequent in vigorous athletic men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The first recorded instance of its occurrence was at a sacrament in east Tennessee, when several hundred of both sexes were seized with this strange and involuntary contortion. The subject was instantaneously seized with spasms or convulsions in every muscle, nerve and tendon. His head was thrown or jerked from side to side with such rapidity that it was impossible to distinguish his visage, and the most lively fears were awakened lest he should dislocate his neck or dash out his brains. His body partook of the same impulse and was hurried on by like jerks over every obstacle, fallen trunks of trees, or, in </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">church, over pews and benches, apparently to the most imminent danger of being bruised and</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">manglgd. It was useless to attempt to hold or restrain him, and the paroxysm was permitted gradually to exhaust itself. An additional motive for leaving him to himkelf was the ■ superstitious notion that all attempt at restraint was resisting the spirit of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The first form in which these spasmodic contortions made their appearance was that of a simple jerking of the arms from the elbows downward. The jerk was very quick and sudden, and followed with short inter- vals. This was the simplest and most common form, but the convulsive motion was not confined to the arms; it extended in many instances to other part? of the liody. When the joint of the neek was affected, the head was thrown backward and forward with a celerity frigiitful to behold, and which was impossible to be imitated by persons who were not under the same stimulus. The bosom heaved, the countenance was disgustingly distorted, and the spectators were alarmed lest the neck should be broken. When the hair was long it was' shaken with quickness, backward and forward, as to crack and snap like the lash of a whip, so as to be heard twenty feet. Sometimes the muscles of the back were affected, and the patient was thrown to the' ground, when his contortions for some time resembled those of a live fish cast, from its native element on the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From the universal testimony of those who have described these spasms, they appear to be wholly involuntary. This remark is applicable also to all the other bodily exercises. What demonstrates satisfactorily their involuntary nature is, not only that, as above stated, the twitches prevailed in spite of resistance, and even more for attempts to suppress them; but that wicked men would be seized with them while sedulously guarding against an attack, and cursing every jerk when made. Travelers on their journey and laborers at their daily work were also liable to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Not a Trinitarian God-Man</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">S</span><span class="font10">AYS a popular &quot;Roman Catholic book on doctrine*: “Tn this one God there are three distinct Persons,—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, who are perfectly equal to each other. We believe that Jesus Christ, the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity, is perfect God and perfect Man.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">However, at Paul’s first epistle to Timothy, chapter two, verses five and six, of the Catholic </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Douay Version</span><span class="font10"> Bible, it is written: “For there is one God, and one mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus: who gave himself a redemption for all, a testimony in due times.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The “redemption” here mentioned means “ransom” or an exactly corresponding price, and means therefore that the life of Jesus on earth was the exact equivalent of that perfect human life which Adam had in Eden but which he forfeited for himself and for all his • offspring by disobeying God’s express command. In the scale of values, therefore, Jesus’ earthly life must weigh the equal of the perfect Adam’s. “A perfect and just weight shalt thou have; a perfect and just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be long in the land which Jehovah thy God give th thee,” said the prophet Moses to God’s chosen people. (Deuteronomy 25: 15, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font10"> However, if Jesus at the time He ■was on earth and at the time He died w<sup>T</sup>as God himself or w’as equal to Jehovah God the Supreme One, then Jesus was more than a perfect man and weighed</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">* The Faith of Our Fathers,</span><span class="font8"> by Cardinal Gibbons, page 17, Ed. 47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">more in value than Adam and His life w’as more than a corresponding price. In that case Jehovah God would be requiring more than a just measure to provide a “redemption” for Adam’s dying offspring. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hefc the “cloven hoof” of religion’s author, Satan the Devil, is made apparent. By the deceiver’s making it appear that Jesus was God or God’s equal,' then the reasonable mind must conclude that Jesus’ prayers and cries to God were a camouflage and that His life laid down in death was not reduced in the scales of justice to provide a ransom or redemption. Therefore this -whole trinitarian doctrinal scheme is unworthy of the consideration of a true God-fearing man. In view<sup>7</sup> of the Bible statement that Satan, “the god of this world,” blinds the minds of men lest God’s glorious purpose should shine into their minds, it seems strange that men continue to let the religious clergy deceive them by such an unreasonable doctrine as that of the trinity.—2 Corinthians 4: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Bible truth is that, when Jesus was on earth, He was a perfect man, nothing more and nothing less, He having laid aside His heavenly life and glory and become poor comparatively as a man. (Philippians 2:5-8; 2 Corinthians 8: 9) Of all the names kndwn to history, Jesus of Nazareth is the outstanding one. In the brief period of thirty-three and a half years of &quot;His earthly pilgrimage He affected the course of humankind more than any other man. The more intelligent people of the nations of the earth count their years according to the birth of Jesus. The record of this truly great man is found in the Holy Scriptures. God through His prophets foretold the birth of this mighty one. (See Genesis 49:10; Deuteronomy 18:15-18; Isaiah 9:6,7.) In due time God sent His angel Gabriel to Mary, a Jewess of Nazareth, who told Alary that she, although a virgin, was the one of Israel chosen to be honored of God to be the mother of the mighty one whom God</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&quot;through His prophets had promised should come.—Luke 1: 28-32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In due time the babe Jesus was born in Bethlehem, the city of David, just as the prophet Micah had foretold. (Micah 5:2) On the night of the birth of Jesus, about October 1 of B.C. 2, God’s holy angels bore witness to it by bringing God’s message to the humble shepherds in the fields of the holy land. That the birth of this babe should have to do with the bringing of humankind into relationship with God was testified to by the heavenly host which then and there sang: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.” (Luke 2:14) God’s angel at that time bore witness to the fact that in due time the birth of Jesus would be good news to all men of good-will upon earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As a child, Jesus was subject to His mother and Joseph His foster-father. There is no reason to conclude that the home in which Jesus lived was anything more than the ordinary home of the little town of Nazareth. Joseph His fosterparent was a carpenter, and what evidence there is seems to indicate that Jesus worked with him and was known as a carpenter. (Matthew 13: 55) At the age of twelve the child came into some prominence for a few days. (Luke 2: 47-52) Otherwise little is said of Him' during the days of His youth. He “increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At the age of thirty years,- having reached His legal majority, Jesus presented himself at the Jordan in consecration to Jehovah God and to symbolize that consecration by baptism -in the waters of the river. He was there a perfect man, holy,, harmless, undefiled and separate from sinners. (Hebrews 7: 26) That was true' for two separate reasons at least: (1) He was not begotten by a human father but begotten in the womb of Mary His mother by the Jioly spirit of God. The Scriptures do not give the details of how, but the fact is stated that He was begotten by the power of the holy spirit, which is Jehovah God's invisible active force; and that is the end of the controversy. (Matthewl:18) Also (2) as a youth and as a man Jesus had kept His purity and had not sinned in thought, word or deed. Such was possible with Him because of His perfection. It is evident that God’s care was about the child and the boy, and when His mind began to operate and reason Jesus kept himself free from the contaminations in the world about Him. There were thirty years of preparation for the work which God had for Him to do. His existence as a spirit creature in heaven had been transferred by His heavenly Father to the human plane. He was born a man child and He grew to manhood’s estate in its perfection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When Jesus offered himself in consecration to do His Father’s will He showed subjection to and not equality with Jehovah God. He said: “Lo, I come: in tl^e volume of the book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my ' God: yea, thy law is within my heart.” (Psalm 40: 7, 8; Hebrews 10: 5-7) Then and there at Jordan river God gave proof of his acceptance of Jesus’ consecration. His voice came from heaven, saying: “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” At that time God anointed Jesus with His holy spirit (not a “'third person” but his invisible power), and outward evidence thereof , was given to John the Baptist.—Matthew 3:16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If the clergy are right in their dogmas of incarnation and trinity, why did Jesus, the perfect man, there stand before God His Father, not as equal, but as subject to the will of God His Father? If the religious clergy are right, then God in saying, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased,” was there practicing a fraud upon John the Baptist. The clergy would have men believe that there stood He who was “God the jSon”, a God-hian. The clergy are clearly wrong. Jesus was not God the Son in a trinity, but He was and is the Son of God whom Jehovah God sent to the earth to perform a great work. In subjection, the Son pledged himself to do His Lifegiver’s will, whatsoever that might be; and His Father received Jesus and accepted His agreement to do His will and manifested that acceptance by giving Him the anointing with His holy spirit or invisible active force.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Americana</span><span class="font10"> or the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Britannica</span><span class="font10"> encyclopedia and read what it has to say on the subject of law. Almighty God and His Word are virtually ignored, all the stress being put upon what that wonderful creature, man, has done in the way of regulating affairs here below. It seems that law is merely a rule of action, that it changes from time to time, and if you don’t like it you know what you can do, or, worse still, you don’t know what you can do. But you must obey or be shot. That’s the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If there is any such thing running around loose as what is called international law, nobody has ever been able to find it, or if he has found it he doesn’t know who was its papa or who was its mama, or what business it has in what is called the comity of nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After the government had expended $2,000,000,000 developing and fabricating the first atomic bomb, it spent several weeks debating whether or not to use it at all. It finally decided to use it, but after the first one was dropped on Japan it was claimed that there were days before anybody on the streets of Washington smiled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is freely acknowledged that the ability to make these bombs w'ill certainly spread over the whole earth in a short time, and past experience shows that treaties not to use it would be merely pieces of waste paper, of no real interest to the politicians or to anybody else. Moreover, it is foreseen that within a few years it will be possible to produce a rocket that can be guided by radar to any part of the earth. Such a rocket, loaded with atomic explosives, could begin and end a war in a single flash. So it is no wmnder that (and here we do have to actually turn to the Scriptures for the law on the subject) we find “men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth”.—-Luke 21: 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Victors Seem Not in Accord</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The victors in World War II seem not in accord, and with few prospects of establishing such. Many seem to see a big tussle under way between Britain and Russia as to how Europe and the Near East and the Middle East are to be divided up between those two powers. They think World &quot;War III is just around the corner and expect that the United States will be in it from the first day. This is not a pleasant prospect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The statesmen have discovered a new crime. It has been in existence ever since Cain killed Abel, but it is now becoming or about to become the law; at least that is what the lawmakers indicate. They say, and w<sup>r</sup>ith a good deal of reason, that the planning, preparation, initiation and waging of a war of aggression is a crime; also (and this is quite new) that the individual leaders, instigators and accomplices may be; held responsible. Many of the political prisoners just released from Japan’s prisons are insisting that Hirohito should, be hanged.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">America Ruled by the People</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The American people, in principle at least, rule themselves. In their Bill of Rights they have expressly reserved to themselves all rules of action (“laws”) not set forth in the Constitution. The Supreme Court decides if any act of Congress is or is not constitutional. It has a hard job, but it does pretty well. Occasionally something occurs that raises a laugh. One such was raised regarding telegrams. The court rightly decided that telegrams are “goods”, but instead 'of making the common-sense ruling that they are “shipped” by the Western Union, they decided that these goods are merely electrical impulses. Hence, in effect, they are not interstate commerce, and hence (and this is what it was all about) the government cannot say to the Western Union that it must not utilize child labor. Justice Murphy, an outstanding cham-, pion of liberty, considered this ruling a “sacrifice of social gains for the sakeofgrammat-ical perfection”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">And not all congressmen are models to be copied, either. There is that famous friend of “Father” Coughlin, Martin Dies, of Texas.

Their idea seems to be, as with all cartels, that they will “get away with it” if they can, but if they get caught they will pay the small fine imposed and watch for the next good opportunity to recover it all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Much Progress Being Made</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Uncle Sam is making considerable progress in self-government. The United States Food and Drug Administration is doing good work. Until it interfered, on behalf of the people, it was possible to get in the eastern district of the United States garlic made of asafetida, conserves made from citrus fruits retrieved from the garbage, fish packed in secondhand barrels that had contained poisonous lead substances, and honey and candies that contained coal tar dyes and 'talc. A fruit-preserVing firm was found substituting grated carrots for much fruit; indigestible mineral oil was found in popped corn, candy and chocolate ice cream coatings; horse meat was substituted for beef; ground cocoa, made mostly of cocoa shells, appeared in cakes and candy; coffee was adulterated with four kinds of substitutes; shelled pumpkin seeds were found mixed with nuts in a product sold as mixed salted nuts; olive oil was found adulterated with cottonseed oil; brandy was found containing large and dangerous glass slivers; inferior rubber stoppers were found causing chemical changes in medicines. In one instance gift packages were sold for $5.95 each, but, when examined, were found to contain only $2.10 at retail value; when the contents received were compared with those displayed, they were found to contain only fifty percent of the items for which payment had been made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Under the Wage-Hour Act, there are certain rights which employees cannot sign away. Thus, a night watchman of a Brooklyn, N. Y., savings bank was deprived of his time-and-a-half pay for overtime over a two-year period. He accepted a check for $423 to cover the withheld wages. Then he discovered that he was entitled to double the amount as “liquidated damages” for the violation of the law, whereupon he sued for the remainder and the Supreme Court granted it to him. A similar case happened in a box factory at Crisfield, Md. A man, on his dismissal, was induced to take a $500 check to make up for $776 in back pay, and to sign a release for the rest. Later, when he discovered his full rights, he sued for the full amount due under the Aet, double the $776, and it was paid to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Yes, the national government has made progress. In a single war year the national income was raised from eighty billion dollars to one hundred and thirtyseven billion dollars, and the point is made that if such an income as that last named could be maintained for even ten years, the national debt could be paid off in full in that time. But people are not willing to do for the cause of peace what they are willing to do for the cause of war. Not yet.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Legislators in the states may pass laws that seem to take away the people’s liberties, but when such laws come up for review before the United States Supreme Court they cease to exist. No one, no matter who says to the contrary, can come to an American home at night, ransack the house, take away the letters and papers it contains, and drag the men of the house away to jail or to death. They cannot even go to the barn and lead away the family cow. The Bill of Rights intervenes. Germany seems not to have had any Bill of Rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The states try to hang on to their proper rights; and they should. They do not wish to send all their money to Washington and then have the boys down there tell them in detail just how they must spend it. But the states do .some unfair things that need to be corrected. Thus many women resent it that when they marry, there are certain states in which they lose their rights. In Florida a married woman cannot make a promissory note; in Washington she cannot sue for damages for injuries unless her husband joins in the suit or has abandoned her; in South Carolina her clothes belong to her husband; in California her earnings are subject to the control of her husband; in Georgia her husband collects all her wages, no matter where she earns them; in New York state what she earns outside of the home is hers, but what she earns under her husband’s roof belongs to him; in Kentucky her husband can divorce her if she gets‘drunk, but she cannot divorce him for fhe same offense; in Idaho and Texas an unmarried mother cannot get assistance from the father of her child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Many men educated in parochial schools, and therefore entirely ignorant of American history and laws, have the idea that when they get into state legislatures they can do almost anything. In New Jersey they tried to get a law passed requiring boards of education to provide free transportation for children attending parochial schools. New Jersey’s Supreme Court declared the law unconstitutional, as, of course, it was, <sub>t</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font10">AH over the country the same class of men, handicapped by their parochial training, have been introducing group libel bills which, so they think, will provide heavy fines and imprisonment for the publication or broadcasting of any matter exposing racial or religious groups to public hatred, contempt or ridicule. These measures are all in violent antagonism to the Bill of Rights, not to mention the Atlantic Charter, and can never come to anything but that which they invite, and which is expressed in the bills themselves, namely, contempt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the United States Court of Claims persons innocently convicted may recover damages up to $5,000 for such, injustice. New York State also now has a law that makes possible a recovery of damages for like causes, but in other states there seems to be no one, or almost no one except Jehovah’s witnesses, that is interested in seeing that persons unjustly imprisoned or otherwise punished get any redress whatever. There is nothing tyrants so much fear as publicity, and Jehovah’s witnesses propose to see that tyrants that trespass upon the rights of Jehovah’s people get their just dues in that regard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mississippi likes to make comical laws. It recently distinguished itself by placing a gross tax of 10 percent on all illegal sales, including that of bootleg liquor. So doing it made itself an accessory to lawbreaking. Moreover, the law stipulates that the information as to</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">lawbreaking, obtained by the tax collection agency, may not be released to any other agency. Hence, if a collector is summoned to testify in such a case, and -to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, he is suborned to perjury. Some law.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">The Monroe, La., </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Morning World</span><span class="font10"> contains in adjoining columns two items that indicate extraordinary severity in local law courts. A certain man, J. S.

In the same dity, on the same day, a man who had previously made the mistake of shooting a dog (which he claims came running into his home, dashing through the kitchen and bedroom, breaking dishes and damaging bed linens- and other furnishings) was fined an additional $50 and costs or 30 days in jail for this offense, after he had already received a judgment in a civil court ordering him to pay $200 for the loss of the dog.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In Brooklyn, N.

None of them had been charged with any offense, and a Negro minister said that he knew most of the boys, and knew that they were not members of any hoodlum gangs. Photographers were present, to take pictures of the judge, and the entire company of youths, and the whole thing is considered much out of place by critics.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Most ridiculous of all the imaginary lawmakers is the American Legion, whose commander in 1923 said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Do not forget that the Fascist! are to Italy what the American Legion is to the United States. If ever needed, the American Legion stands ready to protect the country’s institutions and ideals as the Fascisti dealt with obstructionists who menaced Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The attacks of the American Legion on Jehovah’s witnesses as recorded in 1940 and subsequently disclose that this private organization not only has no lawmaking or law-enforcing legal functions, but that its'mode of operation is entirely contrary to American laws and American institutions. Jehovah’s witnesses are law-abiding in the highest sense of the word, and they do not resort to threatening over the telephone, as was recently done in. Brooklyn by a man who claimed to be a commander of the Legion, but lacked the manhood to give his name. Past experience shows that the real soldiers, the ones that did things<sup>1</sup> at the front, have never abused or threatened Jehovah’s witnesses; it has been only those that are tied to the Vatican’s apron strings, either religiously, politically or commercially.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>From the Philippines</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font10">RYING to treat the Filipinos right has been good business for Uncle Sam, and a good object lesson to all the rest of the world, and especially for those having colonial possessions in Asia and elsewhere. More and more the common people everywhere are seeing the need of a world-wide government such as Jehovah God has ordained, and less and less they appreciate colonial rule which has deprived them of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. In the meantime, American colonial administration shines superior to any of the eight that still act as if they thought that they, at least in their colonies, were what Hitler had in mind when he dubbed the Germans as the master race. An alphabetical list of present colonial administrations includes American, Belgian, British, Dutch, French, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. The German and Italian colonial administrations seem to have been pretty well disposed of, with every one of them, America included, facing Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When the American forces moved into the Philippines, the natives came to them with uncomplimentary remarks about the Japanese “new order” as administered in their midst after Bataan. They could not figure it out why in many Filipino villages girls had been raped without consideration of age; why the “new order” soldiers had paraded in the nude, insulting both men and girls as they passed; why whole towns had been set on fire; why livestock had been stolen; and why men had been hung from the trees by the hands and left for as long as seven days without food or water. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some of the Filipino boys themselves were lured into dreadful acts. Nineteen of them in Manila accepted 300 pesos apiece from the Japanese for every house they, would burn. One of these boys was only seven years old. The boys were carefully taught how to throw gasoline cans into the houses and then follow these with hand grenades, and at least nineteen were caught thus engaged in burning their own city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Terrible retaliation wrns visited upon Filipino men whom masked women identified as guerrillas working with the American troops. After shooting and bayoneting many of them, the others were confined for three days and nights in a huge wooden garage connected with Fort Santiago prison. On Friday night, February 9, 1945, the doors of the garage, were closed, the building was sprayed with gasoline and then set afire, burning all that were confined therein to death. One man escaped,, by climbing the chimney, breaking a hole in the ceiling, dropping tw’enty feet to the ground, crawling twenty yards to the Pasig river, and swimming across it to safety. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As the American troops moved in the Filipino women (Filipinas they are called) made a fine impression on the American Women’s Auxiliary Corps, and vice versa. Coming out in a procession, the Filipinas were described as dressed in long, delicate, sky-blue and silver dresses, or in light-brown and gold-stitched gowns, with high puffed shoulders and sleeves, and peaked stiff lace collars, with veils over their black hair, with long skirts and American-made gold-and-silver high-heeled slippers. On the other hand the WACS,-.as they are commonly called, were dressed strictly in GI slacks or jungle greens. The American girls admired the dainty outfits of the Filipinas, and the Filipinas in turn admired the beautiful hair and beautiful complexions of , their American visitors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is neither reason nor common sense in colonial administrators’ high-hatting the natives of any land, for God “hath,made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth”.—Acts 17: 26.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Brazil’s Excommunicated Bishop</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font10">T IS a great honor to be excommunicated by the most wicked organization in the earth; and hence Bishop Charles Duarte, of Brazil, is to be congratulated that he had sufficient courage i and sufficient honesty to bring upon him * the condemnation of the Vatican, and thus to be relieved of his job in the Boman Catholic Hierarchy. Many will be interested in the following interview reported in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Norte Evangelico</span><span class="font10"> in its issue of June 15,1945. Bishop Duarte is reported in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Latin American News Letter</span><span class="font10"> as having said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Since 1938 at the request of Cardinal Leine I have been travelling through the Archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro. From the beginning of the war I found that the clergy inclined toward the side of the Germans, Italians and Spaniards. The newspapers which they read by preference were the Meio </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Dia </span><span class="font8">and the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Gazeta de Noticias,</span><span class="font8"> both ardent in their defense of Hitler, Mussolini and Franco. .. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In different parts of the country' there were acts of sabotage, clandestine messengers, torn Brazilian flags, Indians singing the “Giovinez-za”, persecutions of . mulattoes in schools, anti-Soviet writers, sequestering of arms, local uprisings and the hiding of spies. This was the ^vork carried on against our country by German, Italian and Spanish “missionaries” who had as their defenders in that “Tribunal of Security”, which ironically still exists, cowardly Brazilian, bishops, led by one who. is a disgrace to Christianity, namely Dom Bento Aloisi Masella. ... He was the greatest spy during the war period, and in the peace which is beginning he continues to be the great protector of the fifth columnists.... . Let • everyone remember that the Ibero-American Institute has moved its head. quarters from Berlin to Madrid and its name now is Dire^ao Geral da America (General Administration of America). It is the preparation for a new world war. ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In May 1944 we denounced the Hispanidad Movement which was begun in Brazil in the Catholic Confederation of Rio de Janeiro in a meeting presided over by the archbishop of Rio de Janeiro and Msgr. Leovegildo Franqa when a plan of attack was outlined against communism, spiritism, Protestantism, in general all the sects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Sr. Serafim Braga ordered me to prison he said to me, “The Government orders your excellency to go to Morro Velho; there you will find what you must do.” &quot;A Brazilian citizen, then, has no right to decide where he will live,” I told him. “Not under this regime,” he said. ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With regard to the benevolence asked for by the pope in behalf of the criminal fascists, it is really protection, as it is well known that the pope is one of the leaders of that fascism known as Hispanidad. City after city in England and Russia was bombed by Germans and Italians and the pope did not protest. When, however, Italy’s turn to be bombed came and Germany’s also, then we heard the voice of the Vatican. Hitler’s secret weapon was the ■Roman congregations and^that general staff called Jesuitism. It is the Society of Jesus rolling in wealth, which has capital invested in the greatest enterprises in the world and which was behind the Spanish revolution and keeps Franco in power. It is this powerful organization which foments the social ills in Catholic countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Soon I shall break with the Vatican. . . , then I shall publish a manifesto showing the hypocrisy of the Catholic Church which turned away from Christ to win temporal and universal dominion over the peoples of the earth, taking advantage of their religious spirit and exploiting it shamefully. There is no business, industry or bank which can compare with the business, industry and bank of the Catholic Church. . . . The priests of the Church are in the same conditions as the priests under the ancient law. Now is the time to unmask these individuals, evildoers against a humanity which must be humanized by the recovery of its dignity stolen from it by that cursed Fascism.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>The Priest at the Chateauguay, Quebec. Mobbings</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">B</span><span class="font10">EING a pioneer in Montreal, I was a witness to the malicious, unmitigated mob violence loosed upon our brethren September 16,1945, in the Montreal suburbs of Chateauguay and La-chine. [Fully described in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font10">No. 682, issue of November 7, 1Q45.] For years the Hierarchy has attempted to suppress Jehovah’s people in this vicinity by distortion of the laws, and her influence in the courts. On the date above mentioned it seemed that her patience had been exhausted, the mask was off, and the full fury of her vehemence was turned upon the zealous witnesses in these areas. What a grand fulfillment of Scripture 1 The 'scarlet woman’ is once again resorting to the tactics she used during the Middle Ages. This seems to be her favorite form of “Christianity”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Signs were ripped off, literature was destroyed, tomatoes flew thick and fast. Five brethren were trapped in a house in Lachine, for five hours, while it was being stoned by a mob of about two thousand people. In Chateauguay the hoodlums stooped so low as to throw human excrement. I helped to evacuate brethren from the besieged house in Chateauguay. There was no disorder or rush for cars. They surely had a mental calmness unnatural to humans. The police aided in the evacuation, but could not or would not stop the fruit bombardment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Across the street from this house stood the priest in his long black dress and blue windbreaker, calmly looking on. </span><span class="font10">The amazing thing is that through all this no one was actually hurt. It was the French unit of Montreal that sponsored the campaign in Chateauguay. It was well supported and they were superb in their determination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On Sunday the talk in Lachine was to be held in a hall on the main street, over the bank. The bank manager was so worried about the many windows in the hall and bank that he was practically eating cigars by the box by the time three o’clock arrived. Although the area around the hall was well guarded by a reinforced police squad, the manager finally refused to open the hall. The very timely discourse was subsequently delivered in a private home, with about ten policemen standing guard outside. The house was jammed with newspaper reporters; so they counted many strangers. Since this, three more talks have been given in both ■ towns, and, by God’s grace’, the series will be completed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Most noticeable was the jubilance and enthusiasm of the friends at the Sunday night </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font10"> study of the same day. Never had I heard Jehovah’s “songs of victory” sung with so much joy and feeling. The usually comfortable hall was packed with people standing at the back. There were hardly enough questions to go around that night; everybody wanted to answer. It seems that every time Satan tries to persecute Jehovah’s .witnesses he drives a few more “sheep” out of his famine-stricken camp into Christ’s fold, and there is no doubt that it greatly strengthens those already on the right-hand side. The faithful attitude of the brethren in this territory makes one feel proud to be associated with Jehovah’s people and their Commander in this great discipling work. Surely Jehovah is blessing His people. —A Canadian Kingdom publisher.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Careful Planning in Utah</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font10">HE United States army looks after the details of its business. When it planned the bombing of Japan it built in Utah a model Japanese city of more than </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY 131 1M6</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">100 d’Wellings, made in detail just as they are made in Japan. When it was discovered that the exact type of grass and fiber mats which the Japanese use were not available in the United States,, the Navy brought them in from Hawaii.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As fast as the houses were destroyed or damaged they were rebuilt, with the bombers continuing to come over at varying heights, using various types of explosive and incendiary combinations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">V ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—“</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The results were carefully recorded and studied. Fire bombings were made by night with the window shutters closed and the bedding in place. Day bombings were made with the shutters open and the bedding put away in closets, according to Japanese custom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The Terrible Triplets</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">J</span><span class="font10">EHOVAH God made perfect man in His own image, endowed with a measure of His lovt\ wisdom, justice, and reasoning faculties. Priceless gifts! With the full use and exercise of these faculties man, even after becoming imperfect, could discern the right and wrong of things and could see the revealed portion of Jehovah’s purposes; could take Kis stand on the side of right, Jehovah’s side, through his love for the Creator and his sense of justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Satan didn’t like such a situation, of course. Being pretty wise in his serpentine way, he knew where to strike to undermine man’s devotion to God. Take away man’s love for God and for all right; take away his human measures of wisdom and justice; take away his reasoning faculties, and, behold! another dupe for the adversary. Well, he couldn’t go so far in his meddling with God’s creation as to remove these God-given faculties, but he could and did think up some pretty good counteracting weapons. Judging from the present condition of the majority of mankind, it seems his weapons have been as effective on the minds and hearts of men as the atomblast was on Hiroshima.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What are these successful weapons, these brain-children of Satan? They are more properly his grandchildren, because they are the cunning offspring of his beloved firstborn, the beguiling, charming woman named .Religion. To carry the metaphor farther, their father is one of Satan’s chief prides, the bumbling hulk called Ignorance. And now for the names and descriptions of these three of Satan’s offspring, through the immediate parentage of Religion and Ignorance. They’re very much alike, you’ll find; so much so that it is plain they are triplets. They are full-grown now and busy constantly in their father Satan’s business of keeping mankind away from Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Cords of Prejudice</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">First there is Prejudice. The writers of the dictionary give a brief description of this sure-fire weapon of Satan, They say Prejudice is “previous and unfavorable bias; pre judgment without due examination”. What better weapon could Satan ask? How does Prejudice work? Like this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He wraps victims in an almost hopeless entanglement of netting, hampering their every movement. There would be a million cords of biased prejudgment to cut before the victim could be freed. Prejudice plugs the ears of his victims with the netting, keeping him from hearing properly. Everything he hears must pass through the mass of netting and by the time it registers on his brain it is something quite different from what was said to him. Prejudice wraps the cords so thickly that the victim’s eyesight is impaired. Everything he sees is viewed through the netting and is strangely altered thereby. When he looks ht something of -which Prejudice is in favor, the netting causes it to be a delightful rosy hue; but when he looks at something on Prejudice’s black list, it looks hideous, gray, and black. Likewise, when the victim speaks, his jaws are bound and his tongue hampered by Prejudice’s bonds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now for the strangest part of Prejudice’s work. He makes the victims fiercely love their bonds and hold tenaciously to them! And if an outsider dares attempt to free him of some or all of his bonds, he fights and claws with all his might and hugs his cords tighter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Prejudice, of course, zealously guards the “susceptibilities” of his mother, Religion. But the main defender of her vulnerability is the second triplet, Tradition. Tradition is handsome to behold, but iron-strong beneath his beauty. He is an inseparable ally of Prejudice and usually attacks the victim first, preparing the way for the less comely brother. Tradition wins the victims with his charm and good looks. They would then blindly follow him anywhere, the first stop being the enmeshing trap Prejudice holds open and ready.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Once a victim has become the slave of Tradition, his ears can hear nothing but the words and instructions of Tradition. If any word spoken to him is contrary to Tradition’s dulcet-toned instructions, it doesn’t even register on his brain. Nothing his eyes see is quite as charming as Tradition’s comeliness. Every word his tongue formfe is formed to please and win the favor of Tradition. He blindly follows Tradition wherever he leads, and that path is always in the direction opposite to that of light and truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Thus doubly-bound, the victim’s condition looks pretty hopeless. But, fortunately, the Devil’s inventions never quite measure up to the faculties Jehovah creates; Prejudice and Tradition often go down completely and man’s reasoning faculties of love, wisdom, and justice triumph. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But what of the third triplet? This is what Webster has to say about Superstition : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . .reverence for, and belief</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">in . . . objects which are not worthy of worship; false worship or religion ; extreme observance of religious rites or ceremonies.” A victim of Superstition </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY 13, 1946 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' </span><span class="font10">is termed as one “overscrupulous and extreme in religious rites or ceremonies’’. So, then, this daughter of Religion is almost identical with her infamous mother; is closer to her than any other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The helpless,, blinded, deafened and , gagged victims of Prejudice and Tradition are led straight into the clutches of Superstition. Tradition sanctifies his mother’s behavior, endears her to the victim; Prejudice binds him there, seals him air-tight in his opinions; and then the brothers hand what’s left of the victim over to their sister, Religion’s ditto, Superstition. What further does the zealous Superstition do to the victim? Well, her brothers have done most of the preparation work for her and about all she has to do is sit back content and reign with her mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Confusion and Fear-of-('real ares</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">She has two little brothers always handy to use in heckling the victims. They are the lively and ugly twins, Confusion and Fear-of-Creatures. They are Superstition’s right-hand helpers. Confusion likes to spin the victims around and around until they don’t know what’s what or where or who or why. Then Fear-of-Creatures plants himself squarely before the dizzy victim and makes hideously ugly faces at him. After such treat-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> ment, Superstition finds the victims very humble and obeisant before her. Superstition has a lively imagination and is famous for her many and varied stories, hardly of the bedtime variety. If .the victim’s God-given faculties rouse feebly in protest to these colorful yarns, then, little Confusion and Fear-of-Creatures apply their talents again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Once the victims relax in contented enjoyment of their bonds of Prejudice, with worshipful eyes riveted on Tradition, and in obedience to the reign of Superstition, the whol’e family is happy. The victim is fed' often and heartily. Big, sugar-coated lumps of food from Religion’s table are shoved regularly down his throat. If he chokes and sputters, a</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">&gt;27</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">' cdaxing word and a pat or two from Tradition will usually get the lump swallowed in no .time. If handsome Tradition should fail, then hideous little Fear-of-Creatures is called in to make a few faces at him; Confusion gives him a whirl or two, and, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">presto!</span><span class="font10"> he has swallowed the lump 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I In this condition the victim gets to where he can swmlUw almost anything. ‘ At one hearing, the victims of this closely-knit family were busy swallowing camels. (Matthew 23:24) Stewing .now on Mama Religion’s stove are generous-sized elephants for distribution to the multitudes of victims. They are to be served, not au gratin, not as stew, but </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">whole.</span><span class="font10"> Many will gleefully gulp them down, to the applause of Tradition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">' Many will not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For, even though the condition which results from the combined and co-ordinated efforts of this family sounds almost hopeless, it isn’t quite. There is still within each victim, no matter how deadened his senses may be, a measure of that wisdom, justice and love. No matter how rusty and moth-eaten, that reasoning machinery is still there. If it be Jehovah’s will to free the victim, these God-given faculties can be reached and aroused. They can burst all the bonds and tighten the throat against any more camel-swallowing. But is it Jehovah’s will to free these victims? Read Isaiah 58:6 and John 8:32,36. And for the number of victims who Will be released read Revelation 7: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Devil’s inventions are in their heyday of success now, but when Religion goes down at the near-at-hand battle of Jehovah’s day, all her children and her mate Ignorance will go down with -her. On the other hand, the loving gifts of God, wisdom, justice, power, and love, will become enlarged in men to the limits of human perfection. Jehovah created them and endowed man with them; and Jehovah creates not in vain. Satan the mimic’s efforts at creation are in vain, and he created The Terrible Triplets. —Contributed, from Texas.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Rotherham and </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Emphasized Bible</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">J</span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">oseph Bryant Rotherham was born at New Buckingham, Norfolk, England, in 1828. His parents were conscientious Methodists, his father being a preacher of that persuasion. Joseph was accordingly raised a Methodist, and for a time preached Methodism pure and simple, having concluded that he had a call to do so. It was not long, however, until his inquiring mind realized that he did not know all there was to be known as far as the Scriptures were concerned, and that some of the things he thought he knew quite well were hardly sustained^ by Scriptural proofs. Among other things, he came to see that baptizing infants was not in accordance with the instructions of the Lord Jesus, and that sprinkling, moreover, was not baptizing. His resolute stand in connection with these matters raised quite a flurry among those to whom he preached but he stuck to his conscientious conclusions and the Lord blessed him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Every opportunity that came to Joseph to improve his knowledge was eagerly welcomed. He increased in knowledge of Scripture and took up also a study of the original languages in which the Scriptures were written. With the original tongues he became almost if not quite as familiar as he was with his own. native- English. He observed that the Hebrew and the Greek had certain indications of emphasis, and these he considered it of very real importance to render in English in some manner. He skid, “The Emphatic Idiom of the English is but a faint and fitful reflex of the Emphatic Idiom of the Hebrew and Greek.” He felt also that the arrangement of the words in both the Hebrew and the Greek should be preserved as far as possible in any English translation that would seek to do justice to the force of the originals. Yet he realized that such an arrangement would sound very strange to the average reader in many instances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY 13, 194B</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■With regard to the Word of God, Rotherham expressed his own reverent attitude in the following words*.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Whatever translation of the Bible we prefer, and whether or not we compare therewith other versions, let us never forget that it is our duty and privilege to rise above all mere formalism even in Bible reading, and use all our powers to get at the heart of divine things. God’s works and ways and thoughts so far as revealed in His Word—let these be the objects of our search and the subjects which engage our meditation; let us seek to turn these into realities, by looking at them from every side, and translating them into our own language and into our own thoughts. Let us try to get at the facts through the words, at the sense through the sounds. Let us guard against being rocked to sleep by the lullaby of unpenetrated sentences whose meaning we do not understand. Let us not dream that we can be made holy and safe by mere verbal charms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This sentiment summed up Rotherham’s own attitude toward the Word of God, which he assiduously studied and continually examined, both in the original languages and in various translations, if by any means he might arrive at a more accurate and beneficial rendering of the sacred text than had yet been produced. Concerning his translation, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Emphasized Bible,</span><span class="font10"> he said that his aim throughout was to form a companion version, and that he had no thought of producing a version in competition with the one in common use. He stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">No English Bible can be more than a translation, since the Sacred Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments were originally written in Hebrew and in Greek. Hence it must be obvious to all, that just in proportion to the importance of these documents must be the obligation to translate them as accurately and adequately as possible; and since, in the very nature of things no translation can be perfect, improvement is always possible. Even if no further improvement were attainable, various renderings for different classes of read-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">29</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">.. ers would still probably be of service. Besides, ... the humblest individual translator may reasonably deem it possible to contribute something to the common stock of happy and effec-_ tivc renderings. Hence it may not be presumptuous to hope that a useful place will be filled by </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The. Emphasized Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Rotherham spent twelve years on the work of producing his remarkable Bible translation. And they were years of fruitful activity. In that time he wrote out the whole Bible with his own hand, and many portions of it several times over. But it w<sup>r</sup>as not merely a matter of copying the Bible. It was necessary to consider the exact meaning of the original, to compare manuscripts, versions, and sources. He consulted what others had said on this or that text and the conclusions of various scholars about difficult passages.' He was convinced, after forty years of experience, that there should be no such thing as finality in the ■ work of Bible translation and revision, .in view of the fact that languages changed, grammars multiplied, dictionaries grew, and discoveries in Bible lands continued to throw light upon an' cient customs and records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Believed in The Theocracy</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Rotherham believed wholeheartedly in the Millennium and looked forward to the coming of The Theocracy in power and glory. lie felt, too, that certain statements of Scripture '‘opened up avenues of thought concerning the great problem of the unevangelized nations, and all who have nevbr had a fair chance to hear the Gospel tidings”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Rotherham was deeply impressed with the significance of God’s name, which he sought to restore to its rightful place in his translation, instead of obscuring it by the anonymous title “Lord”. Whether or not one agrees with him that this name should be pronounced as the Hebrews pronounced it, as far as that pronunciation can be determined, the fact remains that he recognized the value of the name, which is commonly and acceptably translated “JEHOVAH”. Those who object to that rendering should reflect that no name in Scripture is pronounced by us as the Hebrews uttered it, not even the name of Jesus, which is the Greek rendering of the Hebrew Jehoshua, Joshua or Jeshua. The variations in the pronunciation of the Savior’s name suggest that there were also differ-erent pronunciations and renderings of the name of God. That fact, however, is a matter of secondary importance, so long as the name is recognized, acknowledged, and revered. Rotherham showed such -respect for the name, and argued cogently for its use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Of Rotherham the statement of the Psalms seemed fitting: “They shall still bring forth fruit in old age.” He was active almost to the day of his death, wliich occurred in the first wtsck of January, 1910, when the translator of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Emphasized Bible</span><span class="font10"> was in his 82nd year. His translation stands as a monument to his reverence for the Word of God.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Cutting Down the Cost of Iowa Prayers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font10">HE legislature at Des Moines, Iowa, has been having a hectic discussion about how much to pay apiece for prayers. They finally agreed to pay at the rate of $10 per prayer, or at 5 cents a mile, whichever w<sup>T</sup>ould provide the best income for the prayer-maker. Should the prayer-maker live just 200 miles from Des Moines, his price per prayer wmuld be $10. After that he would get 50c more per prayer for every ten miles farther north, or south or east or west, aS the case might be. An lowm correspondent suggests that the legislature buy a phonograph, and run off its own prayers for only a few cents each. And then, though he did not mention it, there is that bright idea of the Chinese of setting</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">up a prayer wheel. The clerk of the legislature could give it a whirl at the right time, and then politics could go on as</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">usual without any expense or delay. <sup>1</sup></span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>President Harry S. Truman</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">H</span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">arry S. Truman, president of the United States at the age of 61, got his start in political life with the aid of , the Pendergast machine of his home state, Missouri; but there has been no question of his ability, sincerity and integrity. As a United States senator, he emerged as an able investigator of railroads, was made head of a special Senate committee probing the national defense program, and made his committee a powerful instrument against waste and corruption in the fulfillment of war contracts. He is accredited with steering clear of partisan politics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In his first address to Congress after he was made president, he quoted, and applied to himself, the passage in 1 Kings where Solomon, on taking office, prayed to Gpd: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">’ President Truman spoke well of the job that labor did during the time when ' vicious newspapers were snarling at their desires for a fair deal. At that time he said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The job that has been done not only assures that victory will be won, but it assures that it will be won more quickly and with fewer casualties. . . . strikes in 1943 resulted in a loss of man power of less than one-fourth of one percent of the man power actually used, whereas, the man power contributed by labor in that period exceeded that used in 1939 by 76 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“A New Broom Sweeps Clean”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As is usual in such cases, when President Truman succeeded President Roosevelt, he began replacing the latter’s cabinet, until now nearly all are changed. It</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">, FEBRUARY 13, 1946 </span><span class="font10">is generally very well appreciated that his own selections were largely western men. Thus, Judge Schwellenbach, of Spokane, Washington, was chosen to replace Mme. Frances Perkins, of New </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">S </span><span class="font10">York, as secretary of labor; Tom Clark, of Dallas, Texas, replaced Francis Biddle, of Pennsylvania, as attorney general ; and R. E. Hannegan, of St. Louis, replaced Frank C. Walker, of Pennsylvania, as postmaster general.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">No man can fill such an office without every act’s being criticized. One of the criticisms is that Mr. Truman, then vicepresident, flew in a government plane to attend the funeral of Thomas J. Pendergast, the political crook and ex-convict under whom he got his political start.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">* This criticism was heightened when one of his subordinates placed Mr. Pendergast’s nephew in a $6,200 position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Palestine situation has him all tangled up, the same as was Mr. Roosevelt. The facts are, briefly, that King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia, came tearing across Arabia to confer with President Roosevelt and the latter solemnly staved things off by assuring him that nothing would be done affecting the basic situation without full consultation with both Jews and Arabs, and that no action would be taken that would prove hostile to the Arab people. This was a complete side-stepping of the vexing Jewish question, and promised nothing to anybody. When President Truman had the same problem to solve, he first took the position that 100,000 Jews should be admitted to Palestine and then reiterated what Mr. Roosevelt had said, which left the thing just where it was before; which is nowhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The presidency of the United States in these days is a mighty hard job.</span></p>

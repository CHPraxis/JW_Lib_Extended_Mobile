<p><span class="font9">Palace at Paris as diplomats and their staffs assembled on July 29 for the sessions of the momentous peace conference. Flags brightened the exterior of the palace, hut the interior, though ornate, was not impressive. Twenty-one nations were represented in the solemn conclave, which, in spite of its momentous responsibilities, was matter of faet and ordinary in many respects. PremierPresident Georges Bidault of France, the host nation, opened the conferenee with the unpretentious utterance, ''Gentlemen, I declare the peace conference open/' The speeeh which followed was not inspiring, and there was no applause. It set forth briefly the necessity for patiently seeking solutions to the difficulty of arriving at a conclusion of World War II. The speech was translated into Russian and English, as were the other deliberations of the conference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">While the emissaries to the conference seemed </span><span class="font6">un-</span><span class="font9">J:&gt;retentious, there was, nevertheless, considerable talent represented. Each nation sent its experts to safeguard its interests. The United States limited its delegation to technically qualified personnel. Mr. Jas. F. Byrnes, the secre-</span></p>

But he had as assistants and advisers Senators Arthur H. Vandenburg of Michigan and Tom Connally of Texas, the latter chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Russia was represented by the doughty V. M. Molotov, formidable champion of the Soviet cause, </span><span class="font8">wlw </span><span class="font9">was accompanied by able but undiplomatic Andrei Vishinsky mid other aides. Ernest Bevin represented the British people, while France was represented by Georges Bidault, already mentioned. Otlwr nations were not less ably, though perhaps somewhat less conspicuously, represented by their delegates. some of whom will come to the fore as we proceed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The conference at the outset backed the proposal of United States delegate J. F. ByTnes that there should be complete freedom of the press to report the conference and its .deliberations and conclusions. Molotov stated that he favored free access on the part of the correspondents not only to the plenary sessions but also to , the meetings of the various committees and commissions, dealing with details.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">3</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Treaty Drafts</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">T1ie conference was early supplied with treaty drafts proposed by the Cm.m-cil of </span><span class="font8">E</span><span class="font9">ormgn Min</span><span class="font8">i</span><span class="font9">sters composed of the Big Four, Russia</span><span class="font6">, </span><span class="font9">United States, Great Britain and Fr</span><span class="font6">a</span><span class="font9">n</span><span class="font6">ce</span><span class="font9">. There were five or Ihef'e drafts, setting forth terms of peace for Ita!v, Bnlgariu, H nngary, Rumania and </span><span class="font8">Finland. 'l'lw </span><span class="font9">drafts revealed that </span><span class="font8">the </span><span class="font9">Big Fotr Imd come to some agreement or compromise on quite a muHher of problems, Ruch as demilitarization of </span><span class="font8">tlf' </span><span class="font9">n</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a</span><span class="font9">med enemy nations, houndary rev</span><span class="font8">i</span><span class="font9">sion</span><span class="font6">s </span><span class="font9">and reparations; but tJiere were also points </span><span class="font8">that were left </span><span class="font9">un-:finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">TLe so-</span><span class="font6">c</span><span class="font9">alled ••smaller&quot; nations represented at the conference, however, were iiol disposed to act. merely as a ruhher stamp </span><span class="font8">l'or </span><span class="font9">the Big Four decisions. Tins determination was put into words by Dr. </span><span class="font8">H</span><span class="font9">er</span><span class="font8">b</span><span class="font9">ert V. Evatt, Australia's minister for external affairs. He s</span><span class="font8">t</span><span class="font9">a</span><span class="font8">r</span><span class="font9">ted out to &lt;‘ritieize the draft treaties^ severely, </span><span class="font8">s</span><span class="font9">nying </span><span class="font10">that </span><span class="font9">they assured </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font9">p</span><span class="font8">r</span><span class="font9">i</span><span class="font8">v</span><span class="font9">ileg</span><span class="font8">ed </span><span class="font9">position for Russia in tLe economic affairs of thr </span><span class="font8">five </span><span class="font9">minor Axis powers. He set out fom fuclamenta! principles which he emphasized as being essential for just peacemaking, demanding (1) adherence to the Atlantic and United </span><span class="font8">Nations </span><span class="font9">Charters (which many of the smaller nntions felt </span><span class="font8">were </span><span class="font9">heing ignored) </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">5 </span><span class="font9">(2) impartial examination by the conference of all facts bearing on the treaties; </span><span class="font8">(3) </span><span class="font9">a</span><span class="font6">v</span><span class="font9">oidance of unjustifiable bur</span><span class="font8">dens on the losers in tile </span><span class="font6">wnr, </span><span class="font8">to f</span><span class="font9">o</span><span class="font8">ster </span><span class="font9">democracy; and </span><span class="font8">( </span><span class="font9">4} the effort to attain a Just nnd diii’ahle peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Dr. Evatt </span><span class="font8">was </span><span class="font9">not the only one who was dissntisfied with the efforts of the Big' Four to draft peace treaties for the :five recent enemy powers. These five powers thE’mseJves were keenly disappointed in </span><span class="font8">them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">General Dismay</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Italy was dismayed in the decisions set forth in </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">tr</span><span class="font8">e</span><span class="font9">aty it was expe</span><span class="font6">c</span><span class="font9">ted to sign even tually, although subject to review by the conference. The Italian delegates said they saw no indication in the treaty draft of any recognition on the part of the Big Four that the It</span><span class="font8">a</span><span class="font9">lians had fought on the side of the Allies for two years before final victory. They s</span><span class="font8">a</span><span class="font9">id that other enemy states which had done much less than the Italiais had </span><span class="font8">hecn </span><span class="font9">favoi’pd by a powerful friend (Rust-ia). TLe Italians were particularly bitter ahont the proposed internationalization of the port of Trieste, which had been held by Italy since the conclusion of the </span><span class="font8">first 1VorJ&lt;1 1Yar. Yugoslavia, wliicli had </span><span class="font9">been on the side of the Allies, was also bitter about the Trieste proposal. They wanted the city and surrounding territory for thcmRelves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Bulgaria's representatives were said to he &quot;stupified&quot; with the terms of the treaty drawn np for them. They s</span><span class="font8">a</span><span class="font9">id, &quot;We </span><span class="font8">f-UTj-jiol </span><span class="font9">understand why we are treated </span><span class="font8">bio- a </span><span class="font9">beaten enemy when we never once took up arms against any </span><span class="font8">of </span><span class="font9">the Allies.&quot; </span><span class="font8">However, </span><span class="font9">Bulgaria was rather </span><span class="font6">c</span><span class="font9">losely linked with the Nazis and very b</span><span class="font8">e</span><span class="font9">latedly declared war on Germany on Septem</span><span class="font8">b</span><span class="font9">er </span><span class="font8">7, 19H. </span><span class="font9">The Bnlgars protested against being cut off from the </span><span class="font8">A</span><span class="font9">egean </span><span class="font8">sen. </span><span class="font9">The Bulgar-Greek frontier , however, hnd been left unsettled by the</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">e </span><span class="font9">Big Four, although hope for a piece of the coastline was slim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Hungary felt it had considerable cause for uidiuppiu^-s in the provisions of the treaty made on its behaJf. Among other things, its </span><span class="font10">military </span><span class="font9">setup had to be drastically reduced to an m ipotent minimum. Th</span><span class="font8">e</span><span class="font9">n it must pay </span><span class="font8">out $300,000,000 </span><span class="font9">in </span><span class="font8">rep</span><span class="font9">arations, aud must cede to Rumania ids territory of Transylvania.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Rumania, while it would gain Tran-sylvama, must give up to Russia the equally extensive terri</span><span class="font8">t</span><span class="font9">orv of Bessnra-bia, together with North Bukovina, both of </span><span class="font8">which </span><span class="font9">terr</span><span class="font8">i</span><span class="font9">tories Russia liad al</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">r</span><span class="font9">eady taken over. </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font9">he arrangement gives Russia a direct mterest </span><span class="font8">m </span><span class="font9">the Danube river , as the Bessarahian territory borders o</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">n</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">that important artery of trade at its very mouth. Rumania must, further, give </span><span class="font7">up </span><span class="font9">to Bulgaria that piece of territory known as Southern Dobruja.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Finland, too, would lose something as </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font9">result of its association with Nazidom. A greatly minimized military setup was a feature of the Finnish treaty (as, indeed, of every one of the five) and the Russians were to get the territory of Petsamo at the extreme north of Finland, which would close to Finland her only arctic port. Russia also gained the riglit to construct on the Finnish island of Porkkala-Udd a naval base, on a fiftyyear lE&gt;ase. E'inland must, moreover, pay reparations to Russia </span><span class="font7">in </span><span class="font9">the amount of $300,000,000, a crushing burden for the small country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Such, very briefiy stated, were some of the terms which the Big Four had proposed for the defeated nations. The treaties, admittedly incomplete, were now to be eonsidered by the plenary conference of the twenty-one victorious powers, great and small, for recommendations, additions and changes.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Conference Minutiae</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The pe-ace conference was heavily </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">policed. </span><span class="font9">Detectives and uniformed police </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font9">everywhere in evidence. They were also on duty in hotels occupied </span><span class="font7">l&gt;y </span><span class="font9">the delegates. Nothing untoward must happen to thesu important personages, for such a mishap would only complicate the already tense situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The pace of the conference was slow. There was much speech-making, which tended to become wearisome mid boring, but was considered necessary to let the various delegations make their attitudes known. At the rules committee, an </span><span class="font7">im</span><span class="font9">portant part of the conference, it took more than two hours to elect a chairman. This committee also bad to decide how many votes would be required to adopt a Tecommendation with reference to the draft tTeaties. </span><span class="font7">It </span><span class="font9">was bere that Secretary Byrnes of the United States made </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">DECEMBER </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">8, 1946 </span><span class="font9">known his decision that a two-thirds vote would constitute a reeommundation which the Big l&quot;&quot;our, and more particularly the United States representative, would consider woi’thy of serious consideration, wben they met for final decision of the treaties. A British compromise, however, was finally accepted by the rules committee, that a two-thirds vote be considered a recommendation, while a simple majority vote would have less weight and be viewed in the light of </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font9">suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The treaties were now before the conference to be taken up one liy one, first by the various conunh;sions, tlien by the conference in plenary session, for lengtby consideration. Some of the features of the treaties, Yery important, were, nevertheless, 1mt compromises between the members of the Big Four and ' were, therefore, presumably open for revision and alteration. Some points were entirely unsettled, and in these instances the reconunendations of the conference would Jiave greater weight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">days passed the initial hopefulness of the conferees, not too strong to begin with, waned. </span><span class="font7">It </span><span class="font9">was evident that there was no over-all aim to work together for peaee. Rather, the majority realized, the greater nations were cari'Y-ing on-a contest for power in which the smaller powers, and particularly the former enemy nations, were the pawns. It was a continuation of the struggle which antedated the war itself. The chief contestants were apparently the United States and Soviet Russia, with Britain discreetly in the hackground yet vitally concerned in the maneuvers. At one point Mr. Molotov of the Sovjet. made a charge that certain nations had enriched themselves through the war. Mr. Byrnes, sensing that the United States was cliief-Jy </span><span class="font7">in </span><span class="font9">the mind of MolotoY, took oceasion to refute the charge, saying that over $11,000,000,000 had gone to Russia under the ]cnd-lease program, and that America's expenditures during the war aggre-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">gated $400,000,000,000-—money borrowed and which the people must repay. Byrnes contended that this tremendous debt did not indicate national enrichment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">.Among the interchanges, which became rather frequent as concerned the United States and the Soviet, Mr. Byrnes took occasion to say, ‘‘We will not permit admiration and. respect [for the Russian }ieoj)le] to he lessened by Mr. Molotov. We want to work with all nations. We are no!. going to gang up against any nation. But we do not intend to make all the concessions. We have not fought for a free world in order to dictate terms o£ peace to om allies or to let them dictate tenns of pence to ns.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Molotov was prompt to reply </span><span class="font9">in </span><span class="font8">a speech of his </span><span class="font6">ovn, </span><span class="font8">saying. “Mr. Byrnes has spoken in a violent and perhaps bellicose manner. There is no question of dictating decisions to the conference. Certainly it would he easier to dictate decisions, but we are doing everything to convince the conference of the justice of our opinion.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some of the more s.tai-tling and revolutionary proposals made at the conference came from the Australian delegations. Mention ltas been made of the proposal by Dr. Evatt setting forth fom fundamental considerations in the peacemaking. But the Australians were not content to set forth mere generalities. Tliev submitted an amendment with respect to reparations which aroused the ire of the Soviet representative. Dr. Walker, speaking foT Australia, proposed that an am(‘jidment with respect to reparations be passed to ( 1) create a seven-member .reparations commission; (2) determine how much a country could pay without going bankrupt; and (3) provide for bilateral reparations agreements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As the Big Four had in the Foreign Ministers Council spent much time on the subject of reparations, these suggestions were not at all welcomed by Mr. Molotov, especially in view of the fact that the Soviet was the beneficiary in most of the reparations provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another striking proposal by Australia was the formation of a comt o£ human rights which would enforce the treaties as far as individual freedoms (made a part of each treaty) were concerned. If each country can determine for itself to what extent it will see that such freedoms are observed, then, obviously, tJie clauses which guarantee such freedoms in the treaties are likely to be ineffective in practice. Both of these proposals were, however, set aside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Speed-up</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As the conference entered its fifth week, it was realized i;hat something must be done to &lt;p&lt; ed matters along, and the British urged that the deputies of the Big Four meet to </span><span class="font9">try </span><span class="font8">to accelerate ‘ the slow pace of the deliberations. But it was some time before the get-together actually tool&lt; place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some of the delays of the conference were due to misunderstandings of an apparently trifling nature. On one occasion </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font8">translator rendei'ed the word &quot;attend'’ as &lt;'purticipatp&quot;, and the Question of the actual status of the delegation referred to was discussed for two hours before the snarl was finally untangled. A good deal of heat was in evidence during the discussions of this trilling difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On another occasion the chairman of a meeting walked out in a huff, ignoring all the rules, and shouting, ar will not recognize any delegate—the meeting is adjourned.&quot; Some of the members of the committee meeting were greatly incensed by his actiom while the .American representatives laughed and suggested the chairman read the rules before the next meetbig. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the midst of all the problems that faced the conference, matters were further complicated for the American delegation by a speech made by the then United States secretary of commerce, Henry A. Wallace, to an anti-Republican rally in Madison Square Garden, New York. The speech had wide repercussions, and was seen to be a direct challenge to the policy which was being pursued by Secretary of State Byrnes at Paris. The ultimate solution of this world-shaking incident was found ii the requested resignation of Secretary Wallace and </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font8">statement by President Truman that the administration unqualifiedly supported the secretary of state at Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;Mention may be made in passing of the visit at about this t’me of James A. Farley, former chairman of the Democratic National Conunittee, to the pope. He praised the stand taJ\en by Byrnes but would not say that the pope had urged him to do so. Farley also visited Alcide de Gasperii liead of Italy’s “Christian Democratic&quot; ( Catholie) party.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On September 24 the Council of Foreign Ministers (the Big Four) finally met and agreed to recommend to the conference measures that would speed up the delfbei'ations. It was urged that the commissions finish their work by October 5, thus giving the full conference au opportunity to review then^ recommendations during the following week, and allowing the entire conference to finish its work by October 15. In order to accomplish this aim speeches were to be limited as to both number and length. The dosing date of October 15 was set in view of the forthcoming United Nations Assembly in New York October 23, which would be attended by many of the diplomats present at Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The commissions now got down to business in real earnest and by dint of evening work added to their daylight Rchedules finished theh’ work iji the appointed time. During these various commission sessions a total of $1,335,000,000 in reparations was approved to be assessed against the five defeated powers. Other matters, too, were put in shape for final review.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On October 15 the plenary sessions wound up their delilJerations by voting one by one on the 223 articles and 33 annexes in the treaties with Italyt Finland, Rumania, Hungary and Bulgaria. All of the five treaty drafts liad recommendations and suggestions added, and were now ready to be presented to the Big Four for 11nal consideration and action at their proposed meeting in New York, November 4. Further, tlris council will have to solve problems which the conference failed to solve, inulnding the Greek-Bulgarian frontier; the Trieste arrangement, its administration and its boundaries; the freedom of the Danube, and other questions, all of a vexations nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Molotov did not add to the already limited happiness of the conferees when he stated that the work of the conference was unsatisfactory. And thiR after eleven weel\s of &lt;liflcussion and stormy debate. But these eleven weeks were themselveR but a part of more than a year of deliberations, conferences and discussions, all of them still leaving the main problems nntouebpd—-those concerning the chief aggressors, Germany and Japan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The feeling of niany is expressed in the columns of the Camden, N.J., Evening </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">O'ourier,</span><span class="font8"> when it ohserved in the course of the conference a conclusion that could not have been changed at its end: “We are convinced that the only hope for peace lies in realizing that we do not have peace, tliat this is another war of nerves . </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">. . </span><span class="font8">We know all this in our hearts. Let's face it in our minds. We dare not cry 'peace, pP.ace, when there is no pence'.''</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One more thing will have to be realized by those seeking peace, and that is that only Christ Jesus the Prince of Peace and Jehovah God's Theocratic Government of Righteousness can bring peace to obedient persons of good-wilL That this will he done at the time appointed is the reliable promise of God's nnfailjng Word..</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">•While details are lacldng about developments behind tJH.1 inm curtain, considerable information has been released concerning- American progress. At White Sands, Kew Mexico, the United States is busy perfecting the space-conquering ultrasonic V-2 rocket; while elsewhere slw il' engaged in manufacturing faster submarines with target-finding torpedoes; battleships to resist atomic bombs anrl themselves discharge rocket missiles; new planes to attain a speed of </span><span class="font7">1,5110 </span><span class="font9">mph.; while one AAF official contemplates a rocket conquest of the moon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A general rule of warfare is that offense weapons spawn hetter defense weapons. But in the present held day for arms production, the killing devices have far and away outstripped any and all possible defenses lmown to man. And of all these the big rocket with atomic warhead (the warhead is the nose containing the detonator and charge) is the most staggering to contemplate. The known history of the V-2, fourteen-ton, 46-foot '•Big Ben&quot; rocket, projected by burning alcohol and liquid oxygen, is noteworthy because of destructive efficiency already accomplished. A number of V-2 rockets were fired on London at iJie time of tlw mass bombing with the V-1 or buzz bomb, and while the British were able to conibat the latter with radar location, and blanket fire, tJie V-2 was never heard, seen, nor stopped !</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">On the Mojave desert another navy testing center experiments with </span><span class="font8">firing ranges, pilotless planes (target “drones&quot; gas-driven and j’adio-controJled from the ground), and more rockets. One of these rocket experiments resembles the chassis of a handcar clamped to the rails and having three two-foot rockets ‘trig-geTed&quot; for progressive firing. When the first rocket is fu:ed the car is catapulted at terrific speed and at the firing of the third rocket the strange vehicle becomes a blurred streak attaining the fastest speed known on a horizontal rail upward of 1200 mph. At the take-off end the track is slanted upward and directed at the firing point, a mountain about six miles distant. Without explosive charges these vehicles are said to make &quot;cheese holes&quot; in concrete emplacements on the mountain.

<p><span class="font8">Just how difficult rockets and the newly developed faster planes will be to cope with is best understood by comparison of their speeds with that of sound. At 32 degrees Fall renheit sound travels in dry air about 1,087 feet per second., although its speed is 4,708 feet in water at 8 degrees Centigrade (46.2° </span><span class="font9">F.). </span><span class="font8">This is about 740 miles per hour. Tlte V-2 reaches a descent speeU of about five times the speed of sound! This ultrasonic speed makes the &quot;problem of radair traoldng and interception as agonizingly difficult as coping with the atomic explosion itself&quot;. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Passing the threshold of the speed of sound also is the new XS-1, </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font8">rocket-driven airplane designed to travel 1,700 mph. at an altitude of 75,000 feet. Already the B-3G bombers that directed B-17 drones that flew devoid of crews from Hawaii to the West coaRt are old style. Recently also the army ]s setting new records in the :sjze of planes. Up to the close of the summer of 194G the largest bomber built was the Consolidated Vultee Super Bomber XB-36. This sky giant had a wing spread of 230 feet, </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font8">fuselage 163 feet long, and is propelled by six 3,000-horsepower engines. An mmsnal device, the circulation of air through the hollow steel blades prevents ice from forming which had frequently impeded progress in subzero temperahires. aJso recently built is the Howard Hughes Hercules with plywood hull of 214 feet, a cruising speed of 175 mph.. and, while designed to carry war cargo, it could accommodate 700 passengers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Development of Submarines</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Meanwhile the navy is not at all satis-ned witli their submarines. Success against. the Japanes . and German shipping was due, so they aver, to mass production and numbers rather than quality of submarines. In quality botli these Axis powers siupassed the United States. Before the war's end the Germans had developed n true ••submersible&quot; that by menns of a breathing tuhe (“sclnorcheP') could cruise across the Atlantic at periscope depth. Two of the handicaps were largely overcome by the U-boat type 26, which fortunately was never pToduced by the Nazis. With </span><span class="font9">a </span><span class="font8">submerged displacement of less than 2,000 tons it had a submerged speed of 24 knots (slightly less thnn 28 rniles pet’ hour), faster than any convoy. Further, it was practically invisible because of anti-radar paint on the breathing tube and the periscope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Besides torpedo-carrying submarines the Germans and the Japanese developed other types of underwater craft. The Nazis designed a submarine to rai’i’y 400 tons of rubber in underwater Ijilges, and underwater oil tankers. While the Japanese, in addition to building tbl'ee of the largest underwater craft ever launched, built •'mother&quot; submarines for launching midget submarines; cargo carriers •and submarine troopsJiips capable of landing 120 men. Their giant of the seas, the 1-400, largest ''tin fish&quot; ever launched, had </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font8">surface displacement of 4,663 tons, uml carried three bombing planes ead of which in turn carried 1,600 pounds of</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">destruction. This monster was designed to homb the Pana:mn Canal and American cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Just how much farther the submarine may be developed in speed, depth of submergence, and striking power by adaptation of nuclear energy, rocket or jet propulsion can he vei*7 dimly dis cerned. Besides atomic bombs the submarine of the futme may also be used to spread bacteriological warfare. It ap</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">-</span><span class="font8">peaTs as another weapon for destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A United Press dispatch published in the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font9"> of November </span><span class="font8">8, 1946, </span><span class="font9">told of plans for electric torpedoes that can be fired from 1,000 feet beneath the sea and find tlieir targets through automatic homing devices. Westinghouse Electric is making contract with naval ordnance for work on the missiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">.As fahnlous as are the present accomplishments or man, his dreams of space conquest are even more so. According to the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">World-Telegram,</span><span class="font9"> July </span><span class="font8">30, 1946, </span><span class="font9">the Army Air Force missile expert said ''they expected to shoot a rocket to the moon within </span><span class="font8">18 </span><span class="font9">months''. According to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Collier's,</span><span class="font9"> September 7, </span><span class="font8">1946, </span><span class="font9">author G. Edward Pendray describes some of the difficulties which must he overcome: perfecting a rocket with ''liberation'' speed of 7 miles per second required to leave the planet earth; creation of moon suits with their own atmosphere, moisture, pressure and temperature equalizers (the moon has neither water nor atmosphere, and temperatme changes span abo</span><span class="font8">u</span><span class="font9">t 500 degrees F., boiling to super-subzero). Such equipment, though weighing 700 pounds on earth, would weigh only </span><span class="font8">140 </span><span class="font9">pounds on the moon, due to the lesser gravitational pull of the moon. The writer conceives that the moon would finally be colonized, and forti1ie&lt;l for defense against marauders from Mars. Man is again invading the realm, of the supremacy </span><span class="font8">reserved </span><span class="font9">for </span><span class="font8">Jehovah when he irnagirws: •'So </span><span class="font9">far as sovereign power is concerned, therefore, control of the moon in the interplanetary world of the atomic future coulU mean military control </span><span class="font8">of </span><span class="font9">our whole portion of the solar system/' Man will not reach this fahulous achievement. Even while one branch contemplates space conquest, another branch of the army estimates that man cannot live iji the ajr at speeds mueJi greater than </span><span class="font8">750 </span><span class="font9">miles per hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It must be evident that man should turn his eyes away from future ways to kill and to commit suicide more effectively. and give attention to .Jehovah's announcement that the peace-lovers of this generation may live forever, if they follow divine directions </span><span class="font8">. </span><span class="font9">“T have set before thee life and death) the blessing and the curse: therefore choose life, that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed; to love Jehovah thy Godi to obey his voice, and </span><span class="font8">to </span><span class="font9">cleave unto him; for that is thy life, and the length of thy days/'—Deuteronomy </span><span class="font8">30: 19, 20, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Am</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Stan. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">V</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">er.,</span><span class="font9"> margin.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">A young </span><span class="font9">girl that has ''gone wrong&quot; finds herself with child. She </span><span class="font8">becomes </span><span class="font9">desperate.

<p><span class="font9">And what iR his fee t All he aslcs is that the girl sign an agreement to give up her hahy when it is delivered.

<p><span class="font9">The estimate iR that in </span><span class="font8">1938 </span><span class="font9">the</span><span class="font8">r</span><span class="font9">e </span><span class="font8">were 16,000 </span><span class="font9">adoptions made. How mnnv were obtained from the babv •bootleggers&quot; is not known, since t</span><span class="font8">h</span><span class="font9">ere are other sources that have a surplus of babies. The va</span><span class="font7">r</span><span class="font8">i</span><span class="font9">ous states have what are known as child adoption agencies; as, for example, the Child Placing nnd Adoption Conunittee, Spence-Chapin Adoption Service, Placing Out Department of the Fou</span><span class="font8">n</span><span class="font9">dling Hospital, Catholic Home Bureau, or the Free Synagogue Child Adoption Committee. Though some of these agencif'</span><span class="font6">s </span><span class="font9">nre financed by private interests and oi’gnnizatitms, they are approved and unde </span><span class="font7">r </span><span class="font9">the supervision of tlle st.:'lte.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The history of child adoption upon which these agencies are founded goes back nearly a hundred years to the time of C. L. Bract-, who &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the New</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">York Children's Aid ::-;ocieh in </span><span class="font8">1853. </span><span class="font9">Instead of placing homeless and needv children in orphanages </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">B</span><span class="font9">raee place</span><span class="font8">d </span><span class="font9">them in private homes. That raised a dispute as to whether tlte private home with </span><span class="font8">ltti </span><span class="font9">irregular form </span><span class="font8">of </span><span class="font9">parental care was better than the regimented, </span><span class="font8">heart</span><span class="font9">less and machine-like life of au institution. Not until the turning of the century </span><span class="font8">• </span><span class="font9">was the question finally settled in favor of the private home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In </span><span class="font8">1899 </span><span class="font9">Pre</span><span class="font8">s</span><span class="font9">ident Theodore Roosevelt called a meetijig of </span><span class="font8">200 </span><span class="font9">delegatrR from everv state in the Union to discuss the problem. The platform they unanimously adopted </span><span class="font7">said, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The carefully selected foster home </span><span class="font8">is </span><span class="font7">for the normal child the best substitute for the natural home. Such homes should </span><span class="font8">U(' </span><span class="font7">selected by a most carciul process of iuvestigation, carried </span><span class="font9">on </span><span class="font7">by Sklled </span><span class="font8">agents </span><span class="font7">through p</span><span class="font9">erso</span><span class="font7">nal investigation, and with </span><span class="font8">Uue </span><span class="font7">regard to the </span><span class="font9">re</span><span class="font7">ligious faith of the child. After children are placed in homes, adequate visitation. with careful consideration of the </span><span class="font9">p</span><span class="font7">h</span><span class="font9">y</span><span class="font7">si</span><span class="font9">cal</span><span class="font7">, mental, moral, and spiritual </span><span class="font9">tr</span><span class="font7">aini</span><span class="font9">ng </span><span class="font7">and deve</span><span class="font9">l</span><span class="font7">op</span><span class="font6"></span><span class="font7">ment of eaCh child on the part of </span><span class="font9">t</span><span class="font7">he responsible home-finding agency, is essential.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Since tlwn adoption agencies have followed these principles more or less. But are they right 1 If so, theu, why have they not prevented the racketeers from robbing the cradles !</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">High Time to Investigate</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Several committees have studied the adoption p</span><span class="font8">r</span><span class="font9">oblem</span><span class="font6">, </span><span class="font9">one of the newest of which is sponsored by tl</span><span class="font6">i</span><span class="font9">e United Hos-pi tal Fund, the Welfare Council and the New York Academy of Medicine. But, so far, these social workers that have set out to solve this &quot;great human problem'' have come up with the wrong answers. One of these is a sort of &quot;adopt-a-child&quot; campaign in which </span><span class="font8">the </span><span class="font9">adoption agencies are advertised in an effort to make them popular to both unwed mothers and the adopting public. The idea is that this will bring the surplus baby </span><span class="font8">supply into </span><span class="font9">the </span><span class="font8">hands </span><span class="font9">of welfare agencies for distribution instead of letting the &quot;black market&quot; handle it. The public, they think, should buy their liabies as well as their meat from a licensed dealer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some think the shortcomings of the adoption agencies are the cause for existing conditions. The charge is that the agencies are understaffed because of insufficient funds. Others advocate stricter state lawsi forbidding the adoption of children except through approved agencies. Increase our funds, give us more help, and elamp down on all other ave-nnes of adoption, and then we can put </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font9">stop to the baby racket, say the welfare committees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But right here is where social workers miss the whole point. One o£ the reasons why the “black market” is patronized is so tlutt existing regulations and restrictions may be by-pa::;sed and avoided. People are willing to pay extra in order to cut short the &quot;red tape'' Of investigation into their private lives. The wife of a soldier overseas who becomes unfaithful and reckless is found with child. Fearing publicity that might be incurred through the welfare channels she seel\s another way of clisposing of her &quot;harvest of wild oats&quot;. Consequently increased legal restriction is not the remedy, for there is a general social hi'eakdown in law and order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Instead of striking at the underlying causes for this adoption problem many sincere social workers race around talking about new vices that sprout up here and there. </span><span class="font8">Wliy </span><span class="font9">not strike at the roots of social delinquency from which these unwanted babies springl There is a general abandonment of all social. moral anU ethical standards by the </span><span class="font8">i'3 </span><span class="font9">modern &quot;'fTee love&quot; world (more appropriately, free lust), which sells its &quot;love babies&quot; for a thousand dollars a head, many of whom (poor things) are infected and cursed from their conception with the bligltt of venereal disease. And yet, for shame! these &quot;investignting&quot; connnittees n1l't&gt;r no criticism of Hiwh wicked practices. If they realJy want to put an end to the adoptiou “black market'' let them cut off the racketeers' supply of babies. Let them strike at the whoredom in the land !</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Notwithstanding her feeble efforts to care for the abandoned babies and fn-tiierless children Christendom stands condemned before the judgment throne of God. By the mouth of llis prophet </span><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font9">eremiah, </span><span class="font10">J</span><span class="font9">ehovali says: “ For among my people are found wicked men </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• • • </span><span class="font9">they judge not the canse, the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">cause of</span><span class="font9"> the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">fatherless,</span><span class="font9"> yet they prosper; and the right of the needy d(i they noi judge. Shall I not visit for the:-;e things! sait.h the </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font9">: shall not my </span><span class="font8">smil </span><span class="font9">be avenged on such a nation a:-; thisf' </span><span class="font10">(5: 26-29) </span><span class="font9">Yes indeed, and shortly now, at the battle of Armageddon. At that time God will destroy Christendom and all of hej‘ abominations, for she cannot be n:fonned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">So rejoice in tlUs knowledge, you ppo-ple who sorrow over the orphan's plight today. In the righteous New World that will replace the::; present wicked one, children will be the blessed charges of those who beget them. No more will orphans and little ones be east out, nor will they be boug'ht and sold over the counter, nor will the sacred fruit of the womb be treated like a </span><span class="font8">stray </span><span class="font9">cat or dog. Men and women will rejoice in their children, concerning whom it will be sajd: &quot;As arrows are iu the hand of a mighty man; so are ch:ildren of the youth.

Their eyes are in reality cameras, but because they are of such a high ordeT people seldom consider the great similarity between the two. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font9">little com</span><span class="font7">parison, therefore, </span><span class="font9">between the </span><span class="font8">camera </span><span class="font9">and the eye wil prove enlightening and profitable to both the photographer and the layman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Practically all cameras, whether they are midget bantams, folding or box types or whether they are ;umbo press cameras, have four principal features in common : the lens, the shutter, the dia&quot; phragm, and the film. Of the four the </span><span class="font7">lens </span><span class="font9">is generally considered the most </span><span class="font10">im-</span><span class="font9">pmrtant single feature </span><span class="font7">of a </span><span class="font9">camera.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The simplest and cheapest lens is only a single piece of glass convexed on both sides. Lenses that correct distortion, astigmatism, and color are made of four to seven individual elements that are cemented and mounted together in </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font9">single unit. Those of great precision are very costly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The </span><span class="font7">shwtte-r </span><span class="font9">of a camera is usually composed of overlapping leafiike plntes that are operated by springs or gears </span><span class="font7">ui </span><span class="font9">such a way that they momentarily open and close. Common shutter speeds for</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font18"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Your Camera</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">the better class of cameras range from one second to one five-hundredth of a second, though speeds of one-thousandth of a second are not uncommon for focal-plane shutters. The ordinary &quot;snapshot&quot; is about one twenty-flfth of a second.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">TJie </span><span class="font7">diaphragm </span><span class="font9">is made up of fan-like plates so arranged that they can be </span><span class="font8">Bpread out to form </span><span class="font9">an </span><span class="font7">opening </span><span class="font9">or aperture in the center through which the amount of light entering tlte camera can be controlled. This permits the taking of pictures under a wide variety of light conditions. Uore experienced photographers also nse the diaphragm as a control for what is calletl the &quot;depth </span><span class="font7">of </span><span class="font9">fomu:.&quot; in the picture, sinee the smaUer the diaphragm opening the greater the' depth of foeus. Tho majority of cameras have the shutter and diaphragm mounted between the front and back elements of the lens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One can have the best lens in </span><span class="font7">the </span><span class="font9">world, the finest shutter with a precision-made diaphragm, but if there is no film or sensitized material in the camera one might as well try to take pictures </span><span class="font7">with.li </span><span class="font9">a bow and arrow. The filin then is the central feature of tie camera around which the other parts are built for the purpose of recording </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font9">light image. The fihn is more fragile and delicate than the expensive lens.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>How Wonderful Is the Eye!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">More delicate and far more miraculous than any camera is the human eye. Essentially it has the same four parts that a camera has, but of a much higher </span><span class="font8">or</span><span class="font9">der, with greater sensitivity, versatility and utility than possessed by any camera yet devised by man. </span><span class="font7">A </span><span class="font9">comparison between the two will quickly disclose the udvantages and superiority of the eye over the camera.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The eyelid that covers over the eye &quot;camera&quot; serves both as the carrying case and as the shutter. Its &quot;shutter</span><span class="font7">speed&quot; </span><span class="font9">is ahvnt one-fifth of a second. The white or opaque part </span><span class="font10">of </span><span class="font9">the eye is oalled thu sclera by medical men, and covers over about five-sLxths of the spheroidal globe, aml acts like the box or heUows of a camera, keeping out all light except that which enters through the lens. The clear, horny part in the front of the eye that malms up the remaining :;ixth of the area is calied the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">cornea.</span><span class="font9"> It refracts or bends the light rays </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ro</span><span class="font9"> tliat they pass through the lens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The diaphragm, or, as it is called, the is found in front of the lens. iVlieu one says that a person has blue, brown or gray eyes one is referring to the color of the iri:;;. Like the diaphragm in the </span><span class="font7">camera </span><span class="font9">the iris expands or contracts to regulate the amount of light that enters the eye through the hole or aperture in the middle called the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">p’upil.</span><span class="font9"> Similar to the entrance of </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font9">cave tlte pupil appears to be a black spot in the center of the eye because the interior of the eye is black, like the cave. The expausion and contract tion of the irh; may be observed by looking </span><span class="font7">at </span><span class="font9">the size of a person's pupil in the daytime and again at night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Behind the iris is the </span><span class="font7">lens. </span><span class="font8">It </span><span class="font9">is a crystalline substance, transparent, like gltss, and double-convex in shape, that focuses the light rays ou the back part of the eye in tile position corresponding to that occupied by tlte film in a camera. This “&quot;screen&quot; upon which the image is formed is called the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">reti’na,</span><span class="font9"> nnd, ns in the case of the film in the camera, it is the most sensitive as well as the most important part of the eye. The retina is a soft membrnne having in it an infinite number of rods or cones that receive the light energy and transform it into nerve stimulus that is relayed to the hrain.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>More </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Wonderful than Any Camera!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When it comes to versatility and speed and simplicity of operation no manmade camera will compare -with the eye. The eye, mounted in a Iwad that ean be turned in any dh^ection by the universal joints of its neck, plus the fact that it can be quickly rolJed </span><span class="font7">in </span><span class="font9">it::; ::;ocket by its six controlling muscles, makes the eye better tltan any camera mounted on a tripod head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The eye has its own built-in light exposure meter that automatically adjusts its ctiapluagin, the </span><span class="font10">iris. </span><span class="font9">The eye will also record picturfls over a greater range of light levels, and </span><span class="font7">with </span><span class="font9">much greater speed. Rush from the bright outdoors into </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font9">dark hallway and in less time than you conld load a camera with film </span><span class="font8">your </span><span class="font9">eyes </span><span class="font7">win </span><span class="font9">be taking pictures </span><span class="font7">llnder </span><span class="font9">conditions that would require time-exposures with a camera even </span><span class="font7">It </span><span class="font9">it was equipped with </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font9">high-speed film ancl supei:fast lens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The ingenious method used to focus the image </span><span class="font10">on </span><span class="font9">the retina surpasses any automatic synchronized range-finder that science can devi.Rc. Fix yom- eye on an object fifty feet away </span><span class="font8">a::; </span><span class="font9">you walk toward it. The lenses </span><span class="font7">n </span><span class="font9">your eyes will start bulging out, giving them </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font9">greater curve as </span><span class="font7">y</span><span class="font10">o</span><span class="font9">u </span><span class="font10">approach </span><span class="font9">it. Yet, so smooth is the constant change in focm; in your eyes that yon are entirely unconscious of it. Moreover, the eye </span><span class="font7">gives </span><span class="font9">your brain pictures in three dimensions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Wljo </span><span class="font9">will compare the marvels of modern color photog.raphy with the normal human eye nnd say that it is equal or superior? No one with knowledge and understanding. At the best, color photography is such a poor imitation of the real thing that the eye can telJ the difference at a glance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Compared with the eye the camera is a newcomer to the Held </span><span class="font8">of </span><span class="font9">photography. One of the latest developments is a huge hundred-pound telephoto lens liuilt for aerial photography. Its principal Jea-ture is a built-in heating device with thermostatic controls for bjgJi-altitnde flying. But the human eye had it first— its own built-in self-controlled heating system. Likewise the eye was first to have vel)ow filters to cut down on the ultraviolet rays. This yellow coloring matter is found in the eye's lens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And let us not overlook the &quot;darl{-</span><span class="font10">room'” </span><span class="font9">where the &quot;'film&quot; from the eve is processed, that is, </span><span class="font8">the </span><span class="font9">brain. On October 15, 1946, it was demonstrated that a motion picture eonld be taken, developed, and flashed on a screen, all in 15 seconds. But still there is </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">us</span><span class="font9"> much difference between this speed and that of the eye as there is between the speed of the pony express and a P-80 jet plane. Tile eye can take a picture, rush it to the brain, and have it ((developed&quot; and hn-printed hi less than a second. And what about the mind's '•negative 'file'' </span><span class="font8">1 </span><span class="font9">Deep in its reeesses it has cno rmons files, yet they are not bulky or clumsy. Instantly an image that has been recorded for many years ean be flashed on the mind's screen with the same heantv and brilliance as ‘vlten first inade. bnlv tJiese wonders of the cerebral vaults surpass the marvels of the eye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In spite of all the defects necessitating the wearing of corrective glasses, the average eye today is still more marvelous than man-made cameras. It is true, great advances will yet be made in photographic cameras in the future, for men who live </span><span class="font8">in </span><span class="font9">the New </span><span class="font8">W</span><span class="font9">orld </span><span class="font8">will </span><span class="font9">be able to make cameras a hundred times as good as these of today.

<p><span class="font9">T INLINE anything spokeu in the Hebrew Scriptures from Genesis to Malachi, Jesus of Nazareth spoke to His disciples continually about the Father, ''yonr </span><span class="font8">Father </span><span class="font9">which is in heaven.&quot; Differently from the way John the Baptist taught his disciples, Jesus taught His followers to pray, saying: &quot;When ye pTay, say, 6ur Father which art in heaven, Hallowed </span><span class="font7">be </span><span class="font8">thy </span><span class="font9">name.&quot; (Luke 11: 1, 2) On the day of His resurrection from the dead Jesus said to Mary Magdalene: i'Be iiot clinging to me, for not yet have I ascended unto the Father; but be going mito my disciples, and say unto them, I am ascending unto my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.&quot; (John 20:17, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham, </span><span class="font9">margin) Did all sucli instruction and such speaking concerning the heavenly </span><span class="font8">Father mean that Jesus’ </span><span class="font9">disciples had already been begotten by a heavenly life-force anU were children of God? Scripturally the answer must be a No.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There is no question that the disciples had consecrated themselves to do God's will according as </span><span class="font10">J</span><span class="font9">esus taught them and set tliem the example. Peter said to Jesus in behalf of himself and His fellow disciples: &quot;Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we Imve </span><span class="font8">therefore t&quot; </span><span class="font9">(Matthew 19: 27) </span><span class="font8">At </span><span class="font9">His last supper with His faithful ajjostles Jesus said: ‘‘Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations. And I appoint unto you a Jringdom, as my Father bath appointed unto me.&quot; (Liike 22: 28, 29) Those diaeiples were consecrated and fully devoted to God; of that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">DECEMBER </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">8, 1946 </span><span class="font9">there can </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ihc</span><span class="font9"> no question. However, their being consecrated to God did not entail upoii them an innnediatB Ijegettul by Jehovah God as Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During all the time that they were with .Jesus, including the forty days after His resurrection and until His being taken up from them into heaven, Jesus taught His disciples about God's kingdom. Bot even with their consecration aml their knowledge of Kingdom truth, there was one </span><span class="font8">thing </span><span class="font9">lacking. They must be born, not of the water of trntli only, but also of that heavenly life-forcei in order to he l)orn again, from above, and to become the spiritual sons of God. Til then they were simply prospective sons of God, that is, consecrated ones ili the way to become God's children. The spirit or active force of God must yet testify to them that they were the children </span><span class="font8">o£ </span><span class="font9">God. Jesus had that testimony of the spirit: •■for he whom God hath </span><span class="font8">sent </span><span class="font9">speaketli the words of God: foT he giv-eth not the spirit by measure. The Father loveth the Son, and bath given all things into his hand.&quot; As to other persons then, Jesus saki: &quot;If any man thu’st, let him come unto me and drink. He that Ijelieveth on me, as the serip-ture hath said, out of Jus belly shall •flow rivers of living water. But this spake he of the spirit, which they that believed on </span><span class="font8">w</span><span class="font9">e</span><span class="font8">r</span><span class="font9">e </span><span class="font8">to </span><span class="font9">receive : for the spirit was not yet given; because .Jesus was not yet gloriled.&quot;—John 3:3±, 35 and 7: 37-39, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font8"> Standard </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Version,</span><span class="font9"> margin.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">THE </span><span class="font7">National </span><span class="font9">City </span><span class="font7">Bank of New York has discovered that man </span><span class="font8">is a </span><span class="font7">lazy animal but t</span><span class="font8">ha</span><span class="font7">t he likes to eut. From its October, 1946, report on economic conditions and kindred sub</span><span class="font10">j</span><span class="font7">ects come these wails that indicate the hankel's' point of view:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Instead of relying upon work and co-operation to improve economic conditions, people have tmmed increasingly to the Federal Gov-ei’iunent, but gove^rnment efforts to help ^ve been in many cnses </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font7">only aborthre but harmful. In the effort to prevent runaway prices, ceilings are maintained at pointe where they suppress production and create bottlenecks blocking other production. In the effort— now seen to have been based on wrong premises—to avoid deflation and give nn incentive to labor, government contributed to wageprice inflation.In the effort to eushion -qn-employment, it put subsidies on not worlcing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The feeling has gained ground that these difficulties arc basic, and that </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">sound and lasting prosperity is unattainable </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">until some</span><span class="font7">how these conditions change and all groups of the population accept the truism that economic j)rogress is achieved only through work and co-operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With all due allowances, however, it remains true that too many people have been content to sit back and live off the Oovern-ment rather than take jobs that arc offered and hold on to them. Almost everyone k-nows of some instances of ab^s. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">General </span><span class="font7">Bradley, Administrator of Veterans Affairs, Ihas referred publicly </span><span class="font8">to </span><span class="font7">the minority of veterans who are not really seeking work.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">'f!t </span><span class="font7">s fashionable </span><span class="font8">at </span><span class="font7">the m^^nt </span><span class="font8">to argue </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font7">the carrot is the more important oi the two : incentive&quot; is the watchword, and all cla.ses of the community are busy arguing that if only they are given </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font7">little hit more in the way of incentive (at the expense of the rest of the co^ro\tnity) they will respond with more activity. From miners to company promoters the basic argumcnt is t</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">h</span><span class="font7">e same. It may be true that one reason why people </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">wil </span><span class="font7">not work </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">hard </span><span class="font7">is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font7">they cnn buy so little with their wages. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">But it </span><span class="font7">s much more true that they </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">wil </span><span class="font7">not work ^beca^ </span><span class="font8">t</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">h</span><span class="font7">e fear of the sack has vanished from the land and because the Bankruptcy Court is a depressed aiea. If an active and progressive economy is to be founded on the frailties of human nature both (the carrot and the stick) ure needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">'•But the whole drift of British society for two generations past has been to whittle a’vay both at the carrot and the stick, until now very little of either is left. Commercial </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">snceess </span><span class="font7">it-soself has been traced, in the eyes oC wide circles of society, into a positive disgrace. There is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a.</span><span class="font7"> eousplra.cy of In^bour, ^pital and the state to deny enterprise its reward. 'the state takes it away in high taxation. The trade unions will permit labour-saving devices only provided thut they do not in fact save labour. Nor is the attitude of organized capital any better. The industrialist who discovers a. way of making better things more cheaply (which is weflt he ill sent on earth </span><span class="font8">to </span><span class="font7">do) is deprived </span><span class="font9">by </span><span class="font8">t</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">h</span><span class="font7">e stilte of all </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">pecuniary </span><span class="font7">return </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">by his own colleagues of any social reward. Instead of a carrot he gets a raspberry . ..</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">('The same process has been applied to the wage earner as well. Together with the leYel-ing down of incomes there </span><span class="font8">has </span><span class="font7">goue a leveling up </span><span class="font8">of </span><span class="font7">wages. Day rates and &quot;guaranteed weE^ks&quot; steaUily replace payment by results, with the deliberate iuteution of ensuring that the slacker shall earn al:l much </span><span class="font8">as </span><span class="font7">the hard-worker. The margin of adv</span><span class="font9">an</span><span class="font7">tage </span><span class="font9">that </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font7">skilled artisan secures over an unskilled labourer </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• • • </span><span class="font7">is only a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">small fraction of whw t it was before the</span><span class="font8"> First </span><span class="font7">Gelman War </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">. •. </span><span class="font7">Tlte </span><span class="font8">whole </span><span class="font7">effect of the growth iu strength of the trade union movement —indeed, one can say its deliberate intention—has been to divorce the worker's income from any dependence on the efforts </span><span class="font8">he </span><span class="font7">makes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The question, indeed, i^—as the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Economist </span><span class="font7">puts it—&quot;How can the earrot and the atiek be combined with a plellSaut life for the donkey ?&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">T</span><span class="font8">HE </span><span class="font9">request made by the department of agriculture to farmers of the United States for a </span><span class="font8">13 </span><span class="font9">percent increase in production of pork in </span><span class="font8">1947 </span><span class="font9">will be welcomed by bacon-hungry citizens as something that makes s</span><span class="font6">e</span><span class="font9">n</span><span class="font7">s</span><span class="font6">e </span><span class="font9">at </span><span class="font8">l</span><span class="font9">ast</span><span class="font7">. </span><span class="font9">It will also Le recognized as a long-delayed admission from Washington of the ridiculous state of unbalance tlmt has developed </span><span class="font8">in </span><span class="font9">this country in the years tliat a</span><span class="font7">rt</span><span class="font9">ificial controls have been applied by Washington theorists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">It</span><span class="font9"> is amu</span><span class="font8">s</span><span class="font9">ing to note that this new exhortation comes from the same department (with a di</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ff</span><span class="font9">er</span><span class="font8">e</span><span class="font9">nt head) that early in the new deal </span><span class="font7">ara </span><span class="font9">required the destruction of </span><span class="font6">mmmu</span><span class="font9">hered piglets. Henry Aga</span><span class="font7">r</span><span class="font9">d Wallace was chief of the department in those days. At the same time farmers were being paid to refrain from raising </span><span class="font8">wheat </span><span class="font9">and government required the plo</span><span class="font7">w </span><span class="font9">ing under of cotton. All this was in furtherance of tJie so-called &quot;economy of </span><span class="font8">scarcity&quot;, keyed ou the </span><span class="font9">scant-brained concept that higher prices were allimportant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Part of the world is starving todav and part is on sliort rations because of the application of this theory. t.lhe surplus which could have been accumulated would bave stood us in good stead </span><span class="font8">hi </span><span class="font9">war aud would be invaluable now. But the th</span><span class="font8">e</span><span class="font9">orists were in power.

<p><span class="font9">In spite of the conclusive demonstrations that the natural laws are the best and that farming cannot be done successfully by remote political control, tampering of </span><span class="font7">t</span><span class="font9">he soi’t that has b</span><span class="font7">r</span><span class="font9">ou</span><span class="font8">gh</span><span class="font9">t </span><span class="font7">the </span><span class="font9">country to its present predicament still goes on to an extent. Not many months ago the department of agriculture put on pressure to have output of eggs reduced. There we</span><span class="font7">r</span><span class="font9">e going to be far too many of them. Any housewife knows how abundant eggs are today. And then comes the current request </span><span class="font8">for </span><span class="font9">more pigs, as if the farmer would not have recognized the iieed—and the opportunity— without coaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If </span><span class="font9">the department would just let things alone, we are of the opinion that a normal balance would </span><span class="font8">be </span><span class="font9">re</span><span class="font6">s</span><span class="font8">t</span><span class="font9">ored in a rea</span><span class="font8">s</span><span class="font9">onable l</span><span class="font8">e</span><span class="font9">ngth of tim</span><span class="font8">e</span><span class="font9">. But, with a big pig crop, there will be sore temptation to clamp down on the raising of corn.

(Jolm 3:</span><span class="font7">H), 20; 8: </span><span class="font9">+O) Certainly they could show no legitimate cau.se for tlwir venom.—.T olm 15: 24, 25; Psalms 35: </span><span class="font8">19 </span><span class="font9">; 69</span><span class="font7">:</span><span class="font9">4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now. nineteen centuries later, clouds of religious hate still hover over this old woi’lU. No surprise, this, for Jesus told His followers, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">‘‘J </span><span class="font9">f the world hate </span><span class="font8">you, </span><span class="font9">ye know that it lmted me before it hated yon.'' He positively said His followers would be hated, as </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font9">sjgn in these &quot;last days&quot;. (Jolm 15: 18-20; .Matthew 10: 22; 24: 9) That sign is now very manifest in the Canadian province of Quebec.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">In Quebec Jehovah </span><span class="font8">'s </span><span class="font9">witnesses seek to preaeli tile gosvel or good news of Christ's kingdom. It will bring life to the hearers if theY obey. Jeljovah&gt;s wi tnesses preach tie same message of Kingdom announcement that Christ preached; their methods of preaching match those laid down by their examplar, Jel'ms. And for so doing these humble house-to-house ministers are likewise 'hated without a cause'. In Quebec TeJi-giotis opposition to God's VVord and to freedom of worship has stormed violently for the past few years, and clouds of religions hate show no signs of let-tiiig up in their downpour and blowing over. As the situation became more and more acute, the question that confronted Jehovah’s witnesses there was, w1iat shall we do7 Answer carne at </span><span class="font7">t</span><span class="font9">he time of the 'Theocratic Assembly in Montreal, Quebec, November 2 and 3, 194G.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">The evening session convened with more stirring Kingdom songs, and soon led to the discourse “Whose Witnesses'&quot; by C. D.

<p><span class="font9">Songs and experiences started at 2 </span><span class="font6">: </span><span class="font9">00 p.m. carried over to 2 </span><span class="font8">: </span><span class="font9">30 p.m., when </span><span class="font8">H. C. </span><span class="font9">Covington launched into a discourse on &quot;Freedom&quot;. Sentence hv sentence, in running style, the speech was translated into French for the enlightenment of many French-speaking witnesses present. The key point was that Quebec province has </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font9">Freedom </span><span class="font8">of </span><span class="font9">Worship Act just as strong in its guarantees of freedom as Uoes the United States in its Constitution, and that Jehovah's witnesses woulU push their fight for freedom. </span><span class="font8">At 3: 15 </span><span class="font9">the speaker relinquished his microphone to the Society's president, the French translator remaining stationed in front of his microphone to give a Tunning translation of wliat was </span><span class="font8">to follow.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Is </span><span class="font8">it </span><span class="font7">love for God that moves Que</span><span class="font8">b</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font8">c </span><span class="font7">mob</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">s </span><span class="font7">to tear copies of Grod's Word, the Bible, to shreds and huru them in the llarnes ? Is it an evidence of love for Christ for these same religious mobs to club and stone Olirist’s followers, houud them throughout the province, damage their property, and otherwise go on deliriously wild rampages of vandulism against Christ’s brethren? Did not Christ say: uAs long as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me&quot; 1 (Mattliew </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">25:4:0, Dmwy)</span><span class="font7"> Did the parish priests that have stood by and approvingly witnessed such outrages show regard or disregard for Ohi’is-tian principles f And what about Quebec's law-making bodies that frame misehief by law to &quot;get&quot; those not favored by the ruling elementsY aud her police forces that ullow mobsters to riot unchecked while they nrrest the Christian victims, sometimes .lor no more than distributing Bibles or leaflets with Bible quotations, or even as these followers of Christ wall{ along the streets or wait for a streetcar¥ and what of her judges that impose heavy fines and prison sentences against them and heap abusive language upon them, and deliberately follow a malicious policy of again and again postponng cases to tie up tens of thousands of dollars in exorbitant bails and keep hundreds of eases pending? Do such legislators and police aiid judges of Quebec thereby show their love for freedom? Honestly, do you think such fruits are borne by love, or by hate? &quot;By their fruits you shall know them.&quot; —Matthew 7: 20, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Douay</span><span class="font7"> Version </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a torrential downpour all the foregoing violences and injnstices l'ain down daily upon Jehovah's witnesses in Quebec province. Now do we hoar you say to yourself, “Ah, Jehovah's witnesses l I thought so. They are always in trouble&quot; ? Becam;e they are often persecuted, or because they are an unpopular minority, or because they may have been misrepresented to you by incorrect reports, that is not just cause for a hasty dismissal of the matter. On the contrary, it is all the stronger reason for fair-mindcd persons to hear out all the evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Were not Christ and early Christians persecuted often 1 an unpopular minority 1 and grossly misrepresented by religious liars Y If you cau identify enemies by their fruits, by the fl'lits of Jehovah's witnosses you may also know them as true followtn'S of Christ. Both the message they preach and the methods by which they preach it have full backing and foundation in the Bible, as you will soon see 1 you allow one of Jehovah's witnesses to explain them to you instead of listening to the lying and prejudicial reports of the witnesses' perseeutors. But neither space nor subject permits full diseuBsion of these matters here, and suclr discussion is not at all necessary. It does not alter the issue here at stake. Whether you agree or disagree with the witnesses, you do know for a certainty that it does not show love for God, Clu'ist, Bible principles and freedom to bun Bibles and to mob and stone and falsely arrest and imprison those endeavoring to serve God. Such deed'! are the outgrowth of burning hate, and cause the finger of sham.e to point to Canada.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font7"> brief sketch of only a few of the instances of persecution of and violence against Jehovah's witnesses in Quebec province is now submitted as concrete evidence. These fnets are well known to many of the inhabitants of Quebec, and can be proved. Listen :</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Lachine, September </span><span class="font9">15, </span><span class="font7">1945, mob action blazed fiercely against Jehovah's witnesses tlS they advertised the holding of a Bible lecture. Street assaults reaGhed their height when the large Catholic Dlob laid siege to the shop and home of Joseph Letellier, who, with three other witnesses, was inside. The plate glass display window was shattered and rocks and tomatoes poured through the windows in a steady stream. Witness Joyce was struck full in the chest, and as Witness Letellier tried to phone police one vandal dashed in and smashed the elderly mau in the face. intlict-ing a long gash on hs face and knocking his glasses to the floor. The witnesses barricaded themselves in and endured the rain of rocks for more than five hours. Until midnight, two hours after other witnesses had helped the besieged ones oscape under cover of darkness through a </span><span class="font8">iiiu'iow </span><span class="font7">25-foot rear pussage, irate mobsters bombarded the building. The entire front was wrecked, and the valuable clocks inside the shop were destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the moboeratie city of' Chateauguay, September 9, 1945, witnesses were advertising </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">Bible lecture to be hdd that afternoon in City Hall Park. City officials instigated the unlawful arrest of fifteen witnesses and decreed they could not usc City Hall Park for the Bible talk. The lecture location was moved to the yard of R. W. Weaner's private home. Some 125 attended the lecture to hear, but by starting time a mob of 1,200 were there to break up. They had brought along a truck loaded with tomatoes and potatoes, and to these missiles added a generous sprinkling of stones as the barrage gol imder way. Two big fire sirens had been brought, and these were used to drown out the speaker's voice. In van did the witnesses appeal to Provincial Police who had arrived following the emergency cull to Montreal. The meeting broke np amid violence, and damngc to the Wcaner home was heavy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Previously laid plans called for anothen Bil)Je lecture in Chateanguay the Sunday following. This time the city's mob-ruled officials arrested </span><span class="font8">17 </span><span class="font7">witnesses (Quebec police never molest the mobsters), &lt;uid a mob of 1,500 was on hand at the Wcaner home to break up the second meeting. Nnt satisfied with throwing tomatoes and potatoes and rocks, this time the Catholic hoodlums added to the bombardment cucumbers, rotten eggs and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">hmn excrement!</span><span class="font7"> The police ordered the witnesses' loud-speakers silenced or Mrs. W etmer would be arrested for distu’bing the peaee. Some of the buses that had brought the witnesses were returned to Montreal empty, stranding scores of witnesses. After several beatings at the hands of the mob, the Christian assemblers were evacuated. The last group, about 40, were feeing cross country when they were overtaken by mobsters in caTs. Though under the protective eseort of .tivH Provincial and three Chateanguay policemen, many witnesses were injured in the attack that followed and their literature, ineluding Bibles (and the witnesses often carry Catholic Bibles, too), was forcibly sezed and tom to bits and hnrned. And note this: it is reliably reported that during the mobbing the Catholic priest in his long black robes stood just across the street cnlmly looking on </span><span class="font8">! </span><span class="font7">This is no insignificant fact, in a province where the priest rules the parish and one worJ from him would dispel any mob!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One year later, September </span><span class="font8">8, </span><span class="font7">1946, a riot at Caughnawaga, a village on the outskirts of Montreal, was reported. Resident Indian witnesses had invited fellow witnesses from Lacliine to assist </span><span class="font6">in </span><span class="font7">their Bible service, and extended invitations to other residents of the reserve to attend. 8treuuous effort was made to incite the Indians to violently break up the meeting. Upon beiug asked to furnish protection, the Royal CunaU </span><span class="font8">ian </span><span class="font7">Mounted Police fatly refused; bnt they did arrest the chairman uf the Bible meeting anrl drove off with h.iln amid the yells of the mob. The un-disperscd mobsters continued for half an hour to pelt with missiles the house into which the assembly had retired for shelter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here are some instances revealing Quebec's hatred for God's Word as well as for freedom: In Hull, E. l\rl. Taylor, septuagenarian, of Nnmur, Quebec, was senteneeCi to seven days in prison for having distributed Bibles without a permit. In Rccorder's Court Iris attempted explanation was curtly ended by the recorder's ordering him off to prison. Two of Je.hovab's witnesses were arrested for distributing free a Bible pamphlet, charged with sedition, and sentenced to 60 days' imprisonment or $300 :fine. All the French Canadian courts were so under priestly thumbs that they affirmed the infamous sentence, and it was not until the case reached tJie Supreme Court o£ Canada that judgment was reversed. One Quebec witness of Jehovah was distributing a leaflet bearing only the words “The Holy Bible Is the Word of God. Read It'', and some familiar verses of the Crampon </span><span class="font8">V</span><span class="font7">ersion Bible. So incensed were the Mounted Police that they arrested her, searched her home, and jailed her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following affidavit of one of Jehovah's witnesses reports what is regularly happening ou the streets of Quebee City:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;Two men cnme to me while I was displaying the magazines </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">atchtower</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">and Consolation and asked if I had a license to do it. One was very filthy-mouthed and caused quite </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font7">commotion. He suddenly tore my case and magazines and then used me for a punching bag for a few seconds until my teeth were ratting. They crossed the road, evidently with the intention of molesting my companion, an elderly minister. I crossed also, thinking he would get the same dose as I. They tore his magazines, and there was much ,confusion and ripping of magazine bag. Then they turned on me again, but two taxi drivers interfered and things cooled off. As I went hack to get my magazine bag and gather up the torn magazines one of these men shouted, Don&gt;t let him do that; get him </span><span class="font8">!' </span><span class="font7">So again they gave me a good pouodiug. Eventually breaking away, I escaped and took refuge in a store by locking the door. The manager of the store refused to phone the police on my request. When the crowd cleared I gathered up my torn magazines and eon-tinned preaching at another intersection.&quot; Still Quebec City, hut with scene shifted to a private home, another recent affidavit of a </span><span class="font8">witness </span><span class="font7">paints this picture of vandalism and hate:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;A mob of 25 young men gathered around one of the homes where a Bible study was in progress and a chunk of ice was hurled through a double window into the kitchen of the honse. The owner had been n commando in the army, but has now Liken a definite stand for God's kingdom. When he ran nto the street the mob disappeared into the community building next to the church. The next night, abeut 11: 00 p.m., following the elosing Uown of the recreation hall, a small ga.ng began to gather. Finally a carload carne, but two Joeal policemen &lt;&gt;based them away. The following morning the owner and his friend reported the mat,tcr at the police stnlion, to have the mun who was caught questioned. They soon found out that the priest had phoned the officers and told them to lay off. Similar mobs were active </span><span class="font8">every </span><span class="font7">night during that week and windows </span><span class="font8">were </span><span class="font7">smashed. The police caught </span><span class="font8">6 </span><span class="font7">of the gang</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">and obtained 45 other names, hut nothing was done. The moh, seeing that no action was taken, got more daring each night. Last night the mob began collecting at </span><span class="font8">8: </span><span class="font7">00 p.m., and was the worst yet. &quot;lfore windows were broken. The gang got onto the roo£ and some made their way up onto the roof of the two-story house opposite and were throwing missiles down at the doors if anyone went in or out. The police were called twice and finally came.'' Christ Jesus taught at the homes of the people. and also the apostles and other early Christians went &quot;from house to house, to teach and preach'-'. (Acts 5 r 42; 20: 20 ; </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Dona.y </span><span class="font7">Version Bible) Judge how they would now be received in the proud capital city of Qttcbce province, as indicated by what was Dieted out to one of Christ’s followers as he trudged from house to house there:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">HJ </span><span class="font7">haU placed a Bible textbook with a woman mtd was standing at tho next. door when a man climbed over the veranda rail with tb(' book in his hand, telling me to come with him, that he was going to phone the police. He was not the householder of the prcm.ises where I had left the textbook, but just a neighbor of this woman. He opened the door, bidding me go in. There was another man standing in the hall, and, of course, I refused. With this he seized me and. told the yonng man to phone the police, and due to his violence be ripped my eoat. I warned him not to carry his aetions too far. He then told me he was a policeman and that I had to go in. The lady with whom I had placed the book then came to the Uoor of the house and was very Uisjikased with tlris man's action. Ignoring her, he put on .his uniform and laid the charge himself when he arrived at the police station.&quot; Religionists know no hounds in their zeal to perseeute. A 9-year-old girl, daughter o£ one of Jehovah's witnesses, wns distributing circulars when she was pielwd up and de-taineU at police coui't, charged with soliciting without possessing a $25 city permit. She had to appear at juvenile eourt for a hearing. .Again, an 11-year-old child of one of Jeho^ vnh's witnesses in the district of Ste. Germaine had been expelled from school for refusing t.o make the &quot;sign of the cross&quot; and to say the catechism. The parents explained the child's beliefs, and the teacher excused it from pRrt.icipating in the ceremony. But two weeks later a priest visited the school, and soon thereafter the child was expelled. Capping religious zeal, however, was the time when Royal Canadian Mounted Police cltarged into a hall in Montreal where Jehovah's witnesses were celebrating the Lord's Supper. The police broke up the meeting, refusing the presiding minister's request that the service might he completed. </span><span class="font8">Oan </span><span class="font7">the most fantastic imagination picture the police disrupting mass at a Roman Catholic Church </span><span class="font8">1</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah's witnesses have waged battles for freedom in seeking to dislodge its haters </span><span class="font8">f.rmn </span><span class="font7">their entrenched position in Quebec. Due to the large number of arrests that have taken place in Montreal and district, the witnesses challenged the constitutionality of Montreal and Verdun by-laws, under which the charges are made. Jehovah's witnesses won in Superior Court, and Justice C. Gordon Mackinnon ordered writs of prohibition is:med against the Recorders' Courts of Montreal and </span><span class="font8">V </span><span class="font7">er-dun to restrain further proceedings against the witnesses. He ruled the by-laws were suppressive of free worship, press o.nd speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Btit regardless of this decsion, the lawless arrests of Jehovah's witnesses continue almost daily in Montreal and district, and in the Recordei-s' Courts they are subjected to abusive tirades. F'or example, in Jine of 1946 Recorder Leonee Plante denounced the witnesses as a &quot;bunch of crazy nuts&quot;, set cash bail </span><span class="font6">a.o; </span><span class="font7">high as $200, and threatened that </span><span class="font8">if </span><span class="font7">some witnesses came before him again hail would be $1,000. At present, 1946, there are about 800 charges stacked up against Jehovah's witnesses in Greater Montreal, with property hail now involved being $100,000 and cash hail more than $2,000. Court cases are adjourned time after time, to inconvenience and increase expense for Jehovah's witnesses. To have their eases heard, during one short period the witnesses had to appear on 38 different oceasions !</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>The </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Force Behind Quebec's Burning Hate</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Wby this hate for God and His Word </span><span class="font8">? </span><span class="font7">for Christ and His followers? Why this hate for righteous principles and freedom' </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Why'! WHY</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">'I</span><span class="font7"> Jehovah's witnesses preach in </span><span class="font8">ah </span><span class="font7">the other Canadian provinces, without an.y smolderng hate bursting into flaming mob-ocracy. Why should it be so in Quebec province? Wherein is Quebee different </span><span class="font8">f </span><span class="font7">The following will enlighten you to see clearly the moving force behind Quebec's hate:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An officer arresting one of Jehovah's witnesses in Quebec City told the witness he was ordered to do it by Mr. Lavergne, the parish curate. A French Catholic lawyer defending one of Jehovah's witnesses was told by the city attorney, the court clei’k and the deputy chief of police that the arrests were illegal, hut that they were so hard pressed by the clergy that they had to make it </span><span class="font6">as </span><span class="font7">difficult as possible for the witnesses. Foiir witnesses arrested in Quebec City were told by representatives of the police department that delegations from the bishop's palace called daily and insisted that the witnesses were a menace to the Catholic Church and that it was the duty of police to get rid of them, law or no law</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font7">deputy </span><span class="font8">chief </span><span class="font7">of police once admitted that he was never so annoyed by priests as when cases against Jehovah's witnesses were pending. And it is so often noticed that the officer emerges from the back door of the church or convent before making the arrest! Why, Catholic domination of Quebec courts </span><span class="font8">is </span><span class="font7">so complete that in the courtrooms the imagery of the erucifix takes the place of the British Cnat of Arms, which appears in other courts throughout the Dominion!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">^Al </span><span class="font7">well-informed persons in Canada grant th.at Quebec province with its 86-percent-Catholic population </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">e; </span><span class="font7">under church-and-state rnle. In the Quebec legislature the cru-cifLv is placed above the Spcaher's chair, and in the Qnehee Parliament buildings alongside the throne of the lieutenant-governor of </span><span class="font8">qnc-</span><span class="font7">bec is installed a throne for the cardinal. It was reportedly the cardinal who instigated the notorious Padlock Act, supposedly against a mere handful of Communists, but which Art </span><span class="font8">left </span><span class="font7">&quot;Communist&quot; undefined so that anyone not suiting the priests and their piippet politicians could be prosecuted. The Act was used against Jehovah's witnesses. The Quebec cardinal also headed </span><span class="font6">n </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">c</span><span class="font7">a</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">m</span><span class="font7">paign for a corporate state to regiment the people behind the clergy, a program based on Pius XI's encyclical </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Q-uadrmgesimo </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Anno.</span><span class="font7"> Catholic secret societies, backed by French Canadian hierarchy, have been charged before the Canadian Senate </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font7">conspiring to turn Quebec province into a French Catholic Corporate state; and these charges were made by Senator Bouchard, a Frenchman, a Catholic, and from Quebec! Quebec has an unsavory reputation for isolationism, fascism and anti-Semitism. She lives up to it hatefully well, and now seeks to root herself deeper in religious totalitarianism by her legislature's demand that the Canadian prime minister' ‘‘bring before the Parliament of Cimada the measures required to institute </span><span class="font6">an </span><span class="font7">embassy at the Holy See&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All the facts nnite to thunderously declare that the force behind Quebec’s suicidal bate is priest domination.

<p><span class="font7">Quebec, Jehovah's witnesses are telling all Canada of the shame you have brought on the nation by yow; evil deeds. In English, French and Ukrainian languages this leaflet is broadcasting yonr delinquency to the nation. You claim to sei'Ve God ; yon claim to be for freedom. Yet </span><span class="font6">if </span><span class="font7">f</span><span class="font6">r</span><span class="font7">eedom </span><span class="font8">is </span><span class="font7">exercised by those who disagree with you, you ci'l.ish freedom by mob rule and gestapo tactics. Thomgh your words are, your actions are not in liaj'lnony with that for which democracies bave just fought a long and bloody global war. And your claims of serving God are just as empty, for your actions find n.o precedent in the exemplary course laid down for Christians by His Son, Christ Jesus. You should remember that though Cluast Jesus and early Christians were often mobbed, they never under any circumstances meted out mob violence. What counts is not whom you elai</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">m </span><span class="font7">to serve, but whom you </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a</span><span class="font7">ctua</span><span class="font8">ll</span><span class="font6">y </span><span class="font7">do serve by deeds. The Catholic Version Bible says: &quot;Know you not, that to whom you yield yom^selves servants to obey, his servants you aro whom you obey.') (Romans 6: 16) Quebec, you have yielded yomself </span><span class="font6">as </span><span class="font7">an obe.dient servant of religious priests, and you have brought forth .bumper crops of evil fruits. Now, why not study God's Word, the Bible, and yield yourself </span><span class="font8">il </span><span class="font7">obedience to its commands, aud see how bounteous a crop of good fruits reflecting love for God and Christ and freedom you ^li bring fortJi </span><span class="font8">t </span><span class="font7">The eyes of Canada are upon you, Quebec.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What We Shall </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Do</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The applause that punctuated the reading of this leaflet was freque</span><span class="font7">nt </span><span class="font9">and vigorous, but it rang out the loudest when the part was read that announced the paper's publication in English and Ukrainian as well as French. It-had reason £or swelling in volume when the president stated that 1,000,000 copies were printed in English, 500,000 in French and 75,000 in Ukrainian, aud that starting November 15 they would be distributed throughout all Canada. Moreover, he added to the conventioners' delight that </span><span class="font8">Awake! </span><span class="font9">would tell this story of hateful persecution to the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But the answer to &quot;vVhat shall we do </span><span class="font8">1&quot; </span><span class="font9">continued to unfold with the president's succeeding remarks. Western Canada has one witness to every five hundred population; Ontario has one to every nine hundred population; Catholicpriest-dominated Quebec and the three maritime provinces have only one to e¥et-y </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">fifty-nine hundred!</span><span class="font9"> That morning N. H. Knorr had interviewed some 120 full-time ministers of the gospel, and now he told the convention that fifty of these pioneer preachers would attend the next class of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead, would be taught French, and would return to preach in priest-infested Quebec and the maritimes. Sixty more would attend the class that followed, with the same end in view. How hands did clap in sustained applause at these prospects of specially trained reinforcements! At 4:45 final announcements were made by the Canadian Branch servant, and at 4: 55 p.m. ronsing song joined in by ai convention-ers and closing prayer by the president terminated this thrilling Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The above-outlined battle campaign is not purposed for rebuking the scornful priestly keepers of Quebec. &quot;Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a w:ise man, and he will love thee.&quot; (Proverbs </span><span class="font8">9: </span><span class="font9">8) Doubtless the arrogant Quebec hierarchy will continue by their actions to declare their hate tor God and Christ and freedom. Such course leads to death, according to God’s Word. (Psalm 21: 8; Proverbs </span><span class="font8">8: </span><span class="font9">3()) Bnt the preaching activity is for those who wonld be wise and serve God and not religious leaders. ''He that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.&quot; (Ecclesiastes 11: 4) Jehovah's faithful witnesses in Quebec and elsewhere will not eringe back in terror as they see the clouds of religious hate hovering overhead and feel the lightning thrusts of persecution stabbing down upon them. Nor will persons of good-will toward God regard in terror the clouds of hate, but they will associate ,vjth .Jehovah's witnesses hi the fight for right-' eousness. In peace and unity such lovers of righteonsness wil sow the seed of </span><span class="font6">• </span><span class="font9">Kingdom truth; </span><span class="font8">hi </span><span class="font9">due time they will reap the promised reward of eternal life. Till then they confidently rely in God's protection against religions persecutors that are moved by hate.</span></p>

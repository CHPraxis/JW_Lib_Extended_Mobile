<p><span class="font17">W</span><span class="font9">HEN Jehovah God caused the creation of this beautiful earth, He set in operation a mighty laboratory the intricacy and diversity of which bespeak the majesty and the power of its divine Architect. Daily the splendent sun sends forth it:-; radiant lieams, not only to lighten the earth, but </span><span class="font8">also </span><span class="font9">to create an infinite variety of substances for the health and well-being of earthly creatures. Continuously, day and night, summer and winter, year in and year out, powerful natural forc.es ceaselessly perform the bidding of their omnipotent Creator. 'frees grow, flowers bloom, fruits ripen, the tides flow, and </span><span class="font8">tJe </span><span class="font9">earth moves with infinite precision amidst the galaxy of the heavens, all in obedience to the will of the Most High God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Of the many natural forces with which the earth is endowed, that of radioactivity is of particular interest at this time. This is so, not only because of its prominence in the news events of the day, but because it is another one of the many tools with which man has been enabled to peer into some of the myster-</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NOVEMBER </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">8, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">10M;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">ies of earth's creation, and because it </span><span class="font8">is </span><span class="font9">destined to become </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">increasing importance in the future. Just what is this natural phenomenon which is so widely known as radioactivityf and does it possess any immediate beneficial j?roperties for mankind's use&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To understand the nature of this phenomenon, it is necessary first </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">all that one have some knowledge in general of the basic structure of all matter. To this end the reader is referred to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">OornsolatiMi</span><span class="font9"> No. 697, •wherein the structure of matter is discussed in some detail in the article entitled ''Atomic Energy''. Here wei shall merely reiterate the pertinent farts required for the discussion of the subject of this article. A knowledge of how nuclear energy may be released by the simple process </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">chnnging the structure of the nucleus of nu atom readily discloses that radioactivity is inextricably associated with transmutation and nuclear’ fission. In fact, radioactivity is a major factor in. volvecl in the use of atomic energy for practical purposes.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Structure of Matter</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">In this laboratory named the earth, every known substance of which man has any knowledge, be it liquid, solid, or gaseous, is composed of one or more of the ninety-two basic elements, from hydrogen to uranium. A substance may consist of hut one of these elements or it may consist of any number of them in combination. Hence, it is possible for a near infinite variety of substances to be compounded by changing the munbtr and variety of elements entering into their composition. The elements themselves, however, are composed of atoms, each one of which constitutes a miniature solar system, and, in any particular element in its normal state, all the atoms in general are exactly alike, each atom having a definite number of elemental parts all arranged according to a fixed natural law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Every atom of every element contains a mass-center named the “nucleus” around which </span><span class="font8">in </span><span class="font9">fixed orbits revolve electrons in much the same manner as the planets revolve around the sun. The mass-centered nucleus is the basic part of every atom. Its structure, in all except hydrogen, consists of two kinds of particles closely Ijonnd together in one compact mass. One of the two kinds of nn-clear particles carries a positive electrical charge, whereas the other particle carries neither a positive nor a negative electrical charge. The first is named a &quot;proton&quot;; the second, a •'neutron&quot; liecause of its neutral electrical state. This atomic nucleus </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">iR </span><span class="font9">the sole factor that determines to which ore of the ninety-two elements an atom belongs. In other words, it is the structure of the nucleus that determines whether an elemental substance is iron or gold, or whether </span><span class="font8">it </span><span class="font9">is carbon or radium, etc. No two elements contain the same number of protons and neutrons wJten in thjir normal stable state. The elements having the lesser weight contajn hut a few of these particles in their nuclei, whereas those of heavier weight contain many particles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As an example., helium atom nuclei contain four particles each, the heavier lead nuclei contain 207, and radium 226 particles. Thus it is at once realized that if one has possession of the necessary laboratory instnnnents whereby it be possible to alter the number and combination of these nuclear particles, then it is entirely within the realm of possibility to change or transmute one kind of element into another kind of element. Not only is such possible, hut it is actually being done daily. This concept of the structure of atomic nuclei is of fun-damejital importance in understanding the nature of radioactivity.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Natural Radioactivity</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">As early as the year 1896, men engaged in scientific, research discovered that certain substances found in the earth's suTface continuously and spontaneously emitted radiations. It was found that these radiations continued to exist for long periods o£ time with but little diminution. Notable among the elements that exhibited this phenomenon was that of radium. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">By </span><span class="font9">subjecting these radiations to a strong magnetic field it is possible to analyze them and from such an analysis learn about the characteristics of the radiations. Tims doing, it was learned that the radiations from radium consisi of three parts, namely: alpha particles, which are simply the nuclei of helium atoms; beta particles, that is, electrons; and gamma I’ays, which are electromagnetic waves of the same nature as </span><span class="font8">X </span><span class="font9">rays, or as the radiations from a radio broadcasting station, only gamma radiations have a very high frequency, higher than those of X rays. Further research disclosed that other substances in the earth's surface likewise are radioactive. However, only those substnnces of higher atomic weight, :mch as uranium, thorium, actinium, and the recently artiilcially ere-</span><span class="font8">ated plutonium, naturally possess this property.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now here is a most interesting phenomenon, one that is entirely spontaneous. So far as is known, there is no external power in evidence to generate the radiations. The parlicles composing the alpha rays and the beta rays are fundamentally matter, and therefore are just as rea] and tangihle as the paper upon which this is written. Being Teal, tangible substance and possessing tangible motion, and such motion continuing unabated over centuries of time, it is readily seen that a coJossal amount of energy is represented </span><span class="font9">in </span><span class="font8">these radiations. •Whence comes this energy? and, if these particle radiations constitute real matter, does the original substance, the radium for instance, gradually waste away by losing masB! The answers to these questions arc directly related to other questions, sueh as, \Vhat is the source of the great heat and light radiated by the sun? What is the cause of earth's internal heat? And, in general, what is atomic energy'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Present-day knowledge of radioactivity discloses that this phenomenon is due to some h&quot;'ind of instability of the nucleus within the atom of the radioactive snh-stance. That is, the nucleus of the atom is not according to type as established by the laws of nature, and, in the process of returning to type, either electrons, protons, alpha particles, or gamma raysi singly ot in combination, are ejected from the atom. In some radioactive substances only electrons are ejected; in some others, neutrons or protons i in others, alpha particles; and, in certain substances, all are ejected simultaneously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These radiations require energy to produce them, and the interesting fact is that this energy resides wholly within the atom itself. No chemical action of any description has any effect upon the radiations whatsoever. Chemical action may affect the combination of atoms forming molecules. or it may affect the outer layer of electrons of an atom, but none is powerful enough to penetrate the atom to its nucleus. Radioactivity of the natural elements is just as intense at plus 2,000 degrees as at minus 200 degrees, its rate is unaffected at any temperature produced by chemical action. Here, tlten, is positive proof that whatever is the cause of radioactivity, its source must lie within the atom itself. Moreover, if the energy producing </span><span class="font9">the spontaneous radiations lies with the atom, then the atom as a whole cannot be a simple entity, but must embody powerful forces and must consist of a complex structure. This view of the source of radioactivity is enhanced when it is remembered that no air exists within the structure of an atom. Therefore, as concerns the atomic world the conditions are identical to that which exists in the stany vault of the heavens.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">Every artificially created radioactive substance is a freak, a freak in that it does not conform to type, but has the power to correct itself and thereby return to type. During the time of transformation to type, the intensity of the radiations gradually decreases at </span><span class="font6">an </span><span class="font9">exponential rate towards zero. Inasmuch as the intensity decreases at an exponential rate, therefore, theoretically, the radiations never actually cease but can only approach zero, or, as mathematicians would say, the intensity is asymptotic to the time axis in the positive direction. For that reason scientists engaged in atomic research hnve adopted a unit of measurement applicable to radioactivity which Jias been named the ''half-life&quot; of the substance. Thus, for instance, one form of radioactive copper has a half-lile of 12.8 hours, and radioactive carlion </span><span class="font8">n </span><span class="font9">half-life of 1,000 years, etc. That simply means, in the ease of carbon 1,000 years are required for the radioactivity to decrease to one-half of its original value, and that it never quite becomes zero.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Artificial Radioactivity</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">Just how a radioactive substance adjusts itse1f so as to conform to type may be more clearly understood by noting what occurs in artificial (man-mduced) radioactivity. Consider, for instance, the element carbon. Now, carbon in its no:rmaJ state has an atomic weight of twelve, and its atomic number is six, that is, every atom of carbon contains a nucleus consisting of twelve particles each of unit mass, and rotating around the nucleus are six electrons. Since there are sh. electrons in the atom, the nucleus must contain the same number of protons (sh) each carrying unit positive charge in order to preserve the electrical balance, and, since there is a total of twelve particles within the nucleiiSi then the difference between twelve and the number of protons (six) must be the number of neutrons withiin the atom, namely, si.x. Therefore the atom as a whole consists of six protons, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">SL&quot;'C </span><span class="font9">neutrons, and six electrons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Should this element carbon be placed in a laboratory device named a cyclotron, and it be bombarded by neutrons, it is possible to change the atomic structure of the element by adding one or more neutrons to it in the bombarding process. So doing; imagine one neutron is added; it is still carbon hut it now has a mass of thirteen (twelve pins one equals thirteen) and is stable, and therefore is an isotope of carbon. Imagine another neutron is added. Strange things now begin to he in evidence. The original carbon element having a mass of twelve has increased to a mass of fourteen, which is the same mass as tliat of the element nitrogen. Since </span><span class="font8">this </span><span class="font9">bombarded element carbon now occupies the same atomic space as nitrogen, there is </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font9">violation (or shall we say a usurpation of assignment?) of the natural laws as established by the Creator, and, therefore, some kind of readjustment auto-rnatically occurs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">WJiat is the readjustment, do you ask </span><span class="font8">T </span><span class="font9">The answer is, radioactivity. This is wliat occurs according to experimental observations. The radioactive carbon having a mass of fourteen will automatically transform one neutron into a proton and during the process one electron will be eje&lt;lted. In so doing the atom becomes stable. The electron ejected when added to those from millions of similar atoms constitutes one form of radio-</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">activity, and in this particular case is muned Tadioaetive carbon. It is thus seen that radioactivity is an outward manifestation of an internal reaction, an unstable condition adjusting itself to one of stability. Furthermore, if the masses of the various atoms be taken into cmisideration, it is found that in every case of radioactivity there is a Joss of mass, and which mass is transformed into energy manifesting itself in the foi’m of radioactive products. In short, radioactivity is one form of atomic energy resulting from the transformation of mass within the nucleus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Inasmuch as radioactivity is always an outward manifestation of an interchange between mass and energy within an atom, it is readily seen that every radioactive substance is constantly losing mass </span><span class="font8">or </span><span class="font9">weight. That fact becomes quite evident when one observes the cyclical changes that the natural element uranium undergoes in its quest for complete stahility. Uranium has an atomic weight of 238 mass units. Due to the radioactive transformations which are constantly in operation this element gradually disintegrates into lead, and throughout the time energy is constantly being liberated in the form of radio-aetive products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The amount of energy represented in the loss of mass has been proved to be proportional </span><span class="font8">to </span><span class="font9">the square of the velocity o£ lighti and, therefore, has an enormous magnitude. Can it be that herein </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">NOVEMBER 8, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1046 </span><span class="font9">lies the cause of the earth’s internal heat, or of the light and thermal radiations from the sun </span><span class="font8">T </span><span class="font9">There are strong reasons for believing that such is the fact. Not only the naturally radioactive elements, such as uranium, thorium, radium, and actinium, within the earth contribute to this atomic energy in the form of heat, but these radioactive elements induce radioactivity by bombardment </span><span class="font8">iii </span><span class="font9">other substances in their immediate vicinity, adding to the total heat so generated.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Some </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Practical Aspects of Radioactivity</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">Present-day applications of radioactivity are interesting to note. The most extensive usage, perhaps, is that by the medical profession and others engaged in biological research. For such purposes, certain of the natural elements, such as sodhun, phosphorus, iodine, carbon, iron, and others, are made radioactive artificially by using the bombarding technique descriBed in the former paragraphs for carbon. Their half-life periods vary from minutes to hours or even days, depending upon the kind of substance used and the intensity o£ the bomba:ding potential. These radioactivated substances are then fed or injected in safe and controlled amounts into the living tissue of plants and animals, including humans. Using radioactive detectors, such as Giger-Muller counters and photographic j)lates, the &quot;tagged atoms'' of these radioactive substances can be traced as they travel</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">through tJie organism of the animal or plant body. So doing, much may be learned about the internal activities of these organisms beyond our sight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Haclioactive substances artificiallv created have also been successfully used in the treatment of cancer so it is reported. Also, recently a device has been invented that is of valne to printing establishments and similar plants troubled with static electricity generated by rapidly moving belts, rolls of paper, ek In this invention a radioactive&gt; substance is so located relative to the mo,..Jng paper stock that the radiations' ionizing the air causes the static charge to leak nff harmlessly. It is used in tli(&gt; petroleum industry to ohtain knowledge ot' the subsurface structure of the earth's crust in the vicinity of oil wells. It is used to ]ocate minerals in mines, and recently an ingenious device has been invented that. is capable of measuring the level of fluids within tanlu:;, boilers, pipe-s, etc., where other instruments of measurement are impossible to use by making use of the versatile properties of this phenomenon. UnJouhtedly, further applications will be made from time to time as the need arises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">While the pm;sihilities for using radioactivity are seemingly infinite in number, from the present-day status of scientific knowledge it is known that radioactive emanations can be and are extremely dangerous to an animal organism when not used in controlled amounts. Their effect. upon a human body, for instanec7 is similar to that resulting from an overdose of X rays. For that reason men employed in laboratory research working near such bombarding devices as cyclotrons, betatrons, etc., are particularly cautious to work behind carefully designed shields. For the same reason, immediately after tlte recent Bildnj atoll </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">‘.A</span><span class="font8"> bomb&quot; tests, no oiie was permitted to approach near the site of the bomb explosion until certain tests of the radioactivity indicated the region to be safe for human life. Shields around powerful cyclotrons and betatrons in some laboratories are of huge proportions, consisting of thick walls of con-erete or of deep tanks of water. While such protection to personnel is necessary because of insufficient knowledge concerning the control of radioactive emanations, the extent of the protection required is a gange whereby one may correctly appraise the magnitude of the latent potentialities residing within this phenomenon, and bence the extent o£ its power for useful purposes in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Today7 wlmt little knowledge men have of this mai’velons phenomenon is sufficient to inrlicate that the possibilities for its pTactical usefulness in the futnre are limitless. Ii it can heat the earth, why can it not also heat a house, for instance J If radioactivity can canse the material elements to emit electrons, and these electrons are identical to those i:u a copper wire carrying an electrical current, tlien why cannot radioactivity eventually be used not only to heat a house or a city, but also to give light to them, yes, to generate radio waves and to detect them, and a thousand other functions as well? Even now it is known that a source of light can and lias been produced which is due solely to radioactivity, and which has operated continuously for seventy hours. Also, the gamma rays emitted by radioactivity from certain substances are exceedingly powerful X rays. Is there any reason why these caimot eventually be harnessed £or useful purposes, even as low-powered X rays are of gTeat benefit to mankind in a thousand ways now t True, till is not as rosy as it might seem ; there are obstacles to be overcome before such a radioactive Utopia can be realized. Bnt this phenomenon is not a mere accident; it is embodied in God's creative handiwork; and that fact is sufficient assurance to cause one to expect it to be used extensively for mankind's benefit in due time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">bany to New York, a distance of 150 miles, in 2 Jionrs 51 minutes, actual flying time. Thirty-six years later the same course was covered in 16 minutes 20 seconds, and this is a fair sample of the shrinkage aviation lms made in the time-distance around the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Even within the -past year many new speed records have been set up. On December 8, 1945, a Douglas XB-42, averaging 432 miles per hour, cut off 46 minutes from the coast-to-coast Tecord. But this record was smashed six weeks later by a jet-propelled P-80, averaging 584.6 miJes per hour. From Los Angeles to New York, 2,470 miles, hi 4 hours 13 minutes! It took Calbraith Perry Rodgers, in 19ll, 49 days to eross the continent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Fl</span><span class="font12">y</span><span class="font8">ing from New York to England on February 4, 1946, a Constellation knocked nearly 2 hours </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of£ </span><span class="font8">the former commercial time, making the 3,400-mile hop in 12 hours 9 minutes flying time. Then, five days later a new record of 13 hours 30 minutes was established for the east to west crossing of the Atlantic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the Pacific side in April of this year a Constellation Clipper flew from Shanghai to Seattle in 21 hours 2G minutes. The time from Tokyo was 17 hours 26 minutes, with a stopover in the .Aleutians. Other flight times are. from Mimni, Fla.i to Newark, N. J., 5 hours 23 minutes; from New York to Washington, D. C., 29 minutes 15 seconds; from Chicago to Rome, 33 hours 39 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All former nonstop distance records were smashed 011 October 1 by the Truculent Turtle. Averaging 203.4 miles an hour against a 11.5 mph. average headwind, this long-distance navy patrol plane ilew from Perth, Australia, to Co-himbns, Ohio, in 55 hours 15 minutes. A distance of 11,236 miles, nearly halfway around the globe, Ui a little over two days. Magellan would have said, &quot;Impossible ! it took me over a year to sail halfway around.&quot;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">More significant than a mere long-distance flight was the one made over the polar icecap from Honolulu to Cairo, Egn)t, on October 6. Tire plane, the Pa-cnsan Dreamboat, took off with an overload of 29,000 pounds of extra gasoline, and its crew of ten made the hop of 10,854 statute miles nonstop in 39 hours 36 minutes. It was a regular B-29 having no special ice-deforming equipment, thus demonstrating that regular commercial Hights over the arctic route are practical</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Before the war an international speed record of 325.713 mph. was set by Italy, December 9, 1937. Today that figure seems rather tame. Even in a closed-course race a speed of 515 mph. has been attained, aud hi an open course the English jet plane, Gloster Meteor, established the official record at 606 mph. on November 7, 194n Within the last year this record was shattered anti a new one of 616 mph. took its place. The indications are that this latest one will soon be broken, for man is determined to fy fasteT than the speed of sonud, which is in the neighborhood of 750-775 mph,, depending on the temperature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Though speed is a good index </span><span class="font7">of </span><span class="font12">the </span><span class="font8">progress made in aviation it does not tell the </span><span class="font12">whole </span><span class="font8">story. Improvements in ship design have given greater carrying power, longer range, more safety and great</span><span class="font9">er versatility </span><span class="font8">to aircraft. Radical depic</span><span class="font9">tures from conventional </span><span class="font8">de$igns have also made their avpeanmees in the skies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One of these, the Flying Wing, made its debut this last summer, and </span><span class="font9">because it </span><span class="font8">lacked the customary fuselage and tail construction, jt looked more like a giant boomerang </span><span class="font9">than </span><span class="font8">au airplane. The idea of </span><span class="font9">doing </span><span class="font8">away </span><span class="font9">wit]j </span><span class="font8">the fuselage is not new, but </span><span class="font6">was </span><span class="font8">put d</span><span class="font7">o</span><span class="font8">w</span><span class="font4">n </span><span class="font8">in blueprint form as far back as 1923. In 1929 an experimental semi-fying </span><span class="font9">wing </span><span class="font8">was built and flown </span><span class="font9">for a </span><span class="font8">few years, and that was the forerunner </span><span class="font9">of </span><span class="font8">this present giant </span><span class="font9">of </span><span class="font8">the air</span><span class="font1">. </span><span class="font8">Giant indeed! A B-29 superiortress has an overload gross weight of 65 to</span><span class="font9">n</span><span class="font8">s</span><span class="font9">, to compare </span><span class="font8">with 104 for this monster of the airways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This </span><span class="font9">‘‘Wiiig'\ </span><span class="font8">as it is ca1Jed1 has a span of 172 feet, and with its four 3,000-horse-power motors built in, it has the advantage over other types of </span><span class="font9">e</span><span class="font6">m</span><span class="font4">i</span><span class="font8">strncti</span><span class="font6">o</span><span class="font8">n </span><span class="font9">in </span><span class="font8">that it has high &quot;lift&quot; and low &quot;drag” Conventional types </span><span class="font9">of </span><span class="font8">planes will not li£t more than 100,000 pounds for every 1,000 pounds of drag. But when the fuselage and tail gear are done away with, then </span><span class="font9">for </span><span class="font8">every 1,000 pounds of drag there is 140,000 to 200,000 pounds of lift. Greater loads can thus be car</span><span class="font9">r</span><span class="font8">i</span><span class="font9">ed at higher speeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The &quot;Flying Pancake&quot; is another radically different type of design. Known </span><span class="font9">as </span><span class="font8">the </span><span class="font9">Navy's </span><span class="font8">XF5U-1, its principal feature is its amazing range in speed. The range between landing speed and top speed for most planes </span><span class="font9">is </span><span class="font8">a ratio of 1 to 4, but this new ship has a ratio of 1 to 10 or </span><span class="font9">J </span><span class="font8">to 20 and better. Translated into miles per hour, its </span><span class="font9">speed </span><span class="font8">range is </span><span class="font9">from </span><span class="font8">40 to 425 mph. with </span><span class="font9">standard </span><span class="font8">type engines, </span><span class="font9">or </span><span class="font8">with special engines </span><span class="font9">it </span><span class="font8">h</span><span class="font9">as </span><span class="font8">a range </span><span class="font9">of </span><span class="font8">0 to 550 mpli. This means tliat it can hover </span><span class="font9">in </span><span class="font8">the air like a helicopter, or can dig out and streak through space like a jet-propelled Shooting Star.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Helicopters, those fimny-looking 'buzz saws' that are becoming more numerous as time goes on, </span><span class="font9">have </span><span class="font8">also increased their lifting power and range </span><span class="font9">nf di’stanee. </span><span class="font8">The </span><span class="font9">a</span><span class="font8">rray's R-3 is said to </span><span class="font9">be able to </span><span class="font8">lift a load of 1,100 pounds and cruise at more than 100 mpli.

<h4><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Monarchs of the High Sierras</span></h4>
<p><span class="font17">M</span><span class="font9">ONARCHS must possess outstanding virtues </span><span class="font8">if </span><span class="font9">they are to be looked up to and respecteCi by others. </span><span class="font8">In </span><span class="font9">breeding they must be blue-bloods: in power they must possess great strength; in splendor and glory they must be magnificent. If they have these qualities, with an absence of vanity, and if they glorify their Creator, then they are honored and respected by lovers of righteousness. Personalizing the Sequoias or Big Trees fmmd on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada range in central California, it may he truly said of them that they are monarchs endowed with these virtues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These monarchs of the lofty Sierra realm are not to be confused with their honorable cousins, the Redwoods, who rule over the coastal regions of northern California. At one time there were forty-five different species of this royal family, but now there are only these bvo survivors:the Seqtwia </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">sempervirens, </span><span class="font9">the ''Redwoods&quot; found on the coast, and the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Seq</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">tw </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">i </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">gig ant</span><span class="font9"> ea) the &quot;Big Trees<sup>J</sup>' fomid In the High Sierras.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The common mistake of the uninformed in referring to both of these species as &quot;redwoods&quot; is probably because the wood of each is pink when first cnt and upon exposure turns to a reddish brown. There is, however, a greater dif-ferenre between the Sequoias tlian there is between sugar pines and yellow pines. Not only in appearance, hut also in their manner of reproduction and in tlieir habitat, the Big Trees differ from the Redwoods.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19461108_files/g_E_19461108-8.jpg" alt="" style="width:153pt;height:340pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">The Redwoods cover a strip along the seacoast, rarely more than 20 miles wide, running some 500 miles in length from the mountains of Santa Lucia in Monterey county, California, to Curry county iu Oregon. The Big Trees are fonnd only on the western slopes of the Sierras extending some 250 miles, between 4,000 and 8,000 feet elevation. The coastal Redwoods stand among a dense undergrowth of fern, azalea and uxaijs., and their heads are often dampened by the fog hanks tliat rOU in from the Japanese current. The Big Trees, on the other hand, have their feet covej^ed over many months of the yeat with deep snow </span><span class="font8">while </span><span class="font9">their heads enjoy the bright sunshine of the Sienas. The Redwoods occur in heavy forest stands: the Big Trees, in isolated groves. </span><span class="font8">In </span><span class="font6">manner </span><span class="font9">of reproduction the coastal Redwoods differ from Big Trees in that they will sprout from stumps and roots as well as from seeds, whereas the </span><span class="font8">J3jg </span><span class="font9">Trees will onlv reproduce from seed:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But the greatest Ui.f-fert-oce between the two species is in their ap-pearanee. The coastal Redwood is taller and more graceful, while </span><span class="font8">the </span><span class="font9">Big Tret- is more massive and majestic, and more </span><span class="font8">like </span><span class="font9">a true monarch. </span><span class="font8">Or </span><span class="font9">as one writer said, with apologies to Kipling: &quot;The Redwood she's a lady, while the Big Tree he's a man.” rhere is, then, as much difference Lehween the two as there is between a queen and a king. Both are great; both are of royal blood; both are of Secpioia liieo.ge. Therefore, to use adjectives aud superlatives intelligently in comparing one with the other a person must not be content to walk only among the eoasto.l Redwoods but must drive along the Redwood </span><span class="font8">Highway, </span><span class="font9">must plunge into the Sequoia National Park, must stand beneath the majestic monarchs iii the Congress Group. Not until then do words like &quot;magnificent” speak their real meaning.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Take a Closer Look at These Monarchs</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">In driving along the Sierra highways the visitor notices that tJicse Big Trees are sometimes down in the meadows, at other times they stand out as sentinels overlooking a headland of granite. Sometimes they group together by themselves, at other times (which is most of the time) they tower above other trees, pines and firs and cedars, like mighty giants of the forest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The younger of the Big Trees, fifty to two hundred years old, are graceful and well-sltaped with a sharp-pointed crest. But the older ones have a rounded top or clubbed appearance. Big Trees are evergreens having the characteristic needles, which fall off after three or four yeai’s. The coloT of these needles varies with the age of the tree. The younger trees have a bluish-green foliage, but with age the foliage green takes on a metallic brilliance that makes them outstanding among the conifers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The bark on these great trees reaches a thickness of more thnn two feet. Instead of being hard. and tough as would be expected with trees this size, the bark of the Big Trees is soft and spongy, and because it is spongy it weighs only •five to seven pounds per cubic foot. This hark is very fire-resistant, resembling asbestos, and it is also highly repellant to insects, due to its high content of tannin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The wood in the heart of the kingly Sequoia resemhlef: its bark in that it too is rather porous. The green wood full of moisture weighs four to six pounds per board foot, to compare with its weight of only a half a pound when dry. It is also a very brittle wood, not elastic and tough, like pine and fir; and when cut down these Big Trees usually splinter and shatter badly, because of theh-brittleness.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>The Largest Living Thing</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">A hundred years ago, when reports were circulating that trees more than twice the diameter of the coastal Redwoods were growing in the Sierras people wonld not believe it. ''hnpossible </span><span class="font8">!” </span><span class="font9">they said, for a tree to grow 30 feet in diameter and 300 feet in height. Not* withotanding the fact that the coastal Redwoodst and perhaps the Australian Eucalyptus, are taller, and the banyan of the tropics, with its rooted branches and vines, sjHeads out over an acre of ground, or the fact that the Oaxaca cypress of Mexico has a greater spread of branches, or the ipil and narna of the Philippines have 40-foot wmgeil buttresses on tlieir tnujks—notwithstanding all these blue ribbons, yet, without question, there are no trees, nor any other living thing on this globe, that can compare with the Big Trees in sheer bulk and total weight and mass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">TJje largest of these trees, called the General Sherman, towers to </span><span class="font6">n </span><span class="font9">height of 273.9 feet. Its greatest diameter is 37.3 feet, while its mean diameter at the base is 32.7 feet, and even at a height </span><span class="font8">of </span><span class="font9">100 feet its diameter is 18.7 feet; and this can be compared with the coastal Redwoods, which have a diameter at the base of only 16 or 17 feet.. The largest branch of the General Sherman is 7.3 feet in diameter, tuid that is 130 feet from the ground. And what do you think a tree like that weighs? How many'hnn-dreds of tons would that living organic</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">substance weigh? 'the conservative estimate is that it weighs over </span><span class="font8">twelve </span><span class="font9">million pounds, or 6,167 tons! Such </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">tree would provide lumber sufficient for 150 five-room houses. In the trunk alone there is enough lumber to fill 280 freight cars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is hard to picture how big this tree really is, but as a help to the imagination go out o.n your fTont lawn and draw a circle having a diameter of 32 feet. Then stand at the edge of tlmt circle and imagine that you are looking up to the top of a 30-story building. li you can comprehend really how big such a tree as that is, then you tmdcrstnnd why the Big Trees </span><span class="font8">are </span><span class="font9">worthy Monarchs of the Sierras.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Toot system of these Sierra rulers, that gives them poise and balance as they stanU ltead and sbonlden; above the other trees, is in proportion with their torso size-. The main lateral roots, which attain a diameter of 18 inches, radiate out from the base of the tree a distance of approximately two-thirds the height of the tree. That means that if a Big Tree is 300 feet ii stature it has au elaborate network of lateral roots spreading out over a circle 400 feet iu diameter, or covering an area of two to tlnee acres, thus firmly anchoring its 6,000 tons and permitting it to withstand gales and storms for thousands of years.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>The Oldest Living Thing</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">The guessing game on how old the General Sherman is. the largest tree in the world, lms been played for many years. Size alone is no indication </span><span class="font12">of </span><span class="font9">a Big Tree's age. It is known </span><span class="font8">that </span><span class="font9">a tree may struggle along for many centuries until its roots reach out to richer soil, when it will begin te&gt; grow </span><span class="font8">much </span><span class="font9">more rapidly, even snYpassing in size nmch older trees. There is therefore only one way of accurately determining the age of a tree, and that </span><span class="font8">is </span><span class="font9">by cutting it down and counting its annual rings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">.Judge Walter </span><span class="font8">Fry, </span><span class="font9">who lived 40 years among the Big Trees, one time counted </span><span class="font8">NOVEMBER </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">8, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">19.46 </span><span class="font9">the rings of a Big Tree that had a diameter of only 26.5 feetJ arJd found that it was 31126 years old. John Muir, the .American naturalist, said that he once found a tree that was 4,000 years old. Based upon these actual counts the estimates are tltat trees like the Grizzly Giant, the General Sherman, the General Grant and the Boole are t.t least 3,500 years of age, while these trees and others, ike the President, </span><span class="font8">Abe </span><span class="font9">Lincoln, and George Washington, all over 30 feet in diameter, may be centuries older.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If only these annual rings would talk like the grooves of a phonograph record, what a story they coiild tell! Take John </span><span class="font8">Muir's </span><span class="font9">4,000-year-old tree for an example. Before Abraham, that ancient man of faith, was born that Big Tree was already several years old. VYhen God made His covenant with Abraham that tree was perhaps a hundred feet high. \i\Then the nriglity armies of Egypt, the first world power, were drowned like rats in the Red sea that lofty tree on </span><span class="font8">the </span><span class="font9">heights of the Sierras stood erect with head and shoulders more than 200 feet above the ground. VVhen Rome, the city that is fah;e]y labeled “eternal&quot;, was first born, in 753 B. C., the Big Tree was then over 1,300 years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At the age of 1,300 years that tree did not die, but Jived </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font9">thousand years more to see tJie begetta.l </span><span class="font12">of </span><span class="font9">Catholicism by Constantine in 325 A. </span><span class="font8">D. </span><span class="font9">After Charlemagne was crowned by the pope as king of the so-called ‘‘Holy Roman Empire&quot;, A. </span><span class="font8">D. </span><span class="font9">800, tliat glorious tree in the Sierras continued to live anotber thousand years to see the complete uprooting of the </span><span class="font8">chnrcb-state </span><span class="font9">rule of Europe. And when that ancient tree was cut clown by men a </span><span class="font8">few </span><span class="font9">years ago, at the age of 4,000, it was only in its prime of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When it is considered that there are Big Trees now living that may be even older than this 4,000-year-old one that </span><span class="font8">was </span><span class="font9">cut down, it makes one wonder to what such longevity is attributed. One factor is the resistance that Big Trees have to insects and disease. Another factor is their asbestos type of bark that makes them resistant to fires. the most deadly enemy of forest trees, except man. Even when nine-tenths of their bark is charred tlii'ongh, and two hundred feet of their inwards burned out, leaving a hollow sliell, still they will Jive and even make an effort to heal over the damaged parts. Their root system, too, gives them the ability to survive long periods of drought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Their most destructive enemy, and one that was not restrained until he </span><span class="font8">Jiacl </span><span class="font9">destroyed many thousands of these valuable trees, is man. It was in the J 830's that tJie white man 1hst took notice of these giants among giants. Thereafter for fifty years he ruthlessly destroyed them with axe, saw, and dynamite, until public opinion and spirited individuals were aroused to hedge in and preserve the remnant, about </span><span class="font8">25 </span><span class="font9">percent, of the vanishing race of Sequoias.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The fossil remains of these trees tell of the time when dinosaurs roamed among them and giant reptiles enjoyed theh shade. TJie growing trees still standing today on the slopes or the Sierras also give powerful testimony of things etemnl. Is it any wonder, then, that Jehovah God, when He caused His •Word, the Bible, to he written in a language that men could understand, chose the evergreen to represent immortality?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These evergreen Sequoias, the largest and oldest living tilings on earth, are creation's best example of how creatures, having everlasting life, will continue to live on earth throughout the centuries following the battle of Anna-geddon, giving praise to their Creator. Believe this, and some day, shortly, you may see yonr children and your children^ children playing with the cubs of lions and hears beneath these mighty monarchs of the Sierras.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Jesus' words in </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font9">discussion with the Je</span><span class="font8">w</span><span class="font9">ish ruler Nicodemus are authoritative upon the suh.ieet. “Jesus </span><span class="font8">answered </span><span class="font9">and sa</span><span class="font8">i</span><span class="font9">d unto him, Verily, verily, I </span><span class="font8">sny </span><span class="font7">17 </span><span class="font9">unto thee, Except a man bE‘ born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old! can lie enter the second tinw into his mother's womb, and be horn ? Jestis answered, VerUy, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he </span><span class="font6">caii-</span><span class="font9">not enter into tlw kingdom of Gotl. That which is born of the </span><span class="font8">fie::;li </span><span class="font9">is flesh; and that which is born of the spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and tliou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tt?ll whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the spirit.&quot;—John 3: 3-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is unreasonable to take </span><span class="font8">J </span><span class="font9">esusJ words to meau that the person who ltas been begotten of </span><span class="font8">G otl </span><span class="font9">is like an nncertain wind, coming and going and doing things by .fits and starts aml moYing hither and yon nceordint;: to a pastii.ug inclination and hence being undependable and unreliable in general. Some religionists interpret Jesus' words so. Ouly in the light of other scriptures can His words be grasped ::1ensiLly and hence rightly. Wind if; air in motion and has </span><span class="font6">n </span><span class="font9">starting point of movement aud a point where it subsides. Jeremiah 51 : 16 says concerning Jehovah God: &quot;When he uttereth his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causetli the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth: he maketli lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries.&quot; (Am. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Stan, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">V</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">er.)</span><span class="font9"> Psalm 135: 7 repeats the statement: &quot;He briugeth the wind out of his treasuries/' Psalm 148: 7, 8 commands: ''Praise the Lorm from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps : fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his word.&quot; Oene:-;is 8: 1 says : &quot;God made a wind to pass over the earth.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As the •wind is brought forth out of the treasuries of G-od and is according to His word, so the one begotten of God and who enters the Kingdom is like the wind in having God as his source. But the origin with God of such begotten one cannot be discerned by the natural man, whose eyes cannot see the wind that blows about this earth, but such origin is unseen to his eyes. As the natural man hears the soiuid of the passing wind, so he may observe the visible effects of the action of God's spirit upon the one begotten of God, but cannot appreciate their cause, neither can lte discern what is the heavenly destination toward which the spirit-begotten one is moving. Jesus called this fact to the attention of the natural-minded religious enemies, saying: &quot;Though I hear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whlther I go. [Why noB] Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man [thus] . . . </span><span class="font1">.</span><span class="font8">If </span><span class="font9">God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I ef myself, but he sent me.v (John 8:14, 15, 42; see also John 9: 29-33; 13 : 3; 16: 27, 38) The begotten one's new life, therefore, is not a question of re-entering a visible mother's womb and then being known to issue forth again therefrom and thereafter going the way of the rest of humanity. Unless one is born of God in His spiritual organization, which is higher than man, one cannot eventually see and enter into the heavenly kingdom.—Luke 24; John 20; Acts 1: 1-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">So, to return to Jesus' words that ex-vlain by what means it is that the begetting or being born again is accomplished: &quot;'Indeed I assure thee, if any one be not born </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">from above,</span><span class="font9"> he cannot see the kingdom o£ God. . . . Truly jndeed I say to thee, if any one be not born of water and spirit, he cannot enter tJie kingdom of God.&quot; (John 3:3,5, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott)</span><span class="font9"> It is selfevident tliat the one gaining entrance into the Kingdom must be born again, for “God is a Spirit&quot; and the Kingdom is heavenly. Furthermore, to begin with, </span><span class="font8">the faet applies to such one, namely: &quot;That which is horn of the flesh is flesh.&quot; Such ereahue originally wns begotten or born from beneath, and it is now nec-essarv for the creature to he horn &quot;from above'', that is to say, from heaven or from God, who is above all. Only God, who is Spirit, can cause spirit creatures to be brought forth; &quot;that wliicli is born of the spirit is spirit/' OnJy God can make it possible that a creature here on earth should get in line to become a $pirit creature in the spirit realm of the invisible liea vens. Hence only the faithful and true church of God under Christ see and enter into the kingdom of God. Those faithful human creahnes who do not gain life iu heaven as members of the church or Kingdom rlass have only an earthly destiny set before them in God's Word, namely, everlasting life on earth under the reign of God's kingdom.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Slippery Jesuit History</span></h4>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font14">HIHTY-THREE </span><span class="font8">black-robed delegates met in secret session at Rome on September J5 mid elected Jolm Baptist Janssens of Belgium to be the twenty-seventh general of the Jesuits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The founder of the Jesuit order was a Spanish nobleman named Don liiigo (Ignatius) of Loyola. </span><span class="font10">lu </span><span class="font8">the course of time (May 20, 1521} Loyola was wounded, and as he lay tossing on his bed wild, hallucinations pnssed through his feverish mind. He had a vision of himself leading the forces of his church against the forces of darkness which he thought was the Heformatimi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Upon recovery, not mentally but physically, he set about to organize a secret society that would erusade against all enemies of Catholicism. Pope Pnnl endorsed the militant sclieme in </span><span class="font9">1540. </span><span class="font8">Sixteen years later Loyola died, hut the Jesuit order lived on because “the pope, the bishops, and those monarchs who were opposed to tLe Refomiation recognized the .Jesuits as the most efficient organization for saving the old Church&quot;. (</span><span class="font12">M</span><span class="font8">'Clintock &amp;&nbsp;Strong </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Cyclopedia)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Not only did the Jesuits Hght outside opposition to the church by fanning the Inquisition flames, but where there was discontent and jealousy witliin the ranks of the Catholic organization the J esuits were the sharp steel used to cut it out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Finally established as tlte supreme power behind the papal throne (their general being called the ''black pope&quot;), the Jesuits t</span><span class="font9">h</span><span class="font8">en proceeded to bring the whole world mtder their feet. </span><span class="font9">'rJief </span><span class="font8">made politics their Imsilless, aod when temporal rulers and kings opposed them these were assassinated: examples are found in.Henry III, Henry IV, William of Orange, etc. These </span><span class="font9">crude </span><span class="font8">and ruthless methods resulted in the .Jesuit organization's being expelled from forty or more countries and places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">However, this opposition did iiot 'weaken this secret society; it only made it more crafty and cunning, more daring and deceitful. Like a criminal returning to the scene of his crime, dressed as a detective of the law, these Jesuits proceeded to cover over tlieir bloody foot-}Jrints with the dust of time. They posed as educators, opened up schools and colleges, removed from Uistory books the accounts of their crimes, gained control of tlte public pressi made friends witli princes and mlers of the land, even becoming their advisors and confessors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the sight of AJmiglg1Jty God and Christ Jesus the Jesuits stand accursed, for tliey have committed their abominations (which- are ns black as their robes) nuder the name '(Society of Jesus&quot; (S.J.). Deceptive in uame, shrewd in diplomacy’’, cunning in priestcraft, indeed the Jesuits are as suhtle and slippery as the serpent Satan &quot;which de-ceiveth the whole world&quot;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">After shopping- around in the market of unemployed kings Britain finally gave </span><span class="font8">the </span><span class="font9">job to the hoy Prince Otto of Ba</span><span class="font4"></span><span class="font9">varia. A three-man regency was Relected to rnle until Otto became of age. To make sure that this victory would Inst Britain made a financial investment of 60,000,000 francs in the form of a loan to the newly formed government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the years that followed Britain never lost her interest in Greeee. When the Greeks slipped up and forgot to pay interest on the loan Britain sent her warships to make it ''easy&quot; for the Greeks to see their way dear to make the payment. When r</span><span class="font8">p</span><span class="font9">volt broke out in </span><span class="font8">1862 </span><span class="font9">the British were there to iron it ont. When Otto vacated the Greek throne the British were on hand to select another dynasty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The House of Glucksburg was chosen and its William George</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font9">“whom the British government had designated as a suitable candidate,'' says the </span><span class="font8">Encyclopedia Britannica, </span><span class="font9">took over the job. </span><span class="font8">At </span><span class="font9">the time </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font9">new constitution was issued to quiet the dissatisfied Greek popula&lt;&gt;e, concerning which one writer remarked that it served •'to refurbish the democra</span><span class="font4"></span><span class="font8">tic </span><span class="font9">faQtt&lt;le of British domination''. In other words, </span><span class="font8">the </span><span class="font9">second dynasty, m:e the nrgt, was in reality a puppet governmejit of tie far-fhmg British empire. Today, atter eighty years, many of them hectic ones</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font9">the House of Glucksburg cont</span><span class="font8">m</span><span class="font9">ues to awkwardlv straddle the Greek throne in the person of George </span><span class="font10">II.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">TJie evidence is abundant that the Greek monarchy is under the joint sponsorship of British imperialism and the commercial-political-religions clique of Greece, rather than a government of the freedom-loving common people tlwm-selvt'R. But why is Britinn mixed up in Greece's internal affairs t It is not so much to give the Greek people what they want as it is to supply Britain's wants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This is tlte Tragedy of G reece</span><span class="font4">. </span><span class="font9">Greece, the land that once rocked in her cradle the democratic infant, now finds that she is rocking in the same cradle an illicit monarchy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font9">HE United States Constitution guarantees representation by a lawyer for one's defense. It also secures the right of trial by jury. Those inalienable rights Jmve been considered essential to secure the liberties of i.1te people against any aggression of their government and the oppression of tyrants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But wliat good does it do one to have a lawyer to advocate his cause </span><span class="font8">if </span><span class="font9">his only defense is illegally ruled out by the court? \Vbat benefit results to a citizen to have a 1-iglit of trial by jury jf the case is taken from the jury in an unfair manner, the accused one's defense being withheld, from the jury by the eourt as being immaterial? When one's defenses are arbitrarily barred, in effect he is deprived of the right of counsel. A lawyer can do </span><span class="font5">110 </span><span class="font9">good if he cmmot defend. Having a jury is no advantage if the jury cannot consider the defenses. The right to a judicial trial and to due process of law being denied, all the other jnalienable rights secured by the Constitution do no good whatever to the accused person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In </span><span class="font9">case.s involving Jehovah's witnesses under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 (commonly known as the draft law )7 the federal courts denied them the right to show they were ministers. They were not permitted to show that the draft boards violated the law. In court they were deprived of their right to be heal’d. Also, in effect, they</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NOVEMBER </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">8, 1946 </span><span class="font9">were stripped of their right to trial by jury and of the right to be represented by counsel. There were twelve citizens in the jury box, of course; and an attorney nominally appearing in court for the accused. But jury and counsel were of no help to the accused because the orders he was charged with violating were held by the courts of the entire nation to be unchallengeable by any court or jury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Supreme Court of the United States did not approve this doctrine in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Falbo</span><span class="font9"> v. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">United States</span><span class="font9"> 320 U.

Therefore the lower courts following the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Falbo</span><span class="font9"> decision persisted in holding that </span><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font9">ehovah's witnesses could not challenge the draft-hoard orders unless and until fliey complied with such orders. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Falbo</span><span class="font9"> decision did not stop the nefarious doctrine. The. evasive opinion of the Supreme Court in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Falbo</span><span class="font9"> case encouraged the government and the lower courts. They persisted in the argument that the only remedy available to Jehovah's witnesses was submission to induction.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Witnesses Stand Firm</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">.Jehovah's witnesses did not capitulate </span><span class="font8">to </span><span class="font9">the demands of the lower courts and the government. Tliey did not submit to the lawless orders of the draft boards. They stood firm on their ground. They</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">21 </span><span class="font9">contended that it was not neeessary to comply with sueh lawless orders of any board before eballenging their validity in court. Their counsel asserted that there must be some point, before full complianee with the lawlesR order, where a defense was available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Falbo</span><span class="font9"> decision was vague. It was misconstrued by the goveriiDient and the lower eonrts </span><span class="font6">a8 </span><span class="font9">approving the erroneous doctrine iliat one must submit to the order aud then apply .for a writ </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">habeas corpus as the only means of challengmg the ilegal order. But on March 27, 1944, iu </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Billings </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">v. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Truesdell,</span><span class="font8"> 32l U. </span><span class="font9">S. 542, the Supreme Court clarified to a certain extent what it hacl decided in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Falbo </span><span class="font9">case. It was declared that the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Falbo</span><span class="font9"> decision made it necessary to report at the induction station for the second physical examination in order to ascertain whether or not liability for training and service can be avoided on physical or mental groimds. The court held that it would not permit the armed forces to forcibly induct against his will any registrant who reported for the sole purpose of having determined whether he conld he rejected on account of physical or mental defects. The court said that </span><span class="font8">th </span><span class="font9">ont reporting for that purpose could lje damned by the military, that would &quot;indeed make a trap of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Falbo</span><span class="font9"> case by subjecting those who reported. for completion of the seleo-t)ve process to more severe penalties than those who stayed away in defiance of the board's order to report&quot;.-321 U. S. at pages 558-559.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">VVben the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Billings</span><span class="font9"> decision was considered along with the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Falbo</span><span class="font9"> decision counsel for .Telwval’s witnesses concluded that tliev had e:xliansted tlieir administrative remedies upon talcing of the preinduction physical examination. That being true! Falbo had completed the selective process. He litl.d exhausted his administrative remedies. Therefore counsel for Falbo concluded that </span><span class="font8">in </span><span class="font9">his case the court had misinterpreted and misapplied the Regulations. A second petition for rehearing, urging this point, was ftled in the Supreme Court. It was hnstilv overruled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The lower federal courts became more adamant in their contention that Jehovah's witnesses had no right to make a defense to indictments charging them with violating draft-board orders. Indeed, in many instances where Jehovah's witnesses pleaded “not guilty”, resulting in constitutional trial by jury, many lower federal courts penalized Uliem by adding fines to their prison sentences. That was because they refused to plead guilty to the charges. This was done for the purpose of discouraging constitutionally guaranteed trials by jury. </span><span class="font8">It </span><span class="font9">was an attempt to force pleas of “guilty” to the illegal orders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The mountain of precedent piled high in the path of Jehovah's witnesses by the thousands of lower court decisions against them holding it was necessary to submit to induction. Jehovah's witnesses nevertheless pushed against it, persisting in their argument tliat it was mmecessary to submit to induction as the price to challenge the lawless draftboard orders. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Billings</span><span class="font9"> decision, clarifying the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Falbo</span><span class="font9"> decision? suggested that new patterns should be made. New test appeals had to be arranged to sound out the court. The mind of the comt had to be probed to ascertain when, where and how one who refused to submit to induction could challenge the validity of a draft-board order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The decision in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Billings</span><span class="font9"> case made it impossible for the armed forces to claim jurisdiction over oiie who reported only for the purpose of taking the physical examination and who refused to submit to induction. Tliis made it safe for Jehovah's witnesses to go to the very “end of the rope&quot;. Except in eases of men classed as conscientious objectors by boards this further step was necessary to avoid any possibility of the courtsi side-stepping the issue again, as was done in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Falbo</span><span class="font9"> case.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>New Catfes Appealed</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">For l-3iich refusals to submit to induction several of Jehovah's witnesses were inducted and prosecuted under the Act. According to the Supreme Court decisions, it was contended that, inasmuch as they had gone to the end of the selective process, refusing to submit to induction, they ltad snfliciently exhausted the administrative remedies to qualify themselves for a defense that the draft-board order was illegal. H owevE'r, tlte courts stubbornly continued in refusal to permit the defense to be made. Federal district courts and the courts of appeals consistently held there was no defense at any time before actual induetion into the armed forces. They held that Jehovah's witnesses would have to submit to the &quot;trap&quot;. That meant they would have to take the oath of induction and run the gamut of court-martial prosecutions, </span><span class="font8">while </span><span class="font9">attempting to secure review by habeas corpus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When many additional cases, made from </span><span class="font8">the new </span><span class="font9">suggested pattern, were presented to the Supreme Court, at trst it refused to accept them for review. However, ou May 28, 1945, the cotrt called in for review the case or </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Smith. </span><span class="font9">v. </span><span class="font8">United States, </span><span class="font9">tried ai Columbia, S.C. Then on October 8, 1945, the court granted review in another case, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Estep</span><span class="font9"> v. U</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">n</span><span class="font8">i</span><span class="font9">t</span><span class="font8">ed </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">States,</span><span class="font9"> which originated at Pittsburgh, Pa. Both cases involved Jeho-vnh's witneRRes. Both men claimed exemption from r11 8erdce on the ground that. they were ministers of religion. Their boards placed them in class I-A, making them Hable for training and servite in tltc armed forces. The boards ordered them to report for induction. .At the time specified they appeared at the induction station. There they underwent the registration and e:xaurinntioii jH’ocess of thE' armed forces, but refused to participate in the induction ceremony.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>Some Contentions of Counsel</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">In those cases (as in the </span><span class="font8">orte hundred </span><span class="font9">other test draft- cases appealed to the higher federal courts) it was contended that the refusal of the lower courts to permit Jehovah's witnesses to challenge. the orders of the draft boards constituted denial of a judicial trial. It was contended t.hat denial of the judicial trial transformed. the Act and Regulations into u bill of pains anl penalties, contrary to the bill-of-attainder clause of the Constitution. </span><span class="font7">In </span><span class="font8">the </span><span class="font9">Supreme Court these contentions were argued orally by counsel for Jehovah's witnesses in behalf of petitioners Smith and Estep. In the exhaustive 205-page written argument (referred to by lawyers and judges as a brief), filed in printed form in the Supreme Court, counsel, among many other things, stated as follows :</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A hill of attainder is a legislative act which infliets pmiishment without </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font7">juUicial triaL</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Act and Regulations have been eon-strut-d so </span><span class="font8">as </span><span class="font7">to require the petitioner to </span><span class="font8">sur-</span><span class="font7">l'end</span><span class="font8">er </span><span class="font7">himself to the military authorities by submission to induction, as </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font7">condition to obtaining judicial review. </span><span class="font8">If </span><span class="font7">he does not surrender himsel£ and submit to </span><span class="font8">the </span><span class="font7">jmisdiction of the armed forces as commanded, upon his trial he is </span><span class="font8">conclusively </span><span class="font7">presumed to have had </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font7">duty for training and service and of having violated such duty under the </span><span class="font8">Act. </span><span class="font7">In defense to the indictment he cannot show </span><span class="font9">that </span><span class="font7">he had no duty under the Act. This is </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font7">denial of </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font7">judk:iiil </span><span class="font8">trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While the general type of bill of attainder is any </span><span class="font8">l</span><span class="font7">a</span><span class="font8">w </span><span class="font7">that deprives </span><span class="font9">a </span><span class="font8">p</span><span class="font7">erson of a judicial trial, history shows that there are two specific lands of bil.ls of attainder that flourished in England: One was where a person was commanded to report and surrend</span><span class="font6">e</span><span class="font7">r at a </span><span class="font8">c</span><span class="font7">ertain time and place. Upon his failure thus to up-pear he was treated as </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font7">dome!.1.ic rebeL being tried upon the conc</span><span class="font8">l</span><span class="font7">usive presumption of the duty and the violation thereof. </span><span class="font8">T</span><span class="font7">he other kind </span><span class="font8">of </span><span class="font7">bill of attainder was where a person was d</span><span class="font8">eni</span><span class="font7">ed </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font7">right for his failure to undergo a ceremony or take </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font7">test oath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There </span><span class="font6">s </span><span class="font7">a close pa</span><span class="font6">r</span><span class="font8">al</span><span class="font7">el between the English bills of attainder and the eoustructiou placed </span><span class="font8">upon Section 11 (50 </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">U. S. </span><span class="font7">C. App. Sec. </span><span class="font8">311) </span><span class="font7">of the Act </span><span class="font8">in </span><span class="font7">question. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">U</span><span class="font7">nder the English procedure the person named in the bill was denied th</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">e </span><span class="font7">right of </span><span class="font6">u </span><span class="font9">j</span><span class="font7">u</span><span class="font8">di</span><span class="font7">cial </span><span class="font6">1 </span><span class="font7">J'illl to dete</span><span class="font8">r</span><span class="font7">mine his guilt if he </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">railed to</span><span class="font8"> report </span><span class="font7">and surrender or submit at the time mal place mentioned in the </span><span class="font8">order.

<p><span class="font7">In England, un</span><span class="font8">d</span><span class="font7">er the bills of nttainder, the only question that the courts w</span><span class="font5">e</span><span class="font7">re allowed to consider was whether the nccused complied with the order demanding that he report and surrender himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here, the requirement tha</span><span class="font8">t </span><span class="font7">petitioner submit </span><span class="font6">to </span><span class="font7">inUn</span><span class="font6">c</span><span class="font7">tion </span><span class="font5">us </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font7">londition preceUent </span><span class="font8">to his </span><span class="font7">obtaning judicia</span><span class="font8">l </span><span class="font7">review of the illt&gt;gality of the draft-board order is t</span><span class="font4">a</span><span class="font7">ntamount </span><span class="font6">to </span><span class="font7">requiring that he submit to a </span><span class="font8">test oath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In </span><span class="font7">other words, the construction placed on tho Act, so ns to afford petitioner opportunity to obtain judicial review by habeas corpus, opens a way for him to es</span><span class="font4">c</span><span class="font7">ape </span><span class="font8">from </span><span class="font7">the penalty mposed</span><span class="font9">. </span><span class="font7">However, before he run h&lt;‘ recog</span><span class="font8"></span><span class="font7">nized by t.lHi </span><span class="font8">comis </span><span class="font7">and given prolection of his legal rightR under the Act (according 1o construction plucod on the A&lt;'t as incluUing a way provided for him to eseapc the penalty)</span><span class="font8">, </span><span class="font7">he is required to nnde</span><span class="font8">r</span><span class="font7">go a sort of expurgatory oath, the oath of induction.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Mr. Justice Douglas, speaking for the majority, state</span><span class="font9">d, </span><span class="font8">among other things:</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The authority of the local boards whose orders are the basis of tli</span><span class="font4">&lt;'</span><span class="font6">s</span><span class="font7">e crimjnal prosecu</span><span class="font8"></span><span class="font7">tions is circumscribed both by the Act and by the Regulations . ... It would seem, therefore, that if a Pennsylvunia board ordered a citizen and resident of Otegon to report for induction, the defense that it acted beyond its jurisdiction could be interposed in a prosecution under Section 11 </span><span class="font1">. •. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Any other case where a local board nets so contrary to its granted authority as to exceed its jurisdiction does not stand on a different footing. . . .

If a </span><span class="font8">local </span><span class="font7">board ordered a memljer of Congress to report for induction, or i</span><span class="font8">f it classified </span><span class="font7">a 1‘egis-traut as available for military serdee, heranse he was </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font8">Jew, </span><span class="font7">or </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">n </span><span class="font8">G</span><span class="font7">erman, or </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font7">Negro, </span><span class="font8">it </span><span class="font7">would act in defiance of the law. ... In all such cases its action would be lawless and he-yond its jUriscHctiou.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">... We eannot believe that Congress n-tended that eriminal sanetions were to he applied to orders issued by loeal hoards no matter how flagrantly they violated the rules and regulations whieh defuie their jurisdiction. We are denlug here with a question of personal liberty.

Congress departed so far from the traditional concepts of a fair trial when it made the actions of the local boards &quot;final&quot; as to provide that a 1'itizen of this country should </span><span class="font6">go </span><span class="font7">t.o jail for not obeying au unlawful oriler of an administrative agency.</span></p>

Answering the dissenting opinion of Mr. </span><span class="font10">Justice </span><span class="font9">Frtnkfnrter </span><span class="font8">in </span><span class="font9">the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Estep </span><span class="font9">and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">8rnith</span><span class="font9"> cases, Mr. Justice Murphy said :</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To sustain the convictions of the two petitioners </span><span class="font8">in </span><span class="font7">these cases would require adherence to the proposition that a person may be cr^u-nally punished without ever being accorded the opportunity to prove that the prosecution is hnsed upon an invalid administrative order. That is </span><span class="font6">n </span><span class="font7">proposition to which I ennnot subscribe. It Yiolnt.es the most elementary and fundamental concepts of due process of law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Before </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font7">person may be punished for violating </span><span class="font4">an </span><span class="font7">administrative order due process of law requires that the order be within the </span><span class="font6">nu-</span><span class="font7">thorit'Y of the administrative agency and that it not be issued in such a way as to deprive the person of his constitutional rights. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font7">court having jurisdiction to try snch </span><span class="font4">n </span><span class="font7">case has </span><span class="font9">a </span><span class="font7">cleaT, inherent duty to inquire into these matters so that constitutional righs are not impaired or destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is something baskally wrong and unjust about a juridical system that sanctions the imprisonment of a man without ever ae-corCiing him the opportunity to </span><span class="font8">claim </span><span class="font7">that the charge </span><span class="font8">made </span><span class="font7">ugainst him is illegal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We must be cognizant of the faet tha.t we are denling here with a legislative measure born of the cataclysm of war, which necessitates many temporary restrictions on personal lib</span><span class="font4">e</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">r</span><span class="font7">ty and freedom. But the war power is not a blank check to be used </span><span class="font8">in </span><span class="font7">blind disregard of all the individual rights which we have struggleU so long to recognize and preserve. It mnst he used with discretion and with </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font7">Rense of proportionate. values. </span><span class="font8">In </span><span class="font7">this iMtauce it seems hig-hJr improbable that the war effort necmisitates the destruction of the right of </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font7">person charged with a crime to obtain a complete review and consideration of his defense. As long as courts are open and </span><span class="font8">fllctio^rng </span><span class="font7">judicial review is not expendable.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font9">ehovah's witnesses believe in The Theocracy.

<p><span class="font9">obJigatious to Jehovah reqnlrmg them to preach. In preference to capitulaion to the enemy Satan, Jehovah's witnesses have fought. They have shown a willingness to fight unto death. They were willing to suffer ignominy </span><span class="font8">in </span><span class="font9">order to prove the righteousness of their God Jehovali and the correctness of their stand. Theii’ willingness to fight for righteous principles Jias again caused them to carry the hanner of the Bill of Rights as well as of The Theocracy.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>Witnesses Did Not Compromise</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">In the fight waged by Jehovah's witnesses to re-estal&gt;lisb in the court; the fundamental rights of the citizen to be heard, there could be no compromise. In their effort to reconstruct this bastion of liberty in tJie federal courts, they gave no quarter and they asked for none. Therefore tliey persisted on, trusting in Jehovah to lead them through the confused darkness of the law to the crack in the mighty legal wall erected in tlieir path. They sought the place to drive the wedge that resulted in the opening up of a pathway through the </span><span class="font8">bars to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">freedom. </span><span class="font9">Jehovah's witnesses not only have </span><span class="font6">ex</span><span class="font9">perienced victory for themselves, but also have caused the federal courts to be reinstated in the place where they properly belong. The federal courts were ordained by the founders of this nation as a bulwark of protection for the peopled rights against tyrants and oppressors. This restoration has reinstated public confidence in the independence of the federal courts. Moreover, it' bas magnified the fact that the ordained ministers of Jehovah God cannot be successfully mistreated for all time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah God vindicates His servants in the fight against His enemy; &quot;fQr the battle is not yours, hnt God's.&quot; Victory results in the vindication of the name </span><span class="font8">of </span><span class="font9">Jehovah, to whom all honor is due.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Tral, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of an Archbishop</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">^ </span><span class="font6">Ecclesiastics, particularly those of the Roman Catholic cult. have long been considered as above the demnnds of the law. No court of merely human composition was believed to have a right to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">s</span><span class="font6">it in judgment when it came to a priest, a bshop, archbishop or other ecclesiastic. ^This ssue came to the fore in Yugoslavia during October in the trial of Roman Catholic Archbishop Stepinatz of Yugoslavia. The event was considered one of the most important of the century. Stepinatz was charged with collaboration with the NQZis during the occupation of Oroatia and of approving forced conversions to the Roman Catholic sect. As leader of the Ustashi terrorists he was involved n the murder of some 50,000 Croatian and Bosnian Jews as well as in the massacre of over 500,000 Serbs. Stepinatz, and the pope too, denied the charges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A Vatican source said, ''By dragging Archbishop Stepinatz before a civilian tribunal without the Vatican's authorization, Tito (premier of Yugoslavia) has incurred a minor excommunication </span><span class="font1">. • • </span><span class="font6">According to church Jaw, members of the clergy, and especially bishops, are exonerated from judgment of any kind in civilian trlbwials unless the Vatican grants permission that they be placed on trial.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Th.ee special privileges of the clergy, however, were set aside by the People's Court to which Stepinatz was tried, and, the evidence against him being overwhelming, he was sentenced to sixteen years at hard labor. For flve years after that he will continue without the rights of citizenship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">DanUbe Blues and </span><span class="font6">Trieste</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">^ </span><span class="font6">The Danube, second most important river of Europe, flows through or along the borders of several countries: Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulga</span><span class="font4">r</span><span class="font6">ia and Rwnania. (Germany and Au</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">s</span><span class="font7"></span><span class="font6">tria, however, have only the upper reaches.) It flows into the Black sea, which S surrounded by Rumania, Bulgaria, Turkey and Russia. Rumania controls the mouth </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font6"> the Danube. The lands mentioned, with the exception of Turkey, are largely under the influence of Russia and are inclined to favor RRus-sia's viewpoint. It is not, therefore, strange, that the Paris Peace Parley should find the Danube a knotty problem, calculated to provolce tile blues among the conferees. Arnving at a decision, with neither Ea.st nor West inclined to give way, was difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Danubian countries, moreover, are also interested in the territory of Trieste, which presented another snag in peace deliberations. After long deliberations the West's demand for a free Trieste under the control of the ^UN Security Council was approved by the Conference. Opposing votes were cast by Soviet Russia, Czeehoslovaltia, Yugoslavia, Poland, Byelo^Russa and the Ukrane. Yugoslavia was defiant and said it would not accept the decision when the time for the sign^g of the treaty should come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Freedom of the Danube was voted when the Rumanian treaty wa&quot;! passed. This matter, along with that of Trieste, will have to be finally settled by the Big Four. Speeded up by rules of procedure the Conference finished its work on peace treaties with the Axis satellte lands October 14. But no issue was con.siderel as finally disposed of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Darde.neUes Controve1'8y</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">&lt;$&gt;</span><span class="font6"> Russia seems determined to do something about the obstruction that keeps her shipping subject to the good graces of other powers, as far as passing from the Black sea to the Mediterranean is concerned. She has been making overtures toward Turkey to give her a share in the defenses of the Dardanelles, but Turkey insists that an anangeme’nt of that kind would violate her sovereignty. The United States has issued </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">strong note, declaring that it is interested in w.hat is done about the Dardanelles in harmony with the agreement of the Big Three at Potsdam that any changes </span><span class="font8">n </span><span class="font6">tile present setup, called the Montreux Convention (1936), would have to be considered by all the nter-ested powers. </span><span class="font7">An </span><span class="font6">early conference of all such powers was recommended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nazis Senteneood,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Imprisoned. Hanged</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&lt;$&gt; </span><span class="font6">Gathered in the Nuremberg courtroom </span><span class="font9">21 </span><span class="font6">Nazis heard the War Ormes Tribunal, which had been sitting in their trial, for </span><span class="font0">several months, pronounce their doom. Eleven of them were to die for their crimes in war and </span><span class="font8">n </span><span class="font0">peace, while of the other ten, seven were given prison terns of varying length. Three were acquitted. Those sentenced to death were Hermann Goering, called No. </span><span class="font6">2 </span><span class="font0">Nazi; Joachim von Ribbenthrop, Wilhelm Keitel, Alfred Jodl, Ernest Kal-tenbrunner, Alfred Rosenberg, Hans Frank, Wllhebn Frick, Ar-thnr Seiss-lnquart, </span><span class="font6">Jttliws </span><span class="font0">Streicher, and FTitz Sauckel. (Martin Bormann had heen tried in absentia, and was believed to be dead.) Life imprisonment was the portion of Rudolf Hess, Walther Ftmk and Erich Raeeler. Twenty-year sentences were dealt ont to Baldur von Shir.ach and Albert Speer, tlftee.n years to Constantin von Neurath, and ten years to Karl Doenitz. Franz von Papen (who brought Hitler to pawer), Hjalmar Schacht Hans Fiitzsche were acquitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Generally the severest sen tences were approved, the more moderate criticized adversely. The acquittals, particularly that of the papal knight von Papen, were most unpopular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Immediately after midnight of October </span><span class="font6">15 </span><span class="font0">the hangings were carried n to eflect and the guilty pa</span><span class="font8">i</span><span class="font0">d with their lives for their crimes against humanity. Hermann Goering escaped banging by committing suicide in his cell little more than an hour before the stroke of twelve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Moslems Offer </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Co-operation</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">^ The tense situation which </span><span class="font6">^has </span><span class="font0">existed </span><span class="font6">in India </span><span class="font0">ever since the interim gove^rnment took charge began to ease somewhat when, in response to a new offer by Viscount Wavell. viceroy of India, the Moslems indicated they would jon with the Rinkns in governmental arrangements. By the proposed arrangement the Moslems would lie given five seats in the fourteen-member interim government. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">tHin-</span><span class="font0">du) Co.nguess party would hold six scats and the remaining three would be given to Indian Christians, Sikhs and Parsis, minority groups. </span><span class="font6">It Wt'l.a </span><span class="font0">felt in England, however, that the arrangement would not settle India's difficulties, although a step </span><span class="font6">il </span><span class="font0">the right direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Trumw </span><span class="font8">Statement on Palestine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">^ </span><span class="font0">President Truman took occasion October </span><span class="font6">-1, </span><span class="font0">about the time of Jewish New </span><span class="font6">Year </span><span class="font0">festivities, to urge the British gove^rnment to arrange tor substantial immigration of Jewish refugees nto Palestine. At the same time the president advocated that other countries liberalize their immi^ gration laws to provide for refugees. He also expressed his will-ngness to recommend congressional provision for economic aid </span><span class="font6">to </span><span class="font0">develop Palestine, If more Jews could be admitted. The statement angered the Arabs, encouraged the Jews, displeased the British.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The British, government considered the proposal ill-timed, unfortunate. It was currently trying to brng Jews and Arabs together </span><span class="font6">in </span><span class="font0">conference, with little success. </span><span class="font6">^The </span><span class="font0">timing of the message, Britan claimed, &quot;could not have been worse.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Con8tltutlon for </span><span class="font6">Fraoce</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">^ Another proposed Constitu</span><span class="font6">tion </span><span class="font0">has at long lnst been approved by the population of France. that is, by a sufficient number of those voting to pass the document. The official count of those voting was </span><span class="font6">9,200,467 </span><span class="font0">for, and </span><span class="font6">7,790,676 </span><span class="font0">against. Several million refrained </span><span class="font6">from </span><span class="font0">voting at all, which fact is used by both sides as an argument agninst the other. The frst draft was, however, rejected (May </span><span class="font6">5) </span><span class="font0">by a plurality of over a million votes. whereas the last referendum lOctober </span><span class="font8">13) </span><span class="font0">gained a majority nf well over a </span><span class="font6">ml-</span><span class="font0">lion. The opposition of fonner President de Gualle carried much weight, fnd the </span><span class="font6">fact </span><span class="font0">that the constitutional draft carded over his opposition indicates that a substantial section of the French electorate will back up their decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Constitution </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font0"> Japan</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">^ A new constitution for Japan, to talte effect in six months, was finally passed by the lower house of the Japanese Parliament on October </span><span class="font6">7. </span><span class="font0">Approval was expressed by a standing vote, and only live members indicated dissent. The formal issuance of an Imperial Rescript, in which Emperor Hirohito signifies his consent and approval of the new basic law, was assured. A few days before this event Gen. Douglas MacArthur practically removed the crime of lese maje.sty from the statnte books o( Japan. Said the general: ''The protection accorded to [the emperor] as the symbol of the state ought to be no more, no Jess. than the protection accorded </span><span class="font6">to </span><span class="font0">the citizen</span><span class="font1">. •</span><span class="font0">To hold the contrary would constitute a. direct negation of one of the basic principles of democratic government.^</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Japa-^se </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Parliament</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">^ The Japanese Parliament, adjourning after the longest session in Japanese history, .had something to show. (It was the first to be elected under </span><span class="font6">the </span><span class="font0">new democratic procedures ordered by the Allied occupation.) Among other provisions, it passed laws relating to labor which provided the right to organize but prohibits strikes of government employees suCh as policemen, teachers, provincial or rnwticipal officials. A thirtyday ''cooling off&quot; period is fixed </span><span class="font6">in </span><span class="font0">utility cases, and compulsory arbitration may be enforced by the government. In other fields voluntary arbitration will be aided by rrbitration boards. The Land Reform Law makes available nearly </span><span class="font6">5,000,000 </span><span class="font0">acres of land for purchise through the government by former tenant farmers, and enforces the sale of absentee-owned lands worked by tenants. A capital levy law imposes </span><span class="font6">a tax </span><span class="font0">of 25 to </span><span class="font6">90 </span><span class="font0">percent on fnrtunas over </span><span class="font6">100,000 </span><span class="font0">yen. which is about </span><span class="font6">$6,600 </span><span class="font0">at official exchange rates. The War lildemuity Cancellation provi</span><span class="font7">sion cancels the government's guarantees to make good war damages to industry, which wipes out a debt of more than a hundred billion yen. The Rehabilitation Finance Law estain lishes a government fund of ten billion yen to finance the recovery of light industry needed to manufacture products for re^ construction.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">^ Establishment of an interim legislature for that part of Korea occupied by the United States became assured when a co^itLon committee including leaders of the Right and Left agreed upon essentials. Some minoliti.es, ncludng Communists, did not support the ar rangement, but seats were to be left open for fepresentatives of these minority groups. The rec ommendatOn to be made to General Hodge follows closely a suggestion made by him previously, and provides a body of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">90 </span><span class="font7">members, half of them to be elected and the other half chosen by the United States generin. The population of the American zone is esimated to be </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">18,000.000; </span><span class="font7">so there will be one elected representative for every </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">400,000 </span><span class="font7">persons.</span></p>

The British troops in the East Indies, numbering some </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">25,000, </span><span class="font7">are scheduled to leave by the end of November. Discussions on the political arrangements for Indonesia continued. The Dutch-Indonesian conference decided that the stabilization </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font7">the military strength of the Dutch aiid Indonesian sides would remain as it was, which would give the Dutch </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">100,000 </span><span class="font7">troops in Indonesia. The Indo^ nesians are believed to have about </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">200,000 </span><span class="font7">men under arms. A joint committee composed of three Dutch members and three Indonesians undertook to consider means of coming to an understanding for the government of the Indies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">^ The virtually total absence ot meat contimied to plague the American people the first two </span><span class="font8">weeks </span><span class="font7">of October. There was plenty ot stock on the ranches and feed lots, but no meat on the table. Reconversion tfu^ector Joohn R. Steelman predicted that the situation would get worse during the winter. Meat became a political issue, or rather. the absence of meat. D^ocrats were afraid it would result dl'!t-rlmenta.lly to their cause at the November elections. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font7">parley on the problem was held at the White House, witlk cabinet chiefs called in and Truman also taking part. The army cut down on meat rations. Crowds stood n the rain in their efforts to get some meat . Anrjthiiw parley at the Wlilte House produced the infomiation that </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">president would talk </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">the country </span><span class="font8">on </span><span class="font7">Monday evening.

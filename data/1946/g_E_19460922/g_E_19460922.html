<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font14"><a name="bookmark18"></a>POGROMS IN POLAND</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">F</span><span class="font8">OR six long years millions of men fought, bled and died in a terrible world war. Presumably those men were -fighting for the purpose of destroying forever the beastly forces that enslaved, persecuted and killed innocent men and women. By Jnly 4, 194(), the memory of those war yean; had not died; and so it vms a shock to the world to hear on that dav that .fl Jews had been massacred ill Poland, the very country where World War JI began in. 1939. Such an organized massacre of helpless Jews as that is called a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">pogrom,</span><span class="font8"> meaning &quot;devas-liition&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Why such killings continue to plague the peace of the world is what thinking people would like to know. Wily were such victims Jews/ AvVl1y tlid not the officials of Poland prevent iU Why were tliese innocent Jews killed by a Catholic mob? Why did the Catholic bishop:; and cardinals not prevent it1 Weighty questions, thc::;e, that press for an answer. But to arrive at a reasonable answer one must review the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the morning of July 4, at eight o'clock, angry men and women began to gather iit front of the Jewish headquarters in the city of Kielce. By eleven o'clock a moh of several thousand had assembled with murder in their heart::;. That afternooni by three o’clock, they had broken into Jewish homes and stores and had beaten to death 41 persons, besides seriously wounding scores of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The fuse that set off this explosion of mob violence was a story of a nine-year-old boy who deliberately lied that he had been kidnaped, and Iwld in the Jewish headquarters in Kielce for three days, and that while there he had seen the bodies of iifteen Gentile children whom he said the Jews had killed. Later he confessed that he actually was at the home of friends of his father in the neighboring viJlage of Pielmrki.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another hoax was used by several men dressed in the uniform of the PoliSh army. They went to the door of the Jewish headquarters and promised to lead the Jews to safety through the mob. When. they had the helpless Jews outside they turned them over to the crowd, who heat them to death iln A most brutal manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This outrage did not occur on some 4th of July during the Dai'k A.ges, but in the year 1946. It was not executed by Jew-hating Nazlis, but by Na7J-persecut-ed Poles. It was not done by uncivilized cannibals, but by so-called &quot;Christian&quot; Catholics. But whyl</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At first glance it would appear that tho riot was purely an anti-Semitic outbreak of race hatred. Careful observers, however, admit tliat there was more to it than that. \Vhile it is true that there was hatred of the .Jews existing, yet the motive behind the riot that kindled the race hatred to the burning point was a sinister political one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Prior to this outbreak of violence there </span><span class="font9">existed, and continues to exist, much political tension in Poland. Various political groups within </span><span class="font8">tltp </span><span class="font9">country war with one another to increase their power in the government. The referendum that was held on .June </span><span class="font7">30 </span><span class="font9">did lint im prov</span><span class="font8">e </span><span class="font9">the sitnation either. In fad, so</span><span class="font6">i</span><span class="font9">lie claim that the pogrom a few days later developed out of the dissatisfaction over the outcome of the </span><span class="font8">referendum. </span><span class="font9">It was </span><span class="font8">coin</span><span class="font9">cidental, to say the Ira</span><span class="font8">s</span><span class="font9">t, that the pogrom occurred simultameonsly with the pre-liwimu-y annoirncement thu</span><span class="font8">t </span><span class="font9">the referendum calli</span><span class="font7">n</span><span class="font9">g for abolishment of the Senate had lieen \von by the present gov-ermnmit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Political Causes of Pogroms</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are two general divisions of for.ee in Poland</span><span class="font6">: </span><span class="font9">tJte Soviet-sponsored War</span><span class="font8">s</span><span class="font6">a</span><span class="font7">w </span><span class="font9">government, </span><span class="font8">which </span><span class="font9">has Comnm-nistic leaning::;. and the London Polish govermneut, which has the. full </span><span class="font8">support </span><span class="font9">of the </span><span class="font8">Hi</span><span class="font9">erar</span><span class="font6">c</span><span class="font9">by and Catholic interests in England and America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These forces are pole:-i apart in antagonism and are ho 111 powerful. The W</span><span class="font6">a</span><span class="font9">rsaw government, </span><span class="font8">nf </span><span class="font9">course, has the immediate p</span><span class="font8">o</span><span class="font9">w</span><span class="font6">e</span><span class="font9">r of the goYernment, but the London Polish goYernment brings much pressure to </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Iinh'</span><span class="font9"> o</span><span class="font7">n </span><span class="font9">tlte i</span><span class="font7">n</span><span class="font9">ternal affairs through the Catholic hierarch within the </span><span class="font6">c</span><span class="font9">ou</span><span class="font7">n</span><span class="font9">try, the gtwrri I la hands in the forests, and the </span><span class="font8">PoJi;&lt;;Jj armed </span><span class="font9">forces outside the country under the leadership of Oenerals Bor and Anders. Anders' forces, are estimated to he </span><span class="font10">1S0,-000 </span><span class="font9">troops. mid they stand as a coup d'etat threat. The powerful P</span><span class="font4">e</span><span class="font8">a</span><span class="font4">s</span><span class="font6">a</span><span class="font9">nt party, which </span><span class="font8">is </span><span class="font9">C</span><span class="font6">a</span><span class="font9">t</span><span class="font8">h</span><span class="font9">olic under the limd-ersldp of 'Mikolajezyk, also agitates </span><span class="font8">Po</span><span class="font9">la</span><span class="font7">n</span><span class="font9">d's equHibrium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">VVltlt such internal stresses </span><span class="font8">it </span><span class="font9">is little wonder that following the wholesale massacre of Jews in July tlte various factjons immediately pointeO the finger of accusation </span><span class="font8">at </span><span class="font9">the other parties. First of all, why did not the government in power prevent it? Does it lark the pow-ed Nationally, it probably has suJlieicnt power to prevent an ove</span><span class="font7">r</span><span class="font9">throw of government, hut locally it may be weak. This is gathered from the report of ,V. </span><span class="font8">g, </span><span class="font9">L</span><span class="font8">a</span><span class="font9">wren</span><span class="font8">c</span><span class="font9">e in the New York </span><span class="font8">Thn.es </span><span class="font9">of July </span><span class="font8">Hi, 1.946</span><span class="font7">:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is the opinion of </span><span class="font8">all </span><span class="font7">neutral observers who have been </span><span class="font8">in </span><span class="font7">Kid.ee that the secret police and military did not act with normal speed or strength against the moh. It is pointed out that in </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font7">cmmtry where gunfire is normal rather than unusual in breaking np crowds, no shots were fired at the gi’ouj) </span><span class="font9">t</span><span class="font7">h</span><span class="font4">a</span><span class="font7">t </span><span class="font9">killed </span><span class="font7">the .Tews and that none of the mob </span><span class="font8">was killed </span><span class="font7">even u ficr </span><span class="font8">it. </span><span class="font7">h</span><span class="font6">a</span><span class="font8">d </span><span class="font7">killed forty-one Jews and four Poles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Local weakness of tl te present government is seen, too, in the fact that it was </span><span class="font7">n</span><span class="font9">e</span><span class="font6">ce</span><span class="font9">ssary for the government to arrest the local commanders and deiuty command</span><span class="font6">e</span><span class="font9">rs of the securi ty police and •'citizens militia&quot;. There seems, therefore, </span><span class="font8">to be </span><span class="font9">no j)oint in the charge by the opponents of the present regime that it was government forces that plotted the pogrom, for iiwh murderous riot o</span><span class="font7">n</span><span class="font9">ly re-tlected the weakness of its law-enforcement ag-eucy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Underground Guerrillas of Poland were also blamed for the murderous assaults of July 4. These elements have mixed characteristic::;; some are anti-Semitic, some arc anti-communistic, some are nltra-faseiatic. All are opposed to the present government and arl' a law unto themselves. It is quite probable that some of the ringleaders of the pogrom mohsters were of th</span><span class="font6">e</span><span class="font9">se groups. It is also possihle that they were the </span><span class="font8">ones </span><span class="font9">t</span><span class="font8">l</span><span class="font9">t</span><span class="font8">at cmviininied thf' massacre. How</span><span class="font9">ever, it not executed without support •and backing from still another sour</span><span class="font6">ce </span><span class="font9">of power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And wha </span><span class="font7">t </span><span class="font9">is that sinister power? To sav bluntly tltut tlje Homan Catholi</span><span class="font6">c </span><span class="font9">Hierarchy is that sinh;ter power is to invite an outcry of criticism from many people. </span><span class="font8">Proof </span><span class="font9">must first be offered to suhstantiate such an assertion.

<p><span class="font9">Pogroms originated </span><span class="font8">in </span><span class="font9">Russia in 1881, and for a number oi yeaTs thereafter were identified with Uie cruel czarist rulership. Yet Russia is not the only country where such wiekedness has flourished. Sinee the birth or </span><span class="font8">t </span><span class="font9">Iw Polish nation pogroms have been identified as </span><span class="font11">a </span><span class="font9">part of its social standard. </span><span class="font8">No</span><span class="font9">r was this blight on the PoJi::li nation removed by the destruction of thr anti-Remitic forces of Hitler that ruled. Poland. </span><span class="font8">A </span><span class="font9">dispatch in the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font8"> of </span><span class="font9">July 17 said:</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Rememher this important fact in </span><span class="font8">analyzing the causes of Polish </span><span class="font9">pogroms: Poland </span><span class="font8">is </span><span class="font9">a UathoJic country, </span><span class="font8">F:5 </span><span class="font9">percent Catholic. For generations it has heen under the influence of the </span><span class="font7">clergy. </span><span class="font9">Few countries today have a Catholic population as obedient and subservient to the Hierarchy as Poland. .It is J'or this reason that a group of Jews pleaded witli Hie liead of the Catholic church jii Polaml, Cardinal Hlone, </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font9">few weeks hefore July's outrage asking him to is</span><span class="font6">s</span><span class="font9">ue </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">pastoral</span><span class="font8"> letter </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">to the</span><span class="font8"> Catholic popula</span><span class="font9">tion denouncing anti-Semitisin and thus stop the killing off or Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And what was the response of the cardinal to the plea? Did he seize hold of the invitation to prevent the slaughtering of innocent men and women! Shocking as it may seem to honest Catholics, </span><span class="font8">SEPTEMBER </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">J2t,</span><span class="font6"> 194£;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Blond did not lift so much as a finger to prevent it. 'the cardinal said that he thought, '&quot;there were not sufficient factors to justify such a proclamation&quot;, in spite of the faet that on June 14 it was reported that there was a tluee-clay pogrom in the city of Stettin.

<p><span class="font9">The wording ol' the proclamation is very interesting.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Can Pogroms Be Prevented?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Following tile slaughter of July 4 the Warsaw government of Poland made a vigorous ejfort to </span><span class="font7">bring </span><span class="font9">the perpetrators of the crime to justice. Twelve persons were rounded up and tried by a military court. Nine of thein were sentenced to be hanged. This is said to he the frrst time in </span><span class="font8">P</span><span class="font9">o</span><span class="font8">la</span><span class="font7">n</span><span class="font9">d</span><span class="font4">’</span><span class="font9">s </span><span class="font8">histoi'Y </span><span class="font9">where members o.E a pogrom mob were executed for their crimes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But </span><span class="font9">the hanging of nine beasts does not rectify the killing of forty-one </span><span class="font8">intelligent </span><span class="font9">humans. If does not make amends for ‘‘fatally beating </span><span class="font10">a </span><span class="font9">pregnant woman who gave bi </span><span class="font7">r</span><span class="font9">th prematurely to a dead cliild before she, heTself, succumbed to injuries”, as reported by tlte New </span><span class="font11">York </span><span class="font8">Times. </span><span class="font9">Nor ‘vlll the execution of suciJ mobsters prevent future pogroms in Poland. This is evidenced bv the fact that nine Jews were seized and held as hostages for the nine gangsters that were executed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What, then, is the remedy? Is it for the Jews to flpe Poland completely? Before the war there were 3,000,000 Jews in Poland. Now it is estimated that there are less than 160,000, and most of these would </span><span class="font8">like </span><span class="font9">to leave. It is true that if there were no Jews in Poland there wonld be no reported killings of them .from tJtat country, but that does not argue that peace would settle down over Poland. ‘the removal of the Jews would not mean the removal of the cause of th(‘ persecution. the canse of the pogrom is deep-rooted in the internal </span><span class="font8">political </span><span class="font9">tension between the two great philosophies of Russia and the Vati</span><span class="font8">c</span><span class="font9">an. </span><span class="font8">Both </span><span class="font9">clash over the issue of domination of Poland, and the Jews aTe caught in the rrJ.ddle of the struggle.</span></p>

The article follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Judaism</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Jewish religion or Judaism </span><span class="font8">has </span><span class="font9">under</span><span class="font7">gone many changes since the days o£ Moses and the Prophets. Its official </span><span class="font8">gu</span><span class="font7">a</span><span class="font9">r</span><span class="font8">d</span><span class="font7">ians, like the guardians of the various Christian sects, have submitted it to a severe and radical proc^ of cance</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">l</span><span class="font7">la</span><span class="font9">t</span><span class="font7">ion </span><span class="font8">until </span><span class="font7">to</span><span class="font8">d</span><span class="font7">ay it has become what Isaiah so long ago predicted : 'Precept upon precept, line upon line, here a little and there a little: With mauy of the so-called top-J cws it </span><span class="font8">h</span><span class="font7">as ceased to be even </span><span class="font8">that. </span><span class="font7">With them it has become a sort of a pale, indefinite and incorporeal fiction. which expresses itself n costly temples and </span><span class="font8">high-</span><span class="font7">socieQ^ funrtions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font8">is </span><span class="font7">interesting to note, at least </span><span class="font8">from </span><span class="font7">a psychological and linguistie point </span><span class="font8">of </span><span class="font7">Yiew, that nowhere </span><span class="font8">in </span><span class="font7">bibiical </span><span class="font8">literature </span><span class="font7">can one find a </span><span class="font8">c</span><span class="font7">ol</span><span class="font9">l</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">e</span><span class="font7">ctive name for the spiritual and social code, which is the essenc</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">e </span><span class="font7">of the Jewish religion. The only word which may he thus interpreted is &quot;Torah&quot;, which is currently tr</span><span class="font6">n</span><span class="font7">nsluted as &quot;Law&quot;. Actually it is derived from the Hebrew verb &quot;Yoro&quot;, which means to hit at the targ</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">e</span><span class="font7">t, i.e., something that </span><span class="font8">has </span><span class="font7">or must have a practical uud useful aim. The word &quot;Yahaduth&quot; or Judaism is of much later origin and occurs for the </span><span class="font8">first </span><span class="font7">time, </span><span class="font8">f </span><span class="font7">my memory serves me right, in Midrash Esther, which, accord</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">i</span><span class="font7">ng to many authorities, was written as late as the Babylonian exile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Be </span><span class="font7">that </span><span class="font8">as </span><span class="font7">it muy, it is certain that already during the heyday period of the Palestinian Jewish commonwealth the Mosaic </span><span class="font8">c</span><span class="font7">o</span><span class="font8">d</span><span class="font7">e </span><span class="font8">as </span><span class="font7">welt as the pro</span><span class="font8">p</span><span class="font7">hetic preachments had be-guii to undergo a serious process o£ deliberutt substitution.

The various Jewish sects do not materially differ from one another, despite </span><span class="font8">al </span><span class="font7">their claims to the contrary. They differ only in unimportant and unessential features. The orthodox insist upon an outworn and petrified ceremonialism and upon the minutiae of ritualistic observances. The so-called conservatives or middle-of-the-roaders want the preservation of only </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font7">limited and moddified number of the same, while Refonn .Jews represent the great party of total cancellation. Their Jmlnism is a non-existent ghost, </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font7">sort of huge spiritual zero, fuU of pomp alll adulation of the propertied Jewish classes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the presence of all this spiritual pettifogging and all these pretentiously stentorian claims, the real student of the Jewish religion vainly asks: What has become of Moses and the thundering prophets </span><span class="font8">'? </span><span class="font7">Where can one find that ensemble of laws, which minutely dealt with every phase of pulsating and throbbing human life? l\loses and the prophets laid no great stress upon empty ceremonialism, although they fully realized the importanee of the external visible symbols of the inward and invisible effervescences of the human souL The G8th chapter of the book of Isaiah bears testimony to this fact. The visions of </span><span class="font8">Ezekied, </span><span class="font7">of Micah, of Amos aud </span><span class="font8">nll </span><span class="font7">the other prophets dwell insistently and with unabate</span><span class="font9">d </span><span class="font7">vigor upon the Mosaic claim that social justice and political and eeonomic righteousucss are the key to the Jewish religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The best definition of 1his idind of religion is given by the prophet Micah in the 8th verse of </span><span class="font8">the </span><span class="font7">Gt.h chapter of his book, where he says: 'He hath Shown thee, </span><span class="font8">0 </span><span class="font7">man, what the Lord doth require of thee, to practice justice, to love mercy, and to walk humljly with thy God.' The concept of humility as propounded in the last few words is a pungent reproof of the kings, aristocracies and tltt&gt; so-called captniiis of industry concerning thj?ir false and pretentious c.laims of belonging to </span><span class="font4">a </span><span class="font7">class of &quot;betters&quot;.</span></p>

From the cradle to the grave we wilk down a path of disintegration and finally, wlieii our heart stops beating, death begins its reign. And by counting oiir heartbeats we ean tell how far along this shadowy path we are. The infant’s heart heats from 110 to 140 times a minute; in early childhood the rate is 100 to lJO; the yvutii s heart throbs from 80 to 90 timet-, a minute; in middle age tJie normal beat is 70 to 75 times: and as old age creeps in the heart sluggishly pumps only about </span><span class="font8">Gil </span><span class="font9">tirnes a minute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These counts are normal averages and either physical or mental exertion and excitement will speed up the beat. Also diseases of the heart will either slow H down or speed it up. The heart disease known as </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">paroxysmal tachycardia</span><span class="font9"> causes the heart to bent between 150 and </span><span class="font8">200 </span><span class="font9">times a minute. But such rapid heating tears the heart down and does not permit it to liave its normal rest which is very necessary. Ordinarily the heart gets as much rest as the other parts of the body. If tlte periods of tjme between beats were added up they would total between 8 and 9 hours ont of the 24. or about the same amount of rest as the body gets. During these rest periods the heart is nourished and strengthened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Among the animal creation ilte heartbeat varies quite a hit from that of humans. For example, the Jwrse's heart heats only about half as fast as man's, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">SEPTEMBER </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">22, 194() </span><span class="font9">only </span><span class="font7">28 </span><span class="font9">to 40 beats per minute. </span><span class="font8">A </span><span class="font9">frog's heart ticks only some 20 time8 a minute, •whereas the tlighty mouse's heart sets a pace of from 500 to L000 beats a minute. The heartbeats of birds have also been timed, and it has been learned tJiat the smaller the bird is the faster its heart pumps. The inournijig dove's heartbeat is normally 135, while the ruby-throated lnnmningbinl lias a normal beat of 615. The thoughts of the mind have a great effect on the Tate at which the heart beats. Emotions of love, hate, joy, sorrow and fear make the heart of men ei-tber speed up or slow down, and physical activity and exertion will also cause the heart to work more rapidly. The same is true of other animals. Excitement or exertion will cause the heartbeats of birds to lie greatly accelerated. </span><span class="font8">The </span><span class="font9">peaceful dove with a normal heartbeat of' </span><span class="font8">136. </span><span class="font9">if excited, has a rate of 570. The heart of the cardinal increases from a basal rate vf 445 to </span><span class="font8">810 ; </span><span class="font9">the English sparrow's, from 350 to 902; and the chipping sparrow's heartbeat may jump from a normal of 440 to a maximmn of 1,060 when excited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Counting 1.000 Beats per Minute</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All of this </span><span class="font8">is </span><span class="font9">very interesting, but naturally the question arises as to liow such rapid heartbeats are counted with any degree of accuracy. \Vitli us slow-hearted ereatures it 1s an easy matter to count the normal pulse-beat. Aud when accuracy is wanted to a higli degree we haye the &lt;‘lectrocardjogntph to give us a picture of the human heartbeat with al its irregularities. Sncli instrument is based on the work of Einthoven of Leyden. In 190:3 he invented what was called a string galvanometer capable of detecting currents of electricity as small as one sixtythousandth or one millionth of an ampere, </span><span class="font8">whiCh </span><span class="font9">is the same as one sixtybillionth of an ampere. CmTents as small as that are generated by the heart in its beat, and the electrocardiograph is capable of recording them on a graph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">However, to measure these currents it is necessary to attach the wrists and ankles of the individual to the instrument. This would, therefore, make the electrocardiograph wholly unsatisfactory for clocking the heartbeat; of birds, since the attachment of any such instrument to the physical organism of temperamental birds would immediately raise the rate of their heartbeat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Dr. Eugene P. Odum, of the University of Georgia, has devised au instrument of extreme electrical sensitivity knuwu as a cardiovibrometer. The great advantage of this device is that nothing has to be attached to the birds in order to count their very mpid heartbeats. </span><span class="font8">It </span><span class="font9">is simply attached to the twig upon which the bird is perched, or it is placed under the nest, and in such position it is capable of picking up and recoTding the ever-so-slight beating of the heart. These vibrations are translated into electrical currents and are then amplified to </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font9">degree strong enough to be measured and recorded by an automatic pen on a graph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another interesting tiling that Dr. Odum learned </span><span class="font6">in </span><span class="font9">studying the heartbeat of birds is that naked young birds when first hatched are like cold-blooded lizards and frogs. Their heartbeat from the time of hatching changes directly with the rise and fall in temperature in the same manner as a frog's heartbeat. But as birds grow older they assume the characteristics of warm-blooded ani-malsi and as such the temperature Jias the exact opposite effect that it has on frogs, i.e., the higher the temperature the slower the beat, and the lower the temperature the faster the heartbeat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">WheJi considering these facts about the heartbeat we are not so impressed with the mechanics involved in actually counting the beats as we are with the marvels of the heart itself.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden n Age,</span><span class="font9"> which began to be published </span><span class="font8">A.D. 1919. </span><span class="font9">It was part of a movement to awake on the part of the remnant; of God's faithful people after Uie close of World \Var I, and was foreseen by Jehovah's prophet Ezekiel. In vision Ezekiel saw a great valley of dry bones, and Jehovah put to him the question : &quot;Son of man, can these hones live </span><span class="font8">1&quot; </span><span class="font9">(Ezekiel 37: 3) That same question Ite put into tlte mind of his consecrated peo-pie during then: restrained, inactive eon-ditioii amid World War I.

<p><span class="font9">Ezeki el manifested no stubhorn nnhe-lief oi clouht about what God could do, hut trusting Him lte said: &quot;0 Lord Goo, thou Imowest/' In September, 1919, a large company of Jehovah's witnesses assembled in convention at Cedar Point, Ohio, and the question was: </span><span class="font8">•Wm </span><span class="font9">the work be revived </span><span class="font8">1 </span><span class="font9">Those trusting in God did not say, It can't be done.

So now hope began to revive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Ezekiel was called into action as </span><span class="font8">J </span><span class="font9">eho-vah directed what hf} ;;Iionld do. &quot;Again lte said unto me, Prophesy npon these hones, and say unto </span><span class="font8">them, 0 </span><span class="font9">ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lono.&quot; (37: 4) Like Ezekiel, Jehovah's witnesses fulfilled this part of the prophecy by preaching to each other from and after </span><span class="font8">1919 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">. .</span><span class="font9">{ great deal of it was required to drum it into the minis of God's consecrated ones that they must organize for :service and carry forward the work as foreshadowed by Elisha. </span><span class="font8">Those </span><span class="font9">who really trusted in the Lord God and who loved Hin did hear and obey Tis admonitions to get lmsy. ‘‘Zion heard, and was glad: am] the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of tliy judgments, 0 Lono.&quot;—Psalm 97: </span><span class="font8">8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Ezekiel claf';R kept on prophesying or preaching God'::; message. &quot;Thus saitlt the Lord Gon uuto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into yon, and ye shall live: and </span><span class="font8">T </span><span class="font9">will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up Hesh upon you, and cover you witJt l:ikin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and </span><span class="font6">vt&gt; </span><span class="font9">shall Imow that I am the Loiw.&quot; (37: 5, 6) The Watoutowek Society continued to urge upon Jehovah's remnant the need of organizing for service, and faithful speakers talking to companies joined in prophesying', bringing forth many scriptures to prove that. Gotl would give new life to His work on earth, as pictured and foreshadowed by Elisha; and that He would strengthen His people to do it, giving to them a double por-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">tion of the spirit of Elijah for that purpose. The Elijah and Elisha pictures, understood for the ilrst time in 1919, were reaJly the opening of the work that has increased from tliat year until 1946.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">From 1919 on the Ezekiel class kept on searching the Bible to ascertain God's will. •'So I prophesied as I was eom-manded: aud as I propbesied, there was a noise, and behold a shalcing, and the bones came together, boiic to his hone.&quot; (37: 7) From March 1919 to September 1922 such prophesying kept iip, not according to out-of-date explanation of prophecy, Jut according to the Lord's wilt and commandments, such as Matthew 24: 14 and Isaiah </span><span class="font8">Gl: </span><span class="font9">1-3. As the preaching or prophesying went on, a noise of dissension arose among the various companies of consecrated people, such as is indicated in verse 7 quoted above. Despite such noise of dissension the faithfnl remnant continued to send forth organization instructions and to lay out the work to be done and to push t1ie work forward. Then came a shaking, &quot;an earthquake&quot; (says one Bible translation) , and the faithful ones shook themse</span><span class="font11">l</span><span class="font9">ves and aroused themselves to greater activity. As sounded forth centuries previous, at Isaiah 52 : </span><span class="font8">1, </span><span class="font9">2: </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">&quot;A</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">wake, </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">aw</span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ake ; </span><span class="font9">put on thy strength. 0 Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, 0 Jerusalem, the holy eity: for henceforth there shall no more eome into tlwe the uncircumcised and tJie unclean. Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, 0 Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands </span><span class="font8">of </span><span class="font9">tliy neck, 0 captive daughter of Zion.&quot; So, as this shaking con-tinned, the faithful &quot;bones’’ came together, bone to bone. The dead hopes of the waf-harassed witnesses were revived. They began to get their spiritual vision properly adjusted. riwy realized tliey were not &quot;clean cut off’’ or ''quite cut off'' from Jehovah G ocl and His service, as was said at verse 11 of the vision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Then the remnant began in earnest to form an active, operating organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">SEPTEMBER 22, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">101,6</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;And when </span><span class="font8">I </span><span class="font9">beheld, lo, Ute sinews and the fiesh came up upon them, and the skin covered tJiem above: but tJiere was no breath in them/' (37: </span><span class="font8">8) </span><span class="font9">Those whose hearts were really devoted to the Lord God began to arise from their nnc.lean and dead appearance to a live body of joyful activity in </span><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font9">ehovah's service. Thus they got into unity and in love in Christ and stopped being tossed about by men's opinions.—Ephesians </span><span class="font8">-!: </span><span class="font9">15, 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">God’s faithful. remnant continued to present this matter before Him in prayer, secretly and iu their assembled companies. r_rhis is pictured as fo1Jow:3: &quot;Then Haid he unto me, Prophesy nnto the wind [or, breath]) prophesy, son nf man, and say to the wind, Thus salth the Lord Goo: Come from the four winds, 0 breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.'' (37: 9) God's faithful remnant kept in mind that the work must be accomplished, if at aJl, not by their own might, but by the spirit of the Lord of hosts. The Watch T</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ow</span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">e</span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">r publications continued to prophesy and to instill the spirit of God's work into His witnesses, and the prayer of His people everywhere was that they night fuHi]l Ris purj)oses. Such prophesying or preaching reached a climax on September </span><span class="font8">S, </span><span class="font9">1922, at a convention of God's people, at which time they were awakened by the spirit or active force of God as never before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;So I prophesied as lte commanded me, and the hreath came into them, and they Jived, and stood up upou their feet, an exceeding great army.' (37: 10) Ev-ei'Y faithful witness of God who was present at that international convention in 1922 wHl never foTget that hour of great blessing. At tJuit time the remnant saw that Jehovah's &quot;messenger'', Christ Jesus. had come to the temple, and realized that they, as Isaiah long before stated, had been &quot;of uncJean lips&quot;, and tltey prayed to God and He heard and cleansed them and they began to greatly rejoice. (Isaiah 6:1-9; </span><span class="font8">12: </span><span class="font9">1-3) Those</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">25 </span><span class="font9">who then eame to the front were no mere skeletons, by any means, hut, as Ezekiel said, like &quot;an exceeding great army&quot; in Jehovah's seTvice, moved by His spirit and strength, and ready to do His </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">wil. </span><span class="font9">The faithful spirit-lilled remnant were Urns brought to the temple condition of unity with their Head and Commander, Christ Jesus, and Jehovah commanded tliem, as He did Isaiah at the temple loug ago, to go forth as His witnesses to do His service among all nations, bearing testimony concerning His established kingdom. And as the magazine </span><span class="font10">The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font9"> and thereafter </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Gonsolaiion</span><span class="font9"> performed a part during many years of that work from and after 1919, so onT hope is that </span><span class="font8">Llwaliie I </span><span class="font9">will carry on and perform an even greater work in that behalf during the following years of this Kingdom testimony on earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font9">ITH Hitler and his friends making progress in their conspiracy to destroy all democracies, </span><span class="font8">H. </span><span class="font9">seemed reasonable to many tliat the .American people shonld agree not to raise prices on anything until the war's end: hence the Office of Pi’ice Administration, the OPA.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is a big jol), directing 8,000,000 different services and commodities in the 3,000,000 manufacturing, wholesale, retail anO service businesses that go to make up America as it now is. Atov this, the OPA governed the rent in </span><span class="font8">J </span><span class="font9">5,500,000 dwelling units in the 479 defense rental areas </span><span class="font10">where </span><span class="font9">95,000,000 Americans wen war-employed. Additionally, the OPA ad-minif;tered 13 rationing programs, calling for the printing and distribution of 130,000,000 copies of each of four war ration books, millions of mileage </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">of'</span><span class="font9"> gasoline and fuel oil rationing nud hundreds of thousands of purchase certificates for automobiles, tires, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When it was in full swing the OPA had 250,000 workers, of whom tliree-fourths were volunteers. .As oJ January 1i 1046, there were 38,000 on the OPA payroll. Their joh was iiot a pleasant one. They had to continually say ‘'No! No!

<p><span class="font9">Congress knew that the OPA would terminate June 30, 1946, but delayed action, tJiongh the president had requested it ten months before tlutt date. ll'inallv, at the last minute, they passed a revised hiJJ, but it contained so many amendments and exceptions that the president vetoed it. Remarking that the output of civilian goods already surpasses the 1941 level, and </span><span class="font6">t</span><span class="font9">hat employment exceeds that leve</span><span class="font8">l </span><span class="font9">by six million, the president said that inflation and collapse in the United States would gravely jeopardize America</span><span class="font4">'</span><span class="font6">s </span><span class="font9">efforts to build better international economic relations. H.e thought t</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">h </span><span class="font9">at jf ho had signed the vetoed bill it would have resulted in sharp and widespread price increases; production slowdowns due to price uncertainties; renewed demands for .higher wages due to higher living costs; hlgber production costs due to production slowdowns and stoppages and to higher labor costs; and therefore immediately higher prices.</span></p>

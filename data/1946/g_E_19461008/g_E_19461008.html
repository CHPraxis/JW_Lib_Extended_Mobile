<p><span class="font6">Now that the war has ended, and especially s i n e e all political prisoners </span><span class="font7">in </span><span class="font6">countries conquered by the Allies and Russians have been freed, and amnesty given even to a million despised Nazis (who eruelly persecuted Jehovah's w i </span><span class="font7">t </span><span class="font6">n e s s e s in Germany), it is now time to request that steps be taken to restore these mission </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">:ry evangelists to the po^ sition they occupied nnder law before their convictions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Although no mail can restore to these thousands of misHionary evangelists the time that they have served illegally iu </span><span class="font7">prison, </span><span class="font6">executive clemency by the president of the United States, exercised </span><span class="font7">mtdcr </span><span class="font6">his pardon powers, would restore the civil rights and privileges to all of them and result in the immediate discharge of those now imprisoned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The resolution to President Truman provided:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now, </span><span class="font6">THEREFORE, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DE </span><span class="font6">IT RESOLVED THAT</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">This resolution was unanimously adopted by upward of </span><span class="font6">60,000 </span><span class="font8">delegates at Jehovah's witnesses’ </span><span class="font7">convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Personal Interview by Committee</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For presentation of the resolution mid history an appointment for a persona] interview with President Truman was procured. This was nxed for- </span><span class="font6">12: 30 </span><span class="font7">p.m. </span><span class="font8">(Ji:astern Standard Time)i Friday, September </span><span class="font6">6, 1946. </span><span class="font8">Accordingly, on such date and at such time \he committee of three appeared at the White llonse in Washington. The emnmittee was composed of </span><span class="font9">(1) </span><span class="font8">a Missouri law-yer, personal and i?olitjeal friend of .J.lr. Truman, who arranged Ihe apj)ohitmeJit for the committee; </span><span class="font7">( 2) </span><span class="font8">counsel for Jehovah's witnesses, and ( </span><span class="font7">3) </span><span class="font8">a fnll-tijne pioneer minister of .Jehovah’s witnesses who during tJie </span><span class="font7">first </span><span class="font8">W orlcl </span><span class="font7">'V </span><span class="font8">ar was an army ammunition officer under Cnptain Rany .S. Tnunan. The interview and presentation lasted about forty minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Mr. Truman was informed ot the </span><span class="font7">p</span><span class="font8">ur</span><span class="font7">p</span><span class="font8">ose of the visit he stated that the matter of executive clemency for men convicted and imprisoned under the Draft Act had been referred by him to the attorney general for study and a report to him ihout what could be done?. He was then informed that thp committee desired to present tlie side </span><span class="font7">of </span><span class="font8">Jehovah's witnesses to him. He was tolcl, also, that more than </span><span class="font6">60.000 </span><span class="font8">persons who adopted the resolution had ordered the emnmittee to proyida him with the resolution and facts. In reply </span><span class="font7">Mr. </span><span class="font8">Truman stated that 1w would listen to wliat tJte committee linad to say and would see that the projicr thing w as done about it. He added, however, that he had heen a soldier, was a &quot;fighting man'', and did not have anv usc for a man who would not light </span><span class="font7">foi </span><span class="font8">and protect his country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He was theu informed that Jehovah's witnesses were, neither pacifists nor conscientious ohjcctors, but were ordained ministers of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">.J </span><span class="font8">ehovali God claiming their neutrality aud. exemption from service, like ministers of religion, to preach to the people. To this statement </span><span class="font7">!h. </span><span class="font8">Truman declared that he would like to know what would have become of this country in the recent war if every person in the Uniterl States had taken the stand tliat Jehovah's witnesses took— refusing to be inducted into the armed forces to fight. In answer he was told that not every person could take the stand -because not all persons in the </span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font8">United States •were ministers of </span><span class="font7">J </span><span class="font8">eho-nah; but that </span><span class="font7">if </span><span class="font8">every person in the llnited States were one of Jehovah's witnesses Jehovah God would •fight for and protect His people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then the president 'vas reminded of examples recorded in the Bible, of how Jehovah fought the e-newy hordes arrayed against His people an&lt;l protected the Israelites in battle. while commanding tliem to stand still and sing the praises of Jehovali. The president said he did not believe it and he clid not think tliat the rulers of the enemy nations believed it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Truman waH then told that Jehovah's witnesses did not oppose the conscription of men </span><span class="font7">.:mel </span><span class="font8">tbat they believed the nation had a right to raise au army, hut that, like the ministers of Jehovah in the clays of the Israelite conscription wlio were exempted </span><span class="font7">f</span><span class="font8">ro</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">m </span><span class="font8">going to war, </span><span class="font7">,J </span><span class="font8">elmvah’s witnesses today also claimed. exemption, as such is provided for in the Draft Act.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Then the certified copy of tlie resolution adopted by thp Glad Nations Theocratic Assembly wa::; banded to President Truman. He was told that it was moved ljy the president of the Watchtower Society and unanimously adopted by more </span><span class="font7">than 110,000 </span><span class="font8">delegates and persons of g.md-will. His </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">co</span><span class="font8">nsideration of it was </span><span class="font6">respectful</span><span class="font8">ly i</span><span class="font6">ii</span><span class="font8">vited. He read </span><span class="font7">it </span><span class="font8">quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Following the p</span><span class="font6">T</span><span class="font8">esentation of the 1'esolntion the history of the mistreatment of Jchovnli’s w</span><span class="font7">i</span><span class="font8">tnes</span><span class="font6">s</span><span class="font8">es under tlie Act hy draft boards was given. The president was told how the National Headquarters of the Selective Service </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">S</span><span class="font7">y</span><span class="font8">stem had recognized Jehovah's witnesses as a religions organization with ministers entitled 1o exemption. In great detail he wns shown how .Jehovah's witnesses were regularly engaged </span><span class="font7">in </span><span class="font8">preaching from house to house as did Christ Jesus and His apoE'tles. Mr. Truman was told that Jel</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">j</span><span class="font6">o</span><span class="font8">vah's witnesses hear to the </span><span class="font7">people </span><span class="font8">Bihle literature* e</span><span class="font6">x</span><span class="font8">plaining that Goers kingdom of rightponsness is to he .fully established in all the earth as humanity's onJy hope. He was told that m(l';t of the peopl p no longe</span><span class="font6">T </span><span class="font8">went to churches nnU the</span><span class="font6">r</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font8">fore, it was necessary for the message to he taken to them iii their homes. He was informed that Jehovah's witnesses arc the onJy ministers in the country who are meeting tlie needs of' tlw people liy giving them free Bible education in their homes through Bible studies eoudnct.Pcl hy ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hundred::; or draft boards that had received the evidence submitted to them }ju(1 classified Jehovah's witnesses as ministers, exempting many thommmis of them from t raining ami service, the president was told. lit was also informed that many </span><span class="font7">other </span><span class="font8">draft board::; were prejudiced ancl &lt;lid not exempt over -l,OOO o!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah's witnesses. It was shown that as a result these th ousands of men were prosecuted for failure to comply with ell-aft-board orders commanding them to do training and service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">l\lr. Truman then interjected that he was still prejudiced. He also added that he had no s</span><span class="font7">y</span><span class="font8">mpath</span><span class="font7">y </span><span class="font8">for Jehovah's witnesses because of their disrespect for the flag by refusing to salute it and their refusal to show respeet for the law of the land by complying with it . </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font8">it this point he </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">•</span><span class="font0">w</span><span class="font8">as informed that Jehovah's witnesses had respect for the flag and showed they were good citizens of: the United States. He was informed that not one of Jehovah's witnesses had been disloyal to the government at any time; that they all showed their respect for tie flag and the country by fighting for freedom of speech, press </span><span class="font6">a</span><span class="font8">nd worship in the courts and otherwise. He was told that Jehovalt's witnesses on the committee, one of whom he knew </span><span class="font7">-p</span><span class="font8">ersonally and with whom lie had been a</span><span class="font6">::;</span><span class="font8">sociated as a soldier and fellow army officer, had the highest respect for tlie flag and were lo</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">y</span><span class="font8">ally devoted to the country and the .freedoms for which it i\toorl. The president was reminded thai </span><span class="font7">al </span><span class="font8">others of J e-</span><span class="font7">hovali’s </span><span class="font8">witnesses had the same proper regard for the country and flag, altlwngh they were forbidden by God's law from saluting it or the flag of any nation. Mr. Truman said that perhaps he had been misinformed on tliis and that at least he was glad to get that statement of the position of Jehovah's witnesses. </span><span class="font7">Tlris </span><span class="font8">was especially impressive to hi1ii since most of the statement about the position </span><span class="font7">of .T</span><span class="font8">f'Jiovah's witnesses on the flag was made by tlie committee's member who had served as Mr. Tnmmn's am mmiition officer during the fint World \VaT.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ground for Pardon</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The conversation then returned to the matter covered by the resolution. Mr. Truman then repeated that he had referred the matter to the attorney general for a repoi’t. He arlded that it would do no good to argue the matter before him, because he was waiting ttnd depending on the attorney general for advice as to what to do. Notwithstanding this, there was theu next presented. the most important ground for pardon, namely, the illegal tria 1 and conviction of </span><span class="font7">.1 </span><span class="font8">ehovah's witnesses in the f</span><span class="font6">e</span><span class="font8">deral courts. </span><span class="font7">The </span><span class="font8">president then comsented tn he.ar this last ground for the requested reljef.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">History of the struggle of Jehovah's witnesRes for tlw right to be heard in their defense in the federal courts </span><span class="font7">was </span><span class="font6">s</span><span class="font8">n</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font8">cinetly given. It was pointed out </span><span class="font7">how </span><span class="font8">the federal courts trying J ebovah's witnesses for failure to report for duty as ordered bv the draft hoards had heeu denied the right to show that the hoards' orders were void because they were e</span><span class="font7">x</span><span class="font8">empt by law a::; ministers. It was then shown that the holding’ of the Supreme Court of the United States, that all tlie eourts had illegally denied Jehovtth's witnesses the right to make their defenses, was strong and additional ground for granting the requested pardon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">TJw </span><span class="font8">interview and presentation ended at about 1 p.m. At the close )fr.

The president was interested. He agreed that the problem of child delinquency should be blamed on the parents. Then he also accepted a eopy o1 tlie complete report of the Glad Nations Theocratic Assembly of </span><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font8">ehovah's witnesses in the 48-page issue of </span><span class="font7">The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Messe-nger</span><span class="font8"> for August </span><span class="font7">12, 1946.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In parting</span><span class="font7">, </span><span class="font8">the president's attention was c’Rlled to the fact that the 4,000 of Jehovah 's wi tnes::;es, in wliose behalf the Teque:st for relief was given to him, had not taken their stand to evade training and service under the Act. It </span><span class="font7">was </span><span class="font8">shown that they were found in this predicament for righteousness</span><span class="font4"><sup>5</sup> </span><span class="font8">sa kE', for their refusal to nhandon their joh of preaching tbe </span><span class="font7">g</span><span class="font8">osp</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font8">l </span><span class="font7">of Jelwvah’s </span><span class="font8">kingdom.

<p><span class="font8">Since the end of the war the matter of amnesty has been given mneli atten</span><span class="font7"></span><span class="font8">tion and publicity.

They cry out that &quot;4,500 conscientious objectors&quot; have been imprisoned under the Act. It is true that 4,500 men have been imprisoned under the .Act. But only a small percentage of those 4,500 liave been </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">conscientious objectors. </span><span class="font7">Less than </span><span class="font8">five </span><span class="font7">hundred of the 4,500 men cwnvicted and imprisoned were conscientious objectors.

Tie conscientious objectors, numbering less than 500 of tlte 4,500 imprisoned. refused </span><span class="font8">to </span><span class="font7">participate in war, basing their i‘e-Jusal on a </span><span class="font8">variety </span><span class="font7">of religious, political, social </span><span class="font8">and </span><span class="font7">academic grounds but making no claim </span><span class="font8">to </span><span class="font7">statutory exemption by </span><span class="font8">reason of a </span><span class="font7">ministerial status such as that rightfully claimed by Jehovah's witnesses </span><span class="font8">because of </span><span class="font7">their contract relationship with .Almighty </span><span class="font8">God </span><span class="font7">which obligates them to </span><span class="font8">obey </span><span class="font7">Him exclusively by publicizing, uninterruptedly, in peacetime and in wartime, His kingdom, among the people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">In spite of the appeal being made by tlie clergy for the small group </span><span class="font8">of </span><span class="font7">conscientious objectors while the larger numlier of those imprisoned have been Jehovah's witnesses, the religionists' amnesty movement has resulted in arousing </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font7">few courageous newspapers </span><span class="font8">to </span><span class="font7">hack up the request for relief </span><span class="font8">for </span><span class="font7">the imprisoned men.

No compensation, no service points, no protection under the bill of rights. no veterans' benefits, no family alotments, no discharge compensation. Most of tl1em were teachers or farmers or members of religions sects, like the </span><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font6">ehovah's witnesses, who told in many a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">c</span><span class="font6">ourt that their tenets firmly hade them to refrain from </span><span class="font7">warfare. . </span><span class="font0">. </span><span class="font6">.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Preliminaries to the Peace Conference</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;lEi' THJf:RE is anotJier war, atomic</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J- bombs arc certain to he, used unless a more? destructive weapon is developed. World wars must stop.&quot; So said Senator Edwin C. Johnson in commenting on the subject of atomic control, and thereby stressed the necessity </span><span class="font7">for </span><span class="font8">peace, and indirectly </span><span class="font7">lhe </span><span class="font8">importance </span><span class="font7">of' </span><span class="font8">the J)cace councils and cojifcrence in this war-torn world. For. technically at least, </span><span class="font7">1he </span><span class="font8">war is not over, even though lighting has ceased for the present. Tlie various nations composing tiie victorious side of the recent conflict arc as anxioni' I'oi peace and the making ot:' the necessary treaties of peaee as t.re the defeated nations. wlio suffer most. keenly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">rhcre has, therefore, been much talk ahont Jjeaco, or the attainment of those arrangements that </span><span class="font7">will </span><span class="font8">insure peace. It is now well ovp.r a year since hootilities ceased, aml still the center of tlie ditli-eulty, the German problem. has not heen toncliecl. Austria, too, is an important factor in the solution nf tlie peaee problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is sajCi that every world statesman learns sooner or later of the vital position Aus tria occupies in tho structure of Europe, </span><span class="font7">11ml </span><span class="font8">that if one wishes to subjugal </span><span class="font5">e </span><span class="font8">or liberate all of eastern Europe nne must J,egin with Austria. Vienna has been called the gateway to the East, but to Stalin, who doubtless has taken some notice of the transportation system of Europe. Vienna is tlie gateway to Ihe West. </span><span class="font7">1t </span><span class="font8">all depends upon tlw angle from which one views the map.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Soviet Union has some </span><span class="font7">140,000 </span><span class="font8">troops in Austria, and armies of occupation in Hnugary, Rnnmnia and Bul-gnrin. That gives the Soviet not a little influence in those countries, and treaties with these lands nre likely to he in Russia's favor. Russia has not been in a hurry to move out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All this, of course, has a </span><span class="font9">bearing </span><span class="font8">on the importance of Europe itself to world-economy mid world-trade. It is not merelv tlie fate of this or that nation that is in tJie balance. Europe has until rect=&gt;ntlv been the virtiml center of the world, and vast readjustments had been made, cYeii though but temporarily, when all of Europe was engulfed </span><span class="font7">in </span><span class="font8">war. Now that tbe war is over, Europe i&quot; comparable to a vacuum, and, since nature abhors a vacmun, some setup must take the place of its previous organization. Witli the exception of the horder states the people Itave no self-government. Something must occupy the plate of government until the peace treaties rut these nations back on their </span><span class="font7">ovm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Though Europe is sometimes considered to he merely a peninsula extending westward from the </span><span class="font7">Asiatic </span><span class="font8">mainland, it is a very important peninsula. </span><span class="font7">It:; </span><span class="font8">population is far from negligible. In Europe proper, excluding Hussia and Britain, tliere are ruoro people tlian there are in the British Commonwealth, the Soviet Union and all of the •Western Hemis-sphere. 'he peace of Europe, therefore, is an important matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The London Conference of </span><span class="font7">H145 </span><span class="font8">having ended in faiure, another conference, designated the Council of Foreign Ministers (of thf’ Big Four), was scheduled to meet in April of 194g. Russia was represented by Molotov, America </span><span class="font7">by </span><span class="font8">Byrnes, France by Hidaull, and Jingland by Beyin. Tt debated for three weeks. Results were most discouraging. The ministers of the f our big powers finally decided to call o</span><span class="font7">f</span><span class="font8">f their meetings fur a month's recess and to meet for further talks iu June and Tnly. They had not reached an agreement on </span><span class="font5">it </span><span class="font8">twenty-five-year alliance to see that Germany remained disarmed, and were not sure tlmt disarmnment was actually being carried out so far. A committee was set up to investigate what was being floue about it in the four zones of occupation. •Was Russia disarming Ihat part or Germany nnder her control! Was Britain properly disarming in its zone? The commit tet- would ascertain the facts. Russia said the operation of armament plants in her zone was not to be investigated !</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This session of tlie council of foreign ministers also made some revision in th . Italian armistice terms, but that was a minor matter. Nothing nmch seemed to have been accomplished. but at least thei’e had heen plenty of talk, which the different ministers could reflect upon during theh recess. The American representative, Secretary nf State James F. Byrnes, upon arrival in Washington, arranged to make his report, which was published in the press on May 21.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>JV</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ito Gets What?</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">It appeared that a great deal of the time had been devoted. by the council to discussion of who would get what. Neither America nor Britaiu had heen annexing territory. Russia had, and apparently intends to lioJd 011 to what she lias annexed. America’s attitude seemed to be more like that or a merchant who seeks to lmild up good-will among his customers or prospective customers. The secretarv mentioned that while America had udvanced $900,000,000 to Italy to keep it on its feet, Russia demanded $100,000,000 reparations for damage done to Rnssia by Jtalian troops fighting together with the Germans. True, Italy had. hirned to the side of the Allies and aided them in tlie final stages of tlie war, but Russia still felt sbe should malm some recompense for the damage inflicted on Russian territory. No final decision was reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The next subject was the Italian colonies. Hnssia had previously made a claim for trusteeship of Tripolitania, but now withdrew that demand. The American delegation held the position that the colonies should he administered by a United Nations trusteeshiv. This •was not decided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Should Greece get the Dodecanese islands </span><span class="font7">1 </span><span class="font8">The general consensus of opinion seemed to favor this transfer, though nothing definite-! was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Agreement on the Balkan treaties was hindered hecanse of economic factors. The Soviet government also stood out against including in the treaties any ar- </span><span class="font0">. </span><span class="font8">rangemcnt for freedom of commerce on the Danube, which is the gateway to central Europe, and as important to that region as the Mississippi is to the central part of the United States.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Trieste</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">The main bone of contention, however, was Trieste, </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font8">port certainly very important to central Europe, but which since World War I had been held bv Italy. However, Italy is not now in position to decide what shall l)e done about it. Russia wants the port to go to Yugoslavia, a country favorable to Russia, and measurably under its influence. The other powers favored Italy, claiming the inhabitants of Tdeste were in the main Italians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All of this unfinished business, not to mention tlte German and Austrian treaties, were to he taken up again after the recess, during which period the various delegates had opportunity to present the matter to their respective governments. There was considerable perplexity as to what Russia really wanted. It had offered so many objections that it appeared to be tlie chief obstacle to arriving at any conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mo]otov, noting that Britain- and Anwrira seemed to agree on most points, concluded that there was a bloc which hindered progress of the conference. He relt that these two nations were trying to dictate to the Soviet. And, of conrse,'if there was any dictating to 1e done, Russia would do it. He didn't say that last part, but that is the way tlte other parties to the conference were inclined to view the situation. The existence of any kind of bloc was denied.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Second Council Session</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">When Se</span><span class="font6">cre</span><span class="font8">ta</span><span class="font7">r</span><span class="font8">y Byrnes was ready to depart for Paris a secoml time a reporter reminded him that he had said before his fi.rpt trip that he stood in the iieecl of prayer. Be was asked wliat he needed this time. Mr. Byrnes answered, appa</span><span class="font6">r</span><span class="font8">ently with a smile</span><span class="font6">: </span><span class="font8">&quot;I would say more prayer. But, in aJl seriousness, </span><span class="font7">J </span><span class="font8">do not say that in jt&gt;::;f. </span><span class="font7">f </span><span class="font8">did say it [in jest] originally</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font8">but </span><span class="font7">I </span><span class="font8">afterward came to believe that we did stand in need of prayer and I hope those prayers will continne.''</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The question as io wlietl</span><span class="font7">t</span><span class="font8">er thof:f‘ who were called upon to do the praying had access to the realm where prayers are heard was uot considered. The clergy, however, are prone to wave sucli ‘'minor” considerations aside. and to respond willingly to any and all calls for ••prayer'', whether in war or J&gt;eaee. Hpnco Bishop Oxnam, president of the Federal Council of tlte Chur</span><span class="font6">c</span><span class="font8">hes of Christ in America</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font8">issued a call to pr</span><span class="font9">a</span><span class="font8">yer on he-half of tlie conference of foreign ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Events in Italy at the time east a slaid-ow .over the very he ginning of the conference, but these disturbances subsided shortly. The council soon was divided on the seemingly all-iniportant theme of reparations. Italy was ilrst up for dis-cnssion. Bevin thought reparations should he waived in the case of Italy, inasmuch as she l</span><span class="font5">i</span><span class="font8">ad joined the Al lies, although </span><span class="font7">b</span><span class="font8">ela</span><span class="font7">t</span><span class="font8">edly</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font7">in </span><span class="font9">fi</span><span class="font8">ghting the Nazis. Agreement was &quot;finally reached that Russia would get the </span><span class="font7">$1 UO,OOO,lOO slip de</span><span class="font8">manded. Restitution of Allied property seized by Italy during the war was also considerE-d. One reporter remarked: &quot;It is, perhaps, curious; to </span><span class="font7">il</span><span class="font8">nd the busiest foreign ministers in the world bickering oYej^ these tiny details. hut it is au nn-fo </span><span class="font7">rt </span><span class="font8">una te n pcossi </span><span class="font9">h-.''</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another stated with reference to ltaly’s pointion as considered hy the conference: &quot;Pltiniately Italy must starve if she continues cut off from the Soviet-dominated area of eastern </span><span class="font7">En</span><span class="font8">rope, trade witli which is vital to her economy. And a pt&gt;aee treaty which leaves in mid-Europe a nation of more than </span><span class="font7">4W,OOO,OOO </span><span class="font8">peo</span><span class="font6">p</span><span class="font8">J e condemned to gnawing hunger is a mere breeder of trou hle later on.''</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As to Trieste, H wa</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">s </span><span class="font8">finallY decided to make this po rt anrl the surrounding territor</span><span class="font7">y </span><span class="font8">of Venmda Ginlia 1111 auto</span><span class="font7">n</span><span class="font8">o</span><span class="font5"></span><span class="font8">mous state under United </span><span class="font7">K</span><span class="font8">ations protection, thus uot giving it to either Italy or Yugoslavia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The question of Italian co</span><span class="font7">l</span><span class="font8">onies and their disposition was again deferred. The Dorlccanese islands were given to Greece.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One of the surprises of </span><span class="font7">tlw </span><span class="font8">session was Molotov's stnh’uient on Gcrmanv. At the May session of the eounc’il Secretary Byrnes had put- forlli gr</span><span class="font6">ea</span><span class="font8">t efforts to arrive at- </span><span class="font6">s</span><span class="font8">ome method of co-operation in dealing with tlie German problem, hut to no avail. Particular emphasis wm; plac</span><span class="font6">e</span><span class="font8">d upon disarmament in order that Russia's s</span><span class="font6">e</span><span class="font8">curity might be assured. Molotov was impervious to any suggestions on the snL.iod, but now came forward with his famous statement on July </span><span class="font7">10. It </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">w</span><span class="font8">as really fnnny for him to start off with, ••The time has come when we should discuss the fate of Herman' and a peai'f' treaty willi that country. The </span><span class="font7">S</span><span class="font8">ov</span><span class="font7">i</span><span class="font8">et government hns always hold that tlio spirit of revenge is a pom; counselor in :m&lt;'li affairs.” Tl</span><span class="font7">i</span><span class="font8">c Russian minister jwesented this a::-; </span><span class="font6">::.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">w</span><span class="font8">m</span><span class="font6">e</span><span class="font8">thing quite new and original</span><span class="font5">. </span><span class="font8">Also, the following would appeal to </span><span class="font7">tiie </span><span class="font8">German people: ••rt would be incorrect to adopt a co</span><span class="font7">u</span><span class="font8">r</span><span class="font6">s</span><span class="font8">e of Germany’s annihilation as a state or that of itR agrarianization, inc</span><span class="font6">l</span><span class="font8">uding the annihilation of i ts own main </span><span class="font7">industries.&quot; </span><span class="font8">Such a statement would give the impres</span><span class="font5"></span><span class="font8">sion that while Russia liad no sitc'lj designs upon Germany, others had. The fact, however, that ever </span><span class="font6">s</span><span class="font8">i nce the occupation of Germany Britain and the ITnitccl Stntt-s have h</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font8">en putting money in</span><span class="font7">t</span><span class="font8">o the country, while Rnssia has hpeu taking things out, should not he </span><span class="font7">over</span><span class="font8">looked. Milking the cow is nice work, especially if somebody else keeps feeding it. Mr. Byrnes declared that Russia had already received directly or indirectly $1+,000,000,000 in reparations from Germany. Taxable property hi the par</span><span class="font6">t </span><span class="font8">of Silesia taken from eastern Germany was valued at $11,500,000,000, which part Russia </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">gave</span><span class="font8"> to Poland in re</span><span class="font6">turn </span><span class="font8">for that part of Poland which Russia has taken over.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">M</span><span class="font7">ODERN science, in </span><span class="font6">h </span><span class="font7">gejjeral way, j:s divided into two parts: one division busies itfiel f wiili inventing and perfecting devices for killing people; the other gi’onp seeks </span><span class="font6">new </span><span class="font7">and better ways or saving those that are going down into deatli. During the recent war years medical science did uot lag behind the destructive technicians, but also made forward strides. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Snrgery made its greatest advance after the introduction of anesthetics many years ago in spite of the hazards and risks involved in their- use. In an effort to overcome tb!f;c difficnltieR new anesthetic:; luwe been introduced from time to time, the latest being sodium ■pentothal, which, it is claimed, does not produce the after-effects tliat chloroform and etlwr do. It is also nonexplosive and enn be used in connection with the electric needle without ruirnmg the risk of a fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">New drugs were brought into use for the Jirst time during tlie war. First. the sulfa drugs ‘vith tlieir variations made leadlines as ''wonder drugs’’. Then penicillin took the center of the stage as a &quot;new wonder drug&quot;. And later its cousijk streptomycin, made its debut as the ''wonder of wouder drugs”. Another “wonder” drug tried out at the army hospital at Topeka, Kans., was made from chlorophyl, the green coloring matter of plants. It was extracted from grass and alfalfa und found particular use in cleansing wounds. burns and Lone infections while at the same time it alleviated pain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The old plaster cast lms always beeJi criticized bv those that have had to wear it, because it weighs so much. To overcome this a composition of plastic and fiberglass weighing only one-fourth as much as the conventional cast bas been</span></p><img src="g_E_19461008_files/g_E_19461008-5.jpg" alt="" style="width:195pt;height:104pt;">
<p><span class="font7">developed. It is composed of 80 percent cellulose acetate and 20 percent fiberglass, and also has the advantage oyer the older type in the fact that X-rays are able 1 o pasi’ through it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another disadvantage of casts in times past has been the foul odors that arise when encasing infectious wounds and fractured bones. The National Research Council of Canada decided to do something about this, and as a result of its study a material was developed that took advantage of the ahsorbent properties of carbon and micronized silica, and tliis material in turn was used to impregnate bandages used im:;ide 1be casts.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Surgery and the JYar</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">After an oj’dered assault on the enemy's stronghold or following an air attack by the enemy the medical corps, in an elTort to save the wounded, would go over the battlefield and pick up as many as po::;silile for hospitalization. Sometimes it was necessary to make emergency operations on the spoti like the one following Ute hattie ol' Metz. A medical aide npon finding a soldier gasping for air took a penknife, made an incision in his throat, and tlieii shoved in the soldier's owti fountain pen in his windpipe to keep it open until he could 1je brought to a field hospital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the army and navy hospitals amputations, graftings and transplanting-s were made, besides the setting of bones, removal of bullets and treating of wounds. Even after a soldier had undergone such treatment there was always </span><span class="font8">the possibility that complications would develop, necessitating a return to the operatings room. For example, a soldier upon returning to the .fighting :U:ont, having apparently recovered after be-iDg shot up somewhere in </span><span class="font7">Africa, com</span><span class="font8">plained of occasional pain around the heart. </span><span class="font7">X-rays </span><span class="font8">showed that a lialf-ineli piece of slieil fragment was lodged three inches under the skin right against the heart so tluit with each beat it moved. After cutting through layers uf flesh the doctors were able to remove the metal though it had been in there seven months, aud they did it without damaging tlie lieart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another unusual war casualty was the case of a navy seaman who had been the victim of au air attack in the Pacific theater. Forty-seven days after setting his broken bones and I’eiiioYing shell splinters </span><span class="font7">Jie </span><span class="font8">still complained of pain in the lower </span><span class="font7">part </span><span class="font8">of his body. The doctors found by X-ray that a fused 22-mrn. projectile </span><span class="font7">was </span><span class="font8">lodged in his body. But to remove it was a delicate operation, since a slip of the knife might explode the sltell. After calling in bomb disposal experts for a consultation the operation was successfully performed amid an atmosphere of tension.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some place in Belgium, near the front, during the war a young doctor remembered that glass tubing had been used as </span><span class="font7">n </span><span class="font8">substitute for the arteries in laboratory work on animals: so, instead of amputating tlie leg of </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font8">soldier who had a section of his artery blown away, he tried to save tho leg by shnnting blood around tb^ wound through glass tubing. Later, when the soldier Jmd recovered sufficiimtly to stand a grafting operation, the glass tubing was replaced with </span><span class="font7">n </span><span class="font8">natural artery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Russian doctors claimed tliat 71 percent of soldiers who suffered injuries to the lower jaw on the Eastern battlefield were fixed up by surgery. Tliis was made possible by shortening the time between when the wound was inflicted and the time when plastic surgery and hone grafting was begun. Im:tead of waiting six to eight montlis before performing a plastic operation, as the practice </span><span class="font7">there</span><span class="font8">tofore had been, it was begun in three or four weeks and bone grafting was accomplished within one or two months instead of waiting </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font8">year. Lockjaw was prevented hy the use of special flexible steel pins.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">A </span><span class="font8">new technique was developed for the delicate removal in total darkness of cataracts from the eyes. It was found that tlie lens of the </span><span class="font7">eye </span><span class="font8">glows in the dark when exposed to invisible ultraviolet rays. Therefore much greater accuracy is possible under ultraviolet light than unde.r ordinary light in removing lens fragments that lie behind the iris of the eye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Tlie transplanting of healthy eye corneas onto defective eves has been practiced for some time. A case reported during the war told how tlie eyes of a 59-vear-old woman who liad died were used to restore the sight of an eight-Diontli-old habv that was boi’ii blind. Someday when this baby is old it may boast of having the oldest human eyes iu the wOTld.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The making of artificial eyes has not been the job of tlie medical profession in times past, but, due to the shortage brought on by the war, dentists have Emtered the :field of eye-making using clentul plasties instead or the special glass formerly used. which had a velvet texture. In addition to the 350,000 wearers of glass eyes there are now several hundred wearing the new plastic type.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Not only were instructors in public speaking surprised to learn that it was possible for a man </span><span class="font7">to </span><span class="font8">talk with his tongue removed, but </span><span class="font7">ah;o </span><span class="font8">medical science was surprised. An old man of 77 years had lost his tongue through a cancer operation, yet he learned to talk by forming the vowels aiid consonants in his throat. A phonograph recording of this feat was made for thm;p who </span><span class="font7">stn&lt;ly </span><span class="font8">speech disorder. It is further reported that persons who are lmndii’ajjped through the loss of tlteir larynx, tit&lt;&gt; upper part of the windpipe, art- also able to speak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It </span><span class="font8">hns been reported that tlie skullhone of a monkey was replweed with a transparent plastic encasement in order to detennin’e what happens when concussion of the brain hikes place. </span><span class="font7">Au </span><span class="font8">arti-f.eial concussion is caused, and the results are :fHiiieil; hut what </span><span class="font7">these </span><span class="font8">expe</span><span class="font7">r</span><span class="font8">i</span><span class="font7"></span><span class="font8">ments bave brought </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">n </span><span class="font8">the \vay of practical m</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font8">di</span><span class="font7">c</span><span class="font8">al knowledge on the subject is not stated.</span></p>

By injecting two-tenths percent solution or Evans Blue it waH possible to measure this flow, and it was founJ that when the body is at rest abou</span><span class="font7">t 10,000 </span><span class="font8">drops per minute pass through the brain. Tliat is well over a pint a minute. If one breathes rapidly, </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">hs</span><span class="font8"> mountain </span><span class="font7">tdimhers </span><span class="font8">do when ihey<sup>r</sup> lac-k oxygen, the liow is cut down; and when one breathes a high concentration of carbon dioxide the blood flow is increased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In </span><span class="font8">Paddington, England, it has been a</span><span class="font7">nn</span><span class="font8">ounced tlu.it patients who are to </span><span class="font7">un</span><span class="font8">dergo </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font8">brain operation nrf' first given an inj</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font8">ction of malachite green dye in solution. Diseased tissue in the brain -is dypd green, while the healthy tissue remains white, thus enabling the surgeon to tell which part to remove with his scalpel. The dye is conl'liclei'eU nonpoison-ousi and, although the eyes aud skin of the individual are temporarily dis</span><span class="font7"></span><span class="font8">colored, after three days tlw stain disappears. More than a dozen successful operations have been att</span><span class="font7">r</span><span class="font8">ibu</span><span class="font7">t</span><span class="font8">ed to this practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thi</span><span class="font7">s </span><span class="font8">dyeing practice lras also led to the discovery that a certain part of the brain of persons having epilepsy he-comes discolored. Heretofore tlie cause for this disease has not been known. but this discovery gives hope of a permanent remedy for epilepsy</span><span class="font7">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">After years of experimenting with dogs and cats and stillborn bahie</span><span class="font7">;:), </span><span class="font8">the Russians have now succeeded in doing what some might call “resurrecting’' the dead. First they teamed how to keep a dog's heart pulsating after it had been removed from the body; then work was begun on Immnus that were as good as dead. This study indicated that there were di ffereiit degrees in the process known ns the cessation of life. These differences have been classified as agonal. clinieal and biologieal death. Agonal &lt;leatli is considered as tlie active struggle of </span><span class="font7">t </span><span class="font8">lie dying organism, and is closely connected with e.linical death, w</span><span class="font7">h</span><span class="font8">ich is said to be when the heart and lungs have stopped functioning.

In all tln^ee stages cirenhition of hlood in the brain ceases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The studies of the Russian scientists have shown that if death results from a bad heart, a damaged brain, riddled lungs or poison in the blood, there is nothing tltnt medical science eau do to revive the person. But if one dies of shock or from loss of blood or from snf-iocatiort it has been found that lw stimu-latiojj </span><span class="font7">H </span><span class="font8">is possible to start </span><span class="font7">tlie </span><span class="font8">heai't and lungs •working once again.

It's a goo</span><span class="font7">dl</span><span class="font6">y picture, but utterly fraudulent. 'Thal. is not the way </span><span class="font7">t</span><span class="font6">hings happened. 'fhc preceding night, Saturday, the government had got hold of t</span><span class="font7">h</span><span class="font6">e text of </span><span class="font7">t</span><span class="font6">hat very document which the Japanese would present the next day. It went to </span><span class="font7">1'\h. </span><span class="font6">Roosevelt at 10 p.m. Hull, Knox and Stimson had it. They knew now what was to happen. Hnll tele^ phoned Knox and Stimson to meet liim next morning for a co</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">n</span><span class="font7">f</span><span class="font6">e</span><span class="font7">r</span><span class="font5">e</span><span class="font6">nce at 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Consider the situation that. night. The president and his 1hree aged and slow-moving cabinet membars knew everything, all save the hour and point of attaek. Far out iu the Pacific the blow would fall. What, in the name of simple common sense, would men of ordinary intelligence do? They knew at that very moment the Japanese ships and planes a,nd subs and </span><span class="font7">t </span><span class="font6">roops, </span><span class="font7">muler cover of </span><span class="font6">dni'k-ness, were moving to their appointed targets. They luiew tliat out in that vast Pacifc were two commanders, wetelwdly equipped, depending solely on them for information. Would yon not suppose the very first act would be to notify General Marshall tmd Admiral Stark anU then, instantly</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font6">Admiral Kimmel and General Short </span><span class="font7">7 </span><span class="font6">Would you not think that if MatshaH and Stark were not in their offices, they were to be hunted through the town, roused from their slumbers to give them this tremendous news? No. The old gentlemen called a conference among themselves for the next day and went home :for the slumbers so essential in their advanced years. The president had. the news at 10 p.m. He</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font6">too, did nothing. Worse than this, a naval aide was told not to give Admiral Stark his co</span><span class="font7">p</span><span class="font6">y of tlic Japanese note until next morning. Why 1 I think Cong</span><span class="font7">r</span><span class="font6">ess ought to ask for some explanation of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tho next morning, Sunday, Admiral Stark, because of the tense situation, went to his oflke. There he </span><span class="font7">f</span><span class="font6">ound the nnw com</span><span class="font7">pl</span><span class="font6">ete copy o£ the Japan</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">n</span><span class="font6">se uot.e. &quot;My God!&quot; he cried</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font6">&quot;this means w&lt;tr. I must get word to Kimmel at onee.&quot; For some reason </span><span class="font7">t</span><span class="font6">h</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a</span><span class="font6">t word did not go at all. Another Japanese code message ar-riv.ed and was decoded. By 8: 20 a.m. the text was in hand. It gave the liour at which the envoys were to present their note to Secretary Hull. The hour was 1 p.m. Washington </span><span class="font7">time. Just </span><span class="font6">as it was de</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">e</span><span class="font6">odeU another message was intercepted. It a</span><span class="font7">t</span><span class="font6">l </span><span class="font7">v</span><span class="font6">i</span><span class="font7">s</span><span class="font6">ed the twelve .Japanese cons</span><span class="font7">ul</span><span class="font6">s in the United States that Japan was breaking with this country. All were hurried to Knox, Stimson and the president. They were in the hands of Hull's conference at ll a.m. The bombs would iiot fall on Pearl Harbor for another two and three-quarters hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lieut. Com. Kramer gave a memorandum to Secretary Knox of t</span><span class="font7">r</span><span class="font6">anscendent importance. The memorandum pointed out that 1 p.m. Washington time was sunrise over Honolulu and dark night </span><span class="font7">at. </span><span class="font6">Manila. Sunrise would be the moment for air attack As a surprise attaek was </span><span class="font7">ni</span><span class="font6">d</span><span class="font7">i</span><span class="font6">ca</span><span class="font7">t</span><span class="font6">ed</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font6">the ]jour of presenting the dspa</span><span class="font7">t</span><span class="font6">eJi inUica</span><span class="font7">t</span><span class="font6">ed an air attack ou Pe</span><span class="font7">a</span><span class="font6">rl Harbor. In other words, we faced an air attack on Pearl Ha.rhor in a little over two hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Onn we be</span><span class="font7">li</span><span class="font6">eve that, tlms warned, the High Command in Washington, on the edge of such a preci</span><span class="font7">p</span><span class="font6">ice, would not with whatever speed science had yet devised get this tremenUous news and its impl ication </span><span class="font7">to the commanders </span><span class="font6">ni Hawaii? Instead </span><span class="font7">t</span><span class="font6">he three aging secretaries sat down to </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font6">con</span><span class="font7">f</span><span class="font6">erence. General Marshall did not get the news until ll: </span><span class="font7">25 </span><span class="font6">a.m. He then sent a warning message to Genera] Shor </span><span class="font5">•</span><span class="font6">. There was yet an hour and three-quarters before the explosion. The most precious hom^ and three-quarters the War Department had ever lived through. Time to get many of the ships in motion. Time to get eve</span><span class="font7">ry </span><span class="font6">available </span><span class="font7">nif!Ii </span><span class="font6">mobilized. Time to get every available plane off the ground. General Marshall hart a scrambler phone which would reach Short instantly. He had also the navy's Vowerful short</span><span class="font5">-</span><span class="font6">wave transmitter. Instead o:f using these he sent the message to General Short by commercial radio at or near 12: 18 p.m. Washington time. That would he 6: </span><span class="font7">48 </span><span class="font6">a.m. Honolulu time. It I’etiched Honolulu at </span><span class="font7">7:33 </span><span class="font6">a.m. The Japanese planes were at that moment winging to their kill. The message was sent through the streets as the bombs were falling. Thus delayed it reached </span><span class="font5">Army </span><span class="font6">Intelligence office at </span><span class="font7">11 </span><span class="font8">: 45 </span><span class="font6">a.m. to be decoded. It was delivered to General Short at </span><span class="font7">2:58 </span><span class="font6">p.m., hours after the great base had been destroyed. Why did not General Marshall use the government's short-wave apparatus? Why did he not use </span><span class="font7">hs </span><span class="font6">scrambler phone which would have pnt this information </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">n </span><span class="font6">the hands of General Short from two and a half to </span><span class="font5">an </span><span class="font6">hour and a half before </span><span class="font7">the </span><span class="font6">attack? Ilis explanation to the Roberts Commission was that. he was afraid it might be intercepted. What difference? If intercepted the Japs would merely know what tpey knew already. But Short would have known it also.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Placing tlie Responsibility</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">In view of tbe foregoing it is nmnifest that much of the responsibility for &quot;un-preparednessj' on December 7, 1941, rested heavily upon the president and his so-called “advisers”. This article by Flynn explains tliat much of t1iis blundering on the eve of the Pearl Harbor attack was due to tlie faet that &quot;Roosevelt had, under the influence of flatterers who surrounded hiln, come to think of himself as a master of diplomacy, an expert in political economy, an adept in political manipulation, a wizard hi public iluance, a profound student of Foreign affairs and a military strategist of large dimensions, little less than a genius in naval organization and direction&quot;. This ''ob::;et5sion&quot; that harl seized this '(amateur admiral” who ‘‘had by now got into the habit of referring to himself as the Connnander-in-Chief” did not excuse him from the responsibility of mistakes, says Flynn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To critics who would suv that Roosevelt and Knox are dead and therefore it is wrong to rake </span><span class="font7">np </span><span class="font8">these old embers, Flynn says, “My reply is that they prE.'-vented the discussion of them while they lived. I must add also that </span><span class="font7">if </span><span class="font8">thev are dead, so are the more than 3,000 </span><span class="font6">men </span><span class="font8">who perished in Pearl Harbor </span><span class="font7">on </span><span class="font8">that tragic day.&quot; It is also good to I’emind those wlw are prone to memorialize and worship Roosevelt in a new National shrine at Hyd.e Park, N.Y., that he was not the military genius that. some say he was, but was a mortal mmi capable of making major blunders.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">According to the entomologists, the so-called 'flying white ant' or termite is not an ant at all; hut tliis story is iiot written for entomologists, hut for just plain folks. There are 39 varieties of termites in the United Rtates. In most instances these little creatures destroy the timbers in a home, or eat tlie insides ont of a book without the damage';; being apparent from the outside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The invasion of a building by termites can be prevented hy seeing that in the construction of the </span><span class="font7">home, </span><span class="font6">oi’ </span><span class="font8">in its reconstruction, no untreated wood comes in contact with the earth. The tenuite nest is underground; its food i:s wood; if the two are separated and the engijwers of the colony cannot bridge the gnp, the termite dries up and dies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Termites have been known to build structures twenty feet in ajr, They eat their own dead and tlie shins they have shed. There is no dirt or filth in the colony. Invalids and loafers are dispatched and eaten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A huge nest of ants discovered in the Alps was about twenty-five feet hi diameter. A careful study or it disclosed the faet tJiat it was the home of about 400,000 ants, nud that it disposed of about 40,000 insects daily. An exact count made </span><span class="font6">over </span><span class="font8">a long period of time and in various kinds of weather showed tliat 42 percent of tJie captured insects were forest pests.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Should Ants Be Killed?</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">The Lord thought enough of ants to give them an average life of ten years, and </span><span class="font7">the </span><span class="font8">last previous paragraph shows that they are of some use in the world; still, they may become a pest, and so this story terminates with some methods of doing away with these &quot;people&quot;:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Ants are poisoned by using equal parts of tartar emetic and sugar, witb a dash of honey. Moisten, and pour into </span><span class="font7">slml-</span><span class="font8">Jow dishes set in the runways of the ants. They will eat very freely of this and, if it does not take effect quickly, tJiey carry the poison into the nest and thus help to dispose of the whole brood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A second method, when </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font8">colony has been located, is to pour an ounce or two of carbon disulphide into each of several holes made in the nest with a sharp </span><span class="font7">stick, </span><span class="font8">anti then quickly stop up each hole witli a clod of earth. A heavy wet blanket thrown over the nest also helps to keep the fumes iu the galleries until they have done their work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A third method is to dust the ants with sodium fluoride.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A fourth method is </span><span class="font7">to </span><span class="font8">dissolve one pound of sugar in one quart of water, acld 125 grains of arsenate of soda, boil, strain, add a small amount of honev, soak a sponge with the niixture and put it where </span><span class="font7">the nuts </span><span class="font8">can get it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But before you nnnecessarilv kill </span><span class="font7">off </span><span class="font8">the ants, you might get out the Bible tnd read what the Creator says about them:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">'1'here be four things which are little upon t.be earth, but they are exceeding wise: the ants are a people not strong, yet </span><span class="font5">t</span><span class="font6">hey prepare their meat in the summer.-Proverbs 30: </span><span class="font7">24, 25.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">It is folly to draw a conclusion from these few figures without considering the overshadowing realities. First of all, to say that farmers today enjoy a greater measure of happiness and contentment than they did in the days of grandfather is not true. They have a higher living standard, true, bitt also a proportionately higher muiutenance and taxation cost. The economic load is no fighter. Farmers may have moretime now for reading and entertainment, but this has not brought them contentment, because, for the most part, they do not spend their leisure time in the most profitable way. To conclude, therefore, that farmers today, with all of their modern maeliinery, nf a happier, a moro contented an&lt;l a more satisfied class of people than they were two generations ago is a fallacy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Since John tlie Baptist was the forerunner of </span><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font8">esus and His personal friend and relative, the question arises, Was John a son of God? Let us consult the Bible on this. </span><span class="font7">Jolin’s </span><span class="font8">father and mother were both old: '‘they both were now </span><span class="font7">well </span><span class="font8">stricken </span><span class="font7">in </span><span class="font8">years:' When the angel Gabriel disclosed GocJs purpose that Zacharias should have a son to lje named &quot;.J olm'', that priest was so shuck with the seeming natural difficulties </span><span class="font7">ill </span><span class="font8">the way that he was smitten with dumbness, which did not end till the child's birth and nnming. Hence </span><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font8">o</span><span class="font7">i</span><span class="font8">n’s birth must have </span><span class="font7">been </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">after</span><span class="font8"> the spirit operating upon his physically incapacita</span><span class="font7">t</span><span class="font6">e</span><span class="font8">d parents. FnrtJjrmore, uh regards this one to be born, Gabriel said to Zacharias: &quot;He will </span><span class="font7">lw </span><span class="font8">great in the ::ig1tt of the Lo.rm; and will not partake of \vine arnl strong drink; but lie will be filled •with holy spirit, even from his birth. Aud many of the sons of Israel will lte tnrn to the Lord their G</span><span class="font9">on. </span><span class="font8">And he will come first into [God's] sight in the spirit and power of Elijah. to turn tho hearts of fathers to children, and the </span><span class="font6">r</span><span class="font8">lisobedient</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font8">by the wisdom of the righteous: to make ready for the Lord a prepared </span><span class="font7">p</span><span class="font8">eople.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot; </span><span class="font7">.A </span><span class="font8">fterward, un separate occasions, Elizabeth and ZaeJiarias were each “filled with holy spirit'' to give inspired utterance. -Luke 1:7-17, </span><span class="font9">41, 67, The Emphatic Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Notwithstanding all this, the spirit of 0od did not </span><span class="font7">operate to </span><span class="font8">make John the </span><span class="font7">Baptist a son of God to be brought into Kingdom gJory. As to this, </span><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font7">esus said: &quot;Among them tlmt are horn of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of lieaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.'' (Matthew 11: 11-13) Jesus' words plainly show that neither John nor any of thp. faithful prophets preceding him were made sons of God to inherit the heavenly kingdom. Their future position will be on earth, as princely representatives of the heavenly kingdom. They will he </span><span class="font8">in </span><span class="font7">Kingdom service, indeed, but not as members of the Kingdom family or governing bocly. (Tsaiah 32: 1; Psalm45: 16; Hebrews li : 35--O) Under Christ's thousand-year reign they will become children of '‘The Everlasting Father&quot;, Christ Je.sus, and will tlms tie His earthly children</span><span class="font0">. </span><span class="font8">Jehovah, </span><span class="font7">the God and Father of our Lord Christ .Jesus, will thus become their Jteavenly Grandfather, for with Him is the fountain of life for all creatures in earth as well as in heaven.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark59"></a>Electrical Developments</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font7">NEW visual method of teaching languages has been developed by the BeJ] Telephone Company. As the words are spoken they are resolved on a visual screen into their chief characteristics of pitch, loudness and time. 'When the process is made continuous, these patterns travel slowly acroRS the screen, and the trained eye reads tlwm as speech. By this means it bas been demonstrated that tlie dpaf are able to converse without reading tlie lips. Results with one who has never heard a sound in his life weTe excellent. It is believed that this visual language device should prove extremely valuable in teaching the 100,000 totally deaf in .America. At present it takes such children about a year to speak six words correctly, and if they get to fifty words by tlie third year they are considered to have done well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Persons of normal bearing learn to read this visual language abimt as easily as they learn a foreign language. Tlie language can be recorded on paper in permanent form. By this means music, noise, dialect::, bird songs and human emotions may be permanently recorded.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">now possible to send out twelve separate programs at the same time. To one lis-tenjng, the merger would seem to be a hopeless .jm'gnn of the programs being sent. At the twelve receiving ends there i::; apparatuR which unravels the jargon, so that Nwh li::;tcjH:r mav hear without confusion the program in which lie i:; interested. This arrangement may </span><span class="font6">iiow </span><span class="font7">also be used for telephone conversations between twenty-four persons, twelve at each end of the line.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">21</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">According to the entomologists, the so-called 'flying white ant' or termite is not an ant at all; hut tliis story is iiot written for entomologists, hut for just plain folks. There are 39 varieties of termites in the United Rtates. In most instances these little creatures destroy the timbers in a home, or eat tlie insides ont of a book without the damage';; being apparent from the outside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The invasion of a building by termites can be prevented hy seeing that in the construction of the </span><span class="font7">home, </span><span class="font6">oi’ </span><span class="font8">in its reconstruction, no untreated wood comes in contact with the earth. The tenuite nest is underground; its food i:s wood; if the two are separated and the engijwers of the colony cannot bridge the gnp, the termite dries up and dies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Termites have been known to build structures twenty feet in ajr, They eat their own dead and tlie shins they have shed. There is no dirt or filth in the colony. Invalids and loafers are dispatched and eaten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A huge nest of ants discovered in the Alps was about twenty-five feet hi diameter. A careful study or it disclosed the faet tJiat it was the home of about 400,000 ants, nud that it disposed of about 40,000 insects daily. An exact count made </span><span class="font6">over </span><span class="font8">a long period of time and in various kinds of weather showed tliat 42 percent of tJie captured insects were forest pests.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Should Ants Be Killed?</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">The Lord thought enough of ants to give them an average life of ten years, and </span><span class="font7">the </span><span class="font8">last previous paragraph shows that they are of some use in the world; still, they may become a pest, and so this story terminates with some methods of doing away with these &quot;people&quot;:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Ants are poisoned by using equal parts of tartar emetic and sugar, witb a dash of honey. Moisten, and pour into </span><span class="font7">slml-</span><span class="font8">Jow dishes set in the runways of the ants. They will eat very freely of this and, if it does not take effect quickly, tJiey carry the poison into the nest and thus help to dispose of the whole brood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A second method, when </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font8">colony has been located, is to pour an ounce or two of carbon disulphide into each of several holes made in the nest with a sharp </span><span class="font7">stick, </span><span class="font8">anti then quickly stop up each hole witli a clod of earth. A heavy wet blanket thrown over the nest also helps to keep the fumes iu the galleries until they have done their work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A third method is to dust the ants with sodium fluoride.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A fourth method is </span><span class="font7">to </span><span class="font8">dissolve one pound of sugar in one quart of water, acld 125 grains of arsenate of soda, boil, strain, add a small amount of honev, soak a sponge with the niixture and put it where </span><span class="font7">the nuts </span><span class="font8">can get it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But before you nnnecessarilv kill </span><span class="font7">off </span><span class="font8">the ants, you might get out the Bible tnd read what the Creator says about them:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">'1'here be four things which are little upon t.be earth, but they are exceeding wise: the ants are a people not strong, yet </span><span class="font5">t</span><span class="font6">hey prepare their meat in the summer.-Proverbs 30: </span><span class="font7">24, 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Objections Sustained!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font12">RAB </span><span class="font5">wom£&gt;ii suggest that </span><span class="font7">w</span><span class="font5">hen </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">n </span><span class="font5">roau can't </span><span class="font6">p</span><span class="font5">ro</span><span class="font6">v</span><span class="font5">ide properly for t</span><span class="font7">h</span><span class="font5">e support of one wife, he ts not us_mg his brams to auy great extent when he ma</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">r</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ri</span><span class="font5">es</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font3">say, </span><span class="font5">four. They also think that the method of Arab divorce is too easy on the man and too hard on the woman</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font6">At </span><span class="font5">present all the man has to do is to tell one nf his wives three times in succession &quot;l divorce you&quot;, and from that moment she is off the pay roll, and looking for some other place to board. In the Congress of Aral&gt; women at Cairo, in which these resolutions were mad</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">e</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font5">the women demanded the right to vote, and to hold puhlic office.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">There are jiow at least two hundred ways and means that are used to save time and energy and increase production on the farm th</span><span class="font6">r</span><span class="font8">ough the use of electricity alone.

<p><span class="font8">To support theii— position these }bros-perity predictors point to the fact that from </span><span class="font7">1935 to 1945 </span><span class="font8">electricit</span><span class="font7">y </span><span class="font8">was </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">t</span><span class="font6">a</span><span class="font8">ken •</span></p>

These are their figures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is folly to draw a conclusion from these few figures without considering the overshadowing realities. First of all, to say that farmers today enjoy a greater measure of happiness and contentment than they did in the days of grandfather is not true. They have a higher living standard, true, bitt also a proportionately higher muiutenance and taxation cost. The economic load is no fighter. Farmers may have moretime now for reading and entertainment, but this has not brought them contentment, because, for the most part, they do not spend their leisure time in the most profitable way. To conclude, therefore, that farmers today, with all of their modern maeliinery, nf a happier, a moro contented an&lt;l a more satisfied class of people than they were two generations ago is a fallacy.</span></p>

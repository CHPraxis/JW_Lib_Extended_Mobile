<p><span class="font8">Spirit by which the Creator carries out His will is His active force, His invisible energy, which works according to G ocFs holy purpose and g’ood pleasure. It is God's holy spirit. Those men </span><span class="font7">nml </span><span class="font8">women of ancient liuws upon ‘'-'hom God's spirit came, inspiring tliem to speak or ‘vrite, or moving them </span><span class="font7">to </span><span class="font8">act, were not made children of God by this.

But none of them were engendered by it to be-eome sons of the Most High.

(Revelation </span><span class="font9">15: 3) </span><span class="font8">Besides Moses, tlie spirit of the Lord came upon Judge Othniel, and .Judge Jeplithah; it came upon </span><span class="font7">J </span><span class="font8">ndge.

Still, by none of these operations of ihe spirit from </span><span class="font6">01 </span><span class="font8">high were these men raised up to take the standing of sons of God.—8ee .Judges </span><span class="font7">3 </span><span class="font9">: </span><span class="font7">10 ; 11 </span><span class="font9">: 29 </span><span class="font6">i </span><span class="font8">13</span><span class="font9">: 23 ; 14: 6, 19; 15 : 14; 1 </span><span class="font8">Samne'J </span><span class="font7">TO: </span><span class="font9">6, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After Samuel anointed Saul's royal successor, the spirit of .Jehovah God came npon David.

For Davjd is not ascended into the heavens.” (Ads </span><span class="font9">2:29, 3±) </span><span class="font8">The spirit of the Lorrl rested upon the prophet Elijah also, and a double portion of that spirit was made to rest upon his Riwi&quot;pRsor Elisha. St Ilf over nine hundred years later Christ Jesus, who came down from heaven, :-;aid: &quot;No man hath ascended up to heaven, hut he that came down from heaven.&quot;—-1 Kings </span><span class="font9">19: 12; </span><span class="font8">2 Kings 2: </span><span class="font7">D. </span><span class="font9">15, 16; </span><span class="font8">John 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Since John tlie Baptist was the forerunner of </span><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font8">esus and His personal friend and relative, the question arises, Was John a son of God? Let us consult the Bible on this. </span><span class="font7">Jolin’s </span><span class="font8">father and mother were both old: '‘they both were now </span><span class="font7">well </span><span class="font8">stricken </span><span class="font7">in </span><span class="font8">years:' When the angel Gabriel disclosed GocJs purpose that Zacharias should have a son to lje named &quot;.J olm'', that priest was so shuck with the seeming natural difficulties </span><span class="font7">ill </span><span class="font8">the way that he was smitten with dumbness, which did not end till the child's birth and nnming. Hence </span><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font8">o</span><span class="font7">i</span><span class="font8">n’s birth must have </span><span class="font7">been </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">after</span><span class="font8"> the spirit operating upon his physically incapacita</span><span class="font7">t</span><span class="font6">e</span><span class="font8">d parents. FnrtJjrmore, uh regards this one to be born, Gabriel said to Zacharias: &quot;He will </span><span class="font7">lw </span><span class="font8">great in the ::ig1tt of the Lo.rm; and will not partake of \vine arnl strong drink; but lie will be filled •with holy spirit, even from his birth. Aud many of the sons of Israel will lte tnrn to the Lord their G</span><span class="font9">on. </span><span class="font8">And he will come first into [God's] sight in the spirit and power of Elijah. to turn tho hearts of fathers to children, and the </span><span class="font6">r</span><span class="font8">lisobedient</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font8">by the wisdom of the righteous: to make ready for the Lord a prepared </span><span class="font7">p</span><span class="font8">eople.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot; </span><span class="font7">.A </span><span class="font8">fterward, un separate occasions, Elizabeth and ZaeJiarias were each “filled with holy spirit'' to give inspired utterance. -Luke 1:7-17, </span><span class="font9">41, 67, The Emphatic Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Notwithstanding all this, the spirit of 0od did not </span><span class="font7">operate to </span><span class="font8">make John the </span><span class="font7">Baptist a son of God to be brought into Kingdom gJory. As to this, </span><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font7">esus said: &quot;Among them tlmt are horn of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of lieaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force. For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.'' (Matthew 11: 11-13) Jesus' words plainly show that neither John nor any of thp. faithful prophets preceding him were made sons of God to inherit the heavenly kingdom. Their future position will be on earth, as princely representatives of the heavenly kingdom. They will he </span><span class="font8">in </span><span class="font7">Kingdom service, indeed, but not as members of the Kingdom family or governing bocly. (Tsaiah 32: 1; Psalm45: 16; Hebrews li : 35--O) Under Christ's thousand-year reign they will become children of '‘The Everlasting Father&quot;, Christ Je.sus, and will tlms tie His earthly children</span><span class="font0">. </span><span class="font8">Jehovah, </span><span class="font7">the God and Father of our Lord Christ .Jesus, will thus become their Jteavenly Grandfather, for with Him is the fountain of life for all creatures in earth as well as in heaven.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Electrical Developments</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font7">NEW visual method of teaching languages has been developed by the BeJ] Telephone Company. As the words are spoken they are resolved on a visual screen into their chief characteristics of pitch, loudness and time. 'When the process is made continuous, these patterns travel slowly acroRS the screen, and the trained eye reads tlwm as speech. By this means it bas been demonstrated that tlie dpaf are able to converse without reading tlie lips. Results with one who has never heard a sound in his life weTe excellent. It is believed that this visual language device should prove extremely valuable in teaching the 100,000 totally deaf in .America. At present it takes such children about a year to speak six words correctly, and if they get to fifty words by tlie third year they are considered to have done well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Persons of normal bearing learn to read this visual language abimt as easily as they learn a foreign language. Tlie language can be recorded on paper in permanent form. By this means music, noise, dialect::, bird songs and human emotions may be permanently recorded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From a single broadcasting station, and with a single Rending outfit, it is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">OCTOBER 8, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">1946</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">now possible to send out twelve separate programs at the same time. To one lis-tenjng, the merger would seem to be a hopeless .jm'gnn of the programs being sent. At the twelve receiving ends there i::; apparatuR which unravels the jargon, so that Nwh li::;tcjH:r mav hear without confusion the program in which lie i:; interested. This arrangement may </span><span class="font6">iiow </span><span class="font7">also be used for telephone conversations between twenty-four persons, twelve at each end of the line. Tests showed that sueh conversatiom; came through witli excellent clarity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Registration at </span><span class="font7">18 </span><span class="font11">Still Compulsory</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">• All young men who are citizens of the United StateR or who are resident aliem; are notified that, while the recent amendment tu the Selective Training and ReTv-icf' Act defers them from training and Rervice until they reach the age of nineteen, they imu;t present t!jem::;elves at tlie nearest lneal selective service board for registration immediately following their I’ightepnth birthday; that is to say, when they become eighteen (18) years of age.</span></p>

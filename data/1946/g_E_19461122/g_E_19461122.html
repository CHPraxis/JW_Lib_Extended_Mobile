<h1><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font15"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Do Vatican Crusaders Foment a Third World War?</span></h1>
<p><span class="font9">DOES this world face a third </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">WOridw</span><span class="font9"> world wad That question pops </span><span class="font8">I </span><span class="font9">up from all sides to J?lague war-weary humanity. Now, shortly after the close of World War </span><span class="font8">IT, </span><span class="font9">sides are already forming for a third test of strength, many believe. It is also strongly contended by many that if a third world war does break over the earth it will be a &quot;holy war&quot;, a crusade, to borrow a word out of the dim past. To many the word &quot;crusade&quot; lifts war to an exalted level of holiness and godliness. I3nt to the informed it signifies the most bitter and ruthless of struggles. Why, the facts known by so many but appreciated by so few clearly mark the aggressive wars of this twentieth century as crusades. It will he to your lasting interests to alert yourself to crusades, past and present, and to awaken yourself to the subtle movements of tlie organizntioi that has always inspired them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When Palestine was conquered by the Arabs in the seventh century they allowed the pilgrimages so popular with European “Christians”. </span><span class="font8">In </span><span class="font9">the tenth century the country came under Egyptian control, with a subsequent lessening of favor for pilgrims. But with the conquest of JeTnsalem in 1078 by Seljuk Turks fi’om the Caucasus, conditions became intolerable. News of atrocities hy the infidels spread over Christendom and kindled the desire for liberation of the Holy Land. Popes fanned the tense situation into the flmnes of war, for two reasons: the opportunity to increase their power in the &quot;\Vest and to extend their power into the East; also it was an opportunity to turn tlie warlike ardor of the Western princes, so often jn conflict with the ehnreh, against the infidels. Pop’e Gregory VII conceived the idea of launching crusades, but it was Pope Urban </span><span class="font8">II </span><span class="font9">who lighted the fuse that touched off the successive explosions of religions wars that bloodied the earth from the close of the eleventh centurv til the close </span><span class="font8">♦</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">of the thirteenth century.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>The </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">First Crusade</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">When the feelings of Europe had been sufficiently heated by the. papal-blessed rabble-rouser, Peter the Hermit, the first crusade took on definite form at a council in Clermont, France, in 1095. Pope Urhan </span><span class="font8">II </span><span class="font9">himself mounted the orators' soapbox and declared: &quot;They who die will enter the mansions of heaven, while the living shall pay their vows before the sepulchre of the Lord. Blessed are they who, taking this vow upon them, shall obtain such a recompense.&quot; As this astute moh psychologist emoted nnd played on the tumultuous feelings of the vast crowd, cries of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Deus milt</span><span class="font9"> (God wills it) broke from the audience. Urban made this cry the battle shout, and those who embarked on the venture wore the sign of the cross. lienee the name </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">cTusade </span><span class="font9">(French </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">aroisaicle,</span><span class="font9"> from Latin crux, a cross).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Priests and abbots caught up the war cry tmd preached </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">crusade as a “'new mode of salvation, which eiiahled the layman without laying aside his habits of wild license to reach a height of perfection scarcely to be attained by the most austere monk or the most devoted priest&quot;. So from </span><span class="font8">al </span><span class="font9">parts of Europe thousands with priest and papal blessing flocked to the war drummed up by Urban </span><span class="font8">11. In </span><span class="font9">successive waves undisciplined forces totaling some 275,000 began sweeping eastward in May of 1096, committing horrible ravages along the route, especially among the Jews, whom they murdered witliont mercy. These advance expeditions were soon slaughtered or scattered by the Bulgarians and Hungarians and Turb. But by this time the rea] armies of the Crusades made their appearance, seasoned warriors under chiefs of the first rank. By the </span><span class="font8">}nm-</span><span class="font9">dreds of thousands they marched eastward, finally taking Syrian Antioch after a very costly siege of months. During this time wind-jamming Peter the Hermit deserted, and was miles away before he was apprehended. War and famine and pestilence and desertion so fearfully thumed the ranks of the crusaders that by the time their objective, Jerusalem, was captured in 1099 they munhered only 40,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">hen the city was finally taken a most horrible slaughter followed. ''So terrible, it is said, was the carnage wliicli followed that the horses of the crnsaders who rode up to the mosque of Omar were knee-deep in the stream of blood. Infants were seized by their feet and dasled against the walls or whirled over the battlements, while the Jews were all burnt alive in their synagogue.''(Ency-</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">clopa;dia Britannica)</span><span class="font9"> Thus ended the first of a long series of crusades tliat were sponsored by the Vatican. Was that first crusade Christian </span><span class="font8">f </span><span class="font9">How preposterous to claim so </span><span class="font8">I</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the 200 years that followed the Vatican inspired at least eight more major crusades. The most tragic and pathetic was the one in </span><span class="font7">J 212. </span><span class="font9">Imown as the Children's Crusade. The Hierarchy (’)aim was that innocent hands could wage the war with God's blessing; which was an admission that previous warring hands were neither innocent nor blessed. The result of this crusade was the hlood-g-uiJt of 50,000 children on Vaticun skirts, since that number either died on the trek to .Asia or fell into the more fearful horror of the slave market. Djd Catholic Hitler ever perpetrate a worse crime? The superstitions, hocus-pocus rituals practiced in dimly lit Catholic cathedrals will never ntone for the Vatican's wanton slaughter of millions.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Crusade Against Freedom</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">From this period of the Crusades skip down the stream of time three centuries. By this time Germany has been split by the Reformation, ancl religious freedom has begun to dawn with what is now recognized as tlie birth of modern democracy. In papal eyes this was as deplorable as inlidcl occupancy of .Jerusalem; so they whipped up what a:monntcd to another crusade. This time tile ''Church sword&quot; brandished was Ferdinand II, sharpened by Jesuit education and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">di</span><span class="font9">rected by an oath to erlerminate Prot-testants. He eamne into power in 1617, persecutions began, and in </span><span class="font8">1618 </span><span class="font9">tbey blossomed out into a religious war that stormed over Europe for thirty years </span><span class="font8">hl </span><span class="font9">a vain Hierarchy effort to beat back tlie advances made by the Reformation ou the freedom front. Yes, vain; becau.se the Thirty Years’ -W.ar ended in Protestant victory and the Peace of Westphalia, concliideU at Miinster in </span><span class="font8">1648. </span><span class="font9">The oj&gt;pressive Hierarchy lias fought this peace ever since, because &quot;an age of greater toleration was introduced into Germany. </span><span class="font8">In </span><span class="font9">all religio\is questions the Protestan t</span><span class="font8">s </span><span class="font9">se</span><span class="font6">c</span><span class="font9">ured </span><span class="font8">a</span><span class="font9">n equality with tlie </span><span class="font8">Catholics, mid </span><span class="font9">gained eqnaJ weight </span><span class="font8">in </span><span class="font9">the diet and high courts. o_f the empire&quot;. —M'CUutock and Strong's Oyclopa:dia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But now the river o£ time plunges us into onr own twentieth century and becomes a churni</span><span class="font8">n</span><span class="font9">g torrent of destructive events. </span><span class="font8">Through </span><span class="font9">the raging rapids of 'VorJd War I the Va</span><span class="font8">t</span><span class="font9">ica</span><span class="font6">n</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font9">outwardly pretending impartiality, stdes in with the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Dreibund</span><span class="font9"> to crush freedom. World statesmen were well aware of thi</span><span class="font6">R</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">i </span><span class="font9">and hence specifically baned Jier from the peace negotiations. Thereafter she made league with Catholic dictators to smash the freedom gained by the Information and the Peace of W estphalia, to reestablish the Holy Homan Empire and the Dark Ages rule </span><span class="font8">of </span><span class="font9">cl arch and state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Do yon ball; at believing that7 Then honestly consider: Alfred Rosenberg, once the chief Nazi ideologh;t, declared iit 1942 tha</span><span class="font8">t </span><span class="font9">the Germans must helieve that World War II was &quot;another Thirty Years' War”. Not in length, of course, hut in issues involved. Do von remember that when the armistice was signed with France in </span><span class="font7">1940 </span><span class="font9">H.Xactiiig arrangements were made that it should be done in the same car and in tbe same forest </span><span class="font8">c</span><span class="font9">le</span><span class="font8">a</span><span class="font9">ring used for the signing of the 1918 armis</span><span class="font8">t</span><span class="font9">ice </span><span class="font8">r </span><span class="font9">There Hitler made a bo</span><span class="font8">m</span><span class="font9">bastic speech about the righting of great wronga, wrongs committed in that same car, in the same clearing in the forest of Compiegne. Appropriate tliat they be righted on tlte same spot committed, Hitler screeched. But note how parallel reasoning dictated the Nazi choice for the final treaty ending \Vorld War II, if she triumphed. Das </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Schwarze Korps, </span><span class="font9">official Nazi organ, in reporting t</span><span class="font8">l</span><span class="font9">ie ar</span><span class="font8">mistice </span><span class="font9">proceedings </span><span class="font8">with France, </span><span class="font9">said Hitler had decided that the final treatv would be signed in Munster and known as the Treaty or PE’ace of Westphalia! There Crusader Hitler would right the wrongs and erase the smirch of the first Peace </span><span class="font8">of </span><span class="font9">Westphali</span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font9">that ltas galled the Hierarchy for three hundred years!</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Do you still hesitate to believe'?

The leader of the missionaries is Luigi Cardinal Lavitrano, archbishop of Palermo.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Agitation to Revive the Crusade</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Tbe Catholic dictators Hitler and Mussolini failed their master at Vatican City. World War IT's crusade into Russia ended as disastrously as did those long ago against the infidel Turks. But the wily Vat:ic;an and its slippery Jesuits have survived major political reverses before, and its double talk and outward sham of neutrality during the past global war are paying off, thanks to^a cowardly and senrile press in democratic lands. Millions have even been convinced that they sbould ignore the facts of Hierarchy action during the war and swallow unquestioningly all the propagainda that now floods out from Vatican mouthpieces. Her diabolical cunning has even enabled her to emerge from the war she fomented stronger than ever, though her side suffered military defeat. And now she busily plans and agitates for a revival of her crusade against atheistic Russia, only this </span><span class="font8">time </span><span class="font9">she seeks to dub the democracies as her crusading &quot;swords''.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are 38,000 Catbolic priests </span><span class="font8">in America </span><span class="font9">who, by their consecration swear allegiance to papal Rome. </span><span class="font8">In </span><span class="font9">their churches they preach the &quot;red scare”. By their efforts they bind the spineless Protestant and Jewish religious organizations to their crusade chariot and even have these groups seeing and pTeaching &quot;red&quot;. Catholie politicians and Jesuits in key governmental positions point the accusing finger and yell &quot;Red!&quot; at any other ones in government not sympathetic with the Vatican. This bas a tremendous effect on the foreign policy of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Throughout the educational systems and social organizations of the country the Hierarchy propaganda lias been infiltrated. Some of the loudest cries of</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;red&quot; have been hurled at labor unions. For example, read the following report from the Se-ptemheT 23, 1946, issue of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Courier-Post,</span><span class="font9"> of Camden, N. J.:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;It is the solemn duty of every Christian labor unionist to attend union meetings, expel the Couummists and assist in a crusade to reduce to impotency the monster of Communism. That ChaJlenge was thrown down yesterday by Bishop Eustace, before nearly 5,000 members of the Holy Name societies. . . . CaUing all men of the diocese to ,join a crusade to wipe out Communism, Bishop Knstace warned there can be 110 peace in the world of labor or the world at large until atheisticism is discredited.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This.cry for a purging crusade against &quot;reds&quot; in labor unions was thereafter taken up by Willian Green, president of the American Federation of Labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What is happening in tlie United States of America is also happening in many other lands where the Catholic Hierarchy has any power. The Vatican engineers are working overtime to whip up anothru: crusade against Hnssia, not so much because Russia is atheistic, because the Vatican herself has htuned and otherwise destroyed unnumbered thousands of Bibles in her time. She aims her attack toward Russia because Russia's eyes are wide open to the Vatican's collaboration with tlte Axis and becmiise the Vatican wants to forcibly &quot;convert&quot; atheistic Rnssia to Catholicism to increase her wealth and power and attain world domination. </span><span class="font8">In </span><span class="font9">Europe the Hierarchy is busy organizing for the coming fray. Catholic political parties, such as those in Anstria, Italy, Franee, Belgium, Germany anrl Holland, have adopted catchy names like ((Christian Democrat'' and seek to set up governments of Vatican design. Nazism may be gom. in name, but only in name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Vatican Crusaders in Yugoslavia</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">In September and October of 1946 the Vatican's crusade complex was cast in brilliant light. So, along </span><span class="font10">with </span><span class="font9">the rest of the world, focus gaze on events occurring in Yugoslavia during that time; but, unlike so much of the world, look at the realities stripped of their distortion by crooked Vatican tongues that are professional emotionalizers. It is a ease of clerics reaping the harvest of what they had previously sown, only not yet in fullness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When Hitler's troops took over Yugoslavia and set np a puppet regime, that regime was resisted by large sections of Yugoslavia's predominantly Orthodox Catholic population. Roman Catholics under priestly direction crusaded against the 01’thodox Catholics, and did so under Hitler's protection. But now that their protector is gone and a new government has supplanted the Nazi puppet clique, the collaborationists are being rounded up. And, milike many governments of tlis religionized old world, the Yugoslavia rulers did not think black robes were sufficient to hide blackei' deeds. Catholic clergymen were tried along with others, and to tbe13e the evidence said: ''In thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor imoeents.&quot;—Jeremiah 2 : 34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Among these “bloody skirts&quot; rounded up was tlie Yugoslavia archbishop, Step-inatz. He was taken into custody on Septembet 18, charged with &quot;crimes against the people&quot;. Fifteen other defendants, all priests or Franciscan Friars, were ulso tried. The evidence brought out at tlie trial was overwhelming in showing that during the forr years of occupation the Hierarchy forces worked with the terrorists, known as ''Ustashin and “Crusaders”. Indisputable evidence proved the Hierarchy responsible for forced conversions of Serbs to Roman Catholicism, responsible for mas-sncres of thousands of Orthodox Seibs, and proved that Catholic priests made conversions at the point of pistols. Catholic priests of Stepjnatz' diocese &quot;personally incited the Ustashi to mass killings, and in some instances the Catholic priests themselves, with their owu hands, participated in the slayings&quot;. For example, in the village of Blagaj, a Catholic priest named Blaza Tornljenovich ordered 520 persons killed on May </span><span class="font7">6, 1941. </span><span class="font9">Today their dead bodies lie buried in two large pits near his church. And what is noteworthy, most of the witnesses at the trial were Croatian Catholic peasants or laborers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Archbishop Stepinatz on the stand was insolent in the face of these eharges and refused to miswer questions. </span><span class="font8">It </span><span class="font9">was the safest way for him to avoid a slip of the tongue. His defense was, <sup>f,</sup>:M:y conscience is clear.'' He repeated that many times during the trial, maybe to convince himself. When confronted with photographs of himself attending the banquets of the Ustashi he responded: &quot;I see no reason not to go to ceremonies when I'm aslted. My conscience is cam&quot; To which the president of the court observed, ‘‘You must have a very loose conscience if you could be in the company of such people.&quot; The Bible calls such a conscience ''seared&quot;. As to his blessing of the Ustashi and Crusaders, Stepinatz retorted: </span><span class="font8">&quot;I </span><span class="font9">give my blessing to all who ask.&quot; When queried as to whether that included criminals he repljed, &quot;Every one has the right to get blessings/' On that basis he would bless the Devil himself. When greeted by his alleged report to Pope Pius XII, sent in 1944, and defending the Nazi puppet state of Croatia as &quot;in conformity with Catholic interests and against the Orthodox Church and Communism&quot;, Stepinatz would not deny he sent it.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Vatican. Chestnuts in tile Fire</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">On October 16 Stepiuatz was convictecL on all fourteen counts of the indictment. Twelve of the counts related to activities with the Ustashi regime of Pavelitch, foremost YugosJav quisling, in which he was Charged with active collaboration with the Axis. The other two counts i‘e-lnted to activities since the end of tie</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">war, when he supported Ustashi leaders and Crusaders (Ustashi terrorist bands). Ever the opportunist, the Vatican seized upon the trial and conviction to scream &quot;Persecution of tie church by godless Communists!&quot; She said, &quot;There is the appeal to pubHe opinion.&quot; But this appeal did not ring out iii clear tones to refute the charges or meet tlie issues raised. It was, ''Monsignor Stepinatz is a criminal only as far as the Catholic Church, the </span><span class="font8">church </span><span class="font9">of Christ, n- criminal.” Fine words for emotional effect, but of no force to thinkers who can digest facts. rhe remark might even convict Stepinatz in the minds of those who remember the criminal record of the Hierarchy during the Dark </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Ages,</span><span class="font9"> tbe Crusades, the Inquisition and Its “court trials&quot; that were such a travesty of justice, and papal cri.J.nes with the modern dictators tliat pile up so higli.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Nonetheless, the wily Vatican judged the mentality of many of its Catholic population correctly, and, fanned by priests and bishops aud archbishops and cardinals, the \vail of protest that rises fTom many parts of the earth is loud and insistent. Spellman toyed with rhetoric in denouncing the &quot;satanic. Soviet sycophants)) and the &quot;perfidious pattern of Communist godlessness, barbarism and enslavement''; and warned Americans of the Red danger in their land. (In case you've forgotten, Cardinal Spellman is the one so infatuated with Frnnco the Butcher’s beautiful eyes and Chiis-tlan character.) Catholic papers in America took tlie cue obediently, one <sup>f</sup> saying: “U the moral sense of our </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">government</span><span class="font9"> is so blunted and its sense of appeasement is so strong that it fails to rise to the occasion, what hope can tliere be that the reign of terror the Red totalitarians have inaugurated will be curbed iu the foreseeable future?&quot; This article agitating for a crusade against liussia by the United States was titled &quot;America on TriaV<sup>3</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Joining in the cries for other governments to pull the Vatican chestnuts out of the Yugoslavia fire, Catholic press leaders sent a message to Tniman urging him to protest tlte trial of Stepinatz. Also, 600,000 Knights of Columbus representatively through Supreme Knight J olm Swift demanded that the state department of the United States protest to Yugoslavia. Cardinal Strich, of Chicago, called for Unjted States intervention. Similarly, in Britain Cardinal Griffin appealed to the British government to involve itself </span><span class="font6">01 </span><span class="font9">Stepinatz' behalf. As a result of the agitation Dean Acheson, acting secretary of state in the United States, expressed &quot;concern and deep worry&quot; over the trial. Politicians should remember tliat despite Vatican howls tlie government of Yugoslavia was trying a collaborator for his personal acts, and not the Catholic Church; which point Yugoslavia, from Tito on down, has repeatedly stressed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Unanswerable Facts Against Crusaders</span></h2>
<p><span class="font9">But let us tune out the Vatican's rabble-rousing speechmakers, and note a few more facts. At tlie trial &quot;Father'' Salle, Stepinatz' secretary, testified that &quot;the church was perhaps too much linked with politics&quot;. &quot;Father&quot; Seleaki, also on trial, admitted he had blessed the Ustasbi flag. Another one on trial, a Franciscan Friar called ‘'‘'Reverend&quot; Modesto Mar-tinic, charged Stepinatz with influencing the dergy of Yugoslavia to cany on illegal activities against Tito's regime. He said: '&quot;We are unable to hide tJie fact that the Church collaborated with the Ustashi. Stepinatz chose to fight not only for his ideology but for the Ustashi, not in the way of the Catholic Church. Stepinatz' epistle . . . was written to have influence on the clergy and to spur them to illegal work, and it served its purpose.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A letter was published in the New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font9"> from Stephen Lackovic, former seeretai’y of Stepinatz, which was supposed to defend the archbishop but </span><span class="font8">which failed to meet the major charges. Thereafter, the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font8"> (October 15, 1946) published a hetler in reply, written by Sime Balen, counselor of the Embassy of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. </span><span class="font9">It </span><span class="font8">follows:</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">NOVEMBER 2£,</span><span class="font6"> 191,6</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Like Stephen Lackovic, former seel'etary of Archbishop Stepinatz, whose letter was pub- </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• </span><span class="font7">lishcd </span><span class="font8">in Tmj T^IMES </span><span class="font7">of Oet. 9, I too am a Croat and a Catholic and was </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">nn </span><span class="font7">eyewitness to the tragic events iu Croatia from 1941 to 1945.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We can nll rejoice if Archbishop Stepinatz </span><span class="font6">was </span><span class="font7">in any way instrumental in helping </span><span class="font8">&quot;hun</span><span class="font7">dreds&quot; of </span><span class="font8">Jewish </span><span class="font7">refugees escape from Croatia to Italy. Yet Mr. Lackovic fails to mention that the Ustashi terrorists of the Paveliteh regime, with which Archbshop Stepinatz was so rlosely allied 1.mder Hitler's protection, murdered during those yem^s approximately 50,000 Croatian and Bosnian Jews, or over two-thirds of Yugoslavia's pre-war Jewish population of 70.000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mi.</span><span class="font7"> Lackovic's letter also fails, signifcantly, to speak of the major sections of the charges against .Archbishop Stepiuatz—the massacre by the Ustashi </span><span class="font8">of </span><span class="font7">over 500,000 Serbs. There were 2,000,000 Serbs in Croatin when Hitler set </span><span class="font8">up </span><span class="font7">the Pavelitch puppet regime there in April, 1941, and the poliey then officially proclaimed was that a third o£ these were to he forcibly converted from the Orthodox to the Catholic faith, a third were to be driven back to Serbia and a third were to be killed. Among the fii’st murdered were hundreds of Orthodox priests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dr. Stepinatz, a member of Pavelitch's Parliament (Sabor,) apostolic viear in Pavelitcb’s army and a member of the committee for the conversion of S&lt;rbs to Catholicism, made no effort to save these priests and did not •even intervene on behalf of his colleague, Dr. Dosi-tej, the metropolitan of Zagreb, who was barbarously tortured before being put to death. It is not difficult to thaw conclusions from Mr. Laekovie's omissions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It should not go unnoticed tJiat the Ustashi also killed approximately 31,000 Catholic Croats in Zagreb alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I am told that it is hard for Americans to comprehend the enormity of these crimes, For </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">us </span><span class="font7">wbo lived through them it is hard to forget.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Excommunication Tips Vatican's Hand</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Since the foregoing facts are unanswerable in favor of the archbishop or the Vatican, Stepinatz neither affirmed nor denied them at the trial and the Vatican has since side-stepped them diligent</span><span class="font9">ly. </span><span class="font8">A parrot-lilie repetition of the words '(My conscience is clear” hardly suffices to dissolve such wholesale blood-letting, does it? But rather than show any concern for more innocent blood on its religious skirts, the Vatican retaliated by excommunicating aU who contributed morally or physically toward the anest, trial or conviction of Stepinatz. The declaration was issued by the Sacred Congregation of the Council and published in the Vatican newspaper </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Osservatore Romano.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the Vatican learned of Stepinatz' conviction, she said; &quot;There is the appeal to public opinion.&quot; Hence this appeal might be made to public opinion; Catholic Franco butchered men, women and clrildren in coimtless thousands; and the vast majority were Catholic, if that makes any difference. But he was never excommunicated. Were those crimes less offensive to the Hierarchy than the mere sentencing of one man to sixteen years of hard laborl Catholic Mussolini likewise slaughtered multitudes </span><span class="font9">in </span><span class="font8">murderous fashion.

'Was he ever excommunicated 1 Many times groups of honest Catholics requested that the pope excommunicate Hitler, but were only rebuffed. Crusader Hitler was never excommunicated. Apparently the Vatican believes it a more heinous crime to sentence one man to sixteen years; hard labor than to kill and maim millions upon milons.

<p><span class="font9">After the moh broke up the Bible lecture on September 8, the w itnesses •were to consult with Sheriff Johnson Wednesday morning, September 11. The evening before </span><span class="font8">300 </span><span class="font9">residents of Lacona </span><span class="font7">and vicinity </span><span class="font9">(there are only a little over </span><span class="font7">400 </span><span class="font9">persons in Lacona) met in the town hall and decided to block the highway leading into Lacona to prevent the third meeting</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">13 </span><span class="font8">of the Bihle lecture series. Connty Attorney Dale Ewalt, Sheriff Johnson and Mayor Goode conducted the session. and the promise was ma&lt;le that the witnesses would hold no meeting the following Sunday. The next morning Sheriff </span><span class="font9">J </span><span class="font8">olrn-son served notice on tlie witnesses that they could not use the park and that if they tried to do so they would be treated </span><span class="font6">as- </span><span class="font8">law violators. This sheriff did not treat any of the mobsters as law violators. Ap</span><span class="font7">p</span><span class="font8">arently, he considers mob rule legal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was on this morning that some of the witnesses called at the attorney general's office to see him, but were not permitted to do so. Instead, an office assistant, :Mr. Buckles, snntcliecl up a law book, opened it to a place previously marked with a slip of paper, and read law on </span><span class="font6">• </span><span class="font8">unlawful assemhlies. But Bible lectures are not yet unlawful, and when points concerning civil liberties were mentioned by the witnesses they were cut short by the threat, &quot;How would you like to be put under protective custody?” Rounding ont the events of the week, on Satur</span><span class="font9">day, </span><span class="font8">September </span><span class="font9">14, </span><span class="font8">on the steps of the State House </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font8">Des Moines, a committee oi witnesses served notice on County Attorney Ewalt, Sheriff </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">J</span><span class="font8">olmson and Mayor Goode that meetings would continue to be held and that protection hom mobs would be expected. Jolmson declared: &lt;‘Well, it may be all right, but </span><span class="font9">I </span><span class="font8">tell you folks to stay out of Lacona. And I'll say it loud enough for everyone to hear, too. You </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">stay </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">out of Lacona!''</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The next morning, Sunday, September 15, Sheriff </span><span class="font9">J </span><span class="font8">obuson was in Lacona at </span><span class="font9">9: 00 </span><span class="font8">a.m., and hy V: </span><span class="font9">30 </span><span class="font8">a.m. had sworn in </span><span class="font9">200 </span><span class="font8">deputies, many of them being the mobsters of tbe previous Sunday. These, with </span><span class="font9">200 </span><span class="font8">other men and U trucks, blockaded foT nve hours the four roads Jead-hig into Lacona. The men were armed with canes, rubber lwses and clubs, just to be sure there would be no violence. •When sixteen car groups of witnesses crone Sherif Johnson and </span><span class="font9">his </span><span class="font8">deputized mobsters tiu’ned them back ''You cadit have a Bible Lecture today or any other day!&quot; ruled the sheriff. To the protests that his action constitnted a denial of constitutional gnarmitees the shortsighted little official decreed: &quot;The Constitution does not enter in here !&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This poor, befuddled sheriff contends that the blockade prevented violence. His surface-thinlrn1g does not let him realize that appeasement policiesi in Iowa or internationally, do not work. He feebly </span><span class="font9">reasoned </span><span class="font8">that the wav to halt violence was to cater to the mobsters, deputize them, and arm Hlem with ehibs to make theh^ violent work legal. To appease the mob he killed democratic rights. It never occurred to him that the true remedy might be to suppress the mobsters,</span></p>

The Record-Hemld and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Indianola </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Trib</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">une,</span><span class="font8"> chief propagajida organ for the bawling brat, said: 'Lacona has Methodist, Catholic, Christian, Nazarene and Lutheran churches. Never were they all so united and pulling together as they are at this time.&quot; Mayor Goode said those in Lacona who wanted to go to church that blockade Sunday could, hut that “there wasn’t very many attending though because they were all too busy&quot;. This matches the boasting of a Catholic hoy to his boss, who is friendly with but not one of .Jehovah's witnesses. The Catholic youth bragged that all they liad to do was calJ different towns arotmd to get </span><span class="font9">500 </span><span class="font8">men for the Lacona riot. After the blockade he told how they had a big feed in the Catholic church and that the &quot;Fathei&quot;' blessed them on the good work thev ltad done. This Catholic youth also </span><span class="font9">verified </span><span class="font8">other reports that there were not very many G.I/s, but mostly Catholic boys, and that some of the G.I!s got mixed up in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Other facts accumulate to prove the existence of quite a conspiracy_ The </span><span class="font9">American Legion, notorious devotees of mobocracy where .Jehovah's witnesses are involved, played host to the blockad-ers, chicken dinners being served them in the American Legion Hall. Stanley Prall, the attorney tlmt clefenUed the six mobsters that were on trial, and was recently installed Legion commander of Warren Post No. </span><span class="font7">Hi5, </span><span class="font9">was on hand at the blockade &quot;to observe&quot;. Twelve state highway patrolmen, who could uot </span><span class="font7">get </span><span class="font9">to the riot the Sunday previous to suppress the mobsters, could very easily and very early get to the blockade this Sunday, ‘‘to direct traffic,&quot; they said. Meaning to direct the cars of the witnesses away from Lacona? Attorney General Ranldn did not attend the blockade, but he opined that the local authorities were “justified in blockading the town&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Present also were Sheriff Hemert of Marion county and Sheriff Neidt of Lucas county. Sheriff Johnsou said he had called them in ‘‘because there was </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">tt </span><span class="font9">possibility of the Jehovah's witnesses moving into one of those counties to hold their rrwetiugs and I wouldn't have jurisdiction&quot;. Thus he betrayed that it was not just a meeting in Lacona's town square he was out to stop to prevent violence. He was out to hound the witnesses ancl halt tlieir meetings in other counties. After all, an aspiring dictator likes to bave nwre than nne little county in which to maneuver his storm-troopers. Not only from Lacona, but also from Liberty Center (a laughable misnomer), Woodburn, Milo, Indianola, and other surrounding towns the blockaders eame. <sub>(</sub> A recruit from Milo blustered: &quot;VVe're ready to move any place </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">u </span><span class="font9">the county that they try to liold a meeting.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To aid readers to gauge the shallow logic of Sheriff Johnson, this statement of his to a committee of the witnesses is presented: ''None ol' us wanted the war, but </span><span class="font7">if </span><span class="font9">we hadn't gone over </span><span class="font7">there. </span><span class="font9">they would have come over here, and you wouldn't be ahle to hold </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">u </span><span class="font9">meeting any place.&quot; How hollow hls foolish reasoning, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NOVEMBER 22, 1946 </span><span class="font9">when at that very moment he was denying them that very right, despite the war fought to preserve sucli rights! Wliat prompted his statement was the fact that Jehovah's witnesses, a society of ministers, did not serve iu the army. He forgot that tlie Selective Service Act exempted ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Public Opinion</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Several fme editorials appeared in the public press condemning lawless Lacona, and many letters frow citizens in Iowa joined in the protest. T'lw Des Moines </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Register</span><span class="font9"> fairly reported the outbreak of moh rule, and editorially spoke </span><span class="font7">like </span><span class="font9">real </span><span class="font7">.Americans, </span><span class="font9">though they did not fully approve of Jehovah's witnesses. The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Record-Herald anC Indianola Tribune </span><span class="font9">took strong exception to tile </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Register's </span><span class="font9">editorials, but, since its logic and rebuttal were about as shallow us Sheriff </span><span class="font7">J</span><span class="font9">olmson's, they carried no weight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Several letters published in the Des Moines </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Register</span><span class="font9"> were from G.I.'s </span><span class="font7">. .A </span><span class="font9">few excerpts follow:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The ,.A.miericon flag is not a god, but it </span><span class="font4">is </span><span class="font7">the symbol of religious freedom and guarantees to the American people the right to worship GuU in any manner they choose , And the police of the co</span><span class="font9">u</span><span class="font7">ntry are hired and paid with the people's nwney, including the memhei'S of Jehovah's witnesses' tax money, to keep the peace.</span></p>

If the V.F.W. allows its members to desecrate the .&lt;\.:mieriean flag, like tJiose misguided men Cid at Laco</span><span class="font9">n</span><span class="font7">a, I </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">am </span><span class="font7">ashamed oi my membership in such an organi-zatiun.—Dan Harvey, H02 N.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">am </span><span class="font7">not a Jehovah's witness and never ('ould he one. But I also rlid not spend about three years of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">my </span><span class="font7">life in the a:my, mostly overseas in Eu</span><span class="font9">r</span><span class="font7">ope</span><span class="font6">, </span><span class="font7">in o</span><span class="font9">r</span><span class="font7">de</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">r </span><span class="font7">that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">few rnis-guided fellow citizens migbt indulge in fascist</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">I am sure the erring few people of Lacona and Warren county &quot;talk’<sup>3</sup> democracy, but &quot;your actions speak so much louder than your words that I cannot tell what you ure saying''. —Dwight N. Crotenhouse, Orange City, la.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Des Moines </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Register</span><span class="font9"> said, in part, </span><span class="font7">in </span><span class="font9">its issue of September 17, in an editorial entitled ''Not Something to Be Proud </span><span class="font8">Of”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A </span><span class="font7">sheriff and his deputies </span><span class="font6">are </span><span class="font7">not authorized to tyrannize the highways. The citizens of Iowa towns are not authorized to determine who muy and who may not enter their boundaries. Not without a court </span><span class="font6">order </span><span class="font7">based on some charge or evidence, at least.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So </span><span class="font8">if </span><span class="font7">there </span><span class="font8">is </span><span class="font7">to be any more of this—either in Warren eounty or elsewhere—we suggest that tlie local citizens and especially the public </span><span class="font8">officials </span><span class="font7">begin observing the laws that they are sworn to uphold, and confine themselves to that. As leaders of mobs, they doift add much to anybody's pride in Iowa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Laeonan mobocrats may babble volumes about Americanism, but their actions insult tlie flag, the Constitution and democracy. 'Che Supreme Court of their nation and the Supreme Court of their state have ruled that Jehovah's witnesses have the right to do what they were doing in Lacona. But lawless souls in Warren </span><span class="font6">c</span><span class="font8">o</span><span class="font9">unty can only wave tlie flag and clothe their anarchy in its colorful folds; they cannot understand the principles for which it stands. To them it is an image without meaning. They disobey America's laws, her Constitutio</span><span class="font7">n, Jhu' n</span><span class="font9">atio</span><span class="font7">n</span><span class="font9">a</span><span class="font8">l </span><span class="font9">and state supreme courts. and trample underfoot her democratic principles of freedom. Their actions would harmonize better with a swastika.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As for Jehoyah's witnesses, they are now carrying the battle for fl'eedon into the federal courts to restore rights of speech, assembly and worship </span><span class="font8">in' </span><span class="font9">War- </span><span class="font4">• </span><span class="font7">ren </span><span class="font9">county.

<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font9">HIS earth </span><span class="font7">of </span><span class="font9">ours has been trembling and quakmg as long as man has been upon it. Tlie oldest history book in the world, the .Bible, mentions several eartli-qnnkes that occurred before Christ. In the days of Dzziah there was one. (Amos </span><span class="font7">1 </span><span class="font9">: </span><span class="font7">1 </span><span class="font9">: Zechariah 14: 5) Isaiah promised tha.t one would come &quot;to Ariel, the city where David dwelt&quot;. (Isaiah 29: 1, 6) EJlijah the prophet experienced one when in Mount Horeb.—1 Kings 19: </span><span class="font7">11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The apostles that asked Jesus what would be signs of </span><span class="font7">His </span><span class="font9">second presence and the time of the setting up of His kingdom knew of these former earthquakes. So when Jesus said, among other things, that “there shall be earthquakes in divers places', the apostles knew that the evidence of His presence would be so Rtrong, literally earthshaking, that none could deny the evidence of it. (Mark 13:8; Luke 21:11; Matthew 24:7) At </span><span class="font7">the </span><span class="font9">death of Jesus there was an earthquake, and another at the time of His resurrection. (Matthew 27: 54; 28: 2) About seventeen years later there was an earthquake that broke open </span><span class="font7">tlie </span><span class="font9">prison at Philippi where Paul and Silas were , held. (Acts 16: 26) But none of these were of sufficient magnitude to constitute the earthquaking &quot;sign&quot;, nor did the apostles think that tliey were.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thereafter as men watched for the ful-tillment of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">.J </span><span class="font9">etlus' great prophecy they be-&lt;:'Atie interested in the phenomenon of earthquakes. They began to record the areas affected, the frequency of occurrence, and the damage and loss of life suffered. They devised sensitive </span><span class="font6">inshu-</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NOVEMBER 2:Z, 1946 </span><span class="font9">ments known a:&gt; seismographs, whicJi were able to record the time, length and tY}je of not only the major and minor shocks hut E&gt;ven the tremors of low intensity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The woild's eartJjquake belt is eastward through tlie Mediterrcmean, Turkey, Persia and the Netherlands East Indies to New Zealand; thence up the Pacific shore through Japan </span><span class="font7">to </span><span class="font9">Alas</span><span class="font7">l\u </span><span class="font9">and down again along the western shore of North and South America to Cape Horn with a loop urouncl </span><span class="font7">the </span><span class="font9">Caribbean sea. </span><span class="font7">lil </span><span class="font9">these areas it is wise for the builder to erect his Jiou::;e on </span><span class="font7">solid </span><span class="font9">rock,* as the motion of eartb particles </span><span class="font7">in </span><span class="font9">solid substances </span><span class="font7">is </span><span class="font9">only </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font9">fraction ol' an inch, whereas soft </span><span class="font7">earth </span><span class="font9">is th</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">r</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">o</span><span class="font9">w</span><span class="font7">n </span><span class="font9">into the air like tlie billowi </span><span class="font7">of Ute </span><span class="font9">sea when earthquake waves pass beneatli </span><span class="font7">it. </span><span class="font9">Tbis was observed in the </span><span class="font7">l,i</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">:.;</span><span class="font9">h</span><span class="font7">o</span><span class="font9">n</span><span class="font7">, </span><span class="font9">San Francisco and Valparaiso eartliqnakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It has Iwon leanied hom the study of earthquakes that there are three general types of vibrations or waves, known as longitudinal. transverse and surface </span><span class="font7">waves. Each lias ih; </span><span class="font9">own pe</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">c</span><span class="font9">u</span><span class="font7">lia</span><span class="font9">r behavior. </span><span class="font7">Longitudinal waveis </span><span class="font9">travel faster than </span><span class="font7">the other </span><span class="font9">two: transverse waves do not pas8 through substance; sneh as liquids and gases ; aud </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">sn</span><span class="font9">r</span><span class="font7">!'</span><span class="font9">a</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font9">e waves cause buildings to rock like a wagon when It </span><span class="font6">i8 </span><span class="font9">driven over a rough road. ..Major earthquakes that cause great havoc are made up of a combination of these three types of waves. Heavy destruction also results when earthquakes occurring beneath ilie surface of the sea cause great waves to sweep over cities.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Von Papen, Arch..Conspirator</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;T^AT </span><span class="font8">von Papen! He always gets out of everything !&quot; So said General Eisenhower with reference to Franz von Papen's acquittal in the War Crimes trials. Yes, von Papen had escaped scot-free,. His career had been a checkered one since he was expelled from the United States in 1915 for plotting against Canada. It was lie who in 1932 persuaded von Hindenburg to boost Adolf Hitler to power in Germany. Von Papen was made vice-chancellor in the Hitler cabinet the following year, January 30. He cooperated in, </span><span class="font7">if </span><span class="font8">he did not largely influence, the Nazi moves to increase theii* control over Germany. </span><span class="font7">It </span><span class="font8">was he who signed the Hitler-Vatican concordat, the present pope signing for the Vatican. Von Papen declared, in </span><span class="font7">Der </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Volkischer Beobachter,</span><span class="font8"> January 14, 1934: &quot;The Third Reich is the first power which not only recognizes, but which puts into practice the liigh principles of the Papacy.&quot; He should know, for he </span><span class="font7">was, </span><span class="font8">and still is, a papal knight. Strangely, on June 30, 1934, von Papen was among those taken into custody by the Hitlerian SS, and two of his associates were murdered in tlie purge of that year, but von Papen escaped, and was made minister to Austria a few days later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">r’he treacherous activities of von Papen in Austria culminated in betraying Schuschnigg into the hands of HitleL'. With tlie assistance of Austria's vain foreign minister, Gttido Smith, whom he </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font8"> won with flatteries, von Papen intrigued the Austrian chancellor to visit Hitler at Berchtesgaden. He worked on Scbusch-nigg's weakness, his sinctue Catholicism, stressing the point llat if he made peace with Hitler it woulCi serve the cause of the Vatican. It did, at the cost of Austria. As Hitler's guest Schuschnigg was browbeaten, broken. The Anschluss was assured, thanks to von Papen's cunning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With the dirty deed done, von Papen </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">NOVEMBER tt, 2946 </span><span class="font8">offered Hitler his resignation: It is possible thnt even he would find it difficult henceforth to face his victim. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Or </span><span class="font8">the offer of resignation may have been stage play. In any event, it was accepted. The roll owing year. however, von Pnpen went to Ankara. as ambassador to Turkey. With him went intrigue nnd treachery. In 1941 revolution broke out in Iraq. It was recalled that several Iraq ministers had consulted with von Papen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In 1942 von Papen haCi another nanow escape ‘vhen a bomb was </span><span class="font7">aimed </span><span class="font8">at him in the streets of Ankara. The leaders of the German-baeked Turanian Fascist movement </span><span class="font7">il </span><span class="font8">Turkey were busy stirring up trouble, and were finally arrested. They were suspected of having received direet financial support froiu Germany, and attacks upon Germany in the press reached tlie point where von Papeu made demands that they be halted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In September &quot;Satan in top hat&quot;, as von Papen has been called, was in Switzerland. Hitler's chief trouble-shooter, or troublemaker, had come to see Catholic politicians who were there in &quot;exile''. He also visited the Jesuit Friedrich Muck-rermann. At the same time Prince Maximilian Egon von Holtenlolie was reported as being in Portugal trying to work out something tJiat would enable Germany to get out of the war witn a whole skin. giving up everything but Austria, which would be retained to “strengthen Catholic inflnence in GeT-manyn. Germany might then continue to be the &quot;sword of the church&quot; as the pope had planned at the outset of the whole business. The war, however, ended disastrously for Germany and tlie Vatican.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">''That von Papen! He always gets out of everything.&quot; The arch-conspirator escaped once more. In a front-page editorial </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">L'Humanrite</span><span class="font8"> (Paris) declared tliat von Papen was saved at Nuremberg by Vatican intervention.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">S</span><span class="font9">ELECTIVE breeding is not a discovery of modern times, but dates back as fai' as man's history. In an</span><span class="font6">e</span><span class="font9">ie</span><span class="font6">u</span><span class="font9">t </span><span class="font8">times, </span><span class="font9">when it was necessary to </span><span class="font8">kil </span><span class="font9">domestic animals the largest, speediest and most beautiful were spared. Man had no scientific iustruments with which to measure the exact difference between his animalsi hut his intelligence and observation told him that the strongest and best animals produced the best offspring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On this </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Americana</span><span class="font9"> says: </span><span class="font7">There is no question that selective breeding was undetstoocl in a practical way at the dawn of history. It is most strikingly manifested in the care taken in ancient as </span><span class="font8">in </span><span class="font7">modern times in southwestern Asia, aid in northern .Africa, to keep pure and perfect the </span><span class="font8">standard </span><span class="font7">breeds of horses </span><span class="font8">andd </span><span class="font7">camels. Little progress •was </span><span class="font8">made </span><span class="font7">in Enrope </span><span class="font8">in </span><span class="font7">this direction, for various reasons, previous to or dmiug the Middle .Ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The “various reasons&quot; were those imposed upon the people by the rule of the papacy, whose policy was to keep all lmowledge, even that concerning t.lie propel' breeding of animals, in the hands of the clergy. Here, then, is moTe evidence why that period of European history is so correctly called the '•Dark Ages&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">By the middle of the eighteenth century the matter or breeding cattle along scientific lines was begun in England by </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font9">Robert Bakewell, and what is Imowii </span><span class="font8">as </span><span class="font9">('breeding by points&quot; is based upon his early work. A male and a female </span><span class="font8">may </span><span class="font9">excel </span><span class="font7">in </span><span class="font9">certain qualities ot points bnt not all of thei</span><span class="font7">r </span><span class="font9">offspring will have the same amount of these qualities; some will be gifted more than others. This </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font9">the law </span><span class="font7">of </span><span class="font9">heredity. However, by selecting the Ijest of endi succeeding genenition aud mating' them together it is possible to increase the good qualities and eliminate the undesirable ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">l’'or illustration, in a herd of cows some have •' </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">\</span><span class="font9"> and some have “B&quot; qualities. If cattle }ja-dng A qualities are mated witli cattle hav</span><span class="font8">i</span><span class="font7">n</span><span class="font9">g </span><span class="font8">B </span><span class="font9">qualities, then </span><span class="font6">n </span><span class="font9">balance is restored iu the next generation, bnt if A is matched with </span><span class="font8">A </span><span class="font9">' theu the offspring will have a superabundance of </span><span class="font8">A </span><span class="font9">and a deficiency in B.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It must he remembered, however, that </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font9">thoughtful Creator provided for this to be carried only so far. After that, undesi </span><span class="font8">rnblp </span><span class="font9">results are attained. This was demonstrated hi tlie middle of the nineteenth century by two men, Bates and Booth, of Yorkshire, England. By their excessive inbreeding to attain extrava-ganl strains practical points were en-Uaugcred and weakened. </span><span class="font8">It </span><span class="font9">took the work of men like the Cruickshanks, Duthie and Willis of Scotland and England to restore the constitutional vigor of the breeds. It is one thing to produce an artificial type of animal; it js quite </span><span class="font6">n </span><span class="font9">different tiling to matte it strong, useful and valuable for future breeding. More than a slide-rule science, cattle-breeding is an art.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The advantages of good breeding are numerons. </span><span class="font8">If a </span><span class="font6">c</span><span class="font9">ow produces only 100 pounds of butterfat a year she eats just as much, and it costs as mncli to keep her. as a cow that produces 300 or 400 pomuls a </span><span class="font8">year </span><span class="font9">. Actual records show that if a cow's production of fat could be increased four tiwes the uet ijicome which she would bring to the farmer would increase ten times ovei' and above operating costs. Breeding is far more important than feed and care in raising the milk and fat production of a herd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are three general types of cattle : beef, dairy, aml dnal-purpose cattle. Among tlw outstanding breeds of beef cattle are the Shorthorn,Hereford,Aber-deen-Angns and Galloway. In breeding these, emphasis is placed entirely on meat production, and fine results have been obtained. Until recently the highest price ever paid for a bull was ior a Hereford, $51,000. The new record price of $611335 was paid by a Kansas breeder for &quot;the best Shorthorn in alJ Scotland”. TJie same breeder also paid tlie top price of $21,000 for an Aberdeen-Angus heifer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Notwithstanding these record prices paid to improve and strengthen beef herds, dairy cattle are more important tban the beef type. In 1930 milch cows in the United States averaged $83.40, to compare with $40.70 for other types. Or from another viewpoint: for every 100 potmds of digestible matter eaten a dairy cow that produces 139 pounds of mill\ gives actually 18 pounds of edible solids, to compare with a dressed steer which yields only 8.3 pounds of marketable material of which only 2.8 pounds are edible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The outstanding breeds of dairy cattle are Jersey, Guernsey, Ayrshire and Hol-stein-Friesiau. A comparison of the average </span><span class="font8">milk </span><span class="font9">and butterfat produced by these four breeds is very interesting. The figures are for the better breeds in each instance.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font15"><a name="bookmark43"></a>One Divorce for Every Three Marriages</span></h1>
<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font8">MERICA </span><span class="font9">boasts the highest divorce bill in the world. One out of three American marriages today crashes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The divorce rate rose to the appalling number of 31 divorces for every 100 rnnrriages during World War II. In 1945 there were 502,000 divorces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The outlook for the postwar period indicates no immediate letdown. Chicago, which last year broke all records with 15,184 divorces, had already reported a 21-percent increase over that during the first five montl.1s of 1946. The divorce rate in Oregon in 1945 rose 110 percent over 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Actors, traveling salesmen and bartenders are the most divorced men. Women coJlege graduates are four times as unlikely to make successful marriages as men graduates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The first year of marriage accounts for the greatest number of crack-ups. However, there are enough couples with children divorcing to lead one juvenile judge, after a study of 188 cities, to conclude that broken liomes are responsible foT 80 to 90 percent of aH juvenile delinquency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The American divorce rate is rising at such a pace that, not counting the war booms, if the present state of things still stands, by 1965 one-half of all marriages will be doomed for divorce. People are begiming to grow afraid the more they realize that such social depravity cannot be charged merely to war conditions. Tlie fact that humanity has grown callons and lacking in natural affection simply . adds up to one of the signs of the times in which we live.—2 Timothy 3:1-5.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font11">S </span><span class="font8">THERE any sign or evidence today that the United Nations are makhig the jjeople of tlle earth glad? Or is there any indication that such organization ju the future will make the multitudes rejoice </span><span class="font7">1 </span><span class="font8">No, there is none whatsoever. The comparatively few people today whose hearts are jubilant are those who have been made glad by the Prince of Peace, the King of Tlie Theocratic Government, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Cleveland, Ohio, August 4-11, 1946, there were gathered together some of these happy people, lmown as Jehovah's witnesses, from 30 or more nations. On the last day of that Glad Nations Theocratic Assembly 80,000 were present to hear the talk “The Prince of Peace&quot;. These then dispersed to their homelands, where echoed and re-echoed the many gladdening things that they had learned. Just listen, as these reports are read from other lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the British Isles during four days, September 12-15, many thousands assembled at Bristol, Birmingham, Edinbm:gli and Stoke-on-Trent, where they learned of the many wonderful things told at Cleveland. From Bristol the first reverberation of their joy flashed out in cablegram form : “6,015 conventioners assembled Bristol send greetings and love. Thrilled with new releases and welcome you next year. Meantime express determination to fearlessly uphold Prince of Peace.’' Reports that followed went into greater detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As one approached the outskirts of Bristol, a city of 425,000 population, it was observed that a large ‘‘canvas city'' of tents had been spread out over 28 acres (depicted in the artist's sketch below). It was self-contained and complete with water supply, electric light, telephone kiosk, puhlic-ndclress system, held kitchen, etc. </span><span class="font7">In </span><span class="font8">all </span><span class="font7">of </span><span class="font8">this there was such a similarity between the Bristol &quot;tent city&quot; and the great “trailer* camp': </span><span class="font7">.at Clevchintl. It </span><span class="font8">was HKe </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">miniature model with it.- 759 inliahitants compared witii Cleveland's with its 20,000 dwellers. And, like Cleveland. not </span><span class="font7">nil </span><span class="font8">the witnesses that came to Bristol were houfied in the camras city; the majority of them, nearly 4,700, stayed in the homes of good-will people, and this meant that many pioneers for weeks prior to the Assembly were busy canvaSfing the city for rooming accommodations. There is a lionsing shortage in England as well as in .America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But this camras city had ::;ometlring the trailer camp at Cleveland did not possess : the convention assembly-places. There was a central tent, a “big top&quot; of mammoth proportions; and linked by </span><span class="font9">sound ampli</span><span class="font8">fi</span><span class="font9">ers to it were half </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font9">dozen marquees for overflow audiences. Hence the </span><span class="font8">cam}) </span><span class="font9">was not only a canvas city hut also a gladsome convention city.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">One who was there writes about the cafeteria = &quot;The catering arrangement was very well carried on, </span><span class="font8">1 </span><span class="font9">thought</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font9">and I heard many praising it.

<p><span class="font9">The greatest similarity with the Cleveland Assembly, however, was in the program and the ••releases'' that they mentioned. The tcxthook </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Equipped for Every Good Work''</span><span class="font9"> and its companion book, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True&quot;,</span><span class="font9"> were surprises that brought great joy to the witnesses of that country. For six years during the wnr they had only heard of the new releases at their assemblies, but now it was possible for them to get one personally. And, as </span><span class="font8">th </span><span class="font9">not enough for these release-hungry witnesses, they also </span><span class="font6">r</span><span class="font8">e</span><span class="font9">ceived the new Song Book and were told about this new magazine, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A. cablegram from Edinburgh told how they also had a similar assembly of gladness. &quot;Joyful greetings from 3,000 glad publishers Edinburgh asse</span><span class="font8">m</span><span class="font9">b</span><span class="font8">l</span><span class="font9">y grateful to Jehovah and organization for further equipment.

<p><span class="font9">Many of the </span><span class="font8">80,000 </span><span class="font9">that were </span><span class="font8">at </span><span class="font9">Cleveland have since gone to the south, some to the Carihbean area, some to Central America, some to South America. With them they have taken tlie joy and enthusiasm that was so manifest at Cleveland; they have relayed the uiessu.ge ''The Prince of Peace&quot; to many thousands of good-will people</span><span class="font8">. </span><span class="font9">The Soeiety arranged for its representatives to attend several conventions in Mexjco and Central America, where they could tell the Spanishspeaking- people in their own language what Jehovah had done for His people at Cleveland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In Aloxlco there were three assem hlies, held at </span><span class="font8">il </span><span class="font9">onterrey, M azatlan and M Hxico city, with a tot</span><span class="font8">a</span><span class="font9">l attendance of: 2,906. There were 174 baptized. Wlwn these a:ssemhlio:: were shown tho release::; in English and were told of their contents, and anticipating that in time they might have them in Spanish, tltey rejoiced greatly at the bountiful provisions of .Jehovah. But </span><span class="font8">when </span><span class="font9">the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Uoncorclanc’ia</span><span class="font8"> de </span><span class="font9">la. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Srtitla Hiblia</span><span class="font9"> was announced !—well, let one who was tliere tell iihou t it: &quot;The joy of the brethren surpassed anything we eould ever have exported, and the enthusiasm tbey displayed beat anything seen at former </span><span class="font6">c</span><span class="font9">onventions</span><span class="font8">.''</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This same fire of enthusiasm </span><span class="font8">swept </span><span class="font6">on </span><span class="font9">down th rough Central America and ignited the zeal of Jehovah's witnesses in those countries also. They manifested the same Ueterrnination us expressed at Cleveland, and resolved that they would have nothing to do with any human scheme with a UN label on it, for such can never </span><span class="font8">bring </span><span class="font9">peace and prosperity. Instead these assemblies throughout Central America, like the other assemblies in other countries, declared that their oitly hope wai’ </span><span class="font8">in </span><span class="font9">the Prince of Peace and His Theocratic government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The interest shown by the oppressed people of these Latin countries in tlie lecture &quot;The Prince of Peace&quot; is apparent from the (igures of attendance. In British Honduras the peak attendance at the regular sessionR was 47, but when the lecture was given on &quot;The Prince of Peace'<sup>3</sup> 160 were </span><span class="font8">in </span><span class="font9">attendance. Similarly, in San Salvador. where there were 32 publishers reporting for the month of September, tliere were 250 out to hear about the Peace-giving Prince. In Guatemala 186 attended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">South American reports are beginning to come in, and the first from British Guiana tells o£ the same joyful response of the people as manifested in other countries. The largest attendance at any of the regular sessions was 165, but how many do you think came to hear the lecture •'The Prince of Peace’’’! 541! TJie 69 publishers who engaged in the first “sandwich&quot; march the startled populaee of Georgetown ever saw were well satisfied with the results. Ten were immersed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thus we see that in the assemhlies so far reported some 118,000 have heard the convincing talk '•The Prince of Peace’’, and they have hailed him as earth's rightful ruler. Many other eoun-tries are yet to be heard from, and, no doubt, many, many more thousands will hear this talk from the public platform. And now, with the announcement that the speech is available in booklet form, millions more will read it, and reacting it they too will he made glad by Jehovah God's Prinee of Peace, Christ Jesus.</span></p>

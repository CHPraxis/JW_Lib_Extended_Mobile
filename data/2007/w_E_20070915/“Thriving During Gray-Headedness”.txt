“Thriving During Gray-Headedness”
MANY people in Mediterranean lands plant date palms in their courtyards. These trees are known for their beauty and tasty fruit. Moreover, they keep on thriving for well over a hundred years.
King Solomon of ancient Israel poetically described the stature of a beautiful Shulammite girl as resembling a palm tree. (Song of Solomon 7:7) The book Plants of the Bible states: “The Hebrew word for the date palm is ‘tàmâr.’ . . . It became the Jews’ symbol of grace and elegance and was often bestowed by them to women.” For example, Solomon’s beautiful half sister was named Tamar. (2 Samuel 13:1) Some parents still give that name to their daughters.
Beautiful women are not the only ones likened to a palm tree. The psalmist sang: “The righteous himself will blossom forth as a palm tree does; as a cedar in Lebanon does, he will grow big. Those who are planted in the house of Jehovah, in the courtyards of our God, they will blossom forth. They will still keep on thriving during gray-headedness, fat and fresh they will continue to be.”​—Psalm 92:12-14.
Figuratively speaking, those who serve God faithfully during their old age have much in common with the elegant palm tree. “Gray-headedness is a crown of beauty when it is found in the way of righteousness,” says the Bible. (Proverbs 16:31) Although their physical strength may falter with advancing years, elderly ones can retain their spiritual vitality by drawing sustenance through a regular study of God’s Word, the Bible. (Psalm 1:1-3; Jeremiah 17:7, 8) Thanks to their winsome words and their fine example, faithful older ones are a tremendous source of encouragement to others and keep bearing fruit year after year. (Titus 2:2-5; Hebrews 13:15, 16) Like the date palm, elderly ones can thrive in their old age.

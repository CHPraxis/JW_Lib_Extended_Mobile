<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">TRUE worship has all but disappeared from the northern ten-tribe kingdom of Israel. Under the rulership of Jeroboam II, there is material prosperity in Israel, but that wanes soon after his death. What follows is a period of unrest and political instability. Four of the six succeeding kings are assassinated. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:14:29-12:14:29" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Kings 14:29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:15:8-12:15:30" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 15:8-30;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:17:1-12:17:6" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 17:1-6</a>) The 59-year-long prophetic career of Hosea, which began in 804 B.C.E., stretches into this time of turmoil.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Jehovah’s sentiments toward the wayward nation of Israel are vividly portrayed by what takes place in Hosea’s marriage. An exposé of Israel’s error and the prophetic judgments against her and the kingdom of Judah are the subjects of Hosea’s message. Using wording that is tender and sensitive and language that is forceful and expressive, Hosea has written all of this in a book bearing his name. As part of the inspired Word of God, its message is alive and exerts power.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:12</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Jehovah tells Hosea: “Go, take to yourself a wife of fornication.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:2-28:1:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Hosea 1:2</a>) Hosea obeys and has a son by Gomer. The next two children she gives birth to are evidently illegitimate. The meanings of their names, Lo-ruhamah and Lo-ammi, point to Jehovah’s withholding mercy from Israel and rejecting his disloyal people.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">How does Jehovah actually feel about his rebellious people? He tells Hosea: “Go once again, love a woman loved by a companion and committing adultery, as in the case of Jehovah’s love for the sons of Israel while they are turning to other gods.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:3:1-28:3:1" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Hosea 3:1</a>.</p>

The kings of the northern kingdom were not of the Davidic line of descent, whereas those of Judah were.</p>

At that time, Jehovah ended the Assyrian threat to Jerusalem by having an angel slay 185,000 of the enemy’s forces in one night. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:19:34-12:19:35" data-bid="9-1" class="b">2 Kings 19:34, 35</a>) Jehovah thus delivered Judah, not “by a bow or by a sword or by war, by horses or by horsemen,” but by an angel.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:1:2-28:1:4" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Hosea 1:2-4</a>) The meaning of that name, “God Will Sow Seed,” is prophetic of Jehovah’s gathering a faithful remnant in 537 B.C.E. and sowing them like seed in Judah. The land that had lain desolate for 70 years would now need to produce grain, sweet wine, and oil. In a poetic way, the prophecy states that these good things would appeal to the earth to release its nutrients, and the earth would ask the heavens for rain. In turn, the heavens would petition God to provide rain clouds. All of this would be for the purpose of abundantly taking care of the needs of the returning remnant. The apostles Paul and Peter apply <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/28:2:23-28:2:23" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Hosea 2:23</a> to the gathering of a remnant of spiritual Israel.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:25-45:9:26" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Romans 9:25, 26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:10-60:2:10" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 1 Peter 2:10</a>.</p>

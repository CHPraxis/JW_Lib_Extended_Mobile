“I’m Not Interested”
1 That is a common reaction to our message in some areas. What will help us to avoid becoming disheartened when faced with apathy in the territory? How might we be able to stimulate interest in the good news?
2 Maintain Joy: Remembering why many are apathetic will help us to maintain joy. People who were taught the theory of evolution or who were raised in an atheistic society may not have considered the value of the Bible. Others may be disillusioned by the hypocrisy they have observed in religion. For some, their apathy may mirror their frustration and hopelessness. (Eph. 2:12) Some ‘take no note’ because they are weighed down with the anxieties of life.​—Matt. 24:37-39.
3 Regardless of the negative reaction of some, we can have joy in the ministry, knowing that our efforts glorify Jehovah. (1 Pet. 4:11) In addition, talking about the truth, even to those who do not yet appreciate it, strengthens our own faith. Let us endeavor to view people in the territory as Jehovah does. He felt sorry for the people of Nineveh who did not “know the difference between their right hand and their left.” (Jonah 4:11) Those living in our territory need the good news! Therefore, we should not give up but should seek ways to stimulate their interest in the Bible’s message.
4 Discuss Local Concerns: Perhaps you could bring up a matter of local concern in your introduction and ask the householder to express his views. Listen as he speaks, then show him the Bible’s comforting message in response to his concerns. After a local tragedy, one Witness expressed his sincere regrets at each door. “Suddenly, the people started talking,” he said. “I had many fine conversations that day because I showed interest in their lives.”
5 Each problem facing mankind will be solved by God’s Kingdom. Try to discern the one that most concerns the householder. He may allow you to explain the Bible’s message of hope. If not, he may be willing to listen “even another time.”​—Acts 17:32.

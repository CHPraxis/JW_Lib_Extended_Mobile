<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>January: </strong>The <em>Knowledge </em>book or any book published prior to 1991 that the congregation may have in stock. If you do not have any of these in stock, please check if nearby congregations have a surplus on hand that you can use. Congregations that do not have these books may offer the <em>Keep on the Watch! </em>brochure. <strong>February: </strong><em>Draw Close to Jehovah</em>. If this publication is not available, you may use the <em>Worship God </em>book. <strong>March: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>Make a special effort to start Bible studies. <strong>April: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. When making return visits on interested people, including those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on starting Bible studies using the <em>Bible Teach </em>book.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Starting in February, and no later than March 4, the new public talk for circuit overseers will be “God’s New World​—Who Will Qualify to Enter?”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ The video program <em>Young People Ask​—What Will I Do With My Life? </em>will be considered at a Service Meeting in April. If needed, copies should be requested through the congregation as soon as possible.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ Our Chinese literature is published in two scripts. People from Hong Kong and Taiwan generally read the traditional script, which we designate “Chinese” (CH). Most other Chinese readers usually read a simplified script referred to as “Simplified Chinese” (CHS). Since the script that a person reads is unrelated to whether he speaks Cantonese, Mandarin, or another dialect, it is important to determine the script that he prefers. The booklet <em>Good News for People of All Nations, </em>pages 19-20, may be used for comparison. In this way, literature in the correct script will be requested.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ Congregations should make appropriate arrangements to observe the Memorial this year on Monday, April 2, after sundown. Although the talk may start earlier, the passing of the emblems <em>should not begin until after sundown. </em>Check with local sources to determine when sundown occurs in your area. Each congregation should try to hold its own Memorial observance. However, this may not always be possible. Where a number of congregations normally use the same Kingdom Hall, perhaps one or more congregations can obtain the use of another facility for that evening. Where possible, we suggest a minimum of 40 minutes between the programs so that all may benefit fully from some association after the Memorial. Consideration should also be given to traffic conditions and parking, including the dropping off and picking up of passengers. The body of elders should decide what arrangements would be best locally.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ Congregation secretaries should make sure that they have a pioneer appointment letter (S-202) for each regular pioneer in the congregation. If they do not, they should inform the branch office in writing.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ The branch facilities in Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, will be closed on the following dates: March 10, 2007 (Gilead graduation); May 11-12, 2007 (spring cleaning); September 8, 2007 (Gilead graduation); and October 6, 2007 (annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania). There will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on those dates.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">▪ As a reminder, all congregations should notify the branch office of their meeting times as they will be on January 1. If this has not been done, the congregation secretary should immediately submit it on the Congregation Internet Site (CIS) or on a <em>Congregation Meeting Information </em>(S-5) form.</p>

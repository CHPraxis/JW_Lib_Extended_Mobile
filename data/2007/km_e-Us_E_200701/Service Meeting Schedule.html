<p id="p29" data-pid="29" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>This Is Who I Am! Talk and audience discussion. Some youths are reluctant to identify themselves as Jehovah’s Witnesses because they feel their peers may ridicule them. However, there are good reasons to identify who you are. Teachers who know your beliefs are more likely to respect them and not insist that you participate in something inappropriate. Unprincipled youths will not be so quick to invite you to share with them in misconduct. Others will more readily understand your decisions regarding matters such as dating or engaging in school sports and other extracurricular activities. You will also feel less apprehensive about witnessing in school or meeting a classmate while preaching in the territory. (<a class="xt" data-xtid="17" href="jwpub://p/E:102002205/14:216-21"><em>g</em>02 3/22 p. 12</a>) Invite publishers to comment on how they benefited by identifying themselves as Jehovah’s Witnesses in school. One or two comments may be arranged in advance.</p>

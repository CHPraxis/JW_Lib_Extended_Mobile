<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>“Come to me, . . . and I will refresh you.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:28-40:11:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 11:28</a>) Such winsome words reflected Jesus’ deep-seated love for people. As Christian ministers, we desire to imitate Jesus in demonstrating our love for people who are worn down by a loveless world. How can we do so as we share the good news?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>In Word: </strong>Love for people moved Jesus to take advantage of every opportunity to share the good news. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:7-43:4:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 4:7-14</a>) Love will help us to overcome hesitancy to witness informally. A six-year-old girl gave a fine witness to a woman sitting beside her in a medical waiting room. What prompted her to do so? She explained, “The lady looked like she needed to know about Jehovah.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>We can convey our interest in people with a sincere, warm smile and a friendly tone of voice. Listening carefully to the comments of others, acknowledging their concerns, and reflecting genuine personal interest likewise demonstrate love. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:15:23-20:15:23" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Prov. 15:23</a>) In imitation of Jesus, we should emphasize the positive Kingdom message and Jehovah’s loving compassion for people.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:4:18-42:4:18" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Luke 4:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>In Deed: </strong>Jesus was sensitive to the needs of others in practical, tangible ways. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:15:32-40:15:32" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Matt. 15:32</a>) We too may have opportunities to perform acts of loving-kindness while in the ministry. One sister observed a woman struggling to comprehend an important telephone call. Our sister volunteered to help by translating the caller’s words. This loving act opened the way for a Scriptural discussion that helped the woman accept a Bible study. In another case a brother making a return visit found the householder exasperated, having wedged a heavy piece of furniture in the doorway. After providing neighborly assistance, the brother was soon sitting on the couch that he had helped move, starting a Bible study with the appreciative man.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>As we share in the ministry, we demonstrate our love for God and our love for neighbor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:36-40:22:40" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Matt. 22:36-40</a>) Such demonstration in word and deed helps honesthearted ones realize that we have the truth.</p>

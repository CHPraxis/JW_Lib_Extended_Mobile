<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">ADRYANA, a six-year-old girl in Tulsa, Oklahoma, U.S.A., had a wish. It was comparable to that of the psalmist David, who sang: “One thing I have asked from Jehovah​—it is what I shall look for, that I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, to behold the pleasantness of Jehovah and to look with appreciation upon his temple.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:27:4-19:27:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 27:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When Adryana was just six months old, she was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a malignant tumor that grows in parts of the nervous system. The life-threatening disease left her paralyzed in both legs. Doctors treated her condition with numerous surgeries and a year-long regimen of chemotherapy.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Adryana’s father, who does not share the religious convictions of Adryana and her mother, contacted a certain foundation to request that his daughter visit a world-renowned amusement park. Before granting the wish, the foundation interviewed Adryana. She expressed her appreciation for being considered but told them that she would rather visit Bethel, the center of the worldwide activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses in New York. After she found out about her father’s request, Adryana prayed to Jehovah to give her an opportunity to visit Bethel. Although concerned at first that Bethel may not be sufficiently child friendly, the foundation granted the wish when her father did not dispute the choice.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Accompanied by her mother, her sister, and a friend, Adryana traveled to New York to visit Bethel for the first time. “Jehovah answered me,” Adryana said. “I knew that he would make room for us at Bethel. I saw how the books, magazines, and Bibles are made. It’s better than an amusement park.”</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Adryana did “behold the pleasantness of Jehovah” and looked with appreciation upon the operation of the center of the activities of Jehovah’s people today. You too are welcome to visit Bethel. In addition to the world headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses in New York, there are branch offices in various other parts of the world.</p>

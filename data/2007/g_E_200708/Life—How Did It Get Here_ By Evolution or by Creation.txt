Life—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?
In the country of Estonia, directors of schools were approached and shown the book with the above title. “We visited all the Russian-language schools in our city,” reported one teacher. “Each school accepted at least one book for each of the biology teachers, but most schools asked for between 15 and 40 books.”
The director of one school wrote in appreciation: “I was impressed by the clear scientific basis for the arguments made in support of creation. The book is objective and beautifully illustrated. We are looking forward to using the books in class.”

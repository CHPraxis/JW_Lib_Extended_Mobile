<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Books of Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE Assyrian world power has already devastated Samaria, the capital of the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel. Assyria has also long been a menace to Judah. The prophet Nahum of Judah has a word regarding the Assyrian capital, Nineveh. Composed before 632 B.C.E., the Bible book of Nahum contains that message.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The next power to rise is the Babylonian Empire, sometimes ruled by Chaldean kings. The book of Habakkuk, perhaps completed in 628 B.C.E., foretells how Jehovah will use that world power as his agent for executing judgment and what will eventually befall Babylon.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The prophet Zephaniah of Judah predates both Nahum and Habakkuk. Prophesying more than 40 years before the destruction of Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E., he proclaims a message of both doom and hope for Judah. The Bible book of Zephaniah also contains pronouncements against other nations.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">“The pronouncement against Nineveh” is from Jehovah God, who is “slow to anger and great in power.” Although Jehovah is “a stronghold in the day of distress” to those seeking refuge in him, Nineveh is to be destroyed.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/34:1:1-34:1:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Nahum 1:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/34:1:3-34:1:3" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/34:1:7-34:1:7" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 7</a>.</p>

In 632 B.C.E. when the joint forces of the Babylonians and the Medes came up against Nineveh, she did not feel particularly threatened. Secure behind her high walls, she considered herself to be an impenetrable city. However, heavy rains caused the Tigris to overflow. According to historian Diodorus, this “both inundated a portion of the city and broke down the walls for a distance.” The river gates were thus opened, and as foretold, Nineveh was taken as quickly as fire devours dry stubble.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/34:1:8-34:1:10" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Nahum 1:8-10</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb">The first two chapters of the book of Habakkuk are a dialogue between the prophet and Jehovah God. Distressed over what is taking place in Judah, Habakkuk asks God: “Why is it that you make me see what is hurtful, and you keep looking upon mere trouble?” In reply, Jehovah says: “I am raising up the Chaldeans, the nation bitter and impetuous.” The prophet expresses surprise that God would use “those dealing treacherously” to punish Judah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:1:3-35:1:3" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Habakkuk 1:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:1:6-35:1:6" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:1:13-35:1:13" data-bid="16-3" class="b"> 13</a>) Habakkuk is assured that the righteous one will keep living, but the enemy will not escape punishment. Moreover, Habakkuk records five woes to be taken up against the Chaldean foe.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:2:4-35:2:4" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Habakkuk 2:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sb">In a prayer for mercy, Habakkuk recounts “in dirges” such past demonstrations of Jehovah’s awesome power as those at the Red Sea, in the wilderness, and at Jericho. The prophet also foretells the marching forth of Jehovah with destructive anger at Armageddon. The prayer concludes with the words: “Jehovah the Sovereign Lord is my vital energy; and he will make my feet like those of the hinds, and upon my high places he will cause me to tread.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:3:1-35:3:1" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Habakkuk 3:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:3:19-35:3:19" data-bid="18-2" class="b"> 19</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:23:29-12:23:30" data-bid="20-1" class="b">2 Kings 23:29, 30,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/12:23:34-12:23:34" data-bid="20-2" class="b"> 34</a>) Although the Babylonians were on the rise, their army had not yet defeated Pharaoh Necho. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/24:46:2-24:46:2" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Jeremiah 46:2</a>) Moreover, Jehovah’s temple was in Jerusalem, and the Davidic dynasty had ruled uninterrupted from there. To the Jews back then, God’s “activity” of allowing the Chaldeans to destroy Jerusalem would appear unthinkable. Regardless of how unbelievable Habakkuk’s words may have sounded to them, though, the vision about Jerusalem’s destruction by the Babylonians ‘without fail came true’ in 607 B.C.E.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/35:2:3-35:2:3" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Habakkuk 2:3</a>.</p>

He would not succeed in gathering to himself all the nations, however, because Jehovah would use the Medes and the Persians to cause his fall. The modern-day composite “man” is made up of political powers. He too is drunk with self-assurance and self-importance and has an insatiable appetite for expansion. But he does not reach his goal of “gathering to himself all the nations.” Only God’s Kingdom will unite mankind.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9, 10</a>.</p>

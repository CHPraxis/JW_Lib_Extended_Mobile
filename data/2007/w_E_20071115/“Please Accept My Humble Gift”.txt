“Please Accept My Humble Gift”
THESE words were written in a letter received by the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia. A large box full of woolen socks accompanied the letter.
The gift was sent by 67-year-old Alla, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses serving in a congregation in the Far East of Russia. Alla has been serving Jehovah for over ten years, zealously preaching the good news of the Kingdom. However, a stroke suddenly left her partially paralyzed. Motivated by love, though, Alla has followed a course similar to that of the first-century Christian woman Dorcas, who made garments for fellow believers.​—Acts 9:36, 39.
In her letter, Alla wrote: “I cannot move my legs, but I can still move my hands. So I preach by writing letters.” She added: “I decided that while I am still able to move my hands, I will knit a few pairs of warm socks. I would like these socks to be given to brothers and sisters who are going to build Kingdom Halls in cold places, such as the Far East and Siberia.”
Regarding his genuine followers, Jesus Christ said: “By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.” (John 13:35) Love like that showed by Alla is an identifying mark of Jesus’ true disciples.

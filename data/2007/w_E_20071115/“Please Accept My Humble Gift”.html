<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THESE words were written in a letter received by the branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia. A large box full of woolen socks accompanied the letter.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The gift was sent by 67-year-old Alla, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses serving in a congregation in the Far East of Russia. Alla has been serving Jehovah for over ten years, zealously preaching the good news of the Kingdom. However, a stroke suddenly left her partially paralyzed. Motivated by love, though, Alla has followed a course similar to that of the first-century Christian woman Dorcas, who made garments for fellow believers.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:36-44:9:36" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 9:36,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:9:39-44:9:39" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 39</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In her letter, Alla wrote: “I cannot move my legs, but I can still move my hands. So I preach by writing letters.” She added: “I decided that while I am still able to move my hands, I will knit a few pairs of warm socks. I would like these socks to be given to brothers and sisters who are going to build Kingdom Halls in cold places, such as the Far East and Siberia.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Regarding his genuine followers, Jesus Christ said: “By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="2-1" class="b">John 13:35</a>) Love like that showed by Alla is an identifying mark of Jesus’ true disciples.</p>

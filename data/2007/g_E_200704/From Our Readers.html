<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><strong>Young People Ask . . . Why Do I Have to Read? </strong>(May 2006)  I am 15 years old, and this article was very helpful to me. I took the magazine to school, and my teacher noticed it. During class she talked about reading habits and showed the <em>Awake! </em>to my classmates. She mentioned that she had enjoyed the article very much, and she recommended it to all in attendance.</p>

<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In the past I would oftentimes read only the subjects in the magazines that appealed to me. Now I make a conscious effort to read each article, even if at first it doesn’t seem interesting to me. I have found that those particular articles almost always become my favorites. Thank you so much.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">I was happy to know that there are young people today who are like I was. I was baptized at age 14 and am now 40 years old. Beginning a short time before my baptism, I too made it a habit to read a number of pages from either <em>The Watchtower </em>or <em>Awake! </em>each day. I feel that it is due to this custom that I have never missed reading an article and that I have been able to maintain my spirituality.</p>

Thankfully, the melanoma was surgically removed while it was still in its early stages. My heartfelt thanks to Jehovah for such practical material.</p>

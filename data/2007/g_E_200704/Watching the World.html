<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“Brain reactions of people who play computer games excessively are similar to those of alcoholics or cannabis addicts.” So says psychologist Ralf Thalemann, leader of an addiction research group at Charité University Hospital, Berlin, Germany. It is thought that stimulation from excessive playing of computer games can cause an increased release of dopamine into a player’s brain, which produces a sensation of well-being that can eventually create an “addiction.” One survey suggested that this may occur in over 10 percent of those who play video games.</p>

The researchers, who studied rich people’s “attitudes toward faith, marriage, life, career and money,” found that “a majority of the millionaires love and hate money at the same time.” A number of respondents said that besides social status and a sense of accomplishment, “annoyance is the main thing money has brought them.”</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">Over 100 experts from 14 countries recently met in Stavanger, Norway, to learn about Green Care, a concept that combines farming, teaching, and health care. According to the broadcasting company <em>NRK, </em>some who have been mentally ill for years no longer need to be institutionalized when they start doing farm work. It is “healthy for mind and body.” More than 600 traditional farms in Norway cooperate with Green Care, for which they receive extra income.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">“New England churches [in the United States] have found a solution to dwindling budgets: renting their picturesque steeples to wireless companies in need of cell sites,” says <em>Newsweek </em>magazine. Locations for towers that transmit and receive messages from cell phones are limited by zoning restrictions in residential areas, and residents do not want ugly antennas in their neighborhoods. So cell-phone providers are hiding their equipment inside church steeples. The president of one consulting firm for churches says: “The first church we did now has three carriers in it, and they’re getting $74,000 a year for space nobody [was] using anyway.”</p>

“A Tremendous Teaching Tool!”
That is what a full-time minister of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Panama wrote regarding What Does the Bible Really Teach?—a colorfully illustrated, 224-page book now being widely used in Bible study. “It is unbelievably concise, coherent, and convincing,” he wrote. “The innovative way references and appendixes are employed instantly encourages investigation.”
A Bible teacher in Missouri, U.S.A., observed: “I love the simple manner in which it is written. The progression of subjects is presented in the most logical manner I have ever seen.” As soon as the Bible Teach book became available, the teacher took it to a woman who had previously tried to study the Bible but had become discouraged.
“She had not finished reading the first chapter,” the teacher related, “when she called to tell me how much she was enjoying it.” The student said that she felt as though the book were written just for her and that she wanted to resume her Bible study. The teacher noted that after they had finished studying the first ten chapters together, the student’s joy over what she was learning was absolutely delightful to see.
Although the Bible Teach book has been available for less than two years, over 50 million copies have already been printed in more than 150 languages.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>March: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>Make a special effort to start Bible studies. <strong>April and May: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. When making return visits on interested people, including those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on starting Bible studies using the <em>Bible Teach </em>book. <strong>June: </strong><em>Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? </em>As an alternative offer, you may use <em>The Secret of Family Happiness.</em></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Congregations should release the latest issues of <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>as soon as they are received. This will allow publishers to become familiar with the contents before offering the magazines in field service.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts for the months of December, January, and February. When this has been done, an announcement should be made to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.​—See <em>Instructions for Congregation Accounting </em>(S-27).</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ The secretary of each congregation holding title to property should review paragraphs 42-4 in the form entitled <em>Information Regarding Ownership of Kingdom Halls </em>(TO-36). Even after real-estate tax exemption has been obtained, an annual filing is required in some states. Check carefully with your local tax assessor’s office to determine whether any action is required. All taxes and assessments are to be paid within the time provided. If any tax or assessment is questioned, promptly follow through on the matter so that either it is removed or a proper challenge is filed within the applicable time limit.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ It is important that groups of 20 or more planning to visit the United States branch office facilities at Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill first correspond by mail with the Central Tour Desk at 100 Watchtower Drive, Patterson, NY 12563-9204. You may also use the following fax number: (845) 306-0200. At least two weeks prior to visiting, please send information on the number coming and the dates and times for visiting each location. <em>Lodging information may be obtained from the congregation secretary. </em>Before your visit, please review the June 2002 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>Question Box regarding proper dress and grooming when visiting Bethel homes.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ Immediately after the Memorial, the total attendance and number of partakers should be submitted to the branch office using the Congregation Internet Site (CIS). If this is not possible, the <em>Memorial Report </em>(S-7) card or a letter may be sent. When multiple congregations meet together, only one congregation should submit the total attendance figure.</p>

Is the Pursuit of Money Making You Sick?
IF YOU became very rich tomorrow, what would you do? Slow down and enjoy life? Quit your job and spend more time with your family and friends? Take up a career that you really enjoy? Interestingly, many people who become rich do no such things. Instead, they devote the rest of their lives to making more money—either to pay off their new debts or just to get richer.
Some who have followed this course, however, are noting the damaging effect that materialism has had on their health, their family life, and the moral character of their children. Recently, books, articles, television programs, and videos have warned against overindulgence and have, instead, encouraged “voluntary simplicity.” A number of sources point out that becoming absorbed in materialistic pursuits can make you sick—mentally, emotionally, and even physically.
Of course, concern about the dangers of materialism is not new. Almost 2,000 years ago, the Bible stated: “Those who are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many senseless and hurtful desires, which plunge men into destruction and ruin. For the love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things, and by reaching out for this love some have been led astray from the faith and have stabbed themselves all over with many pains.”—1 Timothy 6:9, 10.
But is that true? Do those who live for money and material acquisitions really suffer for it? Or do they have it all—wealth, health, and happy families? Let us see.

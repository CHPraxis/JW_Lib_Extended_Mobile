Life After Death—What Does the Bible Really Teach?
It does not teach what many have been told it does. For example, it does not teach . . .
▪ That all good people are rewarded with life in heaven.
▪ That dead relatives are to be worshipped or venerated.
▪ That dead ones can either harm or benefit the living.
▪ That humans possess an immortal soul—a doctrine shared by many religions, which forms the basis for a number of unscriptural teachings, such as hellfire torment and reincarnation.
What it does teach, however, is beautiful and heartwarming, as explained in a clear, simple manner in the book shown here. You may request a copy by filling in the accompanying coupon and mailing it to the address provided or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.

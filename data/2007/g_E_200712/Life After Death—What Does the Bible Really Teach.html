<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sw">▪ That dead ones can either harm or benefit the living.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sw">▪ That humans possess an immortal soul<wbr />—a doctrine shared by many religions, which forms the basis for a number of unscriptural teachings, such as hellfire torment and reincarnation.</p>

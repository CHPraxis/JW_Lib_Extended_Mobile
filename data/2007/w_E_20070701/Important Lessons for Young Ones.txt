Important Lessons for Young Ones
GLADYS works at a school in Mendoza, Argentina. One day she walked by a classroom and noticed a teacher reading to her fourth-grade students from My Book of Bible Stories.a Gladys introduced herself to the teacher as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses and offered to show her how to get the most out of the publication. Impressed by what Gladys explained to her, the teacher wanted to make the book a regular part of the curriculum. However, she needed permission from the school administration. To her delight, permission was granted.
Later, at a school Book Day program, the teacher assigned her students to read a chapter of the book in front of their schoolmates. As a result of the good response to this program, the teacher was invited to appear as a guest on a local television show. When the conduct of schoolchildren was brought up, the show’s host asked her, “How do you keep the children in your classroom under control?” The teacher explained that she was using a publication entitled My Book of Bible Stories. She explained that although she was not teaching religion in her classroom, by means of this book, she was inculcating such moral values as respect, tolerance, unity, cooperation, obedience, and love. All agreed that these were important lessons for young ones to learn.
Would you like to inculcate such values in your children? You may ask one of Jehovah’s Witnesses for a copy of the fascinating publication My Book of Bible Stories.

<p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="qu"> 1. How can anxiety about sinning against the spirit be dispelled?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb">THERE is a way to dispel anxiety about sinning against Jehovah’s holy spirit. It is by doing what the apostle Paul said: “Keep walking by spirit and you will carry out no fleshly desire at all.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:16-48:5:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Galatians 5:16</a>) If we let God’s spirit guide us, we will not be overcome by improper fleshly desires.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:2-45:8:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Romans 8:2-10</a>.</p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu">2, 3. If we keep walking by spirit, how will we be affected?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>As we “keep walking by spirit,” God’s active force will motivate us to obey Jehovah. We will display godly qualities in our ministry, in the congregation, at home, and elsewhere. The spirit’s fruitage will be evident in our dealings with our marriage mate, our children, our fellow believers, and others.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Living “as to the spirit from the standpoint of God” enables us to desist from sin. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:4:1-60:4:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Peter 4:1-6</a>) If we are under the spirit’s influence, we will certainly not commit an unforgivable sin. But in what other fine ways will we be affected if we keep on walking by spirit?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>Remain Close to God and Christ</strong></p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu">4, 5. How does walking by spirit affect our view of Jesus?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Because we walk by holy spirit, we are able to maintain a close relationship with God and his Son. Writing about spiritual gifts, Paul told fellow believers in Corinth: “I would have you [former idolaters] know that nobody when speaking by God’s spirit says: ‘Jesus is accursed!’ and nobody can say: ‘Jesus is Lord!’ except by holy spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:12:1-46:12:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 12:1-3</a>) Any spirit that moves people to pronounce a curse upon Jesus must originate with Satan the Devil. As Christians walking by holy spirit, though, we are convinced that Jehovah raised Jesus from the dead and made him higher than all other creation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:5-50:2:11" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Philippians 2:5-11</a>) We have faith in Christ’s ransom sacrifice and accept Jesus as the Lord appointed over us by God.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Certain professed Christians of the first century C.E. denied that Jesus came in the flesh. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/63:1:7-63:1:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 John 7-11</a>) Accepting that false viewpoint caused some to repudiate the true teachings about Jesus, the Messiah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:1:9-41:1:11" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Mark 1:9-11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:1-43:1:1" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> John 1:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:1:14-43:1:14" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 14</a>) Walking by holy spirit prevents us from succumbing to such apostasy. But only by remaining spiritually vigilant can we continue to enjoy Jehovah’s undeserved kindness and “go on walking in the truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/64:1:3-64:1:4" data-bid="9-1" class="b">3 John 3, 4</a>) Let us therefore be determined to reject all apostasy so that we can maintain a strong relationship with our heavenly Father.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 6. What qualities does God’s spirit produce in those walking by spirit?</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Paul listed apostate idolatry and sects among such “works of the flesh” as fornication and loose conduct. But he explained: “Those who belong to Christ Jesus impaled the flesh together with its passions and desires. If we are living by spirit, let us go on walking orderly also by spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:19-48:5:21" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Galatians 5:19-21,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:24-48:5:25" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 24, 25</a>) What qualities <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>does God’s active force produce in those who live and walk by spirit? “The fruitage of the spirit,” wrote Paul, “is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness, self-control.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:22-48:5:23" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Galatians 5:22, 23</a>) Let us consider these aspects of the spirit’s fruitage.</p>

<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> 7. What is love, and what are some of its characteristics?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Love​—one aspect of the spirit’s fruitage—​often involves strong affection and unselfish concern for others, coupled with warm attachment to them. The Scriptures say that “God is love” because he is the very epitome of that quality. The great love of God and his Son for mankind is exemplified in the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:4:8-62:4:8" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 John 4:8;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> John 3:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:15:13-43:15:13" data-bid="12-3" class="b"> 15:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:8-45:5:8" data-bid="12-4" class="b"> Romans 5:8</a>) As Jesus’ followers, we are identified by the love we have for one another. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:34-43:13:35" data-bid="13-1" class="b">John 13:34, 35</a>) In fact, we are commanded to “be loving one another.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:23-62:3:23" data-bid="14-1" class="b">1 John 3:23</a>) And Paul says that love is long-suffering and kind. It is not jealous, and it does not brag, behave indecently, or look for its own interests. Love does not become provoked or keep account of the injury. It rejoices with the truth, not over unrighteousness. Love bears, believes, hopes, and endures all things. Moreover, it never fails.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:13:4-46:13:8" data-bid="15-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 13:4-8</a>.</p>
<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"> 8. Why should we show love for fellow worshippers of Jehovah?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>If we allow God’s spirit to produce love within us, that quality will exist in our relationships with God and neighbor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:37-40:22:39" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 22:37-39</a>) “He who does not love remains in death,” wrote the apostle John. “Everyone who hates his brother is a manslayer, and you know that no manslayer has everlasting life remaining in him.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:14-62:3:15" data-bid="17-1" class="b">1 John 3:14, 15</a>) A manslayer could find safety in an Israelite city of refuge only if he did not hate the one slain.

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>God-given joy brings us deep satisfaction when we do the divine will even in times of hardship, sorrow, or persecution.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:1-20:2:5" data-bid="22-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:1-5</a>) Our joyous relationship with God is based on accurate knowledge and faith in him and in Jesus’ ransom sacrifice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:2:1-62:2:2" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 John 2:1, 2</a>) Being part of the only true international brotherhood is another source of joy.

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Peace​—another aspect of the spirit’s fruitage—​is a state of tranquillity and freedom from disturbance. Our heavenly Father is the God of peace, and we are given the assurance: “Jehovah himself will bless his people with peace.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:29:11-19:29:11" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Psalm 29:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:33-46:14:33" data-bid="28-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 14:33</a>) Jesus told his disciples: “I leave you peace, I give you my peace.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:27-43:14:27" data-bid="29-1" class="b">John 14:27</a>) How would that help his followers?</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>The peace that Jesus gave his disciples calmed their hearts and minds and allayed their fears.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:14:26-43:14:26" data-bid="30-1" class="b">John 14:26</a>) Under the spirit’s influence and in answer to our prayers today, we enjoy the incomparable “peace of God,” which puts our heart and mind at rest.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Long-suffering is related to peaceableness, for it is our patient endurance of provocation or wrong in hopes of improvement in the situation. God is long-suffering. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:9:22-45:9:24" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Romans 9:22-24</a>) Jesus also manifests this quality.

<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>The quality of long-suffering helps us to endure when others say or do unkind or thoughtless things.

<p id="p58" data-pid="58" class="qu">23, 24. What is self-control, and how does it help us?</p>
<p id="p32" data-pid="32" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><sup>23 </sup>Self-control enables us to keep our thoughts, speech, and actions in check. Jehovah “kept exercising self-control” in dealing with the Babylonian desolaters of Jerusalem. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:42:14-23:42:14" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Isaiah 42:14</a>) His Son ‘left us a model’ by exercising self-control during his sufferings. And the apostle Peter counseled fellow Christians to ‘supply to their knowledge self-control.’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/60:2:21-60:2:23" data-bid="59-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:21-23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:1:5-61:1:8" data-bid="59-2" class="b"> 2 Peter 1:5-8</a>.</p>
<p id="p33" data-pid="33" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><sup>24 </sup>Christian elders are expected to be self-controlled. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/56:1:7-56:1:8" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Titus 1:7, 8</a>) Actually, all who are led by holy spirit can exercise self-control and can thus avoid immorality, vulgar speech, or anything else that could result in Jehovah’s disapproval. If we allow God’s spirit to produce self-control within us, this will be apparent to others because of our godly speech and conduct.</p>

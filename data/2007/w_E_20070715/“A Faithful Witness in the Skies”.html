<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">POETS and songwriters have long extolled the moon as an object of beauty. For example, a divinely inspired song speaks of a woman who is “beautiful like the full moon.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/22:6:10-22:6:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Song of Solomon 6:10</a>) And a psalmist poetically calls the moon “a faithful witness in the skies.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:89:37-19:89:37" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 89:37</a>) What is the significance of this expression regarding the moon?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The moon unfailingly completes its orbit around the earth every 27.3 days. Hence, the moon’s faithfulness can refer to its reliability. However, the psalmist may have had a much deeper meaning in mind. He called the moon “a faithful witness” in a prophetic song about the Kingdom for which Jesus taught his followers to pray.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:9-40:6:10" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 6:9, 10</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Over 3,000 years ago, Jehovah God entered into the Kingdom covenant with King David of ancient Israel. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/10:7:12-10:7:16" data-bid="4-1" class="b">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>) The purpose of that covenant was to provide a legal basis for Jesus Christ, as David’s heir, to possess the throne forever. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:9:7-23:9:7" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Isaiah 9:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:1:32-42:1:33" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Luke 1:32, 33</a>) Referring to the throne of David’s “seed,” the psalmist sang: “As the moon it will be firmly established for time indefinite, and as a faithful witness in the skies.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:89:36-19:89:37" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 89:36, 37</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The ‘luminary that dominates the night’​—the moon—​is a fitting reminder of the permanence of Christ’s rule. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:1:16-1:1:16" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Genesis 1:16</a>) Concerning his Kingdom, <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/27:7:14-27:7:14" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Daniel 7:14</a> states: “His rulership is an indefinitely lasting rulership that will not pass away, and his kingdom one that will not be brought to ruin.” The moon is a witness that reminds us of that Kingdom and the blessings it will bestow upon mankind.</p>

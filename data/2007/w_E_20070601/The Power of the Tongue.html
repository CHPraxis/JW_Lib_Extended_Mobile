<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THE tongue of the giraffe measures up to 18 inches <strong>[45 cm] </strong>long and is agile and powerful enough to pluck leaves off tree branches. The blue whale’s tongue weighs as much as an elephant. Imagine the strength needed just to move it!</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The human tongue pales in comparison in size, weight, and strength. Yet, it is far more powerful. “Death and life are in the power of the tongue,” says the Bible of this small member of the human body. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:18:21-20:18:21" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 18:21</a>) Indeed, how many times have we heard of the human tongue’s death-dealing power being wielded in fabricating lies and false testimonies that have brought ruination, even death, to innocent victims?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Likewise, longtime friendships have been dashed by hurtful remarks. Emotions have been crushed by harsh words. “How long will you men keep irritating my soul and keep crushing me with words?” cried the much-maligned Job. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:19:2-18:19:2" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Job 19:2</a>) The disciple James gave a vivid picture of the destructive power of the unbridled tongue: “The tongue is a little member and yet makes great brags. Look! How little a fire it takes to set so great a woodland on fire! Well, the tongue is a fire.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/59:3:5-59:3:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">James 3:5, 6</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">On the other hand, the power of the tongue can also be life-giving. Empathetic and consoling words have rescued some from depression and suicide. Sound advice, when heeded, has saved many drug abusers and street thugs from untimely death. Truly, the fruitage of a righteous one’s tongue is “a tree of life,” and “as apples of gold in silver carvings is a word spoken at the right time for it.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:15:4-20:15:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Proverbs 15:4;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:25:11-20:25:11" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 25:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The best use of the tongue, however, is in praising Jehovah God, declaring the good news of God’s Kingdom, and teaching others the precious truths of the Bible. Why? Said Jesus: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:3-43:17:3" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 17:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Matthew 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 28:19, 20</a>.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">IT IS December 609 B.C.E. The Babylonian king has begun his final siege of Jerusalem. So far, Ezekiel’s message to the exiles in Babylon has centered on one theme: the fall and destruction of their beloved city, Jerusalem. Now, though, the subject of Ezekiel’s prophecies shifts to the doom of the pagan nations that would rejoice at the calamity upon God’s people. When Jerusalem falls 18 months later, Ezekiel’s message once again takes on a new theme: the glorious restoration of true worship.</p>

However, God did not forsake his covenant with David. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:21:27-26:21:27" data-bid="58-1" class="b">Ezekiel 21:27;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:7:11-10:7:16" data-bid="58-2" class="b"> 2 Samuel 7:11-16</a>) Ezekiel’s prophecy speaks of “my servant David,” who would become a “shepherd” and a “king.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:34:23-26:34:24" data-bid="59-1" class="b">Ezekiel 34:23, 24;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:37:22-26:37:22" data-bid="59-2" class="b"> 37:22,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:37:24-26:37:25" data-bid="59-3" class="b"> 24, 25</a>) This one is none other than Jesus Christ in Kingdom power. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:11:15-66:11:15" data-bid="60-1" class="b">Revelation 11:15</a>) Jehovah will “sanctify [his] great name” by means of the Messianic Kingdom.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:36:23-26:36:23" data-bid="61-1" class="b">Ezekiel 36:23</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="sb">Very soon now, all those who profane God’s holy name will be destroyed. But those who sanctify that name in their lives by worshipping Jehovah in an acceptable way will receive everlasting life. Let us therefore take full advantage of the waters of life that are flowing abundantly in our day and make true worship the very center of our lives.</p>

Announcements
▪ Literature offer for June: Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? As an alternative offer, you may use The Secret of Family Happiness. July: Keep on the Watch! Where genuine interest is shown, offer the Bible Teach book, making a diligent effort to start Bible studies. August: Worship the Only True God. If a Bible study is started, it is recommended that the Bible Teach book be studied before the Worship God book. September: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Make a special effort to start Bible studies on the initial call. When householders already have this publication, show how they can benefit from it by briefly demonstrating a Bible study.
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts for the months of March, April, and May. When this has been done, an announcement should be made to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.​—See Instructions for Congregation Accounting (S-27).
▪ The branch facilities in Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, will be closed on the following dates: September 8, 2007 (Gilead graduation); October 6, 2007 (annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania); March 8, 2008 (Gilead graduation); and May 9-10, 2008 (spring cleaning). There will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on those dates.
▪ It is recommended that applications for regular pioneer service be submitted to the branch office at least 30 days before the requested start date. The congregation secretary should review the forms to make sure that they are complete. If applicants cannot recall the exact date of their baptism, they should estimate the date and keep a record of it. The secretary should note this date on the Congregation’s Publisher Record (S-21) card.

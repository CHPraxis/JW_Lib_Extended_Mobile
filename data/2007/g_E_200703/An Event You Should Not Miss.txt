An Event You Should Not Miss
“Keep doing this in remembrance of me.” Those words of our Lord Jesus Christ, found at Luke 22:19, were spoken at the time that he instituted the Memorial of his death. It is Jesus’ death that opened to humankind the prospect of attaining everlasting life in Paradise conditions. So his death is something we should remember.
Will you observe the Memorial of it this year?
Please accept this invitation from Jehovah’s Witnesses to meet with them in memorializing this important event. This observance will be after sundown on the date that corresponds with Nisan 14 on the Bible’s lunar calendar. This year that date is Monday, April 2.

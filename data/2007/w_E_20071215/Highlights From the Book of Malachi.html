<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Book of Malachi</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE rebuilt temple in Jerusalem has been standing completed for over 70 years. With the passing of time, though, the spirituality of the Jews has come to be at a very low ebb. Even the priests have become corrupt. Who will make them aware of their true condition and try to revive them spiritually? Jehovah gives the task to the prophet Malachi.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Written in a forceful style by Malachi, the last book of the Hebrew Scriptures contains divinely inspired prophecy. Paying attention to the prophetic word of Malachi can help us to prepare for “the great and fear-inspiring day of Jehovah,” when the present wicked system of things comes to an end.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:4:5-39:4:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Malachi 4:5</a>.</p>

<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Jehovah expresses his feelings toward Israel, saying: “I have loved you people.” But the priests have despised God’s name. How? “By presenting upon [his] altar polluted bread” and by offering “a lame animal or a sick one” for sacrificing.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:1:2-39:1:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Malachi 1:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/39:1:6-39:1:8" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 6-8</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The priests “have caused many to stumble in the law.” The people “deal treacherously with one another.” Some have taken foreign wives.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:16:27-3:16:27" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Leviticus 16:27</a>) To scatter dung on the priests’ faces meant that Jehovah rejected the sacrifices and that those who offered them were contemptible to him.</p>

What had caused them such grief? Their Jewish husbands had obtained a divorce on illegitimate grounds and had left <span id="page27" class="pageNum" data-no="27" data-before-text="27"></span>them, likely in order to marry younger foreign women.</p>

How important it is that our acts of worship, including what we do in the Christian ministry, be motivated by unselfish love for God and neighbor, never for monetary gain!​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:37-40:22:39" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 22:37-39;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:7-47:11:7" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 2 Corinthians 11:7</a>.</p>

That was the occasion when Jesus entered the temple and threw out those buying and selling. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:11:15-41:11:15" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Mark 11:15</a>) This was three and a half years after Jesus had been anointed as King-Designate. Correspondingly, it appears that three and a half years after his enthronement as King in heaven, Jesus accompanied Jehovah to the spiritual temple and found God’s people in need of cleansing. In the first century, John the Baptizer was sent forth to prepare the Jews for the coming of Jesus Christ. In modern times, a messenger was sent in advance to prepare the way for Jehovah’s coming to his spiritual temple. As early as the 1880’s, a group of Bible students began to engage in a Bible education work to restore many basic Bible truths to the hearts of sincere individuals.</p>

Yet, tithing has a symbolic meaning. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:15-49:2:15" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Ephesians 2:15</a>) It does not represent the giving of our all. While the tenth part was brought year after year, we bring our all to Jehovah only once​—when we dedicate ourselves to him and symbolize our dedication by undergoing water baptism. From that time on, everything we have belongs to Jehovah. Still, he allows us to choose a portion of what we have​—a symbolic tithe—​to use in his service. It is whatever our circumstances allow and our heart impels us to use. The offerings we bring to Jehovah include the time, energy, and resources used in the Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work. Also included are attending Christian meetings, visiting sick and elderly fellow believers, and rendering financial support to true worship.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:24:44-42:24:45" data-bid="28-1" class="b">Luke 24:44, 45</a>) Moreover, the Law contains “typical representations of the things in the heavens.” Studying it is essential if we are to gain an understanding of Christian teachings and conduct.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:9:23-58:9:23" data-bid="29-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:23</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THAT is how a former prime minister of Belgium described the book <em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived.</em><span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> A neighbor made a friendly visit on him, and the career statesman accepted a copy of the book. Later, he wrote a letter of appreciation: “Your friendly visit really touched me, and I was even more impressed with your very precious gift: the book devoted to ‘The Greatest Man.’”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The former prime minister had analyzed the book and concluded: “If people would be more interested in the message of the Gospel and would put into practice the principles of Jesus Christ, the world today would look completely different. Then we would not need a Security Council; nor would there be terrorist attacks, and violence would be banned from the world.” Although admitting that this seems to be wishful thinking, he expressed respect for his neighbor’s positive action.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The letter continued: “You belong to a great group of people of goodwill who are neither optimists nor pessimists but meliorists, that is, people who believe in the betterment of both humans and things.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that divine action, not human efforts, will eventually bring about a better world. They try to imitate the greatest man, Jesus Christ. Have Jehovah’s Witnesses called on you lately? You would likely enjoy a conversation with them about the greatest man who ever lived. And they would be happy to share with you the book that so impressed the former prime minister.</p>

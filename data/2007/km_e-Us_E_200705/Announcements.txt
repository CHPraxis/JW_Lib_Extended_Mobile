Announcements
▪ Literature offer for May: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. When making return visits on interested people, including those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on starting Bible studies using the Bible Teach book. June: Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? As an alternative offer, you may use The Secret of Family Happiness. July: Keep on the Watch! Where genuine interest is shown, offer the Bible Teach book, making a diligent effort to start Bible studies. August: Worship the Only True God. If a Bible study is started, it is recommended that the Bible Teach book be studied before the Worship God book.
▪ Donations for the worldwide work that are made by check at district conventions and those sent to the branch office should be made payable to “Watch Tower.” The branch office’s financial address is Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, c/​o Treasurer’s Office, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483.
▪ Bodies of elders should review the July 6, 2006, letter regarding disaster preparedness and ensure that they have up-to-date contact information for each publisher. In disaster-prone areas, additional emergency contact information should be obtained. Of course, in addition to emergency situations, it is helpful when publishers communicate with their Congregation Book Study overseer or another elder if they will be away for extended periods, such as when traveling on vacation or business, during a hospital stay, and so forth.
▪ Individuals confined to prisons, jails, substance-abuse facilities, or state hospitals should receive literature and spiritual assistance under the direction of the congregation assigned by the branch office as the contact for the facility. Publishers should not contact the branch office to request literature or visits for such individuals. Rather, those confined should initiate requests for visits or literature through publishers approved to visit their facility or by writing directly to the branch office. This allows the individual to give evidence of his genuine interest and may assist publishers in being granted access to the facility.

Do You Champion God’s Word?
1 In a world that often discredits the Bible, true Christians zealously advocate God’s Word. Convinced that “all Scripture is inspired of God,” we stand with Jesus Christ, who testified in prayer to Jehovah: “Your word is truth.” (2 Tim. 3:16; John 17:17) How may we effectively champion God’s Word?
2 Learn Scriptures: Jesus no doubt applied himself to learning God’s Word. This enabled him to teach from the Scriptures throughout his ministry. (Luke 4:16-21; 24:44-46) How can we build up in our memory a helpful reservoir of scriptures? We do so by reading the Bible each day and then meditating on a verse that we found to be especially encouraging or helpful for the ministry. When preparing for meetings, we should look up and read the cited scriptures directly from the Bible and perhaps prepare a comment on them. When attending meetings, we should follow along in our Bible as the speaker reads scriptures. Learning Bible texts will prepare us to ‘handle the word of the truth aright.’​—2 Tim. 2:15.
3 Let the Bible Speak: While engaging in the ministry, we should let the Bible speak. For example, if circumstances allow, we should try to share a scripture with the householder. If he asks a question or raises an objection, it is best to use the Bible to give an answer. When the householder is busy, we may still be able to highlight a Biblical thought by saying, “Before I go, allow me to leave you with this one scripture.” Whenever possible, read directly from the Bible, allowing the listener to follow along as you read.
4 When one householder was shown scriptures to refute the Trinity, he exclaimed, “I have attended church all my life, and I surely didn’t know the Bible says this!” He readily accepted a Bible study. Jesus said that his sheep would listen to his voice. (John 10:16, 27) The best way for honesthearted ones to recognize the truth is to see it directly from the Scriptures. Let us therefore be champions of God’s Word of truth!

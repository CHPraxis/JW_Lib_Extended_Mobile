Christ’s Coming​—Should We Fear It?
WHAT images does the coming of Jesus Christ bring to your mind? Do you see it as an event that spells doom, desolation, and punishment for mankind? Or do you expect it to bring an end to all our problems? Is Christ’s coming something to be feared? Or should we look forward to it?
Concerning Christ’s coming, the Bible states: “Look! He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, . . . and all the tribes of the earth will beat themselves in grief because of him.” (Revelation 1:7) This coming refers to Jesus’ appearing in the future to reward the just and punish the wicked.
Rather than fearing it, the apostle John looked forward to Christ’s coming. After receiving the revelation about this coming and about what it will mean for the earth, John earnestly prayed: “Come, Lord Jesus.” (Revelation 22:20) But why do “all the tribes of the earth . . . beat themselves in grief because of him”? In what way will “every eye” see him? What will Christ’s coming accomplish? How can putting faith in it benefit us now? The following article will answer these questions.

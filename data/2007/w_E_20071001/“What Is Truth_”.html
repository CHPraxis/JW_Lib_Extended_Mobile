<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THAT question was cynically posed to Jesus by the Roman Governor Pontius Pilate. He was not interested in an answer, and Jesus did not give him one. Perhaps Pilate viewed truth as too elusive to grasp.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:18:38-43:18:38" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 18:38</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">This disdainful attitude toward truth is shared by many today, including religious leaders, educators, and politicians. They hold that truth<wbr />—especially moral and spiritual truth—<wbr />is not absolute but relative and ever changing. This, of course, implies that people can determine for themselves what is right and what is wrong. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:5:20-23:5:21" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Isaiah 5:20, 21</a>) It also allows people to reject as out-of-date the values and moral standards held by past generations.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The statement that prompted Pilate’s question is worth noting. Jesus had said: “For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:18:37-43:18:37" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 18:37</a>) Truth to Jesus was no vague, incomprehensible concept. He promised his disciples: “You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:8:32-43:8:32" data-bid="4-1" class="b">John 8:32</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Where can such truth be found? On one occasion, Jesus said in prayer to God: “Your word is truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:17:17-43:17:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 17:17</a>) The Bible, written under divine inspiration, reveals truth that provides both reliable guidance and a sure hope for the future<wbr />—everlasting life.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:15-55:3:17" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:15-17</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Pilate indifferently rejected the opportunity to learn such truth. What about you? Why not ask Jehovah’s Witnesses what “the truth” that Jesus taught is all about? They will be glad to share that truth with you.</p>

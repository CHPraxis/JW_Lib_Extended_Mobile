A Centenarian With a Purpose in Life
ELIN is one of 60 people in Sweden who were recently listed as being 105 years of age or older. She herself is 105. Although she is confined to a home for the elderly, her health allows her to continue serving as an active Witness of Jehovah, the life course that she chose more than 60 years ago.
In preaching to others, Elin follows the pattern set by the apostle Paul when he was under house arrest, confined to a home. Paul preached to all his visitors. (Acts 28:16, 30, 31) Similarly, Elin seizes every opportunity to speak to cleaners, dentists, doctors, hairdressers, nurses, and others she meets in the home, sharing with them the good news found in the Bible. From time to time, fellow believers in Elin’s congregation even invite their Bible students to visit her so that they can benefit from her knowledge and experience.
Members of Elin’s congregation appreciate her cheerful spirit and curiosity. A fellow Witness says: “She has a fantastic ability to keep up with congregation activities. She remembers the names of all the children and of those who have recently moved into the congregation.” Elin is also well-known for her hospitality, sense of humor, and positive view of life.
What helps Elin maintain her joy and stay focused on her purpose in life? She reads a Scripture text each day from the booklet Examining the Scriptures Daily, published by Jehovah’s Witnesses. With the help of a magnifying glass, she also reads a portion of the Bible every day. Elin prepares for the weekly meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses, and although she is physically unable to attend them, she listens to recordings of these meetings. Regularly reading the Bible and Bible-based publications and not forsaking Christian meetings can help us live a full and purposeful life regardless of our age.​—Psalm 1:2; Hebrews 10:24, 25.

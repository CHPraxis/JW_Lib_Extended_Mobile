<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Book of Isaiah​—II</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">ISAIAH is faithfully carrying out his commission as a prophet. The pronouncements he has uttered against the ten-tribe kingdom of Israel have already come true. Now he has further word about the future of Jerusalem.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The city of Jerusalem will be destroyed, and its inhabitants will be taken captive. The desolation, though, will not be permanent. After a time, true worship will be restored. This is the basic message of <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:36:1-23:66:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 36:1–66:24</a>.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> We stand to benefit from considering what is stated in these chapters because many of the prophecies in this section are having their major, or final, fulfillment in our day or will be fulfilled in the near future. This part of the book of Isaiah also contains exciting prophecies concerning the Messiah.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>“LOOK! DAYS ARE COMING”</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:36:1-23:39:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b"><strong>Isaiah 36:1–39:8</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In the 14th year of King Hezekiah’s reign (732 B.C.E.), the Assyrians invade Judah. Jehovah promises to defend Jerusalem. The threat of invasion ends when Jehovah’s angel single-handedly kills 185,000 Assyrian soldiers.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Hezekiah falls sick. Jehovah answers his prayer and heals him, adding 15 years to his life. When the king of Babylon sends emissaries to congratulate him, Hezekiah unwisely shows them all his treasures. Isaiah delivers Jehovah’s message to Hezekiah, saying: “Look! Days are coming, and all that is in your own house and that your forefathers have stored up down to this day will actually be carried to Babylon.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:39:5-23:39:6" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Isaiah 39:5, 6</a>) A little over 100 years later, the prophecy comes true.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:38:8-23:38:8" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>38:8</strong></a>​<strong>—What were “the steps” on which the shadow was made to recede? </strong>Since sundials were in use both in Egypt and in Babylon by the eighth century B.C.E., these steps could refer to the degrees of a sundial that Hezekiah’s father, Ahaz, might have acquired. Or there might have been a staircase inside the palace. A column alongside the stairs perhaps gradually cast a shadow on the steps, which could serve to measure time.</p>

Upon learning that his sickness would prove fatal, Hezekiah had concerns that went beyond himself. What weighed more heavily on his mind was what his dying heirless would mean for the Davidic line of kings. He was also concerned about who would lead the fight against the Assyrians. Like Hezekiah, we consider the sanctification of Jehovah’s name and the outworking of his purpose more important than our own salvation.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Immediately after foretelling the destruction of Jerusalem and the resulting captivity in Babylon, Isaiah prophesies about restoration. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:40:1-23:40:2" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Isaiah 40:1, 2</a>) “She [Jerusalem] will be rebuilt,” states <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:44:28-23:44:28" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Isaiah 44:28</a>.

They were reminded that Babylon was not beyond the reach of the Creator of the earth, who does not tire out or grow weary.</p>

Rather, Jehovah wanted them to praise him on the basis of “something new” that they would experience themselves, such as their safe journey to Jerusalem, perhaps by a more direct desert route. “A great crowd” who come out of “the great tribulation” will also have new and personal reasons to glorify Jehovah.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:9" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:14-66:7:14" data-bid="21-2" class="b"> 14</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Book of Daniel</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“THE book of Daniel is one of the most intriguing works in the Bible,” states the <em>Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary. </em>“Timeless truths fill its pages.” Daniel’s account begins in 618 B.C.E. when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon comes to Jerusalem and lays siege to the city, and he takes “some of the sons of Israel” into captivity in Babylon. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:1:1-27:1:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Daniel 1:1-3</a>) Among them is young Daniel, probably only in his teens. The book concludes with Daniel still in Babylon. Now almost 100 years old, Daniel receives God’s promise: “You will rest, but you will stand up for your lot at the end of the days.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:12:13-27:12:13" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Daniel 12:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">While the first part of the book of Daniel is presented chronologically in the third person, the last part is written in the first person. Penned by Daniel, the book contains prophecies regarding the rise and fall of world powers, the time of the Messiah’s arrival, and events that take place in our day.<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span> The aged prophet also looks back on his long life and narrates episodes that encourage us to be godly men and women of integrity. The message of Daniel is alive and exerts power.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:4:12-58:4:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Hebrews 4:12</a>.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>WHAT DOES THE CHRONOLOGICAL ACCOUNT TEACH US?</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:1:1-27:6:28" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>Daniel 1:1–6:28</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">The year is 617 B.C.E. Daniel and three young friends, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, are in the Babylonian court. During their three years of training in court life, the youths maintain their integrity to God. About eight years later, King Nebuchadnezzar has a mysterious dream. Daniel makes known the dream and then interprets it. The king acknowledges that Jehovah is “a God of gods and a Lord of kings and a Revealer of secrets.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:2:47-27:2:47" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Daniel 2:47</a>) Before long, though, Nebuchadnezzar seems to forget this lesson. When Daniel’s three friends refuse to worship a giant image, the king has them thrown into a fiery furnace. The true God rescues the three, and Nebuchadnezzar is forced to recognize that “there does not exist another god that is able to deliver like this one.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:3:29-27:3:29" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Daniel 3:29</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Nebuchadnezzar has another significant dream. He sees an immense tree, which is chopped down and restrained from growing. Daniel makes known the interpretation of that dream. The dream is fulfilled in part when Nebuchadnezzar becomes insane and then recovers. Many decades later, King Belshazzar holds a big feast for his grandees and disrespectfully uses vessels <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>that were taken from Jehovah’s temple. That very night, Belshazzar is killed and Darius the Mede receives the kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:5:30-27:5:31" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Daniel 5:30, 31</a>) In the days of Darius, when Daniel is more than 90 years old, the aged prophet becomes the target of a murderous scheme by jealous officials. But Jehovah rescues him “from the paw of the lions.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:6:27-27:6:27" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Daniel 6:27</a>.</p>

No diet can produce such changes in a mere ten days.

The second year of his reign would thus have begun in 623 B.C.E.<wbr />—years before he invaded Judah. At that early date, Daniel would not have been in Babylon to interpret the dream. “The second year” is evidently counted from 607 B.C.E., when the Babylonian king destroyed Jerusalem and became a world ruler.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:2:32-27:2:32" data-bid="12-1" class="b"><strong>2:32,</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:2:39-27:2:39" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> <strong>39</strong></a><wbr /><strong>—In what way was the kingdom of silver inferior to the head of gold, and how was the kingdom of copper inferior to that of silver? </strong>The Medo-Persian Empire, represented by the silver part of the image, was inferior to Babylon, the head of gold, in that it did not have the distinction of toppling Judah. The power that followed was Greece, represented by the copper. Greece was inferior still, even as copper is inferior to silver. Though the Grecian Empire covered a vaster area, it did not have the privilege of releasing God’s people from exile as did Medo-Persia.</p>

Since the rulership extended “to the extremity of the earth,” however, the tree must signify something far grander. <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:4:17-27:4:17" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Daniel 4:17</a> connects the dream to the rulership of “the Most High” over mankind. The tree, then, also symbolized Jehovah’s universal sovereignty, especially with respect to the earth. Therefore, the dream has two fulfillments<wbr />—in Nebuchadnezzar’s rulership and in Jehovah’s sovereignty.</p>

In the greater fulfillment, the “seven times” are 2,520 <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>years.

That is why the conspirators came up with the idea of an edict restricting prayer. Any change in Daniel’s routine with regard to prayer might have seemed to others to be a compromise and could have indicated a failure in his rendering exclusive devotion to Jehovah.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sn"><strong>Lessons for Us:</strong></p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:1:3-27:1:8" data-bid="21-1" class="b"><strong>1:3-8</strong></a><strong>. </strong>The determination of Daniel and his companions to remain loyal to Jehovah speaks volumes about the value of the parental training they must have received. When God-fearing parents put spiritual interests first in their lives and teach their offspring to do the same, their children are very likely to resist whatever temptations and pressures that may arise at school or elsewhere.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:1:10-27:1:12" data-bid="22-1" class="b"><strong>1:10-12</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Daniel understood why “the principal court official” feared the king and did not press matters with him. However, Daniel later approached “the guardian,” who may have been in a position to be more lenient. When dealing with difficult situations, we should act with similar insight, understanding, and wisdom.</p>

We too should strive to be “faithful in all things.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/54:3:11-54:3:11" data-bid="25-1" class="b">1 Timothy 3:11</a>.</p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" class="sb">When Daniel receives his first dream vision in 553 B.C.E., he is in his 70’s. Daniel beholds four huge beasts that portray a succession of world powers from his day to ours. In a vision of a scene in heaven, he sees “someone like a son of man” given “indefinitely lasting rulership.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:7:13-27:7:14" data-bid="31-1" class="b">Daniel 7:13, 14</a>) Two years later, Daniel has a vision that involves Medo-Persia, Greece, and an entity that becomes “a king fierce in countenance.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:8:23-27:8:23" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Daniel 8:23</a>.</p>
<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sb">The year is now 539 B.C.E. Babylon has fallen, and Darius the Mede has become ruler over the kingdom of the Chaldeans. Daniel prays to Jehovah about the restoration of his homeland. While he is still praying, Jehovah sends the angel Gabriel to make Daniel “have insight with understanding” about the coming of the Messiah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:9:20-27:9:25" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Daniel 9:20-25</a>) Time moves on to 536/535 B.C.E. A remnant has returned to Jerusalem. But there is opposition to the temple-building work. This becomes a source of anxiety to Daniel. He makes it a matter of prayer, and Jehovah sends an angel of high rank to Daniel. After strengthening and encouraging Daniel, the angel relates the prophecy that outlines a struggle for supremacy between the king <span id="page20" class="pageNum" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>of the north and the king of the south. The conflict between the two kings stretches from the time when the kingdom of Alexander the Great is divided among his four generals to the time when the Great Prince, Michael, “will stand up.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/27:12:1-27:12:1" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Daniel 12:1</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Repeatedly, the Bible encourages worshippers of God to give thanks. “It is good,” says <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:92:1-19:92:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 92:1</a>, “to give thanks to Jehovah.” The apostle Paul likewise admonished: “Show yourselves thankful.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:3:15-51:3:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Colossians 3:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">There is good reason to be thankful. Professor Robert Emmons, of the University of California at Davis, says: “Gratitude research is beginning to suggest that feelings of thankfulness have tremendous positive value in helping people cope with daily problems, especially stress, and to achieve a positive sense of self.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><em>Time </em>magazine points out something else: “People who describe themselves as feeling grateful . . . tend to have higher vitality and more optimism, suffer less stress, and experience fewer episodes of clinical depression than the population as a whole.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Sadly, however, the Bible foretold that “in the last days,” many people would show themselves to be “lovers of themselves” and “unthankful.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-5</a>) How can true Christians avoid being caught up in this spirit? Says the Bible’s Author: “I, Jehovah, am your God, the One teaching you to benefit yourself, the One causing you to tread in the way in which you should walk.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:48:17-23:48:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Isaiah 48:17</a>) By heeding God’s laws, we are spared much of the misery that comes to those who are caught up in selfish pursuits. In addition, we have the assurance that Jehovah sees our efforts and will reward us accordingly. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:6:10-58:6:10" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Hebrews 6:10</a>) Such benefits move us to “give thanks to Jehovah.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:107:8-19:107:8" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Psalm 107:8</a>.</p>

It Helped With a School Report
A vocational school in Germany has a large number of foreign students. They are from France, Georgia, India, Lebanon, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Ukraine, Vietnam, and the former Yugoslavia.
One of the students writes: “When the opportunity arose to give a school report, I volunteered to do so. The subject I chose was ‘Practical Answers to Questions Young People Ask,’ basing it on the book Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work. The students were impressed by the subjects included in the book and the good suggestions it provided.
“When I finished, the students showed appreciation by loud applause. Since all of them are studying languages and understand English well, I was able to leave 30 English copies of the Young People Ask book with them, and I also provided the teacher with a copy in German.”
In the days that followed, this student continued her discussions with some of her fellow students, and they responded with interest. She left them additional Bible-based literature in Arabic, Bengali, Georgian, Polish, Russian, Spanish, and Vietnamese.
Perhaps you know of a youth who would benefit from the Young People Ask book. Its 39 chapters include: “How Can I Make Real Friends?,” “What About Sex Before Marriage?,” and “How Do I Know If It’s Real Love?” You may request a copy by filling in the accompanying coupon and mailing it to the address shown on the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A vocational school in Germany has a large number of foreign students. They are from France, Georgia, India, Lebanon, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Ukraine, Vietnam, and the former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One of the students writes: “When the opportunity arose to give a school report, I volunteered to do so. The subject I chose was ‘Practical Answers to Questions Young People Ask,’ basing it on the book <em>Questions Young People Ask<wbr />—Answers That Work. </em>The students were impressed by the subjects included in the book and the good suggestions it provided.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“When I finished, the students showed appreciation by loud applause. Since all of them are studying languages and understand English well, I was able to leave 30 English copies of the <em>Young People Ask </em>book with them, and I also provided the teacher with a copy in German.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">In the days that followed, this student continued her discussions with some of her fellow students, and they responded with interest. She left them additional Bible-based literature in Arabic, Bengali, Georgian, Polish, Russian, Spanish, and Vietnamese.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Perhaps you know of a youth who would benefit from the <em>Young People Ask </em>book. Its 39 chapters include: “How Can I Make Real Friends?,” “What About Sex Before Marriage?,” and “How Do I Know If It’s Real Love?” You may request a copy by filling in the accompanying coupon and mailing it to the address shown on the coupon or to an appropriate address listed on page 5 of this magazine.</p>

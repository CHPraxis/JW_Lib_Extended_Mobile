<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><span id="page2" class="pageNum" data-no="2" data-before-text="2"></span><strong>“The Great Day of Jehovah Is Near.”​—</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:1:14-36:1:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Zeph. 1:14</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">In the days of Judaean King Josiah, the prophet Zephaniah proclaimed a powerful message: Jehovah’s day of judgment was coming, and it was near. Though the wicked would be “cut off,” those seeking Jehovah, righteousness, and meekness would be “concealed in the day of Jehovah’s anger.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:1:3-36:1:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Zeph. 1:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/36:2:3-36:2:3" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 2:3</a>) That day arrived in 607 B.C.E., and it came with fury upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">We boldly declare a similar message, one that warns the wicked and comforts the righteous: Soon Jehovah will eradicate both the wicked and wickedness. As you will see in the Worldwide Report, this message is being proclaimed as never before​—evidence that Jehovah’s day is near indeed. May our yeartext for 2007 remind us of where we are in the stream of time, and may it encourage us to remain ever faithful to our magnificent God, Jehovah.</p>

A Letter From the Governing Body
FOLLOWING Jesus’ example, we pray earnestly to God: “Let your name be sanctified.” Our strong desire to live in harmony with that prayer is made manifest by the way we live our lives as Jehovah’s Witnesses. Of course, much more is required of us than simply knowing God’s name. We must take advantage of every opportunity to glorify that name. Indeed, the greatest honor that any of us could enjoy is that of being called one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.​—Matt. 6:9; Isa. 43:10.
In keeping with Psalm 110:3, Jehovah’s people are willingly engaging in the work that Jehovah has decreed must be done. Why are people of all ages and backgrounds expending themselves in the preaching work? Primarily, it is because of their love for God and their personal devotion to him. Deuteronomy 6:5, 6 commands us to love Jehovah with ‘all our heart, soul, and vital force.’ This heartfelt love moves us to use our time, energies, and resources to advance the interests of God’s Kingdom, which includes sharing in the ministry as fully as our circumstances allow.
Jehovah’s love for mankind is behind his direction to have the good news of his Kingdom declared throughout the earth. He does not want any to be destroyed but desires all to repent of their wayward course and turn to their Creator with life in view. (2 Pet. 3:9) “I take delight,” Jehovah says, “not in the death of the wicked one, but in that someone wicked turns back from his way and actually keeps living.” (Ezek. 33:11) When we are engaging in the ministry, we are visible proof of Jehovah’s love for our fellow humans. This fact, no doubt, contributes to the joy and satisfaction we experience when we share in this important work.
Our deep love for Jehovah is also reflected in our view of his inspired Word, the Holy Scriptures. Without the Bible, we would not have come to know God and to draw close to him, as James 4:8 invites us to do. Nor would we know why we are here and what the future holds. We would not know that our common ancestor Adam is the source of our problems. (Rom. 5:12) Neither would we know of God’s great love in providing his only-begotten Son as a ransom for us. In many other ways, Jehovah is sharing a measure of his knowledge, wisdom, and understanding with us. How we treasure the gift he has given us, his spirit-inspired Word! Our appreciation for this wonderful gift moves us to ‘buy out time’ to read, study, and meditate on his sayings. (Eph. 5:15, 16; Ps. 1:1-3) We should never begrudge the time it takes to read God’s Word daily. Rather, our love for God should draw us to his Word, enabling us to increase our understanding of him and deepen our love for him.
We have learned from the Bible that when Adam sinned against Jehovah, he brought all of his future offspring, including each one of us, into a deplorable, hopeless situation. However, God could and did provide a way out for mankind, taking steps to ensure that his purpose toward this earth would be realized.​—Gen. 3:15.
No doubt every one of us has a strong desire to sanctify the marvelous name of our God. As we increase in knowledge of what a wonderful God Jehovah is, we are moved to cooperate with him and his organization in making his grand name and purpose known. We are assured of his favor and blessing now and of an endless future in the new world.
We members of the Governing Body wish to confirm our love for you dear brothers and sisters. We would also like to express our deep appreciation for your diligent efforts to use the remaining time before “the great tribulation” to reach as many people as possible with the good news. (Rev. 7:14) By doing so, you give them the same opportunity that you have received, that of taking in the knowledge of God and of Christ that leads to everlasting life.​—John 17:3.
Your brothers,
Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses

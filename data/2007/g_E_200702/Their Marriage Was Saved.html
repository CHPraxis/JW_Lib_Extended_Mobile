<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In South Africa an employer noted that Bella, one of her employees, was having marital problems. So the employer asked Thandi, one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, to speak with Bella. Thandi learned that Bella had decided to divorce her husband.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Thandi gave Bella two copies of the book <em>The Secret of Family Happiness </em>and encouraged her to give one to her husband. Bella did. A week later Thandi learned that Bella’s husband was reading the book and that their family life had improved. Three months later Bella told Thandi that God had saved their marriage by means of prayer and the <em>Family Happiness </em>book. Yet, that was not the end of the experience.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">When Bella’s employer heard what had happened, she recommended that all staff members obtain the book. Eventually, well over a hundred copies of the 192-page <em>Family Happiness </em>book were provided for employees of the company. Among the book’s instructive chapters are “If Marriage Is at the Breaking Point,” “Protect Your Family From Destructive Influences,” and “Maintain Peace in Your Household.”</p>

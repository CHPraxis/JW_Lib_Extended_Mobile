<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">IN RECENT years, pledges of virginity or abstinence, such as “No sex until marriage,” have become popular among youths. These pledges reflect commendable goals and are in harmony with Bible commands. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:6:18-46:6:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 6:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:5:5-49:5:5" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> Ephesians 5:5</a>) However, their effectiveness is debatable. According to one survey, about 60 percent of teens broke their pledge within a year.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In addition, there is concern over just how some youths define “abstinence” and “virginity.” Charlene C. Giannetti and Margaret Sagarese wrote in their book <em>Boy Crazy!: </em>“The rise of oral sex, even anal sex, has been linked by experts to kids wanting to stay ‘technically’ virgins. They decide anything that’s not intercourse isn’t sex.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Evidently, that view is widespread. After interviewing more than a thousand teenagers, one author said: “It seemed like maybe one or two in a hundred considered oral sex to be sex.” He added: “You should realize that’s probably how your teen<wbr />—and probably even your preteen—<wbr />thinks.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Those who adhere to Bible standards realize that oral sex and anal sex are<wbr />—as their very names make clear—<wbr /><em>sex. </em>The Bible command to “abstain from fornication” (“be . . . completely free from sexual immorality,” <em>Today’s English Version</em>) includes all forms of illicit sexual relations.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/52:4:3-52:4:3" data-bid="2-1" class="b">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a>.</p>

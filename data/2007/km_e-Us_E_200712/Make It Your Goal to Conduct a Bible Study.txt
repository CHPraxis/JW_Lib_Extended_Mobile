Make It Your Goal to Conduct a Bible Study
1 “Lift up your eyes and view the fields, that they are white for harvesting.” (John 4:35) Those words spoken by Jesus Christ are certainly applicable to the situation Christian ministers face today.
2 Honesthearted people desirous of being taught the ways of Jehovah are still being found. This is evident in the number of new disciples being baptized each year. If you are genuinely interested in conducting a Bible study, what might you do?
3 Set a Goal: First, set a goal to start and conduct a regular Bible study. Keep your goal in mind while engaging in the field ministry. Since our Christian commission involves teaching, along with preaching, all of us should seek to have an increased share in the Bible study work.​—Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20.
4 Other Points to Keep in Mind: Heartfelt prayer is a must for Kingdom publishers. At times we find people who have prayed for spiritual assistance. What a blessing it is to be used by Jehovah to find and teach such ones!​—Hag. 2:7; Acts 10:1, 2.
5 A sister prayed for a Bible study and then displayed copies of the tract Would You Like to Know More About the Bible? at her place of work. When a woman picked up one of the tracts, read it through, and began to fill out the coupon, the sister spoke to her and was able to start a Bible study.
6 Fellow publishers who are effective in starting and conducting Bible studies can help you to reach your goal to conduct a Bible study. Prayerfully look for one, and take advantage of all the assistance available to reach this goal. Perhaps soon you will experience the joy of conducting a Bible study.

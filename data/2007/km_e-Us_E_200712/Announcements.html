<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ Please note that the Memorial for the year <strong>2009 </strong>will be on Thursday, April 9, after sundown. This advance notice is given so that brothers may make necessary reservations or contracts for available halls when there are several congregations using the Kingdom Hall and other facilities must be found. In such instances, the elders should have an agreement with the management ensuring that there will be no disturbances by other activities in the building so that the Memorial observance can proceed in a peaceful and orderly manner.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ As a reminder, all congregations should notify the branch office of their meeting times as they will be on January 1. If this has not been done, the congregation secretary should immediately do so by using the Web site www.jw.org or, if that is not possible, by submitting a <em>Congregation Meeting Information </em>(S-5) form.</p>

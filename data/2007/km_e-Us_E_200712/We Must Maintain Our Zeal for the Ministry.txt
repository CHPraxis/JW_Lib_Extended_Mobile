We Must Maintain Our Zeal for the Ministry
1 Each year since 1992, Jehovah’s Witnesses have zealously devoted more than one billion hours to the worldwide Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work. How happy we are to have had a small share in such a marvelous accomplishment!​—Matt. 28:19, 20.
2 Of course, all thanks and praise belong to Jehovah, who has sustained us in our ministry during these “critical times.” (2 Tim. 3:1) What is required on our part if we are to continue having a zealous share in this important work?
3 Basis for Zeal: Deep love for God and neighbor, as well as a heartfelt desire to live up to our dedication, motivates us in our Kingdom service. (Matt. 22:37-39; 1 John 5:3) Love moves us to make sacrifices so that we can have a full share in the preaching work.​—Luke 9:23.
4 Work to Maintain Zeal: Our adversary the Devil makes every effort to dampen our zeal for the ministry. The apathy of those in our territory, the distractions of this world, the pressures of daily living, and concern over our own diminishing health are just a few of the things that he uses in an attempt to discourage us.
5 Therefore, we must work hard to keep our zeal alive. It is important for us to cultivate “the love [we] had at first.” That involves regularly reading and meditating on God’s Word, the Bible, and availing ourselves of all the spiritual provisions of “the faithful and discreet slave.”​—Rev. 2:4; Matt. 24:45; Ps. 119:97.
6 As Bible prophecies clearly indicate, Jehovah’s day for the destruction of ungodly men is fast approaching. (2 Pet. 2:3; 3:10) With that clearly in mind, let us work hard at maintaining our zeal for the ministry, having a full share in the worldwide Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work now under way!

“During the holiday season, many try to show kindness and compassion. Do you think that the world would be a better place if people showed compassion all year round? [Allow for response. Then read 1 Peter 3:8.] This magazine explains the value of compassion and mentions some practical ways we can demonstrate it.”

The Watchtower Jan. 1
“Many people pray for God’s Kingdom to come. For example, notice this famous prayer that Jesus taught his followers. [Read Matthew 6:9, 10.] Have you ever wondered what the Kingdom is and when it will come? [Allow for response.] This magazine shows what the Bible says on the matter.”
Awake! Jan.
“Throughout history women have suffered discrimination and violence. Why do you think that is? [Allow for response.] Notice how the Bible instructs husbands to treat their wives. [Read 1 Peter 3:7.] This magazine shows from the Bible how God and Christ view women.”

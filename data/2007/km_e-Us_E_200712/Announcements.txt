Announcements
▪ Literature offer for December: The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. As an alternative offer, you may use Draw Close to Jehovah or The Secret of Family Happiness. January: Keep on the Watch! Congregations that do not have a supply of such brochures may offer any 192-page book printed on paper that discolors or any book published prior to 1991 with the exception of Creation, Mankind’s Search for God, and Young People Ask. February: Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? As an alternative offer, you may use The Secret of Family Happiness. March: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Make a diligent effort to start Bible studies.
▪ Someone designated by the presiding overseer should audit the congregation’s accounts for the months of September, October, and November. The same person should not be used for consecutive audits. When the audit is complete, an announcement should be made to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.​—See Instructions for Congregation Accounting (S-27).
▪ Please note that the Memorial for the year 2009 will be on Thursday, April 9, after sundown. This advance notice is given so that brothers may make necessary reservations or contracts for available halls when there are several congregations using the Kingdom Hall and other facilities must be found. In such instances, the elders should have an agreement with the management ensuring that there will be no disturbances by other activities in the building so that the Memorial observance can proceed in a peaceful and orderly manner.
▪ As a reminder, all congregations should notify the branch office of their meeting times as they will be on January 1. If this has not been done, the congregation secretary should immediately do so by using the Web site www.jw.org or, if that is not possible, by submitting a Congregation Meeting Information (S-5) form.
▪ The branch facilities in Brooklyn, Patterson, and Wallkill, New York, will be closed on the following dates: March 8, 2008 (Gilead graduation); May 9-10, 2008 (spring cleaning); September 13, 2008 (Gilead graduation); and October 4, 2008 (annual meeting of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania). There will be no arrangements for tours or for congregations to pick up literature on those dates.

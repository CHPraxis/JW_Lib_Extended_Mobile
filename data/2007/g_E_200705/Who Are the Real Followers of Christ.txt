Who Are the Real Followers of Christ?
To find the answer to this thought-provoking question, you are cordially invited to attend the “FOLLOW THE CHRIST!” District Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses
Several hundred of these conventions will be held throughout the world beginning in May in the United States. To find the location nearest you, contact Jehovah’s Witnesses in your area or write to the publishers of this magazine. The March 1, 2007, issue of our companion magazine, The Watchtower, lists convention locations in the United States and Canada.

Announcements
▪ Literature offer for July: Keep on the Watch! Where genuine interest is shown, offer the Bible Teach book, making a diligent effort to start Bible studies. August: Worship the Only True God. If a Bible study is started, it is recommended that the Bible Teach book be studied before the Worship God book. September: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Make a special effort to start Bible studies on the initial call. When householders already have this publication, show how they can benefit from it by briefly demonstrating a Bible study. October: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Where interest is shown, offer the tract Would You Like to Know More About the Bible? with the objective of starting a Bible study.
▪ Since September has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.
▪ Starting in September, circuit overseers will give the public talk entitled “What Marks the Bible as Authentic?”
▪ It is recommended that applications for regular pioneer service be submitted to the branch office at least 30 days before the requested start date. The congregation secretary should review the forms to make sure that they are complete. If applicants cannot recall the exact date of their baptism, they should estimate the date and keep a record of it. The secretary should note this date on the Congregation’s Publisher Record (S-21) card.
▪ The annual inventory of all literature and magazines on hand should be taken on or as close to August 31, 2007, as possible. This inventory is similar to the actual count taken monthly by the literature coordinator, and the totals should be entered on the Literature Inventory (S-18) form. The total number of magazines on hand should be obtained from the magazine servant(s). The secretary of the coordinating congregation should supervise the inventory. He and the presiding overseer of the coordinating congregation will sign the form. Each coordinating congregation will receive three Literature Inventory forms. Please mail the original to the branch office no later than September 6. Keep a copy for your files. The third form may be used as a work sheet.
▪ The branch office does not fill individual publishers’ requests for literature. The presiding overseer should arrange for an announcement to be made each month before the congregation monthly request for literature is sent to the branch so that all interested in obtaining personal literature items may advise the brother handling literature. Please keep in mind which publications are special-request items.

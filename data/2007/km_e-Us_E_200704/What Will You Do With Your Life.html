<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Children are sometimes asked, “What do you want to be when you grow up?” When you were a small boy, would you have said that you wanted to be a cowboy? a fireman? a circuit overseer? Or as a little girl, would you have said that you wanted to be a ballerina? a nurse? a missionary? Now that you are older, you must ask yourself another question, ‘What will I do with my life?’ Are you ready to decide?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>To help you make the best possible decision, Jehovah’s organization produced the DVD <em>Young People Ask​—What Will I Do With My Life? </em>Please watch it, and give serious thought to all that it contains, including the drama, interviews, and supplementary material. The contents are outlined in the box “Main Menu.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup><strong>The Drama: </strong>As you watch the drama, consider these questions: <strong>(1) </strong>What similarities are there between Timothy, who is spoken of in the Christian Greek Scriptures, and Andre?

When making return visits on interested people, including those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on starting Bible studies using the <em>Bible Teach </em>book. <strong>June: </strong><em>Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? </em>As an alternative offer, you may use <em>The Secret of Family Happiness</em>. <strong>July: </strong><em>Keep on the Watch! </em>Where genuine interest is shown, offer the <em>Bible Teach </em>book, making a diligent effort to start Bible studies.</p>

Before sending regular pioneer application forms to the branch office, make sure they are completely filled out.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ It is necessary for the branch office to maintain an up-to-date record of addresses and telephone numbers for all presiding overseers and secretaries. If there is a change at any time, the Congregation Service Committee should complete, sign, and send a <em>Presiding Overseer/​Secretary Change of Address </em>(S-29) form to the branch office promptly. This includes any changes in telephone area codes.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ Whenever personal travel plans include attending congregation meetings, an assembly, or a district convention in another land, your request for information regarding dates, times, and locations must be directed to the branch office that oversees the work in that land. Addresses of branch offices are listed on the last page of the current <em>Yearbook.</em></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ U.S. Selective Service regulations require that all men under the age of 26 who are (1) citizens and have reached 18 years of age or (2) noncitizens who move to the United States must register within 30 days. From the time a man registers until he turns 26, he must notify Selective Service within ten days of any change of address. Compliance with this law is a Christian’s obligation to the superior authorities. Elders should remind those to whom this applies or will soon apply of their duty to register.</p>

Entrusted With a Treasure
1 The apostle Paul valued his God-given commission to preach and referred to it as a “treasure.” (2 Cor. 4:7) He endured hardships and persecution in carrying out that commission. He tirelessly preached to anyone who happened to be on hand. He traveled many difficult and dangerous miles by land and by sea. How can we imitate Paul and show that we cherish our ministry? (Rom. 11:13) What makes our ministry an incomparable treasure?
2 A Superior Treasure: Earthly treasures are often accompanied by much heartache and yield only limited or temporary benefits. On the other hand, our ministry brings lasting benefits to us and to others. (1 Tim. 4:16) It helps sincere people come to know Jehovah, make needed changes in their lives, and gain a real hope of everlasting life. (Rom. 10:13-15) By highly esteeming our ministry, we acquire a satisfying purpose in life, a lasting sense of accomplishment, and an uplifting hope for the future.​—1 Cor. 15:58.
3 Demonstrate That You Value Your Treasure: The value we place on something is often demonstrated by what we are willing to spend for it. What a privilege it is to spend our time and energy praising Jehovah! (Eph. 5:16, 17) The way we spend our time should show that we place more value on spiritual things than on material pursuits. Since we have something so precious to share, we will want to preach with enthusiasm and to be alert to tell the good news at every opportunity.
4 Priceless treasures are usually not hidden but are exhibited for others to enjoy. If we view our ministry as a treasure, it will be a prominent part of our life. (Matt. 5:14-16) With hearts full of appreciation, may we always imitate the apostle Paul and take advantage of every opportunity to show that we truly value our ministry, esteeming it as a treasure.

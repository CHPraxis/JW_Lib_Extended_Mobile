Announcements
▪ Literature offer for February: Draw Close to Jehovah. If this publication is not available, you may use the Worship God book. March: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Make a special effort to start Bible studies. April and May: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. When making return visits on interested people, including those who attended the Memorial or other theocratic events but who are not actively associated with the congregation, concentrate on starting Bible studies using the Bible Teach book.
▪ The secretary and the service overseer should review the activity of all regular pioneers. If any are having difficulty meeting the hour requirement, the elders should arrange for assistance to be given. For suggestions, review the annual S-201 letters.
▪ The special public talk for the 2007 Memorial season is entitled “You Can Feel Safe in This Troubled World!” See the related announcement in the October 2006 Our Kingdom Ministry.
▪ A packet of legal material is available to assist publishers who are involved in lawsuits over child custody and visitation matters in which our religion is under attack. The packet should be requested by the body of elders only in a case in which it is evident that the publisher’s religious beliefs will be at issue. For those facing secular issues on child custody or visitation, helpful information can be found in Awake! of December 8, 1997, pages 3-12; in Awake! of October 22, 1988, pages 2-14; and on the chart found in Awake! of April 22, 1991, page 9.
▪ For those who wish to make donations to the worldwide work electronically, a set of instructions is available to explain this arrangement. For further information, call (718) 560-5000 or write to Watchtower, Attn: Treasurer’s Office, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York 11201-2483.

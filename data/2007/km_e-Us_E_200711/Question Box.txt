Question Box
â–ª Is it appropriate to affix our personal e-mail address to literature that we distribute?
By means of a stamp or a printed label, some publishers have affixed their personal e-mail address to the magazines or tracts that they place with others. Those who accept the literature are then able to contact the publisher to request additional information. Such efforts to help interested ones are well-intentioned. However, our official Web site is already indicated on the back of the magazines and tracts. Therefore, it is best if we do not affix a personal e-mail address to the literature.
Whether a publisher provides people in the territory with contact information on a separate piece of paper, especially when making return visits, is a personal decision. We should take the initiative to call back on those who are interested instead of just leaving it up to them to contact us for more information. Genuine personal interest can be more readily manifested when speaking with the person face to face.

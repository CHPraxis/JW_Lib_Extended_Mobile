<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>November: </strong><em>Learn From the Great Teacher</em>. If individuals say they have no children, offer the brochure <em>Keep on the Watch! </em><strong>December: </strong><em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. </em>As an alternative offer, you may use <em>Draw Close to Jehovah </em>or <em>The Secret of Family Happiness</em>. <strong>January: </strong><em>Keep on the Watch! </em>Congregations that do not have a supply of such brochures may offer any 192-page book printed on paper that discolors or any book published prior to 1991 with the exception of <em>Creation, Mankind’s Search for God </em>and <em>Young People Ask</em>. <strong>February: </strong><em>Is There a Creator Who Cares About You? </em>As an alternative offer, you may use <em>The Secret of Family Happiness</em>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">▪ Since December has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">▪ A number of Bible-based publications are available that have been designed to give a witness to people of various cultural and religious backgrounds. The literature servant has a list of these helpful publications.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">▪ Donations for the worldwide work that are made by check at district conventions and those sent to the branch office should be made payable to “Watch Tower.” The branch office’s financial address is Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, c/​o Treasurer’s Office, 25 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201-2483.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ If not already prepared, all publishers are urged to complete a durable power of attorney (DPA) card. This DPA card protects your right to refuse blood transfusions. Elders will provide personal assistance as needed.​—See the November 2006 <em>Our Kingdom Ministry </em>insert.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">▪ Publishers no longer need to submit a <em>Study Report </em>(S-3) for each home Bible study conducted during the month. However, they should continue to indicate the number of different Bible studies conducted in the appropriate column of the <em>Field Service Report </em>(S-4). Effective immediately, the S-3 form will be used exclusively to record congregation meeting attendance.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">▪ If you are admitted to a hospital and want visiting local elders and, in larger cities, elders serving on a Patient Visitation Group to have access to your name, what must you do? When identifying yourself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, you should also explain that you are willing to have a minister of Jehovah’s Witnesses visit you. A federal law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), protects your privacy, but with your consent, the law allows for the elders to learn of your admission and provide spiritual encouragement.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">▪ The secretary of each congregation holding title to property should review paragraphs 42-4 in the form entitled <em>Information Regarding Ownership of Kingdom Halls </em>(TO-36). Even after real-estate tax exemption has been obtained, an annual filing is required in some states. Check carefully with your local tax assessor’s office to confirm whether any action is required. All taxes and assessments are to be paid within the time provided. If any tax or assessment is questioned, promptly follow through on the matter so that either it is removed or a proper challenge is filed within the applicable time limit.</p>

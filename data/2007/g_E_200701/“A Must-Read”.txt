“A Must-Read”
That is what a professor of physics in the United States said about Is There a Creator Who Cares About You?a He wrote: “The book deals with some of the most outstanding puzzles in astrophysics, molecular biology, and human anatomy, which are hard to explain by chance. . . . A consideration of the examples and arguments presented in the book will be valuable regardless of whether one is inclined to accept evolution or creation.”
A woman wrote: “I really do not have words to express how deeply this little book has affected me. I could not put the book down, as each page described further unfolding discoveries about our universe that scientists have brought to light. I really learned so much!”
Other things that impressed her about the book were the discussions of the four fundamental physical forces and of the uniqueness of humans compared with animals.
Do you ever wonder if there is solid scientific evidence that points to the existence of a Creator? If a Creator does exist, does he really care about us? You will find answers to such questions in this fascinating 192-page book.

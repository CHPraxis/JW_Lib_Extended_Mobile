<div class="openingContent"><p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“Trust not to rotten planks,” wrote English dramatist William Shakespeare. Indeed, before stepping onto the wooden planks of a boat, you would want to be sure that the wood was not rotten.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE words of Shakespeare echo the sentiments of wise King Solomon of ancient Israel, who some 3,000 years ago wrote: “A fool will believe anything; smart people watch their step.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:14:15-20:14:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Proverbs 14:15</a>, <em>Today’s English Version</em>) Yes, only a fool would go through life blindly accepting everything he hears, basing his decisions and actions on frivolous advice or baseless teachings. Misplacing our trust<wbr />—like stepping onto rotten planks—<wbr />can lead to disaster. You may wonder, ‘Is there any source of guidance that <em>is </em>worthy of our trust?’</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Millions of people the world over place their full trust in an ancient book called the Holy Bible. They look to this book to direct their steps. They base their decisions on its advice and pattern their actions after its teachings. Are such individuals stepping, as it were, onto rotten planks? The answer to that question depends greatly on the answer to another question, Are there sound reasons to trust the Bible? This special issue of <em>Awake! </em>examines the evidence.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The purpose of this issue of <em>Awake! </em>is not to impose religious beliefs or views on you. Rather, it is intended simply to present the compelling evidence that has convinced millions that the Bible is worthy of their trust. After reading the articles that follow, you can decide for yourself whether the Bible merits your trust.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">This subject deserves more than your passing interest. After all, if the Bible is, indeed, a trustworthy source of guidance from our Creator, then you owe it to yourself and your loved ones to consider what the Bible has to say.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">First, though, let us mention some outstanding facts about the Bible. At the very least, it is truly a unique book.</p>

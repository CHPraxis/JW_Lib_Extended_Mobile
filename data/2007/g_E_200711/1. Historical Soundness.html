</header>
<div class="openingContent"><p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sa">It would be hard to trust a book that is found to contain inaccuracies. Imagine reading a modern history book that dated the second world war to the 1800’s or that called the president of the United States a king. Would such inaccuracies not raise questions in your mind about the overall reliability of the book?</p>

<p data-pid="5" class="p5 sb"> Bible critics questioned the existence of Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea who handed Jesus over to be impaled. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:27:1-40:27:26" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 27:1-26</a>) Evidence that Pilate was once ruler of Judea is etched on a stone discovered at the Mediterranean seaport city of Caesarea in 1961.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Before 1993, there was no proof outside the Bible to support the historicity of David, the brave young shepherd who later became king of Israel. That year, however, archaeologists uncovered in northern Israel a basalt stone, dated to the ninth century B.C.E., that experts say bears the words “House of David” and “king of Israel.”</p>

<p data-pid="7" class="p7 sb"> Until recently, many scholars doubted the accuracy of the Bible’s account of the nation of Edom battling with Israel in the time of David. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/10:8:13-10:8:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">2 Samuel 8:13, 14</a>) Edom, they argued, was a simple pastoral society at the time and did not become sufficiently organized or have the might to threaten Israel until much later. However, recent excavations indicate that “Edom was a complex society centuries earlier [than previously thought], as reflected in the Bible,” states an article in the journal <em>Biblical Archaeology Review.</em></p>

<h2 class="inline" id="p8" data-pid="8"><strong>Proper titles.</strong></h2><div class="pGroup">
<p data-pid="8" class="p8 sb"> There were many rulers on the world stage during the 16 centuries that the Bible was being written. When the Bible refers to a ruler, it <em>always </em>uses the proper title. For example, it correctly refers to Herod Antipas as “district ruler” and Gallio as “proconsul.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:3:1-42:3:1" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Luke 3:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:18:12-44:18:12" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Acts 18:12</a>) <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/15:5:6-15:5:6" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Ezra 5:6</a> refers to Tattenai, the governor of the Persian province “beyond the River,” the Euphrates River. A coin produced in the fourth century B.C.E. contains a similar description, identifying the Persian governor Mazaeus as ruler of the province “Beyond the River.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Accuracy in seemingly minor details is no small matter. If we can trust the Bible writers in even small details, should that not bolster our confidence in the other things they wrote?</p>

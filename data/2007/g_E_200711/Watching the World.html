<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>Oldest Chinese Bible?</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">“The earliest record about a Chinese translation of the Hebrew Bible is found on a stone stele <strong>[left] </strong>dating back to 781 CE,” says scholar Yiyi Chen, of Peking University. The stone, erected by Nestorian Christians, came to light in the city of Xi’an in 1625. “The Chinese name of the stele is formally translated as ‘the Memorial of the Propagation in China of the Luminous Religion from Daqin’ (. . . Daqin being the Chinese term for the Roman Empire),” explains Chen. “Among the characters on the stele, we find Chinese expressions such as ‘real canon’ and ‘translating the Bible.’”</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="ss"><strong>Treasure From a Bog</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb">In 2006, workers digging in an Irish peat bog uncovered a book of Psalms, or Psalter, thought to date back to the eighth century C.E. The Latin manuscript, one of the few survivors of its era, is described as a treasure. The 100 or so vellum pages, in their original binding, are of lavish quality. “The remains of a layer of a concealing mat and a leather carrying-bag suggest that the psalter had been hidden deliberately, perhaps to keep it safe from a Viking raid 1,200 years ago,” says <em>The Times </em>of London. Although the pages are compacted and have partially rotted, experts are confident that they will be able to separate and conserve them.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>Truckloads of History</strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Reports say that archaeologists sifting through truckloads of soil from the site of Jerusalem’s temple have gathered thousands of artifacts dating from pre-Israelite times to the modern era. Among them was an arrowhead of the type used by the army of Nebuchadnezzar, who destroyed the first Jewish temple on that site. The most striking find is a clay seal dating to the seventh or sixth century B.C.E. that is said to bear the Hebrew name Gedalyahu Ben Immer Ha-Cohen. According to archaeologist Gabriel Barkai, its owner “may have been a brother of Pashur Ben Immer, described in the Bible [<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:20:1-24:20:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jeremiah 20:1</a>] as a priest and temple official.”</p>

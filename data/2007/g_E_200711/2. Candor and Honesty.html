<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">THE Bible writers were honest men who wrote with openness of heart. Their candor gives their writing the clear ring of truth.</p>

<h2 class="inline" id="p5" data-pid="5"><strong>Mistakes and shortcomings.</strong></h2><div class="pGroup">
<p data-pid="5" class="p5 sb"> The Bible writers openly admitted their own failures and weaknesses. Moses told of a mistake he made that cost him dearly. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:20:7-4:20:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Numbers 20:7-13</a>) Asaph explained that for a time he found himself envying the prosperous life of the wicked. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:73:1-19:73:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 73:1-14</a>) Jonah told of his disobedience and the bad attitude he initially had when God showed mercy to repentant sinners. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/32:1:1-32:1:3" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Jonah 1:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/32:3:10-32:3:10" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 3:10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/32:4:1-32:4:3" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> 4:1-3</a>) Matthew freely related that he had abandoned Jesus on the night of Jesus’ arrest.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:26:56-40:26:56" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matthew 26:56</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">The writers of the Hebrew Scriptures laid bare the repeated grumbling and rebellion of their own people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/14:36:15-14:36:16" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Chronicles 36:15, 16</a>) The writers spared no one, not even the rulers of their nation. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/26:34:1-26:34:10" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Ezekiel 34:1-10</a>) With similar candor, the letters of the apostles reported the serious problems experienced by individual Christians, including responsible ones, as well as by some congregations in the first century C.E.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:1:10-46:1:13" data-bid="7-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 1:10-13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:2:16-55:2:18" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 2 Timothy 2:16-18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:4:10-55:4:10" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 4:10</a>.</p>
<div class="stdCaption"><p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sc">Bible writers, such as Jonah, recorded their own mistakes</p>

<div id="section3" class="section">
<h2 class="inline" id="p7" data-pid="7"><strong>Unflattering truth.</strong></h2><div class="pGroup">
<p data-pid="7" class="p7 sb"> The Bible writers did not try to gloss over what some might have viewed as embarrassing truth. The first-century Christians frankly acknowledged that they were not admired by the world around them but were looked upon as foolish and ignoble. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:1:26-46:1:29" data-bid="8-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 1:26-29</a>) The writers noted that Jesus’ apostles were seen as “unlettered and ordinary.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:4:13-44:4:13" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 4:13</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">The Gospel writers did not color the facts in order to cast Jesus in a more favorable light. Rather, they reported honestly that he was born under humble circumstances into a working-class family, that he did not study at the prestigious schools of his day, and that the majority of his listeners rejected his message.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/40:27:25-40:27:25" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Matthew 27:25;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/42:2:4-42:2:7" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> Luke 2:4-7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:7:15-43:7:15" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> John 7:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Clearly, the Bible gives ample evidence that it is the product of honest writers. Does their honesty win your trust?</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">THAT question aroused the interest of a woman in the southwestern part of Central Asia. The question appeared on the cover of the January 22, 2004, issue of our companion magazine, <em>Awake! </em>The woman wrote to the publishers: “Right from the start, I was attracted to your journal, and it helped me to focus on good values. My view of life is becoming more positive. I am telling everybody about our God and the peace this knowledge brings.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">In many places, in fact “to the most distant part of the earth,” people are becoming acquainted with the divine name, Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:1:8-44:1:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 1:8</a>) For example, this name in the Turkmen language, <em>Yehowa, </em>can readily be found in the Turkmen translation of the Holy Scriptures. <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:8:1-19:8:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Psalm 8:1</a> reads: “Jehovah our Lord, how majestic your name is in all the earth!”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">In order to learn more about Jehovah God, the woman asked for a copy of the 32-page brochure <em>The Divine Name That Will Endure Forever. </em>You too may request this brochure from one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</p>

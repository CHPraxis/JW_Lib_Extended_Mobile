<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Have you appreciated reading the recent issues of <em>The Watchtower? </em>Well, see if you can answer the following questions:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn"><strong>• In what four ways do the Christian Greek Scriptures apply the word “congregation”?</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">The primary application is to the composite group of anointed Christians (in some texts Christ is included). At other times, “the congregation of God” applies to all Christians living at a certain time. A third application is to all Christians in a geographic area. Finally, the term may be applied to those making up a local congregation.​—4/15, pages 21-3.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn"><strong>• When does the calling of Christians to the heavenly hope end?</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">The Bible does not supply a precise answer. That calling began in 33 C.E. and continued into modern times. After 1935 the thrust of the disciple-making work turned to the gathering in of the great crowd. Some who were baptized after 1935 have had witness borne to them by holy spirit that they have the heavenly hope, so we cannot set a specific date for the end of that calling. Truly anointed ones do not have more of God’s spirit, nor do they expect special treatment. Whatever their hope, Christians need to be faithful and keep doing God’s will.​—5/1, pages 30-1.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>• When Jephthah made his vow, was he prepared to offer up his daughter as a burnt offering to God?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">No. Jephthah meant that he would devote the one whom he met to the exclusive service of God, a provision of the Mosaic Law. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:2:22-9:2:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">1 Samuel 2:22</a>) In fulfilling the vow, Jephthah’s daughter kept serving at the tabernacle, a great sacrifice because it meant that she would never marry.​—5/15, pages 9-10.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn"><strong>• What role did the codex play in early Christianity?</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">It appears that Christians used mainly the roll, or scroll, at least until the end of the first century C.E. Over the next century, there was a struggle between advocates of the codex and those of the scroll. Experts believe that the Christians’ use of the codex played a significant role in its widespread acceptance.​—6/1, pages 14-15.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn"><strong>• What is the Gezer Calendar?</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sn">It is a small limestone tablet discovered in 1908 at the site of the city of Gezer. Many think that a schoolboy wrote the tablet as part of an exercise. The tablet sets out a simplified version of an agricultural year, or cycle, starting with the ingathering in the month corresponding to September/​October, and it mentions various crops and agricultural activities.​—6/15, page 8.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sn"><strong>• What is meant by sinning against the holy spirit?</strong></p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sn">It is possible to sin against Jehovah’s holy spirit, a sin that will not be forgiven. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:12:31-40:12:31" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matthew 12:31</a>) God determines whether we have committed an unforgivable sin, and he can withdraw his spirit from us. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:51:11-19:51:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 51:11</a>) If we are deeply grieved over a sin, it is very likely that we are truly repentant and thus have not sinned against the spirit.​—7/15, pages 16-17.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sn"><strong>• Since he had earlier had dealings with David, why did King Saul ask whose son David was? (</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:16:22-9:16:22" data-bid="4-1" class="b"><strong>1 Samuel 16:22;</strong></a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/9:17:58-9:17:58" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> <strong>17:58</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sn">Saul was not interested only in knowing the name of David’s father. Having seen David as a person of faith and courage who had just defeated Goliath, Saul wanted to know what kind of man had raised such a boy. Saul may have had in mind adding Jesse or other members of his family to the army.​—8/1, page 31.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what a mother in Italy exclaimed upon receiving the book <em>Learn From the Great Teacher. </em>“I couldn’t hold back my tears,” she said. Regarding her young daughter, she added: “She can’t read yet, but thanks to the pictures, she remembers the main points. She is very attentive because the writing is in the form of a conversation with the reader, and she often joins in. We could not have received a finer gift.”</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">A father in Italy explained that he and his wife had been asking themselves how they were going to explain matters regarding sex to their young son. “When this new publication was released,” they said, “we felt that God had perceived our worries. After examining it, we commented on the extent to which this new book would encourage our son to reflect and reason.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">A young person in Japan, who had been sexually molested as a child, wrote in appreciation for the book: “I cried profusely and just couldn’t stop thanking Jehovah. This book covers frankly and accurately the things that children may face in this wicked age. The questions kindly draw out the heart of a young child. What a wonderful provision chapter 32 is for protecting children from evil adults! My life might have been very different if something like this straightforward educational tool had been available to me 20 years ago.”</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Books of Haggai and Zechariah</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">THE year is 520 B.C.E. Sixteen years have passed since the Jewish returnees from Babylonian exile laid the foundation of Jehovah’s temple in Jerusalem. Yet, the temple is not completed, and the building work is under ban. Jehovah raises up the prophet Haggai and two months later the prophet Zechariah to speak His word.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Haggai and Zechariah have one objective: Stir up the people to resume the work of rebuilding the temple. The efforts of these prophets succeed, and the temple is completed five years later. What Haggai and Zechariah proclaimed is recorded in the Bible books bearing their names. The books of Haggai and Zechariah were completed in 520 B.C.E. and 518 B.C.E. respectively. Like those prophets, we too have a God-given work, which must be brought to completion before the end of the present system of things. It is the Kingdom-preaching and disciple-making work. Let us see what encouragement we can draw from the books of Haggai and Zechariah.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>“SET YOUR HEART UPON YOUR WAYS”</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="ss"><strong>(</strong><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/37:1:1-37:2:23" data-bid="1-1" class="b"><strong>Haggai 1:1–2:23</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Within 112 days, Haggai delivers four motivating messages. The first is: “‘Set your heart upon your ways. Go up to the mountain, and you must bring in lumber. And build the house, that I may take pleasure in it and I may be glorified,’ Jehovah has said.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/37:1:7-37:1:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Haggai 1:7, 8</a>) The people respond favorably. The second message contains the promise: “I [Jehovah] will fill this house with glory.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/37:2:7-37:2:7" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Haggai 2:7</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">According to the third message, their neglect in the temple rebuilding has made ‘the people and all the work of their hands’ unclean before Jehovah. From the day the repair work begins, however, Jehovah “shall bestow blessing” upon them. As stated in the fourth message, Jehovah shall “annihilate the strength of the kingdoms of the nations” and set Governor Zerubbabel as “a seal ring.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/37:2:14-37:2:14" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Haggai 2:14,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/37:2:19-37:2:19" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 19,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/37:2:22-37:2:23" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 22, 23</a>.</p>

<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/37:1:6-37:1:6" data-bid="5-1" class="b"><strong>1:6</strong></a><wbr /><strong>—What is the meaning of the expression “there is a drinking, but not to the point of getting intoxicated”? </strong>This expression simply indicates the scarcity of wine. Because of the lack of Jehovah’s blessing, the supply of wine would be limited<wbr />—definitely not sufficient to cause intoxication.</p>

The preaching work also has the effect of bringing “the desirable things of all the nations” into Jehovah’s house, thus filling it with glory. In time, “Jehovah of armies” is to rock “the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry ground,” causing the entire present wicked system of things to be shaken out of existence.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:12:26-58:12:27" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Hebrews 12:26, 27</a>.</p>

Although Solomon’s glorious temple stood for 420 years, from 1027 B.C.E. to 607 B.C.E., the “later house” was in use for over 580 years, from its completion in 515 B.C.E. to its destruction in 70 C.E. Moreover, the Messiah<wbr />—Jesus Christ—<wbr />taught in the “later house,” and more people came to it than to “the former” in order to worship God.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/44:2:1-44:2:11" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Acts 2:1-11</a>.</p>

They were neglecting the temple, so they did not have God’s blessing. We should give priority to spiritual pursuits and render God whole-souled service, remembering that whether we have little or much in a material way, ‘the blessing of Jehovah is what makes rich.’<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/20:10:22-20:10:22" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Proverbs 10:22</a>.</p>

(See the box “Zechariah’s Eight Allegorical Visions.”) The building work will come to completion, “not by a military force, nor by power, but by [Jehovah’s] spirit.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/38:4:6-38:4:6" data-bid="18-1" class="b">Zechariah 4:6</a>) The man named Sprout “will certainly build the temple of Jehovah” and “must become a priest upon his throne.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/38:6:12-38:6:13" data-bid="19-1" class="b">Zechariah 6:12, 13</a>.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sb">Bethel sends a delegation to ask the priests about the observance of fasts commemorating Jerusalem’s destruction.

In his role as a shepherd, Zechariah foreshadowed Jesus Christ, who was sent to God’s covenant people but was rejected by them. The cutting up of “Pleasantness” symbolized that God would end the Law covenant with the Jews and stop dealing pleasantly with them. The cutting up of “Union” meant breaking up the theocratic bond of brotherhood between Judah and Israel.</p>

Only a small number, the anointed Christians, ‘have called upon Jehovah’s name’ and submitted themselves to the refining process.

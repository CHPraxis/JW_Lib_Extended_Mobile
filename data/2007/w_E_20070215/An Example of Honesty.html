<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">NELMA, who works as a hairdresser in Cruzeiro do Sul, Brazil, recently faced a test of her Christian integrity. When a flood hit her area, Nelma received some donated clothing from one of her clients. While sorting through the clothes, she found money equivalent to $1,000 (U.S.) in the pockets of some trousers.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The money Nelma found represented about seven months’ wages for her, and she really needed it. Her own house had been damaged by the flood, and her father and siblings lost most of their belongings. With the money, she could finish the repairs on her home and still have some left over to help her relatives. However, Nelma’s Bible-trained conscience did not allow her to keep the money.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:18-58:13:18" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Hebrews 13:18</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Early the next day, she went to work before normal business hours and contacted the businesswoman who had donated the clothing. Nelma thanked her for the clothes but added that she could not keep what she had found inside. The lady was overjoyed to receive the money. She had set it aside to pay her employees. “Honesty is something you don’t find very often,” said the businesswoman.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Indeed, some may feel that being honest has no special merit. Yet, honesty is a quality that is highly valued by those striving to please the true God, Jehovah.

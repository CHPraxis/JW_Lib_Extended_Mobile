“Oh, if Only Everyone Would Read It!”
The writer was referring to the book Draw Close to Jehovah. She added, “Now that I see Jehovah’s love in an even clearer way, I am going to demonstrate my love for others more.” Another appreciative reader explained: “Words cannot adequately express how much I have enjoyed this publication and how beneficial it has been. . . . The more I read, the more encouraged I became.”
Under its four major sections, Draw Close to Jehovah discusses God’s primary attributes of power, justice, wisdom, and love. “This book has helped me see my heavenly Father’s excellent qualities,” explained a reader. “It has helped me see that I have the potential to put into practice his qualities if I allow his holy spirit to operate in my life.”
After studying chapter 26, “A God Who Is ‘Ready to Forgive,’” Joanna, a young woman in Poland, said, “I treat the thoughts from the publication as a precious treasure the discovery of which has proved essential for my life.”

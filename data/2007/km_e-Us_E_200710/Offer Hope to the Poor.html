<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>Jesus took a special interest in those who were impoverished. There were occasions when he miraculously provided material assistance and healed the sick, but his focus was on declaring “good news” to the poor. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:11:5-40:11:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 11:5</a>) The Christian ministry today continues to benefit the poor as well as others.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:14-40:24:14" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Matt. 24:14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:28:19-40:28:20" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> 28:19, 20</a>.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup><strong>Real Hope: </strong>Christendom’s ministers often promise the poor that they will prosper if they give generously to the church. However, the Bible teaches that only God’s Kingdom will end poverty and solve all of mankind’s problems. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:9:18-19:9:18" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Ps. 9:18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:145:16-19:145:16" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> 145:16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:65:21-23:65:23" data-bid="3-3" class="b"> Isa. 65:21-23</a>) By showing the poor what the Bible really teaches, we impart hope and help them to satisfy their spiritual need.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:5:3-40:5:3" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Matt. 5:3</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>The Pharisees of Jesus’ day looked down on the poor, contemptuously calling them <em>‘am-ha·’aʹrets, </em>or “people of the land.” However, Jesus viewed “their blood,” or their life, as “precious.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:13-19:72:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Ps. 72:13, 14</a>) We can imitate Jesus and ‘show favor’ to such poor ones by being kind and sympathetic. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:14:31-20:14:31" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Prov. 14:31</a>) Never would we want to speak disparagingly about people living in poor neighborhoods or show a reluctance to witness to them. Many who are responding to the Kingdom message are of humble means.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup><strong>Help Now: </strong>Our teaching Bible principles to poor ones in the territory also helps them to mitigate the effects of poverty right now. For example, the Bible condemns drunkenness, gambling, laziness, the use of tobacco, and other practices that contribute to poverty. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:6:10-20:6:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Prov. 6:10, 11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:23:21-20:23:21" data-bid="7-2" class="b"> 23:21;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:7:1-47:7:1" data-bid="7-3" class="b"> 2 Cor. 7:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:5:5-49:5:5" data-bid="7-4" class="b"> Eph. 5:5</a>) The Scriptures encourage honesty and working “whole-souled,” qualities looked for in employees. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:22-51:3:23" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Col. 3:22, 23;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:13:18-58:13:18" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> Heb. 13:18</a>) In fact, in one survey the majority of employers ranked honesty and integrity as qualities that impress them most in job candidates.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Jehovah is not insensitive to the sufferings of the poor. Soon Jesus Christ will deliver “the poor one crying for help.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:72:12-19:72:12" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Ps. 72:12</a>) Until then, we have the privilege of comforting others, including the poor, with the Bible’s message of hope.</p>

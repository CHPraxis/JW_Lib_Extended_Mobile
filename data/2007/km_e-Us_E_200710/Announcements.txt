▪ At times, questions arise as to whether it is appropriate for the branch office or a congregation to be designated to receive donations from programs that offer to contribute to charitable organizations. The local elders can address such inquiries in accord with guidelines they have received. Publishers should obtain theocratic direction from the elders before deciding to participate in such donation programs.

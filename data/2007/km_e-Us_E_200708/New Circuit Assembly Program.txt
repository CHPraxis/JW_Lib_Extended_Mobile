New Circuit Assembly Program
Jehovah deserves to be glorified. How do we glorify Jehovah? What challenges are some facing in this regard? What blessings come to those who glorify God now? The circuit assembly program for the 2008 service year will provide satisfying answers to these questions. It has as its theme “Do All Things for God’s Glory.” (1 Cor. 10:31) Consider what is in store for us during the upcoming two days of rich spiritual instruction.
The district overseer will speak on the subjects “Why Give God Glory?” and “Be Exemplary in Meeting God’s Requirements.” He will give the public discourse, “Who Are the People Who Glorify God?,” and the closing talk, “Unitedly Glorifying God Worldwide.” He will also conduct the Theocratic Ministry School. The circuit overseer will speak on the themes “Take Delight in Reflecting God’s Glory,” “Giving Attention to the Needs of the Circuit,” and “Remain ‘Firmly Set in the Truth,’” which is based on 2 Peter 1:12. In addition, we will learn how “The Pioneer Ministry Glorifies God.” “Glorifying God in All Aspects of Our Life,” the first of two thought-provoking symposiums, will explore the depth of meaning in the inspired words found at 1 Corinthians 10:31. The symposium “Rendering Sacred Service to Praise Jehovah” will deal with various facets of our worship. We will enjoy the summary of The Watchtower and the discussion of the daily text on Sunday. There will also be an opportunity for baptism.
The majority of mankind refuse to acknowledge God. Many are too distracted by human schemes to ponder the magnificence of Jehovah. (John 5:44) But we are convinced of the value of spending time considering how to “Do All Things for God’s Glory.” Plan to be on hand and to benefit fully from all four sessions.

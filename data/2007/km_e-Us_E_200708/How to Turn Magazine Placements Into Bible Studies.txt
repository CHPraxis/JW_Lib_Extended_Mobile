How to Turn Magazine Placements Into Bible Studies
 1. What is our goal when placing magazines?
1 On Saturdays we generally feature the Watchtower and Awake! magazines in the ministry. However, this is only the first step in reaching our goal of teaching honesthearted ones the truth. Below are some suggestions on how to place the Bible Teach book on a return visit and start a Bible study. These may be adapted to your territory and put in your own words. Feel free to use another approach if it is effective for you.
 2. How could we use the introductory pages in the Bible Teach book to start a Bible study?
2 Use the Introductory Pages: When you return, you could say: “The magazines I left you direct attention to the Bible. Notice why Bible reading is so important.” Read Isaiah 48:17, 18; John 17:3; or another appropriate scripture. Then after introducing the Bible Teach book and handing the householder a copy, you could proceed as follows:
▪ “The Bible gives us a real hope for the future.” Show the householder pages 4-5 and ask, “Which of these promises would you like to see fulfilled?” Direct him to the chapter that discusses the Scriptural promise he selected, and briefly consider a paragraph or two if he allows.
▪ Or you could say, “The Bible answers the most important questions of life.” Direct his attention to page 6, and ask if he has ever wondered about any of the questions at the bottom of the page. Turn to the chapter that gives the answer, and briefly discuss a paragraph or two.
▪ Or you could point out some of the titles in the table of contents and ask which one of the subjects interests him. Turn to that chapter, and briefly demonstrate a Bible study.
 3. How might we start a Bible study after placing magazines that deal with (a) worsening world conditions? (b) the family? (c) the reliability of the Bible?
3 Leave a Question on the Initial Visit: Another option is to lay the groundwork for the return visit on the initial call. After the householder accepts the magazines, raise a question, and promise to answer it on your next visit. Endeavor to make a definite arrangement to return, and be sure to keep the appointment. (Matt. 5:37) When you go back, remind the householder of the question, and briefly read and discuss the answer from the Bible Teach book. Hand him a copy so that he can follow along. Here are a few examples:
▪ If the magazine you placed deals with worsening world conditions, you could say, “Next time we can discuss the Bible’s answer to this question, What changes will God bring about on the earth?” Use pages 4-5 when you return. Or you could raise the question, “Are tragedies God’s will?” On the return visit, show the householder paragraphs 7-8 in chapter 1.
▪ If the magazine you placed deals with the family, before leaving you might raise this question, “What can each member of the family do to make family life happier?” When you return consider paragraph 4 in chapter 14.
▪ If the magazine you placed deals with the reliability of the Bible, you could raise this question for your next discussion, “Is the Bible scientifically accurate?” On the return visit, consider paragraph 8 in chapter 2.
 4. What should we do if the householder does not accept the Bible Teach book?
4 At the end of each discussion, raise another question to be answered on the next visit. Once a regular study is established, consider the book systematically from beginning to end. What if the householder does not accept the Bible Teach book? You can still continue to take him the magazines and have Scriptural discussions with him. As you cultivate his interest, he may in time accept a Bible study.
 5. Why should we endeavor to do more than leave magazines with people?
5 The Watchtower and Awake! may stir up a person’s desire to learn what the Bible really teaches. Therefore, make a special effort to start Bible studies with those who accept the magazines. In this way, we will obey Jesus’ instructions to “make disciples . . . , teaching them.”​—Matt. 28:19, 20.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The theme of the special assembly day program for the 2008 service year is “We Are the Clay​—Jehovah Is Our Potter,” based on <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/23:64:8-23:64:8" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Isaiah 64:8</a>. The Scriptural admonition provided by means of this program will increase our appreciation for Jehovah’s wisdom, justice, power, and love as the Great Potter.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The circuit overseer’s talk, “Serving as Honorable Vessels in the Ministry,” will show how increasing numbers are enjoying the rich blessing of knowing the truth and sharing it with others. The talk “Meditation Will Safeguard You” will reveal how serious contemplation of Jehovah’s righteous principles protects us. The visiting speaker will address the audience on the themes “Not ‘Fashioned After This System of Things’” and “Be Molded by the Great Potter.” Parents and young ones will find encouragement in the parts “Youths Who Are Useful to Jehovah” and “Vital Role of Parents in the Molding Process.” Through demonstrations and interviews, we will delight to hear and observe what our brothers and sisters are accomplishing in their ministry. Those who wish to symbolize their dedication to God by water baptism should inform the presiding overseer as soon as possible. Be sure to bring your copy of the issue of <em>The Watchtower </em>to be studied the week of the special assembly day.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Whatever the Great Potter purposes he accomplishes. But it is up to each one of us to choose how we will respond to his shaping of us. Those who wisely submit to Jehovah’s patterns and refinements can, as a lump of clay on a potter’s wheel, be fashioned, polished, and transformed into useful vessels. When we cooperate with Jehovah, we magnify his sovereignty and receive many blessings.</p>

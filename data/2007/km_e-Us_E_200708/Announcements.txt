Announcements
▪ Literature offer for August: Worship the Only True God. If a Bible study is started, it is recommended that the Bible Teach book be studied before the Worship God book. September: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Make a special effort to start Bible studies on the initial call. When householders already have this publication, show how they can benefit from it by briefly demonstrating a Bible study. October: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Where interest is shown, offer the tract Would You Like to Know More About the Bible? with the objective of starting a Bible study. November: Learn From the Great Teacher. If individuals say they have no children, offer the brochure Keep on the Watch!
▪ Since September has five full weekends, it would be an excellent month to auxiliary pioneer.
▪ Congregations should begin requesting the 2008 Calendar of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Examining the Scriptures Daily​—2008, and the 2008 Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses with their next literature request. A listing of the languages in which these items are available will appear in the monthly “Announcement to All Congregations.”
▪ The elders are reminded to follow through on instructions given on pages 21-3 of the April 15, 1991, Watchtower regarding any disfellowshipped or disassociated ones who may be inclined toward becoming reinstated.
▪ On September 1 and 2, 2007, an inventory will be taken of all literature on hand at Wallkill Bethel. Because of this, no congregation literature requests will be processed for pickup during those days.

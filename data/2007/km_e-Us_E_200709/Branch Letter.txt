Branch Letter
Dear Kingdom Publishers:
We rejoice to see the progress of the work in the United States branch territory during the 2007 service year! We reached an all-time peak of 103,648 regular pioneers in December. A number of Bethelites have been reassigned to the field as special and regular pioneers, and they are having a positive effect on the preaching work. The branch office also oversees the work in the Turks and Caicos islands. The 161 publishers and pioneers reporting there in March conducted 307 Bible studies.
Nearly 51 million copies of Kingdom News No. 37, “The End of False Religion Is Near!” were distributed throughout the United States branch territory. After receiving and reading a copy, an inactive sister had trouble sleeping. The next Sunday, she attended the meeting and requested a Bible study. Interested ones used the coupon on the back of the Kingdom News to request 2,286 copies of the Keep on the Watch! brochure and 1,087 Bible studies.
The objective of such campaigns is to help honesthearted ones to learn what the Bible really teaches. (Matt. 28:19, 20) As you preach, remember to take note of any interest found, and return with the goal of starting a Bible study. We are happy to be working shoulder to shoulder with you in this important activity, and we send our warm Christian love.
Your brothers,
United States Branch Office

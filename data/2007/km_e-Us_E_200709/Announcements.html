<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">▪ Literature offer for <strong>September: </strong><em>What Does the Bible Really Teach? </em>Make a special effort to start Bible studies on the initial call. When householders already have this publication, show how they can benefit from it by briefly demonstrating a Bible study. <strong>October: </strong>The <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. Where interest is shown, offer the tract <em>Would You Like to Know More About the Bible? </em>with the objective of starting a Bible study. <strong>November: </strong><em>Learn From the Great Teacher</em>. If individuals say they have no children, offer the brochure <em>Keep on the Watch! </em><strong>December: </strong><em>The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. </em>As an alternative offer, you may use <em>Draw Close to Jehovah </em>or <em>The Secret of Family Happiness</em>.</p>

A listing of the languages in which these items are available will appear in the “Announcement to All Congregations,” which is mailed each month.

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">▪ The <em>Annual Congregation Property Documents Review Work Sheet </em>(TO-33) and <em>Safety Inspection Work Sheet </em>(TO-34) are to be completed each September. Copies of the completed forms should be promptly provided to the body of elders for each congregation that meets in the Kingdom Hall as well as to the Regional Building Committee. If corrective actions are needed, the elders should care for these. When the circuit overseer visits the congregation, he will review both work sheets.</p>

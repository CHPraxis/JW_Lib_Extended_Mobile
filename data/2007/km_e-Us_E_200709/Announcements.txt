Announcements
▪ Literature offer for September: What Does the Bible Really Teach? Make a special effort to start Bible studies on the initial call. When householders already have this publication, show how they can benefit from it by briefly demonstrating a Bible study. October: The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. Where interest is shown, offer the tract Would You Like to Know More About the Bible? with the objective of starting a Bible study. November: Learn From the Great Teacher. If individuals say they have no children, offer the brochure Keep on the Watch! December: The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived. As an alternative offer, you may use Draw Close to Jehovah or The Secret of Family Happiness.
▪ Congregations should begin requesting bound volumes of The Watchtower and Awake! for 2007, Watch Tower Publications Index 2007, and Watchtower Library​—2007 Edition on CD-ROM with their next literature request. A listing of the languages in which these items are available will appear in the “Announcement to All Congregations,” which is mailed each month. Please note that Watchtower Library​—2007 Edition is a provision for baptized members of the congregation and is made available only through the congregation.
▪ The video program Jehovah’s Witnesses​—Organized to Share the Good News will be considered at a Service Meeting in December. If needed, copies should be requested through the congregation as soon as possible.
▪ The presiding overseer or someone designated by him should audit the congregation’s accounts for the months of June, July, and August. When this has been done, an announcement should be made to the congregation after the next accounts report is read.​—See Instructions for Congregation Accounting (S-27).
▪ The Annual Congregation Property Documents Review Work Sheet (TO-33) and Safety Inspection Work Sheet (TO-34) are to be completed each September. Copies of the completed forms should be promptly provided to the body of elders for each congregation that meets in the Kingdom Hall as well as to the Regional Building Committee. If corrective actions are needed, the elders should care for these. When the circuit overseer visits the congregation, he will review both work sheets.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sa">“You will celebrate the festival to Jehovah . . . , and you must become nothing but joyful.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:16:15-5:16:15" data-bid="1-1" class="b">DEUTERONOMY 16:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 1. (a) What issues did Satan raise? (b) What did Jehovah foretell following the rebellion of Adam and Eve?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb">WHEN Satan led Adam and Eve into rebellion against their Creator, he raised two issues of vital importance. First, he challenged Jehovah’s truthfulness and the rightness of his way of ruling. Second, Satan implied that humans would serve God only out of self-interest. The latter issue was stated explicitly in the time of Job. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:1-1:3:6" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Genesis 3:1-6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:1:9-18:1:10" data-bid="2-2" class="b"> Job 1:9, 10;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/18:2:4-18:2:5" data-bid="2-3" class="b"> 2:4, 5</a>) Nevertheless, Jehovah acted quickly to handle the situation. Even while Adam and Eve were still in the garden of Eden, Jehovah foretold how He would resolve the issues. He foretold the coming of a “seed” who, after having his heel bruised, would fatally bruise Satan in the head.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a>.</p>
<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 2. What light did Jehovah shed on how he would fulfill the prophecy recorded at <a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:3:15-1:3:15" data-bid="44-1" class="b">Genesis 3:15</a>?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>As time went by, Jehovah shed increasing light on that prophecy, thus demonstrating the certainty of its eventual fulfillment. For example, God told Abraham that the “seed” would appear among his descendants. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:22:15-1:22:18" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Genesis 22:15-18</a>) Abraham’s grandson Jacob became father to the 12 tribes of Israel. In 1513 B.C.E., when those tribes became a nation, Jehovah gave them a system of laws that included various annual festivals. The apostle Paul said that those festivals were “a shadow of the things to come.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/51:2:16-51:2:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Colossians 2:16, 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:10:1-58:10:1" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Hebrews 10:1</a>) They contained foregleams of the outworking of Jehovah’s purpose for the Seed. Observing those festivals caused great joy in Israel. A brief consideration of them will strengthen our faith in the reliability of Jehovah’s promises.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>More than 4,000 years after Jehovah’s original prophecy, the promised Seed appeared. It was Jesus. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:3:16-48:3:16" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Galatians 3:16</a>) As a perfect man, Jesus kept his integrity to the death and thus proved that Satan’s accusations were lies. In addition, since Jesus was sinless, his death was a sacrifice of great value. By means of it, Jesus provided deliverance from sin and death for faithful descendants of Adam and Eve. Jesus’ death on the torture stake was the ‘bruising in the heel’ of the promised Seed.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/58:9:11-58:9:14" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/2:12:1-2:12:14" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Exodus 12:1-14</a>) The Passover lamb foreshadowed Jesus, of whom the apostle Paul said: “Christ our passover has been sacrificed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:5:7-46:5:7" data-bid="9-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>) Like the blood of the <span id="page21" class="pageNum" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>Passover lamb, Jesus’ shed blood provides salvation for many.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:16-43:3:16" data-bid="10-1" class="b">John 3:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:3:36-43:3:36" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 36</a>.</p>

<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>When Jesus was on earth, the Festival of Weeks was known as Pentecost (from a Greek word meaning “fiftieth”). At Pentecost 33 C.E., the greater High Priest, the <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>resurrected Jesus Christ, poured out holy spirit upon the small group of 120 disciples gathered in Jerusalem.

<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>The congregation of anointed Christians was foreshadowed by the two leavened loaves waved before Jehovah each Pentecost. The loaves’ being leavened showed that anointed Christians would still have the leaven of inherited sin. Nevertheless, they could approach Jehovah on the basis of Jesus’ ransom sacrifice. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/45:5:1-45:5:2" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Romans 5:1, 2</a>) Why two loaves? That may have pointed to the fact that the anointed sons of God would eventually be drawn from two groups<wbr />—first from natural Jews and later from Gentiles.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/48:3:26-48:3:29" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Galatians 3:26-29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/49:2:13-49:2:18" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> Ephesians 2:13-18</a>.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>The two loaves offered at Pentecost came from the firstfruits of the wheat harvest.

That offering was for the sins of the high priest and “his house,” the underpriests and the Levites. Then the high priest took two goats. One he slaughtered as a sin offering “for the people.” Some of its blood too was sprinkled before the cover of the Ark in the Most Holy. Afterward, the high priest laid his hands on the head of the second goat and confessed the errors of the sons of Israel. Then he had the goat led off into the wilderness to carry away the nation’s sins in a symbolic way.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:16:3-3:16:16" data-bid="30-1" class="b">Leviticus 16:3-16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/3:16:21-3:16:22" data-bid="30-2" class="b"> 21, 22</a>.</p>

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>As those acts foreshadowed, the great High Priest, Jesus, uses the merit of his own lifeblood to provide forgiveness of sins. First, the value of his blood is applied to the “spiritual house” of 144,000 anointed Christians, enabling these to be declared righteous and enjoy a clean standing before Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:2:5-60:2:5" data-bid="31-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:5;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/46:6:11-46:6:11" data-bid="31-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 6:11</a>) This is foreshadowed by the sacrifice of the bull. Thus the way is opened for them to receive their heavenly inheritance. Second, the value of Jesus’ blood is applied in behalf of millions of others who exercise faith in Christ, as shown by the sacrifice of the goat. These will be blessed with everlasting life here on earth, the inheritance that Adam and Eve lost. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/19:37:10-19:37:11" data-bid="32-1" class="b">Psalm 37:10, 11</a>) On the basis of his shed blood, Jesus carries away the sins of mankind, just as the live goat in a token way carried the sins of Israel off into the wilderness.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/23:53:4-23:53:5" data-bid="33-1" class="b">Isaiah 53:4, 5</a>.</p>

It marked the end of the ingathering of the harvest and was a time of thanksgiving for the abundant goodness of God. For that reason, Jehovah commanded the celebrants: “Jehovah your God will bless you in all your produce and in every deed of your hand, and you must become nothing but joyful.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:16:15-5:16:15" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 16:15</a>) What a happy time that must have been!</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>During that festival, the Israelites dwelled in booths for seven days. They were thus reminded that at one time they had dwelled in booths in the wilderness. The festival gave them ample opportunity to reflect on Jehovah’s fatherly care. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/5:8:15-5:8:16" data-bid="36-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 8:15, 16</a>) And since all, wealthy and poor alike, dwelled in booths that were similar, the Israelites were reminded that in relation to the festival, they were all equal.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/16:8:14-16:8:16" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Nehemiah 8:14-16</a>.</p>

<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup>The Festival of Booths was a harvest festival, a joyful celebration of ingathering, and it foreshadowed the joyous ingathering of those who exercise faith in Jesus Christ. The ingathering began at Pentecost 33 C.E., when Jesus’ 120 disciples were anointed to become part of “a holy priesthood.” As the Israelites lived in booths for a few days, anointed ones know that they are mere “temporary residents” in this ungodly world. Their hope is a heavenly one. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:2:5-60:2:5" data-bid="38-1" class="b">1 Peter 2:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/60:2:11-60:2:11" data-bid="38-2" class="b"> 11</a>) That ingathering of anointed Christians reaches its conclusion during these “last days,” when the final ones of the 144,000 are gathered.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/55:3:1-55:3:1" data-bid="39-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1</a>.</p>

<p id="p24" data-pid="24" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>It is noteworthy that during this ancient <span id="page25" class="pageNum" data-no="25" data-before-text="25"></span>festival, 70 bulls were offered. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/4:29:12-4:29:34" data-bid="40-1" class="b">Numbers 29:12-34</a>) The number 70 represents 7 multiplied by 10, numbers that in the Bible represent heavenly and earthly perfection.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/1:10:1-1:10:29" data-bid="41-1" class="b">Genesis 10:1-29</a>) In harmony with that, in our time the ingathering has widened out to include individuals from all nations who exercise faith in Jesus and have the hope of living on a paradise earth.</p>
<p id="p25" data-pid="25" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>18 </sup>The apostle John saw this modern-day ingathering in vision. First he heard the announcing of the sealing of the final ones of the 144,000. Then he saw “a great crowd, which no man was able to number,” standing before Jehovah and Jesus, with “palm branches in their hands.” These “come out of the great tribulation” into the new world. They too are now mere temporary residents in this old system of things, and they look forward with confidence to the time when “the Lamb . . . will shepherd them, and will guide them to fountains of waters of life.” At that time, “God will wipe out every tear from their eyes.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:1-66:7:10" data-bid="42-1" class="b">Revelation 7:1-10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:7:14-66:7:17" data-bid="42-2" class="b"> 14-17</a>) The antitypical Festival of Booths will reach its climax after the end of the Thousand Year Reign of Christ when they along with faithful resurrected ones are granted everlasting life.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/66:20:5-66:20:5" data-bid="43-1" class="b">Revelation 20:5</a>.</p>

Today, we know that the Seed has appeared and that he has been bruised in the heel. Now he is a heavenly King. Further, most of the 144,000 have already proved their faithfulness to the death.

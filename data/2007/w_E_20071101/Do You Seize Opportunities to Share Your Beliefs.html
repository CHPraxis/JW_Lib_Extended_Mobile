<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“DOES absolute truth exist?” That was the subject of a national essay competition in Poland. The instructions for the essay noted: “We do not need absolute truth. Nobody needs it. There is no absolute truth anyway.” Agata, a 15-year-old high school student and one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, decided to use this opportunity to share her religious beliefs with others.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">To prepare for the essay, Agata first asked Jehovah for his guidance and then started to collect material on the subject. She found related information in <em>The Watchtower </em>of July 1, 1995. She quoted the question that Pontius Pilate asked Jesus: “What is truth?” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/43:18:38-43:18:38" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 18:38</a>) That question, she noted, reflected a cynical attitude, as if saying: ‘Truth? What is that? There is no such thing!’ “Pilate’s question,” wrote Agata, “reminds me of the instructions for the essay.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Next she discussed the development of relativism<wbr />—the idea that what is true to one person may not be true to another and that both may be “right.” She asked such questions as, “Who of us would dare to board an airplane if we did not think that the laws of aerodynamics were absolute truths?” Then she pointed to the Bible, saying: “Reliance on God’s Word is firmly grounded in verifiable facts.” She expressed her hope that those who sincerely seek absolute truth will have enough patience to find it.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Agata won a special diploma and had a chance to give a presentation in front of the whole class. Several of her schoolmates accepted her offer to study the Bible with them. Agata is grateful that she used this opportunity to share her beliefs with many others. Yes, being alert to an opportunity to speak about your faith can bear fruit. What opportunities can you seize?</p>

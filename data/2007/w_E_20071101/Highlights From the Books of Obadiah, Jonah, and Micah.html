<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="st"><strong>Highlights From the Books of Obadiah, Jonah, and Micah</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“THE vision of Obadiah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/31:1:1-31:1:1" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Obadiah 1</a>) These words begin the Bible book of Obadiah. The prophet reveals nothing about himself except his name in the book that he composed in 607 B.C.E. In a book completed over two centuries earlier, the prophet Jonah candidly relates what he personally experienced in connection with his missionary assignment. The 60 years of Micah’s prophetic activity lie between those of Obadiah and Jonah, stretching from 777 B.C.E. to 717 B.C.E. All that Micah relates about himself is that he is “of [the village] Moresheth” and that Jehovah’s word occurred to him “in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/33:1:1-33:1:1" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Micah 1:1</a>) The prophet’s familiarity with rural life is evident in the type of illustrations he uses to stress the points of his message.</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Regarding Edom, Obadiah says: “Because of the violence to your brother Jacob, shame will cover you, and you will have to be cut off to time indefinite.” The prophet has fresh in mind the Edomites’ recent acts of violence against the sons of Jacob<wbr />—the Israelites. In 607 B.C.E., when the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem, the Edomites “stood off on the side” and allied themselves with the invading “foreigners.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/31:1:10-31:1:11" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Obadiah 10, 11</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">In contrast, a restoration is in store for the house of Jacob. Obadiah’s prophecy states: “In Mount Zion is where those escaping will prove to be, and it must become something holy.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/31:1:17-31:1:17" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Obadiah 17</a>.</p>

Had harvesters come into her, they would have left behind some of the crop for gleaning. When Edom falls, though, her treasures will be thoroughly searched out and she will be completely plundered by “the very men in covenant with [her]”<wbr />—her allies, the Babylonians.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/24:49:9-24:49:10" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jeremiah 49:9, 10</a>.</p>

Babylonian King Nabonidus conquered Edom about the middle of the sixth century B.C.E. By the fourth century B.C.E., Edom’s territory was inhabited by the Nabataeans, and the Edomites had to take up residence in the southern part of Judea, the area of the Negeb that later came to be known as Idumea. After the Romans destroyed Jerusalem in 70 C.E., the Edomites ceased to exist.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Instead of obeying God’s command to “go to Nineveh the great city, and proclaim against her” a judgment message, Jonah flees in the opposite direction. By hurling “a great wind at the sea” and by using “a great fish,” Jehovah redirects Jonah and commissions him a second time to go to the Assyrian capital.<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/32:1:2-32:1:2" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Jonah 1:2,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/32:1:4-32:1:4" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/32:1:17-32:1:17" data-bid="15-3" class="b"> 17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/32:3:1-32:3:2" data-bid="15-4" class="b"> 3:1, 2</a>.</p>

In ancient times, Nineveh was likely understood to include other settlements stretching from Khorsabad in the north to Nimrud in the south. All the settlements identified with Nineveh form a quadrangle with a circumference of 60 miles <strong>[100 km]</strong>.</p>

Another possibility is that he delivered his succinct message in Hebrew, with someone interpreting for him. If the latter was the case, his words would have aroused even greater curiosity about his message.</p>

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" class="sb">Micah exposes the sins of Israel and Judah, foretells the desolation of their capitals, and promises restoration. Samaria shall become “a heap of ruins of the field.” Because of their idolatrous course, Israel and Judah deserve “baldness,” or shame. By their being sent into captivity, their baldness is to be broadened out “like that of the eagle”<wbr />—apparently a type of vulture that has only a few soft hairs on its head. Jehovah promises: “I shall positively gather Jacob.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/33:1:6-33:1:6" data-bid="34-1" class="b">Micah 1:6,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/33:1:16-33:1:16" data-bid="34-2" class="b"> 16;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/33:2:12-33:2:12" data-bid="34-3" class="b"> 2:12</a>) On account of the corrupt leaders and the delinquent prophets, Jerusalem too “will become mere heaps of ruins.” But Jehovah will “collect [his people] together.” Out of “Bethlehem Ephrathah” will come “the one who is to become ruler in Israel.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/33:3:12-33:3:12" data-bid="35-1" class="b">Micah 3:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/33:4:12-33:4:12" data-bid="35-2" class="b"> 4:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/33:5:2-33:5:2" data-bid="35-3" class="b"> 5:2</a>.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="sb">Has Jehovah been unfair to Israel? Are his requirements too severe?

But the prophet asks: “Who is a God like [Jehovah]?” God will again show mercy to his people and “throw into the depths of the sea all their sins.”<wbr />—<a href="jwpub://b/NWT/33:7:4-33:7:4" data-bid="37-1" class="b">Micah 7:4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWT/33:7:18-33:7:19" data-bid="37-2" class="b"> 18, 19</a>.</p>

The Challenge of Humility
TO MANY people, it might appear that humility has no place in today’s world. Those who command attention and who seem to be the most successful are the self-promoters, the proud, the ones who insist on getting their own way. Society in general envies the lifestyles of the rich and famous, not the humble and meek. Those who are successful usually like to boast that they are self-made. Far from being humble, they proudly take full credit for their success.
A Canadian researcher spoke of the “emergence of an ‘all-about-me’ attitude” in his country. Others feel that we live in a society in which self-indulgence outweighs responsibility and observe that people today are increasingly self-involved. In such a world, humility may not seem to have much to recommend it.
Of course, few would disagree with the idea that humility is fine for others, since unassuming people are easy to live with. However, in our competitive world, some fear that if they personally act humbly, they will be viewed by others as weak.
God’s Word, the Bible, foretold that in our time people would be “self-assuming, haughty.” (2 Timothy 3:1, 2) Would you not agree that this prophecy is being fulfilled? Can you see any value in being humble? Or do you think that a humble person would be viewed as weak, easy to take advantage of?
The fact is that the Bible gives good reasons for valuing and cultivating humility. It provides a balanced and positive view of the quality and shows that true humility is a mark of strength, not weakness. The following article will explain why.

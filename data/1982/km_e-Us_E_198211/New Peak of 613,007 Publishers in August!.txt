New Peak of 613,007 Publishers in August!
In reviewing the 1982 service year, we thank Jehovah by saying in the words of the psalmist: “You have crowned the year with your goodness.” (Ps. 65:11) Considering the many blessings showered upon us, including the new peaks in attendance at the Memorial in April and the district conventions this summer, what a fitting way to close the service year by reaching another publisher peak in August! It represents an 8.8-percent increase over last year’s average and it also exceeds our July peak by 7,193 publishers. Now we look forward to the details of the year’s field service report, not only for the United States but worldwide. Let us continue to show ourselves thankful for all of Jehovah’s goodness and loving-kindness to us.—Col. 3:15.

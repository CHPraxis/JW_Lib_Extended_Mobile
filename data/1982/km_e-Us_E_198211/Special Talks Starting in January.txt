Special Talks Starting in January
1 Starting January 1, 1983, a series of five special talks will be given based on the new book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth. By all means be present to enjoy each of these talks and bring interested ones with you.
2 The titles of the talks and the chapters to be covered are as follows:
1—“Taking in Knowledge of God and Christ” (Chap. 1-6)
2—“Life Now and in the Hereafter” (Chap. 7-12)
3—“God’s Government and Your Future” (Chap. 13-18)
4—“A Paradise Earth—When and for Whom?” (Chap. 19-24)
5—“What Is Required for Life Everlasting?” (Chap. 25-30)
3 The talks will be 45 minutes long. Well-qualified speakers should be used. The material should be properly outlined and presented, not as a summary or a book review, but, as a discourse. There will be no need to read paragraphs from the book, but attention should be drawn to illustrations which fit the material, and should be suitably applied to fit the audience. It will be necessary for each speaker to prepare well. Presentation of the material should be carefully thought out. While developing the main ideas in the chapters assigned, the speaker should clearly emphasize the subject theme. (See Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook, pages 135-158 and 168-171.)
4 Speakers can be exchanged with nearby congregations so a speaker may give his talk in more than one congregation if desired. To facilitate this, the dates for beginning the series of talks can be staggered and dates adjusted as needed due to circuit assemblies or the visit of the circuit overseer. Where necessary the talks can run into the month of February.
5 Invite interested persons to hear these talks with you. Often our mentioning the subject material for the week will help them see the benefit of attending. The talks will help all of us to get better acquainted with the new publication and present it effectively in the field ministry.

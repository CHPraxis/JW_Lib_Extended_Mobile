Feed Your Mind, Feed Your Spirit​—How?
Would you pay $7.00 to learn how to cope with inflation? How to stay young while growing older? How to fight depression? How a gene is spliced? How birds fly 2,300 miles nonstop? How God speaks to man, and whether man can speak with the dead?
These are just a few of the thought-provoking subjects covered in the Watchtower and Awake! magazines last year. Don’t miss the next issues. It is a rich and strengthening spiritual diet . . . after all, man does not live by bread alone.
Please send a year’s subscription for the Watchtower and Awake! magazines. I enclose $7 (US) for 48 issues.

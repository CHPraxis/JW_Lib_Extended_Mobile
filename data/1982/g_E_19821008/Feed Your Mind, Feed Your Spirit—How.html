<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Would you pay $7.00 to learn how to cope with inflation? How to stay young while growing older? How to fight depression? How a gene is spliced? How birds fly 2,300 miles nonstop? How God speaks to man, and whether man can speak with the dead?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">These are just a few of the thought-provoking subjects covered in the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines last year. Don’t miss the next issues. It is a rich and strengthening spiritual diet . . . after all, man does not live by bread alone.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Please send a year’s subscription for the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. I enclose $7 (US) for 48 issues.</p>

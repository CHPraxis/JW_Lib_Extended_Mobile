My Book of Bible Stories​—A Book People Want
A clerk in a general merchant store in St. John’s, Newfoundland, had a Bible discussion with the secretary. The book My Book of Bible Stories was recommended to her. She always wanted a book just like it, but found, in checking with various religious organizations, that the books they had were just too expensive. When she discovered that this volume was available on a small contribution she readily accepted it. When others in the store, including the manager, saw the book they wanted copies for their children, as well as for themselves and their friends. As a result the clerk left 25 My Book of Bible Stories with the staff at the store.
You, too, will be pleased to receive My Book of Bible Stories. It contains 116 Bible accounts that give the reader an idea of what the Bible is all about.

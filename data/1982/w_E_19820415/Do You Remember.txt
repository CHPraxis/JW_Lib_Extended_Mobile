Do You Remember?
How have you enjoyed reading the last several issues of The Watchtower? Probably you will remember some of the following points that came under discussion:
□ What is the present distribution of the Bible?
At least 2,458,000,000 copies.​—12/15, p. 15.
□ Why is it so important to use God’s name, Jehovah?
Knowing and using God’s name is the only way for one to come near to God so as to have a personal relationship with him. (John 17:26) Bearing God’s name, then, brings one under his influence and protection. (Psalm 91:14)​—1/1, p. 9.
□ Why must a Christian be honest?
Because he thereby shows love for God and neighbor. This brings Jehovah’s approval, good relations with one’s neighbors and a resulting good conscience. It is a basic requirement for life in God’s new order. (Colossians 3:9; Revelation 21:8)​—1/15, pp. 4, 5.
□ What flavor does Mark’s Gospel introduce in describing the life and personality of Jesus?
Mark’s account of Jesus’ activity transmits a sense of immediacy and urgency. And yet, coupled with the description of fast-moving events in preaching and miracle-healing, Jesus is shown to be very understanding and compassionate. (Mark 10:13-16)​—1/15, pp. 28-30.
□ How can the Psalms be of great comfort to all of God’s servants?
Regardless of what his situation might be during a time of test, the servant of Jehovah can use the inspired thoughts in certain Psalms while making his prayerful appeal for help and guidance. This can bring him much comfort and encouragement.​—2/1, p. 30.
□ What unique features stand out in the book of Luke?
Luke describes Jesus’ miracles and other events from a doctor’s viewpoint, using medical expressions and descriptions. He shows a sympathetic interest in women and also gives special attention to Jesus’ prayers. The “good news” that he writes about is for all peoples; so his Gospel has a universal appeal.​—2/15, pp. 12-15.
□ What is involved in being a good neighbor?
A good neighbor needs to be thoughtful, understanding and to show a friendly concern for all, especially when he sees someone in need. (Luke 10:29-37) On the other hand, discernment and balance are needed so as to avoid oversocializing, which might lead to engaging in local gossip. (1 Timothy 5:13)​—3/15, pp. 5-7.

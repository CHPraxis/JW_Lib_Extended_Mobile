<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>The month of April will provide many of us with a fine opportunity to serve as auxiliary pioneers. As we thus spend more time in service distributing the special magazines, we will be able to acquaint many persons in the territory with the Kingdom message.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Sisters who are housewives may need to make substantial adjustments in their regular schedules. For example, those with children will have to take them and their needs into consideration. The older children might be able to help in making breakfast or caring for other responsibilities around the home, even doing some of the shopping so that mother can have more time for field service. With pre-school children there is often much greater flexibility. Can they be taken along in service? What about a number of parents taking turns to care for very young children as there may be a need? If automobiles are available for service, could you take along a lunch and eat it in the car to make for better use of time available during the day? Of course, on weekends children out of school can go along in field service.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Those who must work full-time at a secular job would have to make good use of time before and/or after work in order to be auxiliary pioneers in April. Would your employer grant you some adjustments in your daily work hours? Why not consult with him on this? Also plan full days of service on weekends. Get an early start and try to work until late in the day, having in mind contacting the greatest number of persons.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>For those who are going to school there are many possibilities not only before and after the regular school hours, but possibly during some of the time while at school. What about using recess periods and lunch time for witnessing to others? Some may be able to witness while commuting to and from work or riding on the school bus. Others may strike up conversations while waiting for public transportation or walking to school. Again, weekends and evenings should be used to the full. Perhaps arrangements can be made with other publishers of school age to work out a schedule and pioneer together in April.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>So regardless of your personal circumstances, strive to have a full share in field service. Utilize those times when you can talk to the greatest number of people. Evenings and weekends are fine times to find people at home. During the daytime on weekdays we may approach them also in business areas or on the streets. Our purpose in spending time in field service is to find and talk to people wherever they may be.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Those who have rural territory may find it best to work things out somewhat differently from those who witness in city territory. If you can enroll as an auxiliary pioneer for April, now is the time to finalize your plans and turn in your application. May Jehovah bless your careful planning.</p>

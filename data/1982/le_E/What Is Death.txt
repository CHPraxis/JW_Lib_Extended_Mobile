What Is Death?
15 When man dies, he returns to the dust. He does not know anything anymore.—Psalm 146:4
Dead people cannot talk to you or do anything.—Ecclesiastes 9:5, 10
16 But many angels became bad. Now they pretend to be people who have died. They want to make us believe we do not really die.—Genesis 6:1, 2; Jude 6
17 So Jehovah God does not want us to believe those bad angels, called demons.—Exodus 22:18; Deuteronomy 18:10, 11; 32:17
He does not want us to carry on voodoo, witchcraft or juju.—Galatians 5:19-21

Will God Destroy Bad People Again?
22 People today are very bad, too. What bad things are being done here?
23 Some kill other people. God says you must not do this.—Exodus 20:13; 1 John 3:11, 12
24 Some steal. God says you must not steal.—Exodus 20:15; Ephesians 4:28
25 Some people marry many wives. Others live with two or more women in separate homes. Still other couples live together without being married at all. This is all against what the Bible says.—Matthew 19:4-6; 1 Corinthians 7:1-4; 1 Timothy 3:1, 2
26 Do you remember that God gave Adam only one wife?—Genesis 2:22, 24
27 Some worship idols. God says you must not use idols or images in worship.—Exodus 20:4, 5; Isaiah 44:9-17; 1 John 5:21
28 Jehovah will destroy the bad ones who do not change.—Psalm 37:9, 10; Luke 13:5; 1 Corinthians 6:9, 10

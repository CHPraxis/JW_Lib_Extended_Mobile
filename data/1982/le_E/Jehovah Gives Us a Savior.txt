Jehovah Gives Us a Savior
29 The first spirit person God made was like a firstborn son to him.
God loves him very much and will use him to destroy bad people and save obedient ones.—John 3:16, 36
30 Jehovah sent his Son to be born on earth. He was named Jesus. His mother’s name was Mary.—Luke 1:30-35
31 When Jesus grew up he taught many good things. He taught that Jehovah alone is the true God.—Mark 12:29, 30
Jesus said that we should worship only Jehovah.—Matthew 4:10; John 4:23, 24
He also taught people about Jehovah’s kingdom.—Luke 17:20, 21
32 Jesus healed the sick and did many good things. He did not do bad things.—Acts 10:38; 1 Peter 2:21, 22
But how would he save us from sin and death?
33 He had to offer a sacrifice to God to save good people. In the past, God told people to sacrifice animals for their sins.—Hebrews 7:25, 27
34 Jesus did not sacrifice animals. He gave himself as a sacrifice for us.—Matthew 20:28; Hebrews 10:12
Do you know why?

Why Does Man Die?
8 Jehovah God wanted man to make the whole earth beautiful—a paradise for all to enjoy.—Genesis 1:28
Humans could have lived forever, if Adam and Eve had obeyed Jehovah. They were told not to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and bad.—Genesis 2:15-17
9 An angel became bad and used a serpent to cause Eve and Adam to disobey God.—Genesis 3:1-6
10 The angel that deceived Eve came to be called ‘the original serpent, Devil and Satan.’—Revelation 12:9
11 Jehovah drove that disobedient pair out of paradise.—Genesis 3:23, 24
12 Adam and Eve had children, but the whole family was not happy.—Genesis 3:17, 18
13 They had to grow old and die, as Jehovah had said.—Genesis 3:19; Romans 5:12
14 So they died like the animals.
All souls on earth die.—Ecclesiastes 3:18-20; Ezekiel 18:4

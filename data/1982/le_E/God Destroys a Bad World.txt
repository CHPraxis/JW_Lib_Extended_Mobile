God Destroys a Bad World
18 Adam’s offspring became many. They also became very bad. God decided to destroy them.—Genesis 6:1, 5, 7
19 But there was a good man named Noah.—Genesis 6:8, 9
Jehovah God told him to build a very big boat in which he and his family would be saved when the bad people were being destroyed. This boat was shaped like a big box. It was called an ark.—Genesis 6:13, 14
20 They took many animals into the ark.—Genesis 6:19-21
21 Jehovah caused a very big rain to fall. All the bad people died. Those in the ark were saved. Do you know why?—Genesis 6:17; 7:11, 12, 21; 1 Peter 3:10-12

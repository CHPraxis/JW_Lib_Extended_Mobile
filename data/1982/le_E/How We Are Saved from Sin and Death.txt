How We Are Saved from Sin and Death
35 Do you remember that Adam, the first man, sinned? He lost life and paradise, and all of us die, too, because we are his children.—Romans 5:12; 3:23
36 We could get back this perfect life, if another perfect man gave up his life for us, or ransomed us from death.—1 Corinthians 15:45; Romans 5:19, 21
37 Jesus was God’s Son. He was a perfect man. He did not sin.—Hebrews 5:9; 7:26
38 He allowed himself to be killed by people who did not love God.—Acts 2:23
This was a sacrifice of himself for us.—1 Timothy 2:6
39 Jesus was buried in a carved-out cave or tomb. He was dead for three days. Then God raised him up.—Acts 2:24
40 He went back to heaven. He can now ask God to help those who obey God.—Hebrews 9:24; 1 John 2:1, 2

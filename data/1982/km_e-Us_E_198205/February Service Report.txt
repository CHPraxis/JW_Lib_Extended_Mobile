For a midwinter month February’s service report is very encouraging. The total number of publishers is the highest for this service year and second only to the all-time peak reached last August. Another outstanding feature of the report shows 17,619 more home Bible studies were conducted compared to a year ago. May Jehovah give the increase as we zealously press forward with our Kingdom ministry.

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>15 min: </strong>Briefly review Topic for Conversation with congregation. Then discuss highlights and talking points in current magazines. What good field points have you noted? Demonstrate two brief magazine presentations highlighting (1) ‘Kingdom’ articles from May 1 issue, and (2) the articles on women in the May 8 issue. Point out that such magazine presentations can easily be combined with Topic for Conversation to make subscription offer during regular service or when special interest is found. Also, remind brothers to read article “What’s Happening in the Schools?” in May 8 <em>Awake! </em>Much good would be accomplished if parents encouraged their school-age children to place copies of this issue with their teachers as well as school principals.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn"><strong>10 min: </strong>Talk based on article on <a class="xt" data-xtid="1" href="jwpub://p/E:101982085/1-8">page 10 of February 8, 1982, <em>Awake!</em></a> “Holy Spirit at Work Today.”</p>

May 15 <em>Watchtower </em>contains “The Signs of the Times—What Do They Mean to You?” May 22 <em>Awake! </em>has as the cover theme “Sports—Why the Increasing Violence?” Many have found they can interest householder by simply asking the question: “Have you ever wondered why . . . ” and then lead into a current magazine article. If you have specific points to show, interest is often aroused so persons will want to know more.</p>

<p id="p27" data-pid="27" class="sn"><strong>16 min: </strong>Over the years many have associated with the truth, perhaps attending meetings for a time or even becoming publishers, but then drifted away for one reason or another. Elder can give brief talk highlighting points from May 1, 1982, <em>Watchtower </em>article ‘Return to the Shepherd of Your Souls.’ Encourage study conductors to cooperate with the service overseer and secretary in arranging visits on those who might appreciate this article. We want to leave it with them, perhaps study it with them if convenient and give them encouragement to come to meetings. By working with the service overseer and secretary we can avoid a duplication of effort. However, any publisher who has someone in mind needing help might suggest it to the secretary so that none are missed. Prepare two demonstrations by qualified publishers to illustrate application of points in talk. One can show publisher just leaving the magazine and encouraging former associate to read the article and come to meetings, possibly referring to <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:2:20-20:2:22" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Proverbs 2:20-22</a> to show need to keep close to Jehovah. The next demonstration can show publisher being invited into home, presenting magazine and suggesting they spend a little time going through the material. Publisher then proceeds with study of the article.</p>

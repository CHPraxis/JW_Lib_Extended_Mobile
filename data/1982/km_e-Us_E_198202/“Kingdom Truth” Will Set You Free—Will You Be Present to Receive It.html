<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb"><sup>1 </sup>To those who believed in him, Jesus stated, “. . . and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:8:31-43:8:32" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 8:31, 32</a>) With this thought in mind and in harmony with the wise man’s words at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:4:18-20:4:18" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Proverbs 4:18</a>, that “the path of the righteous ones is like the bright light that is getting lighter and lighter until the day is firmly established,” plans are now under way to provide a spiritually encouraging and enlightening program at this year’s “Kingdom Truth” District Conventions.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>We are confident that the “faithful and discreet slave” will again give needed direction toward remaining faithful to Jehovah in these critical times, and at the same time encouragement to boldly proclaim the ‘truth’ of His Word the Bible. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:47" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45-47</a>) To make it convenient for everyone who is a ‘lover of truth’ to attend, over 100 conventions are being arranged as outlined on page 6, as well as in the March 1 <em>Watchtower </em>(English). Additionally, we are providing the following information to enable you to make your arrangements to attend, as well as to assist others to be there with you.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="ss"><strong>SELECTING YOUR CONVENTION</strong></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>In most cases, you will be attending at the location nearest to your congregation, or where two or more conventions are being held at the same location, on the dates recommended for your circuit or portion thereof. Please find listed on page 6, in date order, each convention city and the circuits, or parts of circuits, recommended to attend each convention.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>Those circuits in the chart marked with an asterisk (*) may have some congregations located a little closer to another convention city, but it would be best, if possible, to attend at the location indicated so as to prevent unnecessary crowding.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Where the chart indicates that a portion of a circuit attend at a particular location, such as <sup>1⁄2 </sup>or <sup>1⁄4</sup>, it simply means that those congregations in the part of the circuit closest to that convention would attend where indicated, but the rest of the circuit would attend another convention closest to them as shown elsewhere on the list.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Your determination to be among those attending the “Kingdom Truth” District Conventions will be richly rewarded as you examine in more detail the ‘truth’ and personally experience the light getting brighter and brighter. Strive to be on hand for every session so that you do not miss any of these fine points.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="ss"><strong>ROOMING ARRANGEMENTS</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>If you will be needing rooming accommodations, you should make your own arrangements directly with the hotel/motel and with the information that will be provided by the convention through the congregation. In most cases you will pay much less than the regular rates charged by the hotel/motel since the convention has arranged for a large number of rooms to be set aside for this purpose. Already the managers of good quality hotels and motels in the convention cities have been contacted and the best rates possible have been negotiated with them for those attending each convention. A number of rooms in each of these hotels and motels have been blocked off to be assigned by the hotel/motel only to those identifying themselves as Jehovah’s Witnesses or as delegates attending the Watchtower Convention. In most cases, by the middle of January 1982, your congregation will have received a list of convention-city hotels and motels that are cooperating closely with the Society’s rooming arrangement. It will show the address of the facility, its agreed-upon rates to those attending the convention and the phone number to be used in making your reservations, along with other information. PLEASE NOTE: The program this year will not start until 1:30 P.M. on Thursday, so saving lodging expenses for many.</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sb"><span id="page4" class="pageNum" data-no="4" data-before-text="4"></span><sup>8 </sup><strong>WHAT YOU SHOULD DO: </strong>As soon as your congregation receives the list of hotels and motels from the convention organization you should select the facility where you would prefer to stay. Then phone the hotel or motel <em>immediately, </em>identifying yourself as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses or as a delegate attending the Watchtower Convention. Doing so will qualify you for the agreed-upon rates listed. One night’s deposit (credit card, cashier’s check or money order) will be required at all locations and should be sent to them as soon as your reservations are confirmed. This deposit should be sent to the hotel or motel directly, well in advance of the cutoff date listed on the sheet(s) received from the rooming department. <em>Motels and/or hotels are not obligated to hold the rooms without a deposit or extend the special rates beyond the cutoff date. </em>If you find it necessary to cancel your accommodation you should write or phone the hotel/motel directly, doing so as far in advance as possible. This makes the room available to other delegates who may desire the accommodation. The convention rooming department will provide additional information through the congregation, such as which hotels/motels are filled after a month or two, as well as any additional ones it may find necessary to add to the list. If the hotel/motel you call first is filled, then it will be necessary for you to call the next one you have selected from the list, and so on.</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup><strong>DORMITORIES: </strong>A few conventions find it necessary to use school dormitories in order to accommodate all those attending. In most cases, the congregations will receive information on these a month or so after the first hotel/motel listing is sent. Those needing accommodations of this type should follow through in accord with the instructions set out on the list that will be sent to the congregations.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup><strong>SPECIAL NEEDS: </strong>Most arrangements to care for those with special needs have customarily originated at the local congregation where they attend. Elders and others who are aware of such circumstances have lovingly extended help to these ones, which is commendable. This has often involved taking others with them in their own group—those in full-time service, the elderly, infirm or needy ones. Also, they have cared for their needs in other ways, such as assisting them in making arrangements or even aiding them financially, where possible and as needed. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:15-59:2:17" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Jas. 2:15-17;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/62:3:17-62:3:18" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 1 John 3:17, 18</a>) We are confident that loving concern will continue to be shown to all such lovers of truth. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:13:35-43:13:35" data-bid="5-1" class="b">John 13:35;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:10-48:6:10" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> Gal. 6:10</a>) However, the convention rooming department will function to provide rooming accommodations for those with special needs who can neither be cared for by themselves nor by those in the congregation where they attend. These may ask the convention coordinator in their congregation for a Special Needs Room Request Form, at the same time discussing their situation with him. Those with special needs are the only ones that should use this form. They should fill it out and return it to the convention coordinator to be checked for completeness, accuracy and verification of circumstances. Even though he forwards it to the convention rooming department, the individual(s) will be notified of the accommodation directly by the rooming department. This should be done well ahead of the convention. (The one with special needs should <em>not </em>simply go to the convention and request a room when he arrives, because the convention rooming department needs the convention coordinator’s verification of the circumstances.)</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Please keep in mind that private home accommodations are usually set aside for those with limited funds who would experience real hardship if such accommodations were not made available. They are not intended for those who want free or inexpensive rooms just to save money, such as for a vacation. Also, private home accommodations are for the convention period <em>only. </em>It hardly seems proper to presume upon the hospitality of our brothers by expecting them to accommodate delegates for extra days so as to visit vacation spots or do other things before or after the convention.</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup><strong>DELEGATES ATTENDING OUT OF THE ASSIGNED AREA: </strong>District conventions are arranged at many locations to reduce the travel required in order to attend. In nearly <span id="page5" class="pageNum" data-no="5" data-before-text="5"></span>every case, the location recommended for you to attend is the one nearest your congregation. Seating, literature, food orders, and so forth, are planned on the premise that the majority will attend the convention to which they are assigned. However, a few for various reasons may choose to attend a location other than the one recommended for their congregation. Such individuals may ask the convention coordinator in their congregation for the address of the convention headquarters where they wish to attend. These addresses are listed on the back of the Special Needs Room Request Form. Unless these persons have special needs, they should <em>not </em>use the Special Needs Room Request Form. Rather, they should write to the convention headquarters where they wish to attend and request a copy of the hotel/motel listing for that location, sending a stamped, self-addressed envelope along with this request. Upon receipt of this listing of hotels/motels they should proceed just as if they were using the listing for their local area.</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup><strong>YOUR COOPERATION APPRECIATED: </strong>The smoothness with which this rooming arrangement functions will depend largely on the cooperation of everyone involved. For instance, if a number of delegates attempt to make a hotel/motel reservation on their own before receiving the listing of facilities that are cooperating with the convention rooming department, it could cause a breakdown in some negotiations. This could occur at locations used year after year where brothers, based on rumor or assumption, have been accustomed to making very early reservations. Also, it could result in difficulties if a large number of delegates choose not to use the hotels and motels listed but, for one reason or another, make their own arrangements with facilities that have not cooperated fully with the convention rooming arrangement. We hope to make the listing broad enough to give a choice of good quality accommodations and yet give preference to the hotels/motels that give the best cooperation. Our aim with this rooming arrangement is to see that delegates are accommodated as comfortably and economically as possible, so as to be refreshed and able to enjoy fully the convention program.</p>
<p id="p17" data-pid="17" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup><strong>SIGN LANGUAGE SESSIONS: </strong>This year, sign language translation will be provided <em>only </em>at 16 specific convention cities as shown in the accompanying chart, and <em>not </em>at other conventions. It is our hope that arranging for large groups will allow for wider Christian fellowship and at the same time greatly improve the quality of translation.</p>
<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="si"><strong>TO THE BODY OF ELDERS</strong></p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="si">Upon receipt of this insert, it will be the responsibility of the convention coordinator to meet with the presiding overseer before the next service meeting. They can determine from the circuit list shown which city and dates their congregation is to attend, based on the circuit or portion thereof that the congregation is in as of February 1, 1982. (If the coordinator is caring for both positions, he should meet with another member of the congregation service committee.) Where a fraction of a circuit (<sup>1⁄2</sup>, <sup>1⁄4 </sup>and so forth) is involved, they should determine whether their congregation is part of the fraction nearest to that convention and, if so, plan on attending there. Then, please announce at the next service meeting as well as the following <em>Watchtower </em>study the location and dates recommended by the Society for the congregation. It may be good to underline on the circuit list the recommended convention city and dates the congregation is to attend, and post that portion of the insert on the information board.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="si">In nearly every case, the elder serving as the convention coordinator will be conducting the service meeting part covering this insert as scheduled, as well as making other announcements and handling convention material on the meetings. This will serve to acquaint the congregation with their convention coordinator. When covering this insert it would be good to read the key numbered paragraphs that apply to your congregation. All the elders will want to cooperate fully, offering suggestions to assure the prompt, enthusiastic and effective handling of convention-related material. We appreciate very much your enthusiastic support of and kind attention to these matters.</p>

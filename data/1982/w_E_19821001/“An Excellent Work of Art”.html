<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what the magazine <em>Dimanche, journal de l’île de la Réunion </em>said of <em>My Book of Bible Stories </em>in its weekly international edition of July 23 to 29, 1981. The article, among other things, explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“To begin with it is necessary to say: even if Jehovah’s Witnesses are those who sell it, this book is not dealing with the religious point of view of this congregation. It is just as it’s name indicates, a collection of Bible stories. No more!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“It has been acquired by many Catholic priests who wish to use it for their teaching of sacred history. That is sufficient to cut short any controversy.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“The book’s purpose is to teach history, as seen through the Bible, and it is directed to young people. The chosen methods are admirably adapted as concerns: a short text, in well defined chapters, easily understood by the young from 8 years of age. Its simple but high quality illustrations, along with modern techniques of teaching, are an aid to easily memorize and understand the text. The collection is pleasingly bound (almost luxurious) not too bulky to discourage the young, it is altogether fascinating. I tried it out with my own daughter. It works . . . and she asks questions afterward. Even to understand the history of ancient times regardless of your religious background, it is well worth having.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“The book costs only 15 francs, and this is already a pleasant surprise. So, if it is offered to you, you can accept it with confidence. In fact, the printing of this remarkable work is not unlimited, and the copies are quickly taken up.”</p>

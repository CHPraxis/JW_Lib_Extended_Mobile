<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">“Blameless as Lightbearers Amid a Twisted Generation” is the theme of our current circuit assembly program, soon to conclude. This excellent program is providing “food at the proper time.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:45-40:24:45" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matt. 24:45</a>) Those with good spiritual eyesight can see that our present generation is “crooked and twisted.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:2:15-50:2:15" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Phil. 2:15</a>) Useful counsel and suggestions were given on how to avoid any involvement that would bring upon us Jehovah’s disfavor.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The theme for the fall series of circuit assemblies starting in September is “Making the Truth Manifest in Our Lives.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:2-47:4:2" data-bid="3-1" class="b">2 Cor. 4:2</a>) Do we really know the truth and are we practicing it in our lives? The program is designed to offer practical help in both of these areas—<em>knowing </em>and <em>living </em>the truth. Pioneering will be highlighted, especially for younger ones. Information related to handling objections in the field and helping school children to combat the theory of evolution will be considered. The part, “By Keeping Strict Watch on How We Walk” will emphasize the need for each of us to watch carefully how he is building spiritual qualities in both himself and in those with whom he studies. The public talk is entitled: “How Does the Truth Affect Your Life?” It will be followed by two discourses: “Living Today With Soundness of Mind” and “Walking Orderly in the Truth With Jehovah’s Organization.” We urge you not to miss any of this excellent assembly program.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">In obedience to our Lord’s command 1,499,284 attended the Memorial celebration on April 8, 1982, here in the US. This is an all-time peak, surpassing our attendance in 1981 by 36,214. There were 4,206 partakers at the Memorial this year. In view of the excellent attendance we once again have impressed upon us that there are many who need to be taught by Jehovah in order to become actively associated with us in ‘worshiping the Father with spirit and truth.’—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:23-43:4:24" data-bid="1-1" class="b">John 4:23, 24</a>.</p>

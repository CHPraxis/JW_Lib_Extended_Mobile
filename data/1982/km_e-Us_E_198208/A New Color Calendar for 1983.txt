A New Color Calendar for 1983
An illustrated calendar for 1983 has been prepared that is both beautiful and practical. It will feature six large four-color pictures on Kingdom-preaching themes, showing two months under each picture. When opened for wall hanging it will measure approximately 11-3/8 inches by 17-1/2 inches.
In addition to the yeartext and Memorial date, it lists field service days to help us to regularly share with the congregation in group witnessing. As a reminder to keep up with our Bible reading, it provides the weekly schedule. It also lists the dates for our written reviews so that we can prepare for a fuller share in this feature of the Theocratic Ministry School. You can readily appreciate the spiritual benefits these features provide.
The calendar will be printed in English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese and Spanish. Calendars are 75c each. There is no pioneer rate. Please order the quantity you desire through the literature servant, as it is a controlled stock item and will not be stocked by the congregation. Because of the high cost of postage, we would request that orders be combined through the congregation, rather than sent individually to the Society. The initial congregation order should be mailed with the July remittance by August 6, 1982, or no later than August 15, using the Special Calendar Order form (S-5) that has been sent to each congregation. This will assure your receiving the 1983 calendar in good time.

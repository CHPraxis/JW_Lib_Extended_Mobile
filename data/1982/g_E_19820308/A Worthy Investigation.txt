A Worthy Investigation
A chief justice of the United States Supreme Court, Salmon Portland Chase, once made an impartial investigation of the Bible. What decision did he reach?
“There came a time in my life when I doubted the divinity of the Scriptures, and I resolved as a lawyer and a judge I would try the book as I would try anything in the courtroom, taking evidence for and against. It was a long, serious, and profound study: and using the same principles of evidence in this religious matter as I always do in secular matters, I have come to the decision that the Bible is a supernatural book, that it has come from God, and that the only safety for the human race is to follow its teachings.”​—The Book of Books: An Introduction, p. 194.
But why take somebody else’s word one way or the other? If you have not already done so, why not examine the facts for yourself?

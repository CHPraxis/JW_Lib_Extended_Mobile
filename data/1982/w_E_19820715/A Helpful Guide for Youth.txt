A Helpful Guide for Youth
Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It
The book Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It has had a tremendous distribution of over eighteen million copies during the past six years. Why? The comments of one reader of it give some idea. He wrote:
“It’s obvious to most of us that youth have many temptations and difficult decisions to face. Often parents are also very confused as to their role and lack a source of information to guide them. I’ve just read a book Youth, Getting the Best out of It, put out by Jehovah’s Witnesses, that has much good advice for people of all religions. . . . I’m not ‘plugging’ that religion in its entirety, but when they have something good to offer, I believe it wisdom to take advantage of it.”

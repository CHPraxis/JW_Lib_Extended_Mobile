<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The book <em>Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It </em>has had a tremendous distribution of over eighteen million copies during the past six years. Why? The comments of one reader of it give some idea. He wrote:</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“It’s obvious to most of us that youth have many temptations and difficult decisions to face. Often parents are also very confused as to their role and lack a source of information to guide them. I’ve just read a book <em>Youth, Getting the Best out of It, </em>put out by Jehovah’s Witnesses, that has much good advice for people of all religions. . . . I’m not ‘plugging’ that religion in its entirety, but when they have something good to offer, I believe it wisdom to take advantage of it.”</p>

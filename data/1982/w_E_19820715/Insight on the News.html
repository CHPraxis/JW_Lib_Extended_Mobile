<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">One in three Toronto residents under the age of thirty-five believes there will be a nuclear war in his lifetime and 74 percent of all surveyed do not expect to survive such a war, according to a Gallup poll taken for Canada’s <em>Toronto Star.</em> Commenting on the psychological effect that fear of nuclear war has on society, one twenty-seven-year-old stated: “They’re paralysed by anxiety. It’s the terrible insecurity of not knowing if it will happen and the paranoia and fear of knowing you can’t control any of it.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“The biggest and most tragic effect is that so many people live as though we didn’t have a future,” said one woman in the report. “The whole philosophy of living for the moment, living selfishly for today, is fuelled by this sometimes unconscious realization that we can no longer assume the human race will be around next generation. People have always assumed they’d have a future; now they’re not so sure and they’re getting angry.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">The fact that people would “become faint out of fear and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth” was foreseen by Jesus Christ. Would Christians also share this paralyzing fear of the future? Jesus said: “But as these things start to occur, raise yourselves erect and lift your heads up, because your deliverance is getting near.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:25-42:21:28" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Luke 21:25-28</a>.</p>

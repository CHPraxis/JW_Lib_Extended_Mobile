<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">This year the annual meeting of the members of Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania will be held at the Assembly Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses, Norval, Ontario, Canada, on Saturday, October 2, 1982. The assembly hall is located approximately six miles from the Canada branch, which is in Georgetown.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">The Canada branch advises that it has not been able to secure a large facility for the annual meeting and that the available seating at the assembly hall is comparatively limited. For this reason the branch has arranged that admission to the annual meeting will be by invitation only and is giving priority to the membership of Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania and their immediate families, as well as a good cross section of representatives from all across Canada. The Canada branch advises that those members who are planning to attend may correspond directly with the branch office in respect to rooming accommodations in neighboring hotels and motels, as well as some accommodations in the homes of brothers in the area. Members can write to Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, Box 4100, Georgetown, Ontario, Canada L7G 4Y4. Each member who is going to attend the annual meeting in person should promptly write to the branch, informing them as to how many family members will accompany him. The branch asks that all this information be received from the members who are going to attend the annual meeting in person not later than August 15, 1982; so please write the branch immediately, giving all information.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The regular letters of notice of the annual meeting, together with the proxies, will be sent to the members earlier than usual this year so that we can receive them back from the members not later than August 15, 1982. As each member knows, he should complete and return his proxy promptly whether he is going to be at the meeting personally or not. The information given on each proxy should be definite on this point, as it will be relied upon in determining in advance those who will actually be personally present. The Secretary’s office does not need information regarding members of the family that will accompany the member.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">So all members will need to return their proxies promptly after receipt, and, additionally, those members who are going to attend the annual meeting in Canada will need to write also to the Canada branch, giving the necessary information, so that this reaches the branch not later than the 15th of August 1982.</p>

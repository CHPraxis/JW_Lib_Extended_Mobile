<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">It is reported that the big movie <em>Annie </em>was originally rated G. The producer worried that a G rating would not draw well. He asked that one of Carol Burnett’s lines be rewritten to include a “G‐‐ D‐‐‐.” This was done and the movie was reclassified PG. Now, the reasoning went, it would appeal more to the new-morality public.​—<em>New York Sunday News Magazine, </em>May 16, 1982.</p>

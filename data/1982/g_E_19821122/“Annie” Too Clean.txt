“Annie” Too Clean
It is reported that the big movie Annie was originally rated G. The producer worried that a G rating would not draw well. He asked that one of Carol Burnett’s lines be rewritten to include a “G‐‐ D‐‐‐.” This was done and the movie was reclassified PG. Now, the reasoning went, it would appeal more to the new-morality public.​—New York Sunday News Magazine, May 16, 1982.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="ss"><span id="page2" class="pageNum" data-no="2" data-before-text="2"></span><strong>ARMAGEDDON—Not a Reason to Fear, but to Hope!</strong></p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">World events in fulfillment of prophecy show that we are deep into the “last days,” in “critical times hard to deal with.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:3:1-55:3:5" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Timothy 3:1-5</a>) This means that we are nearing the Biblical “Armageddon.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:16:16-66:16:16" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Revelation 16:16</a>) The magazine <em>Family Weekly </em>noted that many “believe that the social order is collapsing, with Armageddon just around the corner.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">However, the approach of Armageddon should not be a cause for fear, but for real hope! Why? Because Armageddon is God’s war to cleanse the earth of all wickedness, paving the way for a bright, prosperous new order! The Bible explains that then the righteous “will possess the earth, and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:37:11-19:37:11" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Psalm 37:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">With bad conditions forever gone, every day of life then will be a delight. Not even sickness or death will mar the happiness of people. God will “wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:4-66:21:4" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Revelation 21:4</a>.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="ss"><span id="page3" class="pageNum" data-no="3" data-before-text="3"></span><strong>How can you be confident that a better world is near?</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Millions of people have gained such confidence by regularly reading <em>The Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>Each year more than 400 million copies are printed in over 100 languages. These magazines point readers to the fulfillment of Bible prophecies that show how Armageddon will soon open the way to eternal blessings for all lovers of righteousness.</p>

<p id="p32" data-pid="32" class="sb">“I wanted to tell you that I think your magazines are very interesting and also very helpful when it comes to finding out Bible principles. . . . I’m a Catholic and I don’t think I’ve ever heard or seen the Bible and its glorious message proclaimed in quite the way the Witnesses do it. Even though people are prejudiced and though the times are hard, I hope that you will be able to continue in your work. I’ve been to different churches and it feels good knowing that there’s someone out there who doesn’t beat around the bush when it comes to the Bible and its meaning. It’s a refreshing change.”</p>

‘It Says It All’
“Let Your Kingdom Come,” in its brief 192 pages, presents the theme of the entire Bible. “This new book ‘says it all,’” writes a reader, “and backs it up with the most marvelous factual and historical foundation as to put the end goal clearly and brilliantly in view. . . . It presents the whole, dramatic contest, the intrigue, the issues, the enormous question, of rightful sovereignty not just for us but before the whole universe.”

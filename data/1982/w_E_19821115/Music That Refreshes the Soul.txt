Music That Refreshes the Soul
Certain music really does. Many persons, for example, say this regarding the Kingdom Melodies, recorded on cassette tapes. Regarding one of these, a family wrote:
“We play this tape over and over in our home and car, and never tire of the stirring arrangements. Often it has provided the right peaceful mood when getting ready for Christian meetings or when traveling to an assembly. This musical entertainment has replaced many hours of music or television that is not so upbuilding.
“We understand that producing this tape must have taken many people working many hours. But the professional quality achieved testifies to the loving dedication of everyone involved. The anonymous musicians deserve our applause even though they never hear it.”
You, too, can enjoy these stirring musical arrangements. The two cassettes, Kingdom Melodies 1 and Kingdom Melodies 2, each costs only $2 (US), and each has a playing time of one hour. Receive the casettes listed below simply by filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon.

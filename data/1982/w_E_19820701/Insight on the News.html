<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Increased sexual activity among youths has prompted many governments to make contraceptives available to teenagers. How wise is this? The <em>British Medical Journal </em>recently observed: “Providing contraception to under age people without doubt implies a condoning attitude to sexual activity.” But is such an attitude really in the best interests of youth?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Evidence shows teenage pregnancy to be harmful,” answers the <em>Journal. </em>“There is less schooling, reduced job prospects and a high divorce rate. There is no evidence that intercourse is at all beneficial to children and as sexual activity is both instinctive and learned behaviour, it is similar to the problem of drug abuse. Early sexual behaviour does not lead to a better sexual experience later in life, improved learning or improved job performance. It probably does lead to inability to form a sound and permanent marriage. . . . The only consistent way to reduce the harm from under age sex is to concentrate all efforts in preventing sexual intercourse.”</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Similarly, a world-famous American sex educator, Dr. Sol Gordon, said recently at a meeting of sex educators: “I can’t think of any good reason for teenagers to have sex. Sex is a health hazard to boys and girls.” Calling teen sex a “national social disaster,” he said that “without information and education, too many teenagers are not equipped to say no.” That guidance and education best comes from parents who make clear God’s view of sex outside marriage. Teenagers need to heed what the apostle Paul told the young man Timothy: “Flee from the desires incidental to youth, but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, along with those who call upon the Lord out of a clean heart.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:2:22-55:2:22" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Timothy 2:22</a>.</p>

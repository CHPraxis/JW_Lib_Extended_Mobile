<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That’s what an attorney said as he took the book <em>Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation? </em>from the hand of the woman offering it to him. He had never really questioned the creation account, but admitted that he had not been taught a logical line of reasoning to support creation.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">After reading the book, the attorney and his family were eager to study the Bible. Soon the whole family was attending Christian meetings. Since then they have often commented on how the <em>Evolution </em>book changed their lives.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Have you thoroughly investigated whether the theory of evolution has a real foundation in fact? Are you willing to check it out? You can do so in the 192-page book <em>Did Man Get Here by Evolution or by Creation?</em></p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sn"><strong>25 min: </strong>Manifesting Christian Manners. Elder reviews with audience participation the following points related to good manners:</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sn">(2 min.) Good manners have been defined as showing consideration in little things such as being punctual, asking before borrowing things that belong to others, giving thanks and saying “please,” and so forth. The basic underlying principle is love.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn">(10 min.) In the congregation: Families with small children show consideration for others by taking seats in the rear so as not to disturb others. When babies cry, consideration and good manners are demonstrated by parents if they temporarily withdraw from the main auditorium to calm the child. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:7:12-40:7:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Matthew 7:12</a>.) Christian manners rule out talking while the meeting is in progress, arriving late for meetings or allowing children to interrupt the meeting by frequent and unnecessary trips to the rest room or by their running at any time in the Kingdom Hall. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:1-21:3:1" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Eccl. 3:1,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/21:3:7-21:3:7" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:14:40-46:14:40" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> 1 Cor. 14:40</a>) When attending the book study, it would be appropriate to dress as when attending the regular meetings at the Kingdom Hall.</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="sn">(8 min.) In field service: Christian manners require that one be presentable when in field service — neat, clean, shoes shined, hair combed, clothing pressed. A sincere and friendly smile and greeting are also part of Christian manners. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:10:5-42:10:5" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Luke 10:5</a>) When preaching on busy streets it is necessary to be tactful, friendly, not shouting, not overly insistent, not interfering with the flow of passersby. When making return visits, show appreciation for the hospitality extended by maintaining a proper reserve, avoiding the tendency to become unduly familiar.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/50:1:27-50:1:27" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Phil. 1:27</a>.</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sn">(5 min.) The fact that one means well and acts from pure motives does not justify forgetting about Christian manners. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:6:31-42:6:31" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Luke 6:31</a>) Although some may feel that Christian manners are insignificant, they are vital.—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:3-47:6:7" data-bid="8-1" class="b">2 Cor. 6:3-7</a>.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A young Italian couple visiting abroad began discussions of the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses. But soon they began to have doubts about the religious choice they would have to face, and, upon returning to their little town in Italy, they discontinued their Bible study.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Later, the wife’s brother was preparing to get married and the town priest came for a catechistic discussion of the duties of a married couple. During the conversation, which the young couple also joined, the priest took out a little blue book. Surprised recognition struck the couple. Was that book not <em>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life​</em>—the one that Jehovah’s Witnesses often use when holding free family Bible discussions? It certainly was!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The priest held his “catechism” lesson from the book using the chapter “Building a Happy Family Life.” The couple asked about his use of the <em>Truth </em>book and the priest replied that some good could be found even in that book. So the two decided that, if the priest could use the book, they could also study it. They resumed their conversations with the Witnesses and both became dedicated witnesses of Jehovah. Two other members of the family also started associating with the local congregation.</p>

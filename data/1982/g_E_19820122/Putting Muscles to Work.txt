Putting Muscles to Work
Climbing stairs may seem to be unnecessary hard work when elevators are handy, but a researcher in Philadelphia finds that it is one of the best forms of exercise for fitness.
“Walking up stairs burns more energy per minute than almost anything else, except for such strenuous pursuits as dragging logs and sprinting,” says Dr. Kelly Brownell of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.
In terms of burning up calories, walking up stairs is 250 percent more efficient than swimming, 150 percent more than tennis or bowling, and 23 percent better than running.
Just walking up two flights of stairs a day, a person of normal weight can lose up to six pounds a year, while an overweight person can lose 10 to 12 pounds.
So, if you are fitness conscious, boycott the elevators. And take the stairs two at a time for maximum benefit!

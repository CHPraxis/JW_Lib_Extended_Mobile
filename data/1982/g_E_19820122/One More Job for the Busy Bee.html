<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A scientist in British Columbia, Canada, is enlisting the bee to help in prospecting for mineral deposits.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Examining pollen collected by bees near a molybdenum mine, Dr. Harry Warren of the University of British Columbia found 40 times more metal contamination than in pollen collected elsewhere. Similarly, pollen from areas near a copper mine and a zinc smelter contain four to six times more copper and zinc than normal.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“Plants absorb metals from the air and the soil,” explains Dr. Warren. “These metals permeate the plant’s system, including its reproductive organs and the pollen. . . . If you can tell where the bees find the pollen, you can locate the deposits.” As little as half a gram of pollen is enough for the analysis.</p>

Listen to a Thrilling Bible Drama
You can now do this. A cassette recording of a dramatization of the exciting story of God’s deliverance of his people from Egypt is now available. It is called “Jehovah’s Name to Be Declared in All the Earth.” An appreciative mother writes regarding the educational value of this tape recording:
“The tape is a great alternative to TV and the radio. Each time I listen to it, I seem to learn something new. My children have learned a lot from it too. They’ve been taught the Bible stories from infancy. My boy is eight years old and my girl is seven. I thought they knew those stories frontward and backward, yet when we listened to the tape, they asked so many questions. My girl asked, ‘Why is the man hitting the slave?’ ‘Why is Jehovah killing the Egyptians?’ and my boy asked, ‘Is this when the Red Sea parts?’ We stop the tape, answer the questions, and then pick up the story without missing a thing.”
Listen to this thrilling and instructive Bible drama in your home. The cassette is only $2. Playing time: 72 minutes.
Please send, postpaid, the cassette recording “Jehovah’s Name to Be Declared in All the Earth.” I enclose $2 (U.S.).

Truth Found in an Unlikely Place
The following letter from a man in Hartford, Connecticut, was received at the headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses:
To Whom It May Concern:
I want to know if the little book The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life is printed by Jehovah’s Witnesses. Please write and tell me to what religion that book belongs. I am interested in finding out because one morning as I was walking down the main street in Hartford, I found this little book thrown in the garbage. It was the title that attracted my attention. . . .
I am a Catholic because that is the religion my parents made known to me, but not because my conscience tells me so. From what I can see in this book, I believe that I have found what I have been searching for for many years​—The Truth. And I found it in a pile of garbage​—one Friday at 9 o’clock in the morning, on December 4, 1981. Please send me the Hartford address of the church of the religion to which this book belongs. Wishing you a happy new year,
Yours Truly,
A. C. G.

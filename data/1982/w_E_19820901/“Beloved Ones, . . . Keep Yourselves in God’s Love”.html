<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb">JEHOVAH’S undeserved kindness is evident in his dealings with those who love him. Through his inspired Word he shows what he requires of them. And how grateful we can be that a part of God’s Word, the letter of Jude, provides warnings that can help us to maintain a proper relationship with Jehovah God!</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Yet, besides giving needed warnings, Jude shows what we must do to be upbuilt <span id="page18" class="pageNum" data-no="18" data-before-text="18"></span>spiritually and to ‘keep ourselves in God’s love.’ Hence, we will benefit greatly from considering the concluding portion of Jude’s letter.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="ss"><strong>Ridiculers Foretold</strong></p>
<p id="p44" data-pid="44" class="qu"> 3, 4. To what “sayings” of Jesus’ apostles did Jude refer?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>Providing an important reminder, Jude wrote:</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="si">“As for you, beloved ones, call to mind the sayings that have been previously spoken by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, how they used to say to you: ‘In the last time there will be ridiculers, proceeding according to their own desires for ungodly things.’ These are the ones that make separations, animalistic men, not having spirituality.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:17-65:1:19" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Jude 17-19</a>)</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Jude said much to expose the “ungodly men” who slyly crept into the congregation. Then, entreating fellow believers for whom he had great affection, Jude bid them to recall words previously spoken by Jesus’ apostles. Recalling those sayings should have moved all genuine Christians to “put up a hard fight for the faith.”</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" data-rel-pid="[44]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>The apostle Paul warned fellow overseers that from among them men would “rise and speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:29-44:20:30" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Acts 20:29, 30</a>) He told Timothy that ‘in later times some would fall away from the faith.’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/54:4:1-54:4:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">1 Timothy 4:1, 2</a>) And the apostle Peter specifically warned that ‘in the last days there would come ridiculers, saying: “Where is this promised presence of his?”’​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:1-61:3:4" data-bid="5-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:1-4</a>.</p>
<p id="p45" data-pid="45" class="qu"> 5. How may faithful Christians have been treated by the “ungodly men” who had slipped into the congregation, but how should godly persons have reacted to this?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>Hence, recipients of Jude’s letter had good reason to expect “ridiculers” to appear during the period that immediately preceded the end of the Jewish system of things. It was not unlikely that the “ungodly men” who had slipped into the congregation were ridiculing faithful believers who adhered to Jehovah’s righteous standards and would not join the “false brothers” in loose conduct. But it was essential that godly persons “put up a hard fight for the faith,” even though they might have been derided by false teachers who ‘proceeded according to’ and were driven by their own immoral “desires for ungodly things.”​—Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:11:26-47:11:26" data-bid="6-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 11:26;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:2:4-48:2:5" data-bid="6-2" class="b"> Galatians 2:4, 5</a>.</p>
<p id="p46" data-pid="46" class="qu"> 6. Although God assured the unity of those loving him, what did the ungodly ridiculers try to do?</p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[46]" class="sb"><sup>6 </sup>Whereas God, by his spirit, assured the unity of those loving him, those ungodly ridiculers tried to “make separations,” or “distinctions,” endeavoring to carry on a separating work among Jehovah’s people. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:19-65:1:19" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Jude 19</a>, <em>New World Translation, </em>1950 edition, footnote; <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:133:1-19:133:3" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Psalm 133:1-3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:1:10-46:1:10" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 1:10</a>) Although the ridiculers spoke against faithful responsible men in the congregation, the ungodly ones expressed admiration for individuals who could benefit them.

Rather than gathering with the Lord, they tried to scatter. Even today some try to draw the unsteady away into private groups, supposedly for “Bible study.” This could never promote love for God, Christ and the Christian congregation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:23-42:11:23" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Luke 11:23</a>.</p>
<p id="p47" data-pid="47" class="qu"> 7. Why were the “ungodly men” fittingly termed “animalistic”?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[47]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>Those men were fittingly termed “animalistic,” or “soulical,” for they were sentient creatures yielding to fleshly sensations, appetites and inclinations. (Compare <em>Kingdom Interlinear Translation, </em><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:19-65:1:19" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Jude verse 19</a>.) Although they considered themselves spiritually enlightened, Jude described them as “not having spirituality,” or, literally, not having “the spirit.” Actually, those “animalistic men” lacked Jehovah’s spirit, could not comprehend <span id="page19" class="pageNum" data-no="19" data-before-text="19"></span>spiritual matters and scarcely rose above the level of unreasoning beasts. If we have Jehovah’s spirit and understand “the deep things of God,” we should be deeply grateful to our heavenly Father.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:2:6-46:2:16" data-bid="12-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 2:6-16</a>.</p>

<p id="p48" data-pid="48" class="qu"> 8. The expression “most holy faith” may have referred to what?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[48]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>Jude next turned to earnest entreaty, saying:</p>
<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="si">“But you, beloved ones, by building up yourselves on your most holy faith, and praying with holy spirit, keep yourselves in God’s love, while you are waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ with everlasting life in view.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:20-65:1:21" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Jude 20, 21</a>)</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Jude lovingly showed how his cherished fellow believers could remain in the love of Jehovah. Following his counsel certainly would include the cultivating of faith, a fruit of God’s spirit. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:5:22-48:5:23" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Galatians 5:22, 23</a>) But in view of Jude’s earlier reference to fighting for ‘the faith delivered to the holy ones’ (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:3-65:1:3" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Jude vs. 3</a>), the expression “most holy faith” may have referred to the whole range of Christian teachings, including the good news of salvation. The foundation of such true faith is Christ, and it was called “most holy” because it looked to the God of holiness and was based exclusively upon his holy Word.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:20:32-44:20:32" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Acts 20:32;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:3:10-46:3:15" data-bid="16-2" class="b"> 1 Corinthians 3:10-15</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[49]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>For Christians to ‘upbuild themselves on their most holy faith,’ or to strengthen it, they must diligently study God’s Word personally and congregationally. Frequently discussing the Scriptures with fellow Christian witnesses of Jehovah, as well as proclaiming the good news to <span id="page20" class="pageNum" data-no="20" data-before-text="20"></span>others, will deepen the impression the Bible makes on our hearts. But none of this can be accomplished apart from earnest prayer. An individual ‘prays with holy spirit’ when praying under its influence and in harmony with the things in Jehovah’s Word. Moreover, the Scriptures, written under inspiration of God’s spirit, show us how to pray and what to request in prayer. For instance, we can confidently pray to be filled with God’s holy spirit. If we ‘pray with holy spirit,’ our prayers will reveal a proper heart condition, one loved by God. We will thus be protected from improper influences, including the views of any “ungodly men” who might slip into the congregation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:11:13-42:11:13" data-bid="17-1" class="b">Luke 11:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:9-45:8:9" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Romans 8:9,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:8:26-45:8:27" data-bid="17-3" class="b"> 26, 27</a>.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" data-rel-pid="[50]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>To ‘keep themselves in God’s love,’ Jude’s fellow believers had to observe Jehovah’s commandments and those of His Son.

<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class="qu">11. What did Jude say about mercy, and in showing it between whom was it necessary to distinguish?</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[51]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>Regarding the need to show mercy, Jude said:</p>
<p id="p21" data-pid="21" class="si">“Also, continue showing mercy to some that have doubts; save them by snatching them out of the fire. But continue showing mercy to others, doing so with fear, while you hate even the inner garment that has been stained by the flesh.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/65:1:22-65:1:23" data-bid="21-1" class="b">Jude 22, 23</a>)</p>
<p id="p22" data-pid="22" class="sb">If Jude’s fellow believers were to continue receiving divine mercy, they had to be merciful to others whose eternal life was at stake. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:13-59:2:13" data-bid="22-1" class="b">James 2:13</a>) But for the faithful to ‘continue showing mercy to some having doubts,’ it was necessary for them to distinguish between those eligible for mercy and the ‘dreamers.’</p>
<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="qu">12. (a) Because of being influenced by the “ungodly men,” some may have had what doubts? (b) How would it be possible to ‘snatch some out of the fire’?</p>
<p id="p23" data-pid="23" data-rel-pid="[52]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>By their false teaching, murmuring, complaining, and so forth, the “ungodly men” were causing spiritually unsteady persons to be filled with doubts. Shaken by the swelling words of the false teachers, the doubting ones may have wondered whether dedicated Christians really were Jehovah’s people and may <span id="page21" class="pageNum" data-no="21" data-before-text="21"></span>have stopped sharing with them in worship and in preaching the good news. Such unstable ones were in danger of the “fire,” or everlasting destruction. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:18:8-40:18:9" data-bid="23-1" class="b">Matthew 18:8, 9;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:31-40:25:33" data-bid="23-2" class="b"> 25:31-33,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:25:41-40:25:46" data-bid="23-3" class="b"> 41-46</a>.) But by quickly coming to their aid with spiritual exhortation and prayer, stable Christians, especially congregation overseers, would be able to save them, “snatching them out of the fire.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:6:1-48:6:1" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Galatians 6:1;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:5:13-59:5:20" data-bid="24-2" class="b"> James 5:13-20</a>.</p>

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:4-59:4:4" data-bid="25-1" class="b">James 4:4</a>) By giving way to animalistic practices, they had, as it were, ‘stained the inner garment.’ They had stained their inward personality as genuine Christians, like a garment worn next to the skin. (Compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:3:4-66:3:5" data-bid="26-1" class="b">Revelation 3:4, 5</a>.) Faithful witnesses of Jehovah guarded against spotting up their own garment of Christian personality in this way because this displeased Jehovah God and might lead to destruction. Yet, godly persons, particularly the appointed elders, compassionately tried to help the unstable wearers of ‘stained garments’ back to the way of salvation. If true repentance was shown by the wayward, it would be possible to “save them” from the death in divine disfavor to which an unclean course would lead them.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/20:28:13-20:28:13" data-bid="27-1" class="b">Proverbs 28:13</a>.</p>

<p id="p26" data-pid="26" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>In conclusion, Jude committed his readers to God, saying:</p>

<p id="p28" data-pid="28" class="sb">Having provided inspired warning and sound counsel, Jude had to place spiritually endangered fellow believers in God’s care. Jehovah alone could make them successful in resisting the “ungodly men” in their midst. So Jude appropriately concluded his letter with an ascription of praise to the Most High.</p>
<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[54]" class="sb"><sup>15 </sup>Jude’s anointed fellow worshipers could have confidence in Jehovah as ‘the one able to guard them from stumbling.’ God could protect them from falling into transgression and from yielding to the temptation to engage in the immorality being encouraged by the ungodly flesh defilers. Indeed, Jehovah could guard the godly from “stumbling” into gross sin and the destruction awaiting unrepentant animalistic false Christians. Moreover, Jehovah was able “to set [his faithful witnesses] unblemished in the sight of his glory,” or, “before his glorious person.” (<em>NW, </em>1950 edition) They would be able to stand unspotted spiritually because of God’s undeserved kindness.

To God he also ascribed “majesty” (Greek, <em>megal</em>ō<em>syn</em>ē), signifying “greatness” of a kingly nature.

<p id="p34" data-pid="34" data-rel-pid="[58]" class="sb"><sup>19 </sup>Therefore, as dedicated Christian witnesses of Jehovah and his dear Son, may we all take to heart the weighty and loving message of the disciple Jude.

(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:119:9-19:119:16" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Psalm 119:9-16</a>) In that way, we will succeed in ‘putting up a hard fight for the faith’ and will, with divine aid, ‘keep ourselves in God’s love.’</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A woman in New York State sent a former classmate, who was raising a family, a copy of <em>My Book of Bible Stories. </em>After a while the woman received a letter from her former classmate. She wrote in reference to her daughter:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Elizabeth just loves the book​—it’s the only one she wants me to read to her at night. She gets five stories (because she’s five) a night, and last week her Sunday-school teacher told me that she can always count on Elizabeth to know all the answers to Biblical questions. So it must have been written by someone who really understands what children like.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">The New York woman observes regarding her former classmate: “This was her honest reaction, as she is very forthright and would not praise the book if she did not like it.”</p>

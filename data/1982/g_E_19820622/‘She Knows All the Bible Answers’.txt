‘She Knows All the Bible Answers’
A woman in New York State sent a former classmate, who was raising a family, a copy of My Book of Bible Stories. After a while the woman received a letter from her former classmate. She wrote in reference to her daughter:
“Elizabeth just loves the book​—it’s the only one she wants me to read to her at night. She gets five stories (because she’s five) a night, and last week her Sunday-school teacher told me that she can always count on Elizabeth to know all the answers to Biblical questions. So it must have been written by someone who really understands what children like.”
The New York woman observes regarding her former classmate: “This was her honest reaction, as she is very forthright and would not praise the book if she did not like it.”
We feel that you, too, will treasure this beautifully illustrated, large-print publication. Its 116 Bible accounts give the reader an idea of what the Bible is all about. These stories appear in the order in which the events occurred in history. You will find this really helpful to learning when, in relation to other events, things happened in history.

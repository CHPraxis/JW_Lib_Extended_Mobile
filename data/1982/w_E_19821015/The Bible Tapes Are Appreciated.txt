The Bible Tapes Are Appreciated
The album of eighteen cassettes, containing the entire Christian Greek Scriptures, is helping people everywhere to gain pleasure and benefit from listening to the Bible
From Oregon a woman writes: “As a mother of four I find little time to sit and read the Bible. With the aid of these tapes I may learn and be upbuilt even as I care for my household duties. I can’t express my thanks deeply enough for this blessing.”
Expressing similar appreciation, a woman in Florida says: “I play them while doing my housework.”
“Listening to God’s Word every morning on the way to work in my car is a real help to me,” writes a man from Ohio.
A letter from Arizona reports: “I find it to be the easiest way to read the Word of God, by listening to the spoken word and following through by reading along.”
You, too, can gain pleasure and benefit from listening to these Bible tapes. The eighteen of them, which contain the entire Greek Scriptures (New Testament), come in an attractive brown vinyl album. They will be delivered to you for only $30 (US).
Please send me, postpaid, the brown vinyl album with the entire Greek Scriptures (18 cassettes). I enclose $30 (US).

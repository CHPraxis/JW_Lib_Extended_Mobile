Benefit from the Circuit Assembly
1 We have received many words of appreciation for the clear and helpful counsel given at our circuit assembly on the theme “Subjecting Ourselves to God.” Do you remember the fine encouragement to recognize our place in Jehovah’s theocratic arrangement and to avoid a course of independence? Surely we will benefit greatly as we heed this counsel ourselves and help our brothers to do so, too.
2 Our next circuit assembly program beginning in February will have as its theme “Be Blameless as Light Bearers.” (Phil. 2:15) There is a need for all of us to be blameless among a twisted generation and at the same time shine zealously as light bearers. But what does Jehovah require of his light bearers and what pitfalls must we avoid? Be sure that you and your family benefit fully from the fine program that has been prepared.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">HOW do you feel about motorcycles? Are you thrilled? Or do you hate them with a passion? Perhaps you are somewhere in between; you simply tolerate them.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">I know that those who are thrilled hold them in their estimation as something very special. It may be their sound​—the throaty rumble of an English twin or single, the high-pitched howl of a Japanese multi-two-stroke, the purr of a big multicylinder four-stroke, or again it might be just a small popping set on which to get to work. It could even be the sense of freedom one gets with the wind in the face.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Whatever the attraction, these people tell me that they really enjoy their motorcycles. To feel that almost-living machine beneath you, to know it will answer to your every whim or direction, to lean into the curves and to know it will carry you to your destination reliably. Through the “black as your hat” night the engine keeps punching its way through the miles, headlamp piercing into the darkness. Arriving exhilarated you might sit in front of the fire, there drinking hot coffee, talking to a friend who had accompanied you on his machine, discussing the virtues of motorcycles​—the advantages or disadvantages of singles, twins, multi-V twins, flat twins, flat fours, shaft drives, chains, self or kick starters.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">But let us look more closely at motorcycles. What are their advantages? How can they best be used? You will agree with me that one of their advantages is economy, for we are living in a time of rising fuel cost. Some machines will do well over 100 miles (160 km) on a gallon of fuel. Additionally, they use only two tires, three at the most if they have a sidecar. Sidecars? Yes, these can be great fun on the snow or ice, at the same time being considered by insurance companies in some countries to be one of the safest methods of transport. So perhaps you ride solo in the summer, but with a sidecar in the winter, thus giving greater warmth and protection to a passenger in inclement weather.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">How best can they be used? Well, I say that motorcyclists have one of the greatest responsibilities on the road in being a fine example to other road users. In other words, I say to them: “Never put other road users in a situation where they may have to take evasive action on account of your course of conduct. Always be alert, looking and thinking ahead, observing what road and traffic conditions are telling you. Always be prepared for the unexpected. Always sit on your machine properly just as if you are a part of it. Always be prepared to help other road users, even if only in a moral sense. Important, too, always wear proper protective gear, for concrete or tar seal can take an awful lot of skin off if you have to drop the bike. Keep in mind that there is one place on the road where you should never be​—on the wrong side of the white line. Surely you would not want to be bloodguilty if an accident occurred due to your wrong action.</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Consideration should also be given to people not on the road. The noise can destroy their peace and endanger their health, so do you have an efficient silencer or muffler? Do you try to show off? If you must do wheelies, then do so with an appropriate machine and do it correctly on soft ground out of earshot of other people, and where the environment is not destroyed.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">So, in short, what are these motor-driven cycles? A means of transportation, of enjoyment, of recreation. In all three aspects motorcycles have their place. If you are a motorcyclist, take advantage of the cycle’s superior qualities but do so with kind consideration for the feelings of others. Enjoy your motorcycling properly and become a knight of the road . . . not a blight.​—<em>Contributed.</em></p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">When I read your issue entitled “Pollution’s Many Victims,” I wept. When the abuses against our earth are listed all in one place, the criminality and tragedy of it all becomes overwhelming. What a blatant lack of gratitude mankind has shown toward the generous Owner of this wonderful home!</p>

<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">Thank you for your article “Coping with Heart Troubles” some time back. On a Sunday morning some weeks ago a 40-year-old man suddenly had a heart attack. While everyone was shouting and no one knew what to do, I recalled the good advice brought out in your article on CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation). No one having the courage to help me, I put that excellent advice into practice alone. After just a few seconds his heart started to beat again. By the time medical aid arrived, the patient’s pulse had come back to normal. I went out of the room, and the neighbors and his wife said to me: “What courage!” Another asked: “Have you ever taken a first-aid course?” I answered: “No, but through ‘Awake!’ I was able to learn this and many other useful things.” The man who was revived continues to enjoy excellent health.</p>

<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="ss"><strong>Airport X-Ray Machines</strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">In a recent issue you referred to a news item indicating that airport X-ray machines are safe for film. As a professional photographer I have had occasion to read several articles recently that have come to the opposite conclusion. I have no personal experience to verify problems and cannot contest the results of the particular machine mentioned in “Awake!” But I hope that your readers will not be induced to feel too free to expose their film repeatedly to X-ray machines and then be disappointed to find their film damaged.</p>

<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="ss"><strong>Robots</strong></p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">I am 11 years old and I really liked that article about the robots. I like robots so I decided to read it. I just want you to know that even 11-year-olds like the magazines you print. Please never stop printing those magazines.</p>

<p id="p15" data-pid="15" class="ss"><strong>Poverty</strong></p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" class="sb">Your article on ‘improving your lot in life’ meant so much to me, I can’t tell you how much I appreciated it. My circumstances are somewhat similar to those of Carmen. Had it not been for the help of such ‘visitors’ to my home I dread to think what condition my life would be in now.</p>

<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sb">Thank you for the articles on poverty. I myself have experienced some poverty some years ago and wish I could have read the articles then, because it would have helped me.</p>

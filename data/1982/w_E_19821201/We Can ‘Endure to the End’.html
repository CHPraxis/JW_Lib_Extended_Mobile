(<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:24-46:9:27" data-bid="48-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 9:24-27</a>) The world looks down on us, as some did on the apostle, even though we show deep concern for the spiritual welfare of fellow humans. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:22:39-40:22:39" data-bid="49-1" class="b">Matthew 22:39</a>) Like Paul, many of us have some affliction. But this makes us more dependent on God’s strength, and in our weakness his power is made especially manifest among those to whom we preach.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:12:7-47:12:10" data-bid="50-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 12:7-10</a>.</p>

<p id="p29" data-pid="29" data-rel-pid="[55]" class="sb"><sup>22 </sup>There is no doubt that power from above sustained Paul right down to his death as an imperfect but faithful servant of Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:7-47:4:7" data-bid="51-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:6-55:4:8" data-bid="51-2" class="b"> 2 Timothy 4:6-8</a>) Comparably, it is only in God’s strength that we can ‘endure to the end’ of this wicked system of things or to our death in faithfulness. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:29:11-19:29:11" data-bid="52-1" class="b">Psalm 29:11;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:10:28-40:10:28" data-bid="52-2" class="b"> Matthew 10:28;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:3-40:24:3" data-bid="52-3" class="b"> 24:3,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:13-40:24:13" data-bid="52-4" class="b"> 13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/41:13:13-41:13:13" data-bid="52-5" class="b"> Mark 13:13</a>) If called upon to suffer “for righteousness’ sake,” we are greatly comforted by Jehovah’s holy spirit, his precious promises and his answers to our prayers. Such things make us confident that “the God of all comfort” is with us. Like the apostle Paul we may be “perplexed, but not absolutely with no way out . . . persecuted, but not left in the lurch . . . thrown down, but not destroyed.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:4:8-47:4:9" data-bid="53-1" class="b">2 Corinthians 4:8, 9</a>) Our God empowers us to proclaim the good news fearlessly in the face of persecution and hardship. And, surely, in Jehovah’s strength we can ‘endure to the end.’</p>

Would You Like Another Bible Translation?
Some time back the following letter was received at the headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Brooklyn, New York:
“Gentlemen:
“About a year ago I found a green-cover Bible, ‘New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures,’ although I have ‘The New English Bible,’ also the ‘King James’ and the ‘American Standard Version.’
“Just recently I decided to examine your Bible and I found that it is an excellent Bible to read and for studying. Please send me the price list of your Bibles and sizes.”

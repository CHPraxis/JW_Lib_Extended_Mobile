In other words, it was believed that nutrients simply diffused across the lining without any active work done by the lining cells. However, the <em>Scientific American </em>of November 1981, pointed out: “Recent work in physiology presents a different picture of the lining. It is now clear that the inner surface of the intestine is active both in breaking down and in absorbing nutrients. Cells of the lining have enzymes embedded in their membrane that convert complex sugars into simple ones and break down the peptides produced by protein digestion into their constituent amino acids or into small peptides made up of a few amino acids each.”</p>

Both the knowns and the unknowns are awe-inspiring, causing many to feel like King David, who said of the Creator: “I shall laud you because in a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:139:14-19:139:14" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Psalm 139:14</a>.</p>

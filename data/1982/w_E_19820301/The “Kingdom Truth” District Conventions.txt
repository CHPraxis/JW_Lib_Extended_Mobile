The “Kingdom Truth” District Conventions
JEHOVAH is “the God of truth.” (Psalm 31:5) His Son, Jesus Christ, said of himself: “I am the way and the truth and the life.” (John 14:6) Of his Father’s Word, he said, “Your word is truth.” (John 17:17) And the Christian congregation is “a pillar and support of the truth.”​—1 Timothy 3:15.
But what is Kingdom truth? It is the theme that runs right through the Bible from Genesis to Revelation. Jehovah God uttered the first Kingdom truth when he told the Serpent in the garden of Eden: “I shall put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed. He will bruise you in the head and you will bruise him in the heel.” (Genesis 3:15) Among the last Kingdom truths recorded in God’s Word is that found at Revelation 21:4: “[God] will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.”
What a privilege is ours as Christian witnesses of Jehovah to make known the Kingdom truth to others! How important it is that we do so! Truth-hungry persons sigh and groan because of the abominations they see taking place. (Ezekiel 9:4) Many say they are without hope. By sharing in the fulfillment of Jesus’ prophecy at Matthew 24:14 we can bring comfort and hope to all who really yearn for truth.
That we might better appreciate what Kingdom truth is all about and what our obligations are in relation to it, and that we might be stirred to do all we can in publishing Kingdom truth, “Kingdom Truth” has been made the theme for our 1982 district conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses to be held earth wide. The program will begin on Thursday afternoon and last until Sunday evening. Make plans now to attend at least one of the “Kingdom Truth” district conventions from the beginning to the end.

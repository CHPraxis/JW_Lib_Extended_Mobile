<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Each year tens of thousands who cannot be regular pioneers enroll as auxiliary pioneers for one or more months so they can have an increased part in sharing the Kingdom good news with their neighbors. Many are planning to do it this year. What about you?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Those who do it all agree, ‘It takes careful planning and a realistic schedule.’ Many of them are still attending school, but their school schedule is such that, if they get up early and use their time well, they can also devote two hours a day to the field ministry. Thousands of young Witnesses find great pleasure in using vacation periods for such service.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Asked why he put forth the added effort to auxiliary pioneer, one Witness said: “It is my way of saying, ‘Thank you, Jehovah, for all the things that you have done for me.’”</p>

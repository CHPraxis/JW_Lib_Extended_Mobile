<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">A youth from Brazil described how the book <em>Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It </em>does just that. He wrote:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Some weeks ago I was invited by a friend to read an immoral book and I refused. Another schoolmate present was surprised at my refusal and asked for my reasons for not reading it. I explained to him what the Bible says about this type of reading and, noting his interest, I went on to explain what the Bible says about homosexuality and masturbation.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“‘Where did you learn all that?’ he asked.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“I showed him the <em>Your Youth </em>book, which he accepted, and a Bible study was started with him during our noon recess. This 14-year-old friend of mine has already given up smoking, after just a few weeks of study.”</p>

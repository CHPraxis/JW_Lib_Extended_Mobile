It Gives Moral Strength
A youth from Brazil described how the book Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It does just that. He wrote:
“Some weeks ago I was invited by a friend to read an immoral book and I refused. Another schoolmate present was surprised at my refusal and asked for my reasons for not reading it. I explained to him what the Bible says about this type of reading and, noting his interest, I went on to explain what the Bible says about homosexuality and masturbation.
“‘Where did you learn all that?’ he asked.
“I showed him the Your Youth book, which he accepted, and a Bible study was started with him during our noon recess. This 14-year-old friend of mine has already given up smoking, after just a few weeks of study.”

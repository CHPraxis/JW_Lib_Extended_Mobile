<p id="p18" data-pid="18" class="sn">● Prepare for the special talk and Memorial: Please order special talk handbills and Memorial invitations now so that your congregation will receive them well in advance of the special talk to be held on Sunday, April 10, 1983, or during the week following, and the Memorial celebration on Tuesday, March 29, 1983. Check locally for time of sundown. The special handbills should be ordered on the yellow <em>Special Talk Handbill Order. </em>Memorial invitations may be ordered in lots of 250, 500 and 1,000, using the special blue <em>Memorial Invitation Order Form. </em>Two copies of each form are being sent to the congregations with the October statement. It would be appreciated if these could be filled out <em>as soon as possible </em>and returned for processing. This will save the Society and the congregations considerable expense in postage. The special talk will be on the subject: “Religion’s Time of Judgment.” PLEASE DO NOT REMIT WITH YOUR ORDER. The handbills and invitations will be charged to your congregation’s literature account. Payment for these should be included with the amount of money remitted for literature. Please do <em>not </em>list payment for handbills and invitations separately on the remittance form.</p>
<p id="p19" data-pid="19" class="sn">● Portions of the book <em>Man’s Salvation out of World Distress at Hand! </em>will be studied in the congregation book studies beginning the week of December 5, 1982, and continuing through the week of May 29, 1983. It should not be necessary for older publishers to order new copies of this publication as the majority will have a personal copy from prior years that can be used. If local congregation supplies are depleted, the Society has a limited supply to fill congregations orders for those newer publishers who do not yet have a copy. Or, it may be that copies can be obtained from nearby congregations.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" class="sn">● With this issue of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry, </em>we are including the Theocratic Ministry School Schedule for 1983. This will enable school overseers to make assignments well in advance.</p>

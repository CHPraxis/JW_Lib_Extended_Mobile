New Peak of 605,814 Publishers
After the excellent report last April we are very thankful that 605,814 publishers reported in July. This represents a 7.5-percent increase over last year’s average and is the first time we have reached and exceeded 600,000 publishers. Although most of the district conventions in the U.S. were held that month, it is evident the brothers made a special effort to share in the field ministry. At the 104 U.S. district conventions there was an all-time peak in attendance of 1,108,022—another cause for rejoicing! May we continue to have “plenty to do in the work of the Lord,” knowing this results in rich blessings.—1 Cor. 15:58.

New Subscription System
The Society is now using a computerized system to handle all subscriptions in the United States. It would be helpful to understand some of its new features.
Our addressing equipment has the capability of printing MESSAGES ON THE WRAPPERS of subscription copies. These are helpful reminders to the subscriber when only a few issues remain before the subscription expires, or in case the subscriber is moving. These messages should be disregarded where the subscriber has recently renewed or has no plans to change address.
The RENEWAL FORM inserted in magazines is now being sent about two months before the last issue due the subscriber. This allows for renewing so no copies of magazines will be missed.
The EXPIRING SUBSCRIPTION RETURN VISIT SLIPS are also sent to congregations about two months before subscriptions expire. When these are received, calls should be made promptly on subscribers to avoid interrupting the regular receipt of the magazines.
Handling subscriptions by computer has made it possible to process subscriptions and address changes more quickly, thus giving better service to subscribers.
We would again like to recommend that families of Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses endeavor to have individual subscriptions to the magazines. Often when individuals, parents and children, receive personal subscription-copies through the mail there is greater interest in the contents of the magazines. It encourages all to read and study over the many fine articles appearing in each issue of The Watchtower and Awake! We hope that many families will seriously consider this matter.

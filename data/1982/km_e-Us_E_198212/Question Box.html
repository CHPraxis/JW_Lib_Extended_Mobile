<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn"><strong>● What should be done when notes are placed in territory envelopes stating not to call on certain homes?</strong></p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Occasionally we meet householders in our territory who are very opposed to our work and message. Some have even threatened us. If some <em>adamantly request </em>that none of Jehovah’s Witnesses call at their homes again, such requests should be respected. A note with the name and address of such a person should be given to the brother assigned to care for the territory. He should also date the note and state on it the <em>specific </em>nature of the difficulty. Thereafter, each publisher who is asked to work this territory should be especially careful to avoid irritating the householder and not call at his home.—Review <em>Kingdom Ministry </em>of June 1974, Question Box.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">However, from time to time people move or perhaps experience a change of attitude. Depending on the circumstances, tactful inquiry can be made periodically by a capable publisher to determine the current situation.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">We should not hastily conclude that such notations are required merely because an individual is disturbed or somewhat angry as a result of our calling at an inopportune time. However, where there is a request that we not call again or a need for caution, matters can be handled as outlined above. In this way we protect our brothers and ‘give no cause for stumbling or basis for finding fault with our ministry.’—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/47:6:3-47:6:3" data-bid="1-1" class="b">2 Cor. 6:3</a>.</p>

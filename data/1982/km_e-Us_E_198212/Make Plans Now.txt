Make Plans Now
1 We are looking forward with eagerness to offering the new book You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth to the public during January and February 1983. Make your plans now to have a full share in the house-to-house work during this campaign. All congregations will want to cover as much of their territory as possible with this outstanding Bible study aid.
2 In order to be enthusiastic in presenting it, we must first appreciate its value ourselves. Therefore, if we have not already read this publication through, we will want to do so as soon as possible. In addition, plan to attend each of the five public talks based on the new book that are scheduled for January. Have your personal copy with you and make notes of points that can be used in the field ministry.
3 Prepare for the campaign now and resolve to have a full share in offering the Live Forever book, starting with the very first day in January.

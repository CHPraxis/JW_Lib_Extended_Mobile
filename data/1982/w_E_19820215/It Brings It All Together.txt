It Brings It All Together
In a letter of appreciation for the new book “Let Your Kingdom Come” one reader wrote:
“Proceeding from one chapter to the next, it reminded me of a riverboat going down river picking up cargo from first the right bank and then the left one, headed for its destination with a full load. How beautifully it was written! Weaving in first one key point and then another, always beckoning to the reader to be included.”
The theme of the Bible is God’s kingdom. Now you can read a book that picks up and illuminates this Kingdom theme, and it shows where you can fit in. Receive a personal copy by simply filling in and mailing the accompanying coupon.

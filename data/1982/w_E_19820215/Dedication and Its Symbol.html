<p id="p2" data-pid="2" data-rel-pid="[33]" class="sb">A SIGN or symbol of a person’s identity or official standing can be a good thing, yes, a necessary thing. For instance, when Jerusalem was about to be destroyed in 607 B.C.E., a symbolic “man” was sent out to mark the foreheads of right-hearted Israelites in order to protect them from being slaughtered. Only those few who were outraged over <span id="page22" class="pageNum" data-no="22" data-before-text="22"></span>‘the detestable things being done’ in the midst of what should have been God’s holy city were marked for salvation.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/26:9:1-26:9:7" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Ezekiel 9:1-7</a>.</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" data-rel-pid="[34]" class="sb"><sup>2 </sup>Today a “great tribulation” is about to strike the whole world. So <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:1-66:7:8" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Revelation 7:1-8</a> tells us that the “four angels” stationed at the four corners of the earth are instructed to hold back the four winds from blowing and producing a most destructive storm or “tribulation” until the fixed number of God’s chosen ones have been given a seal in their foreheads. Also, this allows time for a “great crowd” to cleanse themselves “in the blood of the Lamb” in order to be identified as worthy of surviving this “great tribulation.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:14" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Revelation 7:9-14;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:24:21-40:24:22" data-bid="3-2" class="b"> Matthew 24:21, 22</a>.</p>
<p id="p35" data-pid="35" class="qu"> 3, 4. In the case of the Jewish high priest, of what would the ‘symbol of dedication’ on his turban be a reminder?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>3 </sup>In ancient Israel a priesthood was set up. Moses had carried out the specific instructions from Jehovah on making the distinctive garments for the high priest. Regarding the turban, it is written: “They made a rosette of pure gold as the symbol [sign] of their holy dedication and inscribed on it as the engraving on a seal, ‘Holy to the L<span class="altsize">ORD</span>’ [“Consecrated to Yahweh,” <em>The Jerusalem Bible</em>], and they fastened on it a violet braid to fix it on the turban at the top.”<span data-fnid="1" class="fn">a<span class="tt fn" data-rel-fnid="1"></span></span>​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:39:30-2:39:31" data-bid="4-1" class="b">Exodus 39:30, 31;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:29:6-2:29:6" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> 29:6;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/3:8:9-3:8:9" data-bid="4-3" class="b"> Leviticus 8:9</a>, <em>The New English Bible; New World Translation.</em></p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" data-rel-pid="[35]" class="sb"><sup>4 </sup>This ‘symbol of dedication’ would be a reminder to the high priest and to all observers that he had been “consecrated” or dedicated by God to a sacred service in behalf of a dedicated people. He and his fellow priests would take the lead in instructing the people and offering acceptable sin-atoning sacrifices, which would help them to live up to their dedication to God. This would contribute to the holy dedicated status of the nation, for they were warned that if they left Jehovah, he would, in turn, leave them and abandon them to their enemies.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:28:15-5:28:15" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 28:15,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:28:25-5:28:25" data-bid="5-2" class="b"> 25,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:28:63-5:28:63" data-bid="5-3" class="b"> 63</a>.</p>
<p id="p36" data-pid="36" class="qu"> 5. Though today there is no Jew named Cohen who can identify himself as the Aaronic high priest, why is our case not hopeless?</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" data-rel-pid="[36]" class="sb"><sup>5 </sup>The tragic history of the Israelites is filled with the calamities they suffered as a result of turning away from God’s commandments and their dedicated service to him. After the second destruction of Jerusalem and its temple in 70 C.E., the high priest with the symbol of dedication on his turban passed off the scene. Today no Jew with the family name of Cohen (meaning “Priest”) can prove himself to be the high priest of Israel. Is our situation, then, hopeless? No! For concerning the glorified Son of God, we read: “Such a high priest as this was suitable for us, loyal, guileless, undefiled, separated from the sinners, and become higher than the heavens. . . . he offered himself up.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/58:7:26-58:7:27" data-bid="6-1" class="b">Hebrews 7:26, 27</a>.</p>
<p id="p37" data-pid="37" class="qu"> 6, 7. Was Jesus born into the priestly tribe of Israel, and how could he become a high priest?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><span id="page23" class="pageNum" data-no="23" data-before-text="23"></span><sup>6 </sup>Since Jesus was the Son of God, he did not need to be a member of the tribe of Levi or of the priestly family of Aaron to become God’s priest. That could be so according to the marvelous arrangements of Jehovah God. King David was inspired by God’s spirit to prophesy concerning this illustrious descendant, who was to be higher than his royal forefathers: “The utterance of Jehovah to my Lord is: ‘Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.’ The rod of your strength Jehovah will send out of Zion, saying: ‘Go subduing in the midst of your enemies.’ Your people will offer themselves willingly on the day of your military force. In the splendors of holiness [in holy array], from the womb of the dawn, you have your company of young men just like dewdrops. Jehovah has sworn (and he will feel no regret): ‘You are a priest to time indefinite according to the manner of Melchizedek!’”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/19:110:1-19:110:4" data-bid="7-1" class="b">Psalm 110:1-4</a>, <em>New World Translation; An American Translation.</em></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" data-rel-pid="[37]" class="sb"><sup>7 </sup>So, down to our own day, the glorified Jesus Christ remains a royal High Priest, higher than the chief priests of ancient Israel with their material symbol of dedication. He is in office not because of being a Levite priest but by the sworn oath of Jehovah God.</p>

<p id="p38" data-pid="38" class="qu"> 8. Why is this the day of Christ’s “military force,” and how do those now offering themselves willingly proceed in this respect?</p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" data-rel-pid="[38]" class="sb"><sup>8 </sup>The disciples of that royal High Priest, Christ Jesus, now “offer themselves willingly” on the day of his “military force.” They dedicate themselves to Jehovah God in the name of this royal High Priest, getting baptized in water in symbol of that dedication. These are the ones the complete number of whom must be finally sealed before the outbreak of the “great tribulation.” They, along with their companions of the “great crowd,” “offer themselves willingly” just like dewdrops in bringing God’s refreshing message of salvation to the people.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:2-66:7:4" data-bid="8-1" class="b">Revelation 7:2-4,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:9-66:7:10" data-bid="8-2" class="b"> 9, 10,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:7:14-66:7:14" data-bid="8-3" class="b"> 14</a>.</p>

<p id="p11" data-pid="11" data-rel-pid="[39]" class="sb"><sup>9 </sup>Writing to the disciples of 1,900 years ago, the apostle Paul said: “I entreat you by the compassions of God, brothers, to present your bodies a sacrifice living, holy, acceptable to God, a sacred service with your power of reason. And quit being fashioned after this system of things, but be transformed by making your mind over, that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:12:1-45:12:2" data-bid="9-1" class="b">Romans 12:1, 2</a>.</p>
<p id="p40" data-pid="40" class="qu">10, 11. (a) So Paul addresses his plea to the Gentile Christians in Rome as a follow-up to what discussion? (b) In what way was this arrangement an expression of great compassion on God’s part?</p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>10 </sup>The above entreaty comes immediately after Paul’s discussion of the symbolic olive tree. Like branches in a garden olive tree, the dedicated nation of Israel was the natural offspring of God’s “friend” Abraham. As such they were first in line to become “Abraham’s seed” according to the promise made to him. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:12:3-1:12:3" data-bid="10-1" class="b">Genesis 12:3;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/1:22:17-1:22:18" data-bid="10-2" class="b"> 22:17, 18;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:16-48:3:16" data-bid="10-3" class="b"> Galatians 3:16,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:29-48:3:29" data-bid="10-4" class="b"> 29;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:2:23-59:2:23" data-bid="10-5" class="b"> James 2:23</a>) But only a remnant of natural Jews accepted Jesus as the Messiah and were transferred from being the natural seed of earthly Abraham to being the spiritual seed of the Greater Abraham, Jehovah. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:5-45:11:5" data-bid="11-1" class="b">Romans 11:5,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:7-45:11:7" data-bid="11-2" class="b"> 7</a>) The rest were lopped off as “branches.” To replace them, God turned to the non-Jews or, as it were, to a symbolic wild olive tree, to extract sufficient “branches” to graft into the spiritual garden olive tree that was to be composed of 144,000 branches rooted in the Greater Abraham, Jehovah <span id="page24" class="pageNum" data-no="24" data-before-text="24"></span>God, the Source of all blessings.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:13-45:11:33" data-bid="12-1" class="b">Romans 11:13-33;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:14:1-66:14:1" data-bid="12-2" class="b"> Revelation 14:1</a>.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" data-rel-pid="[40]" class="sb"><sup>11 </sup>So it was an expression of great compassion on God’s part for those Romans and all other uncircumcised non-Jews to become a part of the spiritual seed of Abraham for blessing all the families of the earth by means of God’s kingdom. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/49:2:12-49:2:12" data-bid="13-1" class="b">Ephesians 2:12;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/48:3:26-48:3:29" data-bid="13-2" class="b"> Galatians 3:26-29</a>) This laid upon them the course of self-sacrifice. But this was the only privilege that God then held out to human creatures, and what a special privilege it was! Not overstepping proper bounds, the apostle Paul wrote and said to them: “Present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead, also your members to God as weapons of righteousness. For sin must not be master over you, seeing that you are not under law [the law of Moses] but under undeserved kindness.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:6:13-45:6:14" data-bid="14-1" class="b">Romans 6:13, 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p41" data-pid="41" class="qu">12. What would be involved for spirit-anointed disciples of Christ when they are told, “present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead”?</p>
<p id="p14" data-pid="14" data-rel-pid="[41]" class="sb"><sup>12 </sup>While Paul is writing to those who were already dedicated Christians, “holy ones,” he is not overlooking what they had done at first in dedicating their lives, when he said: “<em>Present yourselves </em>to God as those alive from the dead.” But they must live up to this dedication, in this sacrificial course. If such were not done, then they, as replacement branches, would be lopped off, too. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:1:7-45:1:7" data-bid="15-1" class="b">Romans 1:7;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:11:21-45:11:22" data-bid="15-2" class="b"> 11:21, 22</a>) Moreover, these words written under inspiration would be read by future disciples of Jesus Christ and would offer strong encouragement for them to take all the steps necessary to enter into and maintain this dedicated, baptized relationship with God. To preserve their dedicated relationship with God, once made, they would be in a continual battle to fashion their fleshly members into weapons of righteousness rather than submitting these to the mastery of sin. This would be in obedience to Jesus’ words: “If anyone wants to come after me, let him <em>disown himself </em>and pick up his torture stake and continually follow me.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:16:24-40:16:24" data-bid="16-1" class="b">Matthew 16:24</a>.</p>

<p id="p42" data-pid="42" class="qu">13. Is it proper for those having an earthly hope to make a dedication to God and to symbolize this by water baptism?</p>
<p id="p16" data-pid="16" data-rel-pid="[42]" class="sb"><sup>13 </sup>Throughout the earth today more than 2,300,000 persons are joining in publishing the good news of the Kingdom, and the vast majority of these have presented themselves for baptism in water in symbol of their dedication. At the yearly celebration of the Lord’s Evening Meal, less than 10,000 of all of these partake of the emblematic bread and wine to confess that they are Christ’s disciples with a heavenly hope. But do all the others properly make a dedication and symbolize this by water baptism? Very definitely they do, for they, too, must come into a proper relationship with God through the Fine Shepherd, Christ Jesus, in order to survive the “great tribulation” just ahead and gain an inheritance as part of God’s “new earth.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/61:3:13-61:3:13" data-bid="17-1" class="b">2 Peter 3:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/66:21:1-66:21:4" data-bid="17-2" class="b"> Revelation 21:1-4</a>.</p>

<p id="p17" data-pid="17" data-rel-pid="[43]" class="sb"><sup>14 </sup>So the overwhelming majority of Jehovah’s dedicated witnesses do not entertain any heavenly hope of joint heirship with Jesus Christ in the Kingdom above. They do not claim to be spiritual Israelites begotten by Jehovah’s spirit. Yet they inseparably associate with the remnant of spiritual Israelites as members of the “one flock” under “one shepherd,” Jesus Christ.

<p id="p19" data-pid="19" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>16 </sup>In Moses’ day the non-Israelite “vast mixed company” shared similar experiences with the circumcised Israelites, including a marvelous baptism. As regards that baptism, the apostle Paul wrote, at <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:10:1-46:10:4" data-bid="23-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 10:1-4</a>: “Our forefathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea and all got baptized into Moses by means of the cloud and of the sea; and all ate the same spiritual food and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they used to drink from the spiritual rock-mass that followed them, and that rock-mass meant the Christ.” Thus, in a figurative way, both the Israelites and the “vast mixed company” got baptized although they did not literally get wet.</p>
<p id="p20" data-pid="20" data-rel-pid="[45]" class="sb"><sup>17 </sup>That miraculous baptism by Jehovah God consigned them to Moses as their God-given leader, just as if they literally had been baptized into him. But this was not a baptism into death, as in the case of the pursuing Egyptians. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/2:14:1-2:15:21" data-bid="24-1" class="b">Exodus 14:1–15:21</a>) Today we are nearing a similar situation.

At its spiritual temple, represented by the remnant yet on earth, they render “sacred service” to the Most High God, Jehovah, day and night. Their hope is to survive the “great tribulation,” to continue their dedicated service to God forever on earth.

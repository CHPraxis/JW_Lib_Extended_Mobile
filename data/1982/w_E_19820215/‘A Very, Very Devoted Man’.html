<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">William Kirk Jackson was born September 16, 1901, at Galveston, Texas. After a lifetime of devoted service to Jehovah God, he completed his earthly course on December 13, 1981.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">From his earliest days, William displayed a great interest in Bible truth. In 1915, at age 14, he dedicated himself to Jehovah through Christ Jesus. He always treasured his calling as one of the Lord’s anointed in union with Christ. On June 1, 1933, he entered full-time service to Jehovah as a pioneer. After fulfilling special assignments in Washington, D.C., and in Chicago, Illinois, Brother Jackson became a permanent member of the Brooklyn Bethel family on November 13, 1937. Serving with legal counsel Hayden C. Covington from 1941, he was in the thick of the fight leading to many notable victories for Jehovah’s Witnesses in the U.S. Supreme Court. He was appointed to the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses on October 15, 1971, and in due course he was assigned to care for matters in the Service and Publishing Committees.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Brother Jackson was humble, very self-effacing and never assumed the posture of a person of importance. Known to thousands around the earth as simply “Bill,” he was mild-tempered, approachable at any time, very pleasant and delightful as a companion; he always put people at ease. In the course of a memorial talk given at Brooklyn Bethel, F. W. Franz said: ‘We thank Jehovah God for having raised up such a fine Witness. He finished his course faithfully, and is sure of his reward. Bill Jackson was a very, very devoted man.’</p>

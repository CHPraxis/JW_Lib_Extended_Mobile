<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“Proceeding from one chapter to the next, it reminded me of a riverboat going down river picking up cargo from first the right bank and then the left one, headed for its destination with a full load. How beautifully it was written! Weaving in first one key point and then another, always beckoning to the reader to be included.”</p>

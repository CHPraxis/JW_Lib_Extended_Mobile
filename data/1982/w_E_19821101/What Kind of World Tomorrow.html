<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">WHAT is on the horizon? A different world.</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">That is the substance of projections made by United States government agencies as found in “The Global 2000 Report to the President.” Volume One, prepared by the Council on Environmental Quality and the Department of State, says: “The world in 2000 will be different from the world today in important ways.” In what ways?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Among other things, the report foretells:</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">● <strong>“There will be more people. For every two persons on the earth in 1975 there will be three in 2000.”</strong></p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn">● <strong>“The gap between the richest and the poorest will have increased.”</strong></p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sn">● <strong>“There will be fewer resources to go around.”</strong></p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sn">● <strong>“The environment will have lost important life-supporting capabilities.”</strong></p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sn">● <strong>“Prices will be higher.”</strong></p>
<p id="p10" data-pid="10" class="sn">● <strong>“The world will be more vulnerable both to natural disaster and to disruptions from human causes.”</strong></p>
<p id="p11" data-pid="11" class="sn">● <strong>“Finally, it must be emphasized that if public policy continues generally unchanged the world will be different as a result of lost opportunities.”</strong></p>
<p id="p12" data-pid="12" class="sb">Doubtless you will agree that these prospects are not pleasant. They certainly do not provide a basis for great happiness.</p>
<p id="p13" data-pid="13" class="sb">Yet the Scriptures encourage gladness, saying: <em>“Be glad, </em>you nations, with his people.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:15:10-45:15:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Romans 15:10</a>; compare <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/5:32:43-5:32:43" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Deuteronomy 32:43</a>.) The reference here is to people who worship God in a way acceptable to him. They do so “with spirit and truth.” (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/43:4:23-43:4:24" data-bid="3-1" class="b">John 4:23, 24</a>) But since we now face so many problems, is there really any reason to think you will ever live in a happy world?</p>

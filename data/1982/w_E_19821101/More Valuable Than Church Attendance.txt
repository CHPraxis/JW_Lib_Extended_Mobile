More Valuable Than Church Attendance
What is that? According to a man living in Italy, reading the Watchtower magazine is. He wrote:
“I received the gift of a subscription to your magazine The Watchtower from one of your people and read the copies as soon as they arrived.
“I really must thank you for the marvelous articles contained in this magazine. Though deep, the information is clearly explained and, above all, the writers undeniably adhere to the Bible text.
“Although at one time I used to just recite a prayer to my Creator as soon as I woke up in the morning, I now read one of the articles in your magazine and then meditate on its contents.
“I am a peasant farmer living alone, but since I got to know Jehovah’s Witnesses I seem to have so many friends. When they come from Asti to visit me it is just like receiving a visit from the apostles. I must admit I have learned more about the Bible in the past few months than in fifty years of church attendance.”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">What is that? According to a man living in Italy, reading the <em>Watchtower </em>magazine is. He wrote:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I received the gift of a subscription to your magazine <em>The Watchtower </em>from one of your people and read the copies as soon as they arrived.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">“I really must thank you for the marvelous articles contained in this magazine. Though deep, the information is clearly explained and, above all, the writers undeniably adhere to the Bible text.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">“Although at one time I used to just recite a prayer to my Creator as soon as I woke up in the morning, I now read one of the articles in your magazine and then meditate on its contents.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">“I am a peasant farmer living alone, but since I got to know Jehovah’s Witnesses I seem to have so many friends. When they come from Asti to visit me it is just like receiving a visit from the apostles. I must admit I have learned more about the Bible in the past few months than in fifty years of church attendance.”</p>

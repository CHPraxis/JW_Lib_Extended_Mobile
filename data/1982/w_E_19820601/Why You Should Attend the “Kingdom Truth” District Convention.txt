Why You Should Attend the “Kingdom Truth” District Convention
A thrilling four-day program of Bible instruction awaits you at the “Kingdom Truth” District Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses. By means of practical demonstrations, dramatic presentations and instructive discourses vital Bible guidance will be provided. Also, you will receive something that will have considerable influence on the work Christians will be doing in the days ahead.
Be present Thursday afternoon at 1:20 p.m., when the convention program begins. It is necessary that you squarely face the question of the keynote address: “Where Do You Stand on the Kingdom Issue?” No doubt on Friday you will appreciate so much what you receive that you will be moved to share it with others in the community.
Saturday’s program is filled with practical and needed instruction for living in today’s selfish, immoral world. You will hear such talks as “Counteracting Permissiveness with Bible Principles” and “Beware of Music That Debases.” By all means, do not miss the presentation with which Saturday’s program concludes​—it will feature information that will have long-lasting effects on the Kingdom-preaching work worldwide.
Sunday the full-costume dramatic presentation “Fearless Proclaimer of an Unpopular Message” will stir you to be like God’s prophet Jeremiah. Then you will not want to miss the public talk “The Truth That Can Set You Free.”
Since over 100 conventions are scheduled in the United States alone, there will be a convention not far from your home. Check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the time and place of the one nearest to you.

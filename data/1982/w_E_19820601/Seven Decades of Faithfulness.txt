Seven Decades of Faithfulness
George R. Phillips, known to thousands of Jehovah’s Witnesses, especially in Africa, recently completed his Christian service on earth. Born in Scotland in 1898, he was baptized in 1912 and two years later took up the full-time ministry. He was imprisoned during World War I because of maintaining Christian neutrality. In 1924 Brother Phillips was sent to Africa, where his ministerial field extended from the Cape of Good Hope up to Kenya. He was for years the overseer of the Watch Tower Society’s branch in South Africa. After some seven decades of service to God, Brother Phillips died on March 24, 1982, at the age of eighty-four.

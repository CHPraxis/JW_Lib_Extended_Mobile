First Place
A reader of The Watchtower wrote: “While attending the Choctaw Indian Fair in Philadelphia, Mississippi, July 1981, we had the opportunity to see many interesting displays of Indian arts and crafts. Upon viewing the prize-winning displays we were pleasantly surprised to find in First Place among the religious literature My Book of Bible Stories.”
We feel that you, too, will highly esteem this beautifully illustrated, large-print publication. Its 116 Bible accounts give the reader an idea of what the Bible is all about. These stories appear in the order in which the events occurred in history. You will find this really helpful to learning when, in relation to other events, things happened in history.

Her Faith Was Unshakable
For two years 14-year-old Renata from Brazil had suffered from bone cancer in her left knee. Amputation and cobalt treatment had only postponed her death. Renata’s Christian conscience would not permit her to accept a blood transfusion, in spite of a doctor’s insistence that she have one. Prior to her last entry into the hospital, the doctor and a nurse went to Renata’s home to see her.
“I agree to return to the hospital if Dr. ​——​ promises me not to mention blood transfusion again. I am tired of having to meet that objection,” declared Renata.
The doctor agreed and added that, even though Renata might be living her last moments, her faith was unshakable.
During the last eight months Renata was unable to lie down because of the intense pain. When the time came for a convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses, she cried and said: “If I could just talk to everyone I would say, ‘Use your legs as much as you can. Maybe tomorrow you will not be able to walk and work for Jehovah. Do not miss your assemblies!’”
Renata’s prayers were constant. One day her mother overheard her praying: “Jehovah, I know I will never get better again. The doctors cannot cure me, but You can. But I know that it is not yet time for it; only in the New Order. But please don’t let me swell up anymore; otherwise, mother won’t be able to carry me to the bathroom.”
If others, including her mother, cried in her presence, Renata would encourage them to be strong in faith. Her mother writes: “But I recall that one day after the amputation, a nurse said to Renata, ‘How could you be so animated on the operating table? It’s a good thing that you will be getting an artificial leg, isn’t it?’ Renata answered, ‘No, I expect to have one of flesh and blood, which Jehovah God will give me in the New Order.’”

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">The “Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses” has moved many readers to increase their service to God. The book tells how Christian missionaries, in the mold of the apostle Paul and his early companions, have spearheaded the Kingdom-preaching work in modern times. Wrote a reader of a recent “Yearbook”: “I can’t read it fast enough. The pictures in it are worth a thousand words. What I’ve read so far has been very encouraging. Makes me feel as though I could do more in preaching the ‘good news’ when I see what others are doing under pressure. I have it so easy by comparison.”</p>

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">JOHN MARK is leaving to go home to Jerusalem, where his mother Mary lives. This is during the first missionary journey of Paul and Barnabas.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:13:13-44:13:13" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Acts 13:13;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:12-44:12:12" data-bid="1-2" class="b"> 12:12,</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:12:25-44:12:25" data-bid="1-3" class="b"> 25</a>.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">It is the following year now. Paul and Barnabas are getting ready to leave on a second missionary journey. Barnabas wants to take his cousin Mark along with them again. However, Paul does not want him along. He is saying: ‘Mark quit the last time we took him.’ Yet Barnabas insists that he be given another chance.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Because of this difference of opinion, “there occurred a sharp burst of anger, so that they separated from each other.” Barnabas took Mark with him. They boarded a boat and sailed away to the island of Cyprus to preach there. Paul, on the other hand, chose another Christian, Silas, and they began a preaching journey that took them first into Syria.​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/44:15:36-44:15:41" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Acts 15:36-41</a>.</p>
<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sb">What about this problem between Paul and Barnabas? If you had been there and had seen this “sharp burst of anger,” would <span id="page17" class="pageNum" data-no="17" data-before-text="17"></span>you have concluded that Paul and Barnabas were not part of God’s people because of the way they behaved?</p>
<p id="p7" data-pid="7" class="sb">Really, that would not have been wise. We should realize that all of us have inherited imperfection from our original parents Adam and Eve. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:5:12-45:5:12" data-bid="3-1" class="b">Romans 5:12</a>) So “we all stumble many times,” the Bible says. (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:3:2-59:3:2" data-bid="4-1" class="b">James 3:2;</a><a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/45:3:23-45:3:23" data-bid="4-2" class="b"> Romans 3:23</a>) Yet true Christians do not continue angry with one another or harbor grudges. They heed the Bible command: “Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely if anyone has a cause for complaint against another. . . . Clothe yourselves with love, for it is a perfect bond of union.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/51:3:13-51:3:14" data-bid="5-1" class="b">Colossians 3:13, 14</a>.</p>
<p id="p8" data-pid="8" class="sb">Well, did the two prominent Christians, Paul and Barnabas, solve their difficulties with love? Look at them here. They are associating together again! (<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/46:9:5-46:9:6" data-bid="6-1" class="b">1 Corinthians 9:5, 6</a>) And later Paul wrote Timothy: “Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for ministering.”​—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/55:4:11-55:4:11" data-bid="7-1" class="b">2 Timothy 4:11</a>.</p>
<p id="p9" data-pid="9" class="sb">Yes, although early Christians sometimes had difficulties among themselves, they solved these with love. Surely we can copy their example.</p>

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">That is what one housewife wrote regarding the cassette recordings of the Christian Greek Scriptures. Yet she admitted: “When I first heard that the tapes were to be made I didn’t think they would be worth buying. I thought that you wouldn’t get much out of them after hearing them once. But how wrong I was! I listen to them over and over. I never get tired of the tapes playing over and over, because I truly get more and more out of them. . . .</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“As I go about my housework it is so enjoyable to listen to the tapes and imagine myself in the first century with our brothers and sisters. Sometimes it brings tears to my eyes to be feeling so close to our brothers and sisters who lived so long ago.”</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Now all the Christian Greek Scriptures are available. And attractive brown vinyl album has been prepared to hold these recordings. The album, complete with the Greek Scriptures (18 cassettes), is $30.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sb">Please send me, postpaid, the brown vinyl album with the entire Greek Scriptures (18 cassettes). I enclose $30 (US).</p>

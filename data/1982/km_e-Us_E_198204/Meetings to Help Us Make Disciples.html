<p id="p6" data-pid="6" class="sn"><strong>20 min: </strong>Topic for Conversation. Discussion and demonstration. Review both scriptures with audience and consider possible introductions and points to tie the two scriptures together. Have demonstration of suggested presentation. After short introduction publisher could say: “We are calling on our neighbors because we believe that you are concerned about the future just as we are. As you know, right at this moment the nations have missiles pointed at one another that could virtually wipe all of mankind off the face of the earth in a matter of minutes. Do you think man will eventually find a way to prevent this from happening? Or do you think the Creator of man will need to step in? [Allow for response; be ready to adapt comments.] It is interesting to realize that millions of people have been praying for a solution when they use the words of the well known ‘Lord’s prayer’ or the ‘Our Father’ prayer. [Read or quote <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/40:6:10-40:6:10" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Matthew 6:10</a>.] This model prayer indicates that the kingdom of God is the real solution to man’s problems. Yet many people do not feel the Kingdom will come in our day. Can you think of a better time for it to come? Jesus prophetically described the critical conditions that exist today and then said these words recorded in <a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/42:21:31-42:21:32" data-bid="2-1" class="b">Luke 21:31, 32</a>. [Read.] So this generation that saw the start of the signs in 1914 will see God’s kingdom come and put an end to these distressing conditions. But who will rule in this kingdom? Will it have subjects on the earth? People have many questions in their minds about the Kingdom, and these need Bible answers. That is why this magazine has been published. Note its title, <em>The Watchtower Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom.” </em>Then highlight a particular point in one of the articles and offer the subscription. Conclude part by encouraging all to share in first Sunday of the month activity, using Topic for Conversation in house-to-house work, and making calls to invite people to the Memorial on Thursday, April 8.</p>

Mussolini Could Not Stop Them!
During the Mussolini era the Fascist State ordered the stamping out of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Italy. A great persecution erupted. But the Witnesses escaped out of the enemy’s hand. They have kept on growing, from about 90 then, till now they number over 90,000! Today they go freely from house to house in Italy. Read the thrilling story of their escape from the Fascists and others who tried to stop the preaching of the good news of God’s kingdom.

<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">Perhaps you have seen Jehovah’s Witnesses on the streets presenting the <em>Watchtower </em>and <em>Awake! </em>magazines. They may have come to your home. Or you may have read about them in the public press, or heard others talk about them. But do you really know who they are? what they believe? and why they do what they do?</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">Learn about them in the 32-page brochure JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. Discover the “good news” they want you to hear. Learn its value to yourself and your community. Read answers to questions often asked about Jehovah’s Witnesses, such as: Do they believe that they are the only ones who will be saved? Why do the Witnesses call on persons who have their own religion?</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sb">Please send me, postpaid, the brochure <em>Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Twentieth Century. </em>I enclose 15 cents (U.S.).</p>

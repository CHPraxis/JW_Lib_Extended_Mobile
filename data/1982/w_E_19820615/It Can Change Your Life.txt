It Can Change Your Life
There is a book that has actually changed the lives of many young persons. One day a girl took this book to school to read during her free periods. One of her classmates came along, snatched it out of her hand and in a mocking tone said: “What is this that you are reading?” She briefly explained the contents of the book Your Youth​—Getting the Best out of It. She drew his attention to the chapter: “Your Clothes and Appearance Talk​—About You.” He laughed and left, but took the book with him. The following week they met again in the lecture class but his appearance had changed drastically. His long hair was cut and his beard was shaved off. His attendance in school improved 100 percent. The other classmates, noting this striking change in the young fellow, asked the Witness about the book that was responsible. As a result she placed five additional books with them.

“I Love How They Face Reality”
That is what a reader from Peru, South America, wrote about the publishers of the Watchtower magazine. She expressed appreciation for the straightforward way The Watchtower discusses family problems, explaining:
“It is so real. Of course, I feel all the things (some positive, others negative) described here. It is just that it was hard for me to believe that I could read them in The Watchtower. I was mistaken. I thought Jehovah’s Witnesses would never write that way. But I love how they face reality, using the right words. It is all true! . . . While I was reading The Watchtower I thought to myself, ‘Well, finally you have found someone who is honest enough to tell you how things are, not avoiding the subject.’”

(Regarding these older books, be sure to note further direction in the May 1982 issue of <em>Our Kingdom Ministry.</em>) August: <em>My Book of Bible Stories </em>for a contribution of $2.50 or a 192-page book for 75c.

<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sn">● The regular shipment of service forms will be sent to all congregations during the month of September. The pioneer report cards will be sent separately.</p>
<p id="p4" data-pid="4" class="sn">● The current and incoming presiding overseers should arrange to meet one or more times before September 1 to work out a smooth transfer. There are important matters that should be discussed. In the past, problems have arisen because the new presiding overseer was not aware of a number of things expected of him.</p>
<p id="p5" data-pid="5" class="sn">● Many letters requesting assistance have been received from parts of the country where Arabic, Cambodian, Laotian and Vietnamese people have settled. Families that speak the language and who are interested in working among these people may follow the instructions set out in the June 1980 <em>Our Kingdom Service </em>article: “Step Over into Macedonia and Help.” Speak to your presiding overseer. If the congregation service committee approves of your receiving such an assignment, then write a letter and give it to the congregation service committee and they, in turn, will send it to the Society.</p>

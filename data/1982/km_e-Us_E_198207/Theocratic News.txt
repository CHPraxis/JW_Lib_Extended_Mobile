Theocratic News
â—† Word has been received that the activities of our brothers in Poland were not adversely affected by events in that country during recent months. Although the curfew and travel restrictions did hamper the movement of people in general, our brothers were able to continue their work of preaching the good news and meeting together in private homes without interference from military patrols. The clear, consistent neutral stand of our brothers has been observed at their places of work and otherwise. Food is rationed and people often have to stand in line to buy their supplies but apparently nobody has really had to go hungry. There is no urgent need for clothing at this time. Travel restrictions have been lifted during the past few months. We are pleased to learn that, considering the overall situation, our brothers have been faring quite well.

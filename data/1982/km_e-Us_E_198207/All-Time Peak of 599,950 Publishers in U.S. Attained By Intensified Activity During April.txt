Other Outstanding Peaks Also Reached
Unquestionably, Jehovah’s rich blessings were poured out upon our united efforts during April. The following reports show that all-time peaks were reached in the categories indicated below:
Total Publishers: 599,950. This surpasses the previous peak reached in August 1981 by 11,447.
Total Auxiliary Pioneers: 75,538. Our previous peak was 51,008 reported in April 1979. The report this year represents an increase of 48 percent over the figure three years ago.
Total Hours: 10,616,267. Compared with our previous peak, the April report this year shows 57,478 more hours were devoted to the work.
Total Home Bible Studies: 378,430. Our April report exceeds the March peak by 14,864.
The extra surge of activity that swept through the country in April is powerful evidence that Jehovah’s spirit is operating mightily upon the work of his people. We have every reason to rejoice. How thankful we can be for having exerted ourselves in the ministry! As we go on zealously preaching, may the word of Jehovah keep moving speedily to reach more of those who will listen and join us in praising God.—2 Thess. 3:1.

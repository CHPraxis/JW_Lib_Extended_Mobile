“My Book of Bible Stories”
Now on four cassettes in one handy album
Millions of families have enjoyed the 256-page My Book of Bible Stories. Its 116 Bible accounts give the reader an idea of what the Bible is all about. Now this Bible Stories book has been recorded on four cassette tapes with a heartwarming appeal for children. Listen to the stories together as a family. Or children can play the tapes for themselves and their companions. The album with the four cassettes is only $8.
Please send me, postpaid, the brown vinyl album with the four cassette tapes of My Book of Bible Stories. I enclose $8 (US).

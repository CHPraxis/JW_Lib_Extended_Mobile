<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sb">This was the concern of a young woman who wrote the Watchtower Society. She explained:</p>
<p id="p3" data-pid="3" class="sb">“I am neither married nor have a family now, but it has always been one of my goals. However, I’m of a very independent nature, and after supporting myself for six years I’ve often had doubts as to my ability to work well in a marriage arrangement. But this publication presented the aspects of marriage and raising a family in such a way that I could really appreciate that it is a divine arrangement.”</p>

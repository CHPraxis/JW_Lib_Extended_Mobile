A Guide on Child Rearing
Referring to the book Making Your Family Life Happy, a young couple from Britain wrote as follows:
“It was our Almanac, Bible rule of thumb, on child rearing and to say we would have been lost without it would be an understatement. As a matter of fact, Samuel and no Family book is a thought that I haven’t the courage to face up to even yet.
“We stuck firmly to the five principles from God’s Word, as outlined in the book, and within six weeks he was sleeping through the night and in such a regular pattern through the day it even helped Anne and me with our schedules. And now he is a fine, well-adjusted, spirited young boy.”

The Price of Hunger
At least 30 million people around the world die of starvation each year, according to the Guardian of Manchester, England. And to buy enough food to save them, a sum of $12,000,000,000 is needed. While the nations are hard pressed to come up with this staggering amount of money to save the hungry, “the same sum is spent on world armaments production in 10 days,” observes the Guardian. Truly, these “last days” are marked by “critical times hard to deal with.”​—2 Timothy 3:1.

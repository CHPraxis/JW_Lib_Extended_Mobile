“Let your Kingdom Come”​—Where?
What is the kingdom that Jesus taught us to pray for? Is it purely a heavenly state? Or is it a condition that dwells in the hearts of men? Or is it a literal government with subjects and laws?
The answer can and will make a great difference in your life.
So please send for the new book “Let Your Kingdom Come.” Then use it with your Bible to learn what God’s kingdom is all about, including the sweeping changes it will bring.
Enclosed please find 75 cents (U.S.) for the 192-page, color-illustrated book “Let Your Kingdom Come.” (Sent postpaid.)

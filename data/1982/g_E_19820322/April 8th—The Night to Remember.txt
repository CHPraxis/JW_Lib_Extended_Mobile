April 8th​—The Night to Remember
The evening of Thursday, April 8, 1982, after sundown, will mark the biggest event of the year on the Christian calendar. It is the memorial of Jesus’ death, celebrated in obedience to his command: “Keep doing this in remembrance of me.”​—Luke 22:19.
Last year 5,987,893 persons were in attendance for this special occasion at meetings sponsored worldwide by Jehovah’s Witnesses. You are cordially invited to attend the Memorial observance this year at the Kingdom Hall nearest to your home. Check with Jehovah’s Witnesses locally for the exact time.

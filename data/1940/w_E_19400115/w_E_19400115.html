<p><span class="font4">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JEHOVAH Is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power In heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION Is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“SALVATION” TESTIMONY PERIOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The midwinter Testimony Period is called “Salvation” and occupies the entire month of February. Thus the testimony for Jehovah’s name and his means of salvation, The Theocracy, will continue despite the season of the year. All Theocratic publishers will offer to the public first a combination of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation </span><span class="font4">and the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace,</span><span class="font4"> on a contribution of 25c. As in the daily march around Jericho, portable phonographs will not be left in idleness, but will be used from house to house to run the latest recording announcing the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.</span><span class="font4"> The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> will offer J'ou more detailed information concerning the Period. At this notice you will prepare to do your part during this Testimony, reporting at the end of the month’s campaign how effective your intensive activities have been.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MEMORIAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Saturday, March 23, after six p.m., is the date for 1940 for the yearly feast in celebration of Jehovah’s name and to the sacrifice of the Lamb of God, Christ Jesus, his Theocratic King. Each company, therefore, should assemble after six p.m. of March 23, and the anointed ones thereof celebrate the Memorial, their companions the Jonadabs being present as observers. If there is no competent person present to deliver a brief discourse immediately preceding the partaking of the emblems, that short article appearing in the March 15, 1939, issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> should be read before those assembled before partaking. Since the breaking of the bread and drinking of the wine both picture the death of Jesus, it follows that both emblems should be served together at partaking, and not separately. The emblems should be unleavened bread and real red wine. Jesus and his apostles used real red wine in symbol of his blood, and the anointed remnant should follow their lead. A report of the celebration should be made to the Society as instructed in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font4"> In preparation therefor the article “Memorial” suggested above will be studied with profit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">YEARBOOK FOR 1940</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The 1940 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tearbook of Jehovah’s witnesses</span><span class="font4"> presents a comprehensive report of the past year's world-wide activities of these publishers of Jehovah’s Theocracy by Christ. You will marvel at the most interesting and most successful service year yet, even with opposition increasing, nations being swallowed up by dictators, and wartime restrictions being generally applied, curtailing</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark5"></a>REPROACH OF MEN</span></h2>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">proach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revihngs.<sup>1</sup>'—Isa. 51:7.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">the people in whose heart is my laiv; fear ye not the re</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">to their fellow companions: “Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.” (2 Tun 3:12,13) The companions of the anointed now p: r-ticipate in suffering with the remnant. They suffer because of their love for righteousness and because of pointing the people to the clear distinction between religion and Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> Those who are in a covenant with Almighty God to do his will know that bitter opposition from worldly powers is now just what is to be expected. To his faithful followers Christ Jesus the King says: “And ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake &quot;&nbsp;(Matt. 24: 9) This declaration of the Lord is proved by all the physical facts that have come to pass in recent years. Those words of Jesus make clear the reason for such hatred on the part of the ruling elements of the nations of earth. That hatred is not because Jehovah’s witnesses and companions are bad or that they do anything to interfere with the property or personal rights of the people, or that the\ are doing anything against the general welfare of the people; but that hatred is because his witnesses and companions boldly and fearlessly proclaim tin name of Jehovah God and his King, Christ Jesus The Lord Jesus was hated and persecuted when he was on the earth. He suffered because he was righteous, because he was his Father’s representative and proclaimed the name of Jehovah God and of his coming kingdom. The witnesses for the King now on the earth, and who are therefore enjoying a like privilege of announcing Jehovah’s name, are also privileged to fill up some of the sufferings Christ Jesus left behind for the benefit of those who should be associated with him in his righteous government. Says the apostle, who suffered for His name's sake: “Who nov. rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the church.” (Col. 1: 24) The Jonadabs now suffer with the remnant because they are companions and fellow workers of such and are engaged in God’s “strange work”.—Heb. 10: 33.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font11">J</span><span class="font6">EHOVAH addresses those who desire and who love righteousness, and who suffer reproaches because they are diligent in seeking righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For their encouragement and comfort he says: “Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of their revil-ings.” (Isa. 51:7) Primarily those words were addressed to God’s typical people. Later they apply to all consecrated persons, whether of the anointed or of the “other sheep”. For centuries the Devil has reproached the name of Jehovah, and every creature who has been diligent in serving God has been the object of Satan’s attack. Now Jehovah’s King has been enthroned and has begun his reign and the Devil is exceedingly angry in putting forth his strenuous efforts to turn all persons away from God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>2</sup> The Theocracy is the hope of man. There is no other hope. For this hope and the publication of the Theocracy Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions stand accused before all nations of the earth. They welcome such opposition and the reproach that is heaped upon them. They rejoice to have some part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name, well knowing that the Theocratic Government soon shall triumph and that those who stand firmly on the side of the great Theocrat and his King will share in that victory and continue forever in the joy of the Lord.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> The world-wide opposition to the Theocratic Government does not cause discouragement of those who faithfully proclaim the name of the Most High. That their courage may be strong and their hopes continue bright, the Lord feeds his people upon the spiritual food that is convenient for them. The anointed have been privileged for some time to have such spiritual sustenance, and now those who will form the “great multitude” (Rev. 7: 9-17) are hastening to the tower of refuge, the great organization of Jehovah, and it is the duty and privilege of the remnant to give to them all possible aid that they may be enabled to understand what is the will of Almighty God concerning them. It is the desire and endeavor of the Watchtower publications to render all possible aid</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">' No religious institution nor any of the members thereof suffer as did Christ Jesus and for the same reason. No religious system or institution or the members thereof proclaim the name of Jehovah, the great Theocrat, and announce his Theocratic Government by Christ the King. As to The Theocracy, the religious institutions are either silently or openly in opposition; therefore they do not and can not suffer for righteousness’ sake and the proclamation of the name of Jehovah God. There appears, however, to be a large number of persons held within the religious systems because they have been' ignorant of the truth, and which persons have a desire for righteousness, and it is to such honest and sincere persons of good will toward God that Jehovah’s witnesses and companions are now rendering aid and comfort, that such people may learn the right way, know that Jehovah is the Almighty and the great Theocrat, and that his King, Christ Jesus, is the Redeemer and the One who administers life everlasting to those who obey the laws of the Almighty God. It is the time for the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and this witness must be given just before that complete vindication. God has so ordained it, and so it shall be.—Ex. 9: 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">unselfish</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> The work in which Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions, the Lord’s “other sheep”, are engaged is done not for any selfish reason, and certainly not for any pecuniary gain or worldly honor that might come to them. Their work is done at the command of the Almighty God; and because they love him and rejoice in the opportunity to obey his commandments, they engage willingly in said work, regardless of opposition. They know that God is love, therefore wholly unselfish, and that everything he does is unselfishly done. They know that God is the fountain of life and that to him belongs salvation, and their great desire is for his salvation and full approval. Jehovah’s witnesses are not carrying on a campaign to gain members to their ranks. They are not propagandists. They are not a sect or denomination. They are a company of men and women who have individually taken their stand on the side of the Lord and who jointly go forward in obedience to his commandment to publish the Theocratic Government and to make known to the sincere people of earth God’s gracious provision for man’s salvation. When they have obeyed the Lord’s commandment to tell the truth as long as the door of opportunity is left open, their responsibility ends, because as soon as the witness work is completed God will exercise his unlimited power in the vindication of his name. Then he will assign to his faithful servants other work to do. As they now go forward in publishing The Theocracy it is for those who hear the message to elect to either serve God and live or reject the message, remain where they are, and suffer eternal death. (John 3: 36) The witnesses of Jehovah, having faithfully performed their commission and duty, will then rest content as to whatever may be the result. They ask no favors of men, but ask only to be given a respectful hearing as the representatives of the Lord. They know that the will of God shall be accomplished, and with that they are wholly content.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REPROACHES</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ Few persons understand just why this company of Christian people called “Jehovah’s witnesses’’ and “companions” are diligent in their efforts to obey the commandments of Almighty God. Likewise few persons understand just why Jehovah’s witnesses and companions should be so greatly reproached by religionists. That some of open mind may be enabled to understand the true reason, the Scriptural evidence is published in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font6"> The religious opponents and those who represent them in any and all capacities attempt to belittle the efforts of Jehovah’s witnesses and to class them as a sect of religionists, dub them as fanatics, and wholly misrepresent the work they are undertaking. Let those who desire to know the truth consider carefully what follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ God, “whose name alone is JEHOVAH,” is the Creator of heaven and earth. (Ps. 83:18) To him belong heaven and earth and the fullness thereof. (Ps. 24:1) He created the earth and then made man the perfect creature to inhabit the earth and to fill the earth with a righteous offspring. (Isa. 45:12,18; Gen. 1:28; 2:7) God created Lucifer and assigned him to the position of overseer or overlord of earth's creation. It was the solemn duty of Lucifer to work in harmony with the Creator and honor Jehovah’s name, but that he did not. Lucifer coveted the place and the honor which all creation gave to the great Creator, and he set about to turn all creatures against the great Creator. He is therefore designated in the Scriptures as the covetous one. (Jer. 51: 13) It is written in the Scriptures that Lucifer said in his heart, that is, to himself: “For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north; I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High.”—Isa. 14:13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ Lucifer concluded that he could accomplish his unholy and unrighteous purpose and desire for honor and praise by protesting against Jehovah God’s manner of carrying forward his purpose. Protest, therefore, was a slander against the name of the Most High. He set about to poison the mind of the perfect man against God, and for this reason he resorted to lies that the great name and word of the Almighty God might be reproached and defamed. Lucifer expected that his action against God would work out to his own advancement and elevation. He therefore lied to the first man and woman and induced them to disobey God's law and to bring upon themselves death. (Gen. 3:1-5; 2:17; 3:16,17) Because of his wrongful act in yielding to the great enemy Lucifer, Adam was sentenced to death, driven from Eden into the unfinished earth, degraded and cursed and subjected to a lingering death. Adam was unable to carry out the divine command to multiply and fill the earth with a righteous people, and his inability was due to his own wrongful act. All his offspring inherited death, and therefore it is written: “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.”—Rom. 5:12.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup> Following the rebellion and opposition to God by Lucifer the name of that wicked one was changed, and from that time onward to this day he has been known by the four names, to wit, Satan, Serpent, Dragon, and Devil. (Rev. 20:1,2) Lucifer’s making the attempt to exalt himself and exalting himself brought about his downfall, and God debased him and brought him low, and ever since Satan is the complete expression of wickedness, and in due time shall suffer complete destruction. Of that wicked one it is written: Wet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit. They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms; that made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners? All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house. But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under feet. Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people; the seed of evil doers shall never be renowned.”—Isa. 14:15-20.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>I!</sup> Further describing the Devil it is written in God’s Record, the Bible: “Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so; thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee. By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned; therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God; and I will destroy thee, 0 covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou bast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness; I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee. Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffic; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee; and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth, in the sight of all them that behold thee. All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee; thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more.”—Ezek. 28:14-19.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>12</sup> By way of a parenthetical statement here, it will be noted that, in all the years that have gone by, men who have desired to exalt themselves to a high position and to make for themselves a reputation that they might receive the praise of others have followed Satan’s lead by protesting against that which is right and by resorting to acts of wickedness, thereby hoping to accomplish their own selfish purpose. In every instance it will be noted, as the Scriptures and the facts are examined, that he who attempts to exalt himself at the expense of others is certain to be debased by the great One who promotes or puts down creatures. Few men have learned this unchangeable rule set forth in the Scriptures. Those who have appreciated the meaning of such rule have delighted themselves in Jehovah God and rejoiced to exalt his name. Such persons have appreciated the words written in the Scriptures, to wit: “For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south: but God is the judge; he putteth down one, and setteth up another.”—Ps. 75: 6,7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>15</sup> The prophet then puts in the mouth of those who love righteousness these words: “But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.” (Ps. 75:9) The faithful remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses now on earth and their companions, the Jona-dabs, know that every good and perfect thing comes from Jehovah God, and they delight to do his will, and consequently they look forward with hope and rejoicing in the salvation that he will bring to them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>14</sup> Turning back now to the rebellion in Eden: Be it noted that the Devil had succeeded in causing the death of the man Adam, God’s perfect creature, and then the Devil, filled with pride and malicious hatred, further defied the Almighty God by declaring that he, the Devil, could cause any and all men to curse God to his face and that no man would remain true and faithful to Jehovah God and therefore God is not the supreme one. (Job 2: 5) That raised the question of who is all-powerful, Satan the Devil or Jehovah God. All creation would look on and see what would be the result, and this creation included the angelic host of heaven. That all creation might in due time know that Jehovah God is the Almighty One and that Satan is the chief one of the wicked, Jehovah God accepted the challenge of the Devil and permitted him to put forth his best endeavors to prove his wicked challenge. Although Satan had been sentenced to death, Jehovah God delayed the execution of that sentence of death until such time as the Devil might have full and fair opportunity to prove his boast or demonstrate the fallacy of his challenge. For this reason God said to the Devil, addressing him under the symbol of an earthly ruler, to wit: ‘‘But for this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.”—Ex. 9:16, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>15</sup> This emphatic declaration of the Almighty God proves that in God’s due time his own name shall be proclaimed throughout all the earth and that this must be done immediately preceding the time when Jehovah God will exercise or demonstrate his unlimited power against Satan and all his cohorts. It also follows from that declaration of Jehovah that everyone who faithfully proclaims the name of the great Theocrat and his King and government would be a target against which Satan would launch his great opposition and that in this Satan would be joined by all of his wicked hosts. All the facts prove that this conclusion is correct even as the prophetic Scriptures have pointed out.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> Following the rebellion of Satan Jehovah God announced his purpose to produce a royal seed, that is, a great governing power, which shall act under Jehovah’s command and destroy Satan and all his power. In symbolic phrase the Almighty God said to Satan: “And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.” —Gen. 3:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>17</sup> The “woman” mentioned here is a symbol under which is foretold God’s universal organization that brings forth “the seed” that will accomplish his purpose, and “the seed” of that universal organization is the great and mighty King of the Theocratic Government, which shall rule the world in righteousness. That seed, the King of The Theocracy, is Christ Jesus. (Isa. 54:1-13; Gal. 4:26,29) A long period of time elapsed during which the Devil continued to debauch humankind and to bring reproach after reproach upon the name of the Most High. Then God sent to earth his beloved Son Jesus to be a witness to the truth concerning Jehovah’s name and his purpose. (John 18:37) Jesus proved himself faithful to Jehovah, and justly received the title “The Faithful and True Witness”. (Rev. 1:5; 3:14; 19:11) Every one who is a faithful follower of Christ Jesus, and who is therefore a Christian, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">must be a witness to the name of Jehovah God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THEOCRACY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> The Great Theocrat is Jehovah God. the Almighty One. The Theocracy is the government of Jehovah God, which shall rule the world in righteousness to the praise and honor of Jehovah's name and which shall fully vindicate his name. The King of that great theocracy, or the one ruling directly under the command of the great Theocrat, is Christ Jesus. For his own name’s sake Jehovah God sent Jesus to earth. The primary purpose of the coming of Jesus was to vindicate Jehovah's name, and it is by and through the Kingdom or Theocratic Government that such vindication shall be accomplished. The secondary purpose of the coming of Christ Jesus to the earth and the laying down of his life was that the ransom or purchase price might be provided to redeem and deliver men who would devote themselves entirely to God and his Theocratic Government. (Matt. 20:28; John 3:16; Rom. 6:23) Jesus came in the name of his Father. His Father's name was put upon him, and all that reproached Jehovah also hated Christ Jesus for his name’s sake. And even to this day all who faithfully represent the Lord Jesus are hated for his name’s sake, and winch hatred against them is manifested in the worst manner b\ hypocritical religionists.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>19</sup> The Theocracy is “the kingdom of heaven&quot; because it is the government of Jehovah God operated from heaven by his duly appointed representative. Christ Jesus the King. At the time of his baptism at the Jordan Jesus was anointed by Jehovah as King. (Matt. 3:16) Then Jesus began his work of bearing witness to the name of Jehovah God. His very first discourse, and each one thereafter, magnified Jeho vah’s name. The first time he spoke to others, follow ing his anointing, he said: “The kingdom of heaven is at hand.” (Matt. 4: 17) That was literally true foi the reason that Jesus, the King, was then and there speaking to those who heard him. For three and one-half years thereafter Jesus went about amongst the people, visiting them from house to house in the towns and villages, telling them the truth concerning his Father, Jehovah God, and of his kingdom. At all times he emphasized the paramount importance of the kingdom, which is The Theocracy, and he specifically commanded his followers to always pray to Jehovah God: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven.&quot;—Matt. 6: 10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup> Jesus made known to his followers that others should be associated with him in his kingdom am! all of these must meet a specific test. (Luke 22: 28-30) He told his followers that all who would be associated with him must be witnesses to Jehovah’s name and to his great government. (Matt. 28:19; Luke 12:32) </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">condition precedent to being in the kingdom with Christ Jesus was then announced: that they must suffer with him the reproaches that had fallen upon him, and which reproaches would come by reason of his name and the name of his Father. Jesus was “the faithful and true witness” of Jehovah God and maintained that faithfulness at all times while enduring all manner of opposition, even submitting to an ignominious death as if he was a sinner. He made himself of no reputation. He did not seek honor at the hands of men. He never at any time attempted to exalt himself. In the eyes of the ruling element of the world he “had a bad character”, although he was the only true and perfect character that has ever walked this earth. His faithfulness to God in the performance of his assigned duty merited and brought to him God's approval, and concerning him it is written : “But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name; that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.” (Phil. 2: 7-11) “Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.”—Heb. 5: 8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS FAITHFULNESS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>21</sup> Faithfulness of the Lord Jesus even unto death proved that Satan is a liar and that Jehovah God is true and the Almighty One. God permitted the lifeblood of Christ Jesus to be poured out upon the earth and accepted the same as the purchase price for sinful men who repent, believe, and then faithfully obey and serve Jehovah God. Jehovah God then raised Jesus out of death. Jesus died as a man; he was raised from death as the immortal spirit creature. His resurrection was complete proof of the supremacy of the Almighty God and was Jesus’ reward for faithfulness. The death and resurrection of Christ Jesus make it possible for men who have been born in sin and shapen in iniquity to meet the requirements that the Lord has placed before them and to be delivered from sin and become servants of Jehovah God and receive from him through Christ Jesus the eternal blessing of life everlasting. These mighty, undeniable truths Christians know, and they delight to be permitted to be in a class with Christ Jesus as witnesses to the name of the Most High.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OPPOSITION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>22</sup> In opposition to God, and to further reproach the name of Jehovah, the Devil tried to bring about the death of the babe Jesus, but failed. (Matt. 2:12-17) From the very hour when Jesus was anointed to be the King the Devil tried to destroy Jesus. (Matt. 4:1-11) This the Devil did in his endeavor to carry out his wicked challenge to Jehovah and to further reproach the name of the Most High. During the three and one-half years that Jesus went about doing good, preaching and teaching the people of and concerning the kingdom of Jehovah, the Devil constantly reproached him and tried to kill him. Because of his love and zeal'for doing the will of Jehovah his Father, Jesus literally suffered and constantly bore reproach at the hands of the Devil and his agents for the sake of His Father’s name. It is therefore written concerning Jesus: “I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother’s children. For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.”—Ps. 69: 8, 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>23</sup> At the beginning of his earthly work God gave to Jesus twelve men as his disciples and companions who should walk with him, be taught by him, and under his direction teach and comfort others. All of that number except one stood the test of persecution and proved faithful to God and to their leader. That one exception was Judas Iscariot, who, because of his selfishness, fell away to the Devil and is designated in the Scriptures as a traitor, “the son of perdition,” and is used as a type foretelling a large class of persons who become unfaithful and betray those who are faithful to God and Christ Jesus, and who constitute the composite body known as “the man of sin”, “the son of perdition,” and which includes the unfaithful clergy and those more specifically mentioned as the “evil servant” class. The eleven faithful disciples of the Lord continued as long as they were on earth to preach Christ Jesus, the King, and to exalt the name of Jehovah and his great Theocratic Government. They at all times stressed the paramount importance of The Theocracy, and for their faithfulness they likewise were reproached and maligned by the Devil.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>24</sup> There was a man known as Saul of Tarsus, a lawyer of high repute amongst men, a zealot in the practice of “the Jews’ religion”, and a persecutor of the followers of Christ Jesus. He being sincere in his work, which the Lord knew, in due time the Lord opened his understanding to the truth. He then repented, turned about completely, and became a true follower and servant of Jesus Christ, and his name was changed from Saul to Paul, and the Lord Jesus Christ made him a special apostle and servant to the nations of earth aside from the Jews. This faithful apostle, a true, loyal and faithful Christian, wrote much of the Scriptures thereafter under the inspiration of the spirit of God. He was greatly persecuted by religionists, and in the face of all this persecution he said: ‘Through Jesus Christ we have access by faith unto the grace of God, and we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God; and not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience ; and experience, hope; and hope maketh not ashamed: because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy spirit, which is given to us.’ (Rom. 5:1-5) Again, he wrote to his fellow Christians that they must not be pleasers of themselves, but should seek always to please God: “For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.” (Rom. 15: 3) Frequently he was arrested and haled before the courts for preaching the gospel without first obtaining a permit from some earthly power, and that same devilish rule still exists in all nations in the land today called “Christendom”, where constituted earthly authorities attempt by law to prohibit Christians from preaching the gospel without first obtaining a permit from a police officer.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">DEFAMERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>25</sup> All persons who have indulged in the reproach of Jehovah God, of Christ Jesus, and of the followers of Christ Jesus known as Jehovah’s witnesses, have been labeled by the Scriptures and have labeled themselves as the children or offspring of the Devil. It is certain that Satan has selected the means of bringing reproach upon Jehovah God and his servants that would best serve the Devil’s purpose. Following the flood Satan adopted religion as the means of thus reproaching God. He formed religious organizations and has ever since used religion as the chief means of reproaching God’s holy name. Satan first laid hold upon Nimrod and made of him a cruel slayer of beasts and of men; by which means Nimrod became famous amongst other men and was given the name and title of the mighty Nimrod “before [that is, superior to] the Lord”. (Gen. 10:9) Nimrod then set up a political organization with himself as dictator. He carried on wars of conquest against others. He put all the people in a state of fear of himself and his associates and led them into the Devil’s trap and caused them to indulge in the worship of himself and other devils. (Prov. 29:25) Satan, by means of religion, there began to turn men away from and against the Almighty God, and religion has ever been his means of reproaching God’s holy name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>29</sup> When Nimrod died he was held up before the people as a great one who had been exalted to heaven, and the people were induced to worship the name of that wicked one. Thus the Devil not only organized but has perpetuated religion and has used it to carry out his wicked challenge to God and to defame his holy name. It has been his most successful means of deceiving honest people. As other nations were formed following the organization of Babylon they too were induced to adopt and practice some kind of Devil worship or religion. To bring forth the “seed” and set up His typical theocratic government, to the end that some might be kept in the right and righteous way at the coming of the great King, Jehovah organized the faithful descendants of his friend Abraham into a nation, which nation is designated in the Scriptures as Israel. He also used that nation to make prophetic pictures or dramas foretelling his purpose of setting up the Theocratic Government. The nation of Israel was in fact a typical theocracy, organized to safeguard that people from the wicked influence of the Devil religion. God commanded that they should have nothing to do with those people or nations that practiced Devil worship. He assigned the Israelites to the land of Palestine. He gave to that people his law covenant and commanded that the) should be diligent to obey his law and be ready to serve him. He sent that people into the land of Palestine to take possession of it and to drive out the Devil worshipers who opposed the theocratic government and reproached Jehovah’s name. Therefore God said to his faithful people that not only should they have nothing to do with religion, but they should destroy those who practiced religion and who wrongfully held possession of their God-given lands: “And thou shalt consume all the people which the Lord thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them; neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee. The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire; thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein; for it is an abomination to the Lord thy God.” (Deut. 7 :16, 25) God thus warned the Israelites that religion would ensnare them. (Judg. 2:2,3) Tim Israelites fell under the influence of the Devil and adopted the Devil religion and therefore turned to the worshiping of idols and images, and merited and received punishment at Jehovah’s hand: “They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the Lord commanded them: but were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. And they served their idols; which were a snare unto them. Yea, the) sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils.”—Ps. 106: 34-37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>27</sup> Because the Israelites adopted and practiced religion God cast them away from him. When the Lord Jesus came to the Israelites he found the leaders among them, called “Pharisees”, and who constituted the clergy of that time, teaching the people religion and religious practices based upon the traditions or teachings of men. Jesus reproached them for it and told them that they had made God’s law of none effect and had fallen away to the Devil: “Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders ? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? Ye hypocrites! well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they xlo worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.”—Matt. 15 :1-3, 7-9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>28</sup> Those religious leaders, the Pharisees, were the chief persecutors of Jesus, and the reproachers of Jehovah’s name. Although they claimed to be servants of God they were in fact the offspring of the Devil, because they had forsaken the commandments of God and adopted and practiced Devil worship. They were constantly reproaching the name of Jehovah God. Therefore Jesus said to them: “If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham. But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which 1 have heard of God; this did not Abraham. Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God. Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me; for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. Why do ye not understand my speech 1 even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.”—John 8: 39-44.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>29</sup> On another occasion Jesus told those same religious leaders that they were hypocrites and a generation of vipers, bent upon doing injury to everyone who was seeking to honor and serve Jehovah God. &quot;But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men; for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">go</span><span class="font6"> in. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto w’hited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous. Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets. Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers. Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers! how can ye escape the damnation of [gehenna] ?”—Matt. 23:13, 25, 27, 29, 31-33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>80</sup> Mark this emphatically: that it was the religious men that reproached the name of God and Christ Jesus and that caused Jesus to be charged with all manner of wrongdoing and to be prosecuted and convicted of high treason and crucified as if he was a wicked creature. It was the religious clergy that tried to keep the people in ignorance of the fact that God had raised Jesus out of death, and they attempted to accomplish the same by bribing men with money and inducing them to commit perjury concerning the resurrection of the Lord. Why did they persecute Jesus and attempt to keep the people in ignorance of the truth concerning him? Because they were the dupes of Satan and did the bidding of Satan; in order that Satan might carry out his wicked challenge to Jehovah God and continue to reproach God’s holy name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MARTYRS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>81</sup> The Devil saw’ to it that all the faithful prophets of God who prophesied concerning the coming Theocracy were cruelly persecuted. They suffered all manner of punishment, and many of them were foully murdered. In every instance the Devil used the religionists to accomplish his wicked work. At the eleventh chapter of Hebrews, written under inspiration of the holy spirit, Paul describes some of these faithful men. He had once been a religionist and now, having become a true Christian, could fully appreciate the condition and circumstances surrounding those faithful men about whom he wrote: “They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, w<sup>r</sup>ere tempted, were slain with the sword; they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; (of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth. And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise; God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.” —Heb. 11:37-40.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>82</sup> Those faithful men are held forth in the Scriptures as examples of faith and faithfulness to Jehovah God and to his Theocratic Government. ‘Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us.”—Heb. 12:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>88</sup> The word “witnesses” used in this text is the same as the word rendered “martyrs”. Those faithful men by their very lifeblood bore testimony to the name of the Most High. Setting them forth as examples, the Scriptures record, for the benefit of others who have followed as -witnesses of the Lord, these words, to wit: “Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith; who, for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.”—Heb. 12: 2, 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>84</sup> Religionists persecuted Jesus because he proclaimed the name and kingdom of Jehovah. Knowing that they would do likewise to all of Jehovah’s -witnesses, Jesus gave warning that they would have to suffer like reproach; and this warning is couched in these -words of the Master: “If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.” (John 15:18-20) That prophetic utterance of Christ Jesus has been carried out and fulfilled against all those who have been faithful in publishing the name of the Great Theocrat and his Theocratic Government and King. Among those faithful ones was the first martyr following the crucifixion of Jesus. It was that man Stephen, whom the religionists caused to be charged with the crime of sedition. They had him arrested and brought into court. They bribed witnesses to testify falsely against Stephen, and when he stood before the court, and spoke in his own behalf and, above all, to the name of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, the religionists rushed upon him and put him to death.—Acts 6: 9-15; 7: 54-60.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>85</sup> Saul of Tarsus, then a religionist, stood by and saw Stephen die because of his faithfulness to God. When he became a Christian that vision doubtless was often before his mind, and when Paul suffered for righteousness he delighted to be in the class in which Stephen was found as the follower of Jesus Christ. All the faithful apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ not only suffered reproach, but were persecuted by religionists to the very end. Saul of Tarsus persecuted many of the followers of Christ Jesus. When he learnedsthe truth of and concerning the Theocratic Government he immediately abandoned religion, became a Christian, and thereafter strongly contrasted religion and Christianity. He was a living witness to the name of Jehovah God and he died as a witness to the name of the Most High. At Galatians 1:1-16, in the ninth chapter of The Acts of the Apostles, and in the twenty-sixth chapter of The Acts of the Apostles, Paul the Christian shows the complete opposition of religion to Christianity. Persecuted from one place to another, when he stood before others in Athens he plainly pointed out to them that religion is demonism. (Acts 17: 22, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Dia-glott)</span><span class="font6"> These facts are mentioned here for the purpose of calling to the attention of others of good will that the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses, the opposition to their witness work, is all due to the Devil and his cohorts and is indulged in for the purpose of carrying out Satan’s wicked challenge to Jehovah God, and to prevent, if possible, the setting up of his great Theocracy, and the vindication of God’s holy name.—Ps. 83: 4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS COMING KINGDOM</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>86</sup> Jesus specifically instructed his disciples that he must go away and that in God’s due time he would come again and assume his high office as King of the Theocratic Government: “Let not your heart be troubled; ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.”—John 14: 1-3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>87</sup> He also warned his followers that the religionists would continue to persecute them, that they must expect this and firmly withstand the reproaches and persecution. “These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended. They shall put you out of the synagogues; yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service. And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.’’— John 16:1-3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">” His disciples inquired as to how they would know of the time of the coming of Christ Jesus and his kingdom, and he gave them evidence, which is prophetic, and which prophetic testimony began to have its fulfillment in A.D. 1914, marking the end of the uninterrupted rule of Satan in this world and the beginning of the reign of Christ Jesus the King.— Matt. 24: 3-46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“CHRISTIAN RELIGION&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” Satan always resorts to lies and fraud to accomplish his purpose. He turned the nation of Israel away from their covenant with God by means of religion. After the death of the apostles religious organizations came into being, and that first religious organization soon labeled itself as “the Christian religion”. Other religious systems have done likewise. That one strong, mighty organization of religion is also called “The Roman Catholic Church” and is ruled by a few men designated “The Roman Catholic Hierarchy of Authority”. The work of those dictatorial religionists is carried on under the name of “Catholic Action”, which is another name for all kinds of fraud, chicanery, hypocrisy and political manipulation against the common welfare. That organization has blasphemed the name of Almighty God and the name of Christ Jesus as no other organization that ever existed. Holding itself out, and its leaders, as the representative of God and Christ, that organization at all times has been against the Theocratic Government of Jehovah God by Christ Jesus; not only against it, but claiming that men shall rule the world as the vicegerent of Christ, thus not only reproaching God’s name but denying his announced purpose of establishing the great Theocratic Government by Christ the King. To deceive the people, the Roman Catholic organization claims that God established his church upon the apostle Peter and that Peter was the first pope, and that other men have succeeded him as pope. This blasphemous statement Peter himself emphatically denies, pointing out that the church of God is built upon Christ Jesus, the Chief Corner Stone, and that all the faithful members thereof are designated as stones in that building. “Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings, as newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby; if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious. To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious, ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded. Unto you therefore which believe he is precious; but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner, and a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient; whereunto also they were appointed: but ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light; which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God; which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.”—1 Pet. 2:1-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>40</sup> There is not one scintilla of evidence that supports the claim that Peter was a pope or that there has been a successor of Peter or that any pope that ever existed represented Jehovah God and His kingdom. By means of fraud and deception the Roman Catholic organization has brought the greatest reproach upon the name of Jehovah and his Theocratic Government. Honest and sincere people have been led to believe that the pope represents Christ and that the Catholic organization is God’s church; and thus the Devil has caused the blasphemy of God's name, and greater reproach to be heaped upon God's name than by any other means that he has employed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ Deceptive doctrines have been promulgated and are still taught by the Roman Catholic organization that lead the people into the Devil’s snare. Among such doctrines is that of “purgatory”. The Catholic organization claims that the dead are conscious in “purgatory<sup>17</sup>, suffering bodily pain and mental anguish, and that, by means of the prayers of priests on earth, such punishment may be shortened, and that if friends of the dead will contribute money for such so-called “prayers” the same will result to the benefit of the dead. Nothing could be farther removed from the truth than that, because the Scriptures uniformly declare that “the dead know not any thing’’, that they are unconscious, out of existence, waiting for the resurrection. By this fraudulent means of “purgatory” millions of money have been wrongfully extracted from the poor to build up the gigantic political organization that has oppressed the peoples of the various nations and reproached and defamed God’s holy name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Catholic organization through its Hierarchy leads the people directly into Satan’s trap, causing them to violate God’s specific command concerning images and the worship of the Devil. There never has been any other organization on earth that has deceived so many people and turned so many away from God and the Theocratic Government as that of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>48</sup> And now let this be noted: The Catholic organization of authority, the Hierarchy, constitute the chief persecutors of all Christians now on the earth. Acting under the direction of the head of that organization, persecution against Jehovah’s witnesses is viciously and wickedly carried on in every country on the earth. Faithful men and women are cruelly persecuted, beaten, imprisoned, and some of them killed, because they publish the name of Jehovah and his Theocratic Government. It is that religious organization that has induced the legislative bodies to enact laws for the specific purpose of punishing the witnesses for Jehovah’s Theocratic Government. That cruel religious organization has installed its representatives in all the municipal, political parts of the governments of earth. They enact ordinances or laws which forbid the preaching of the gospel of the Kingdom by going from house to house as did Jesus and his apostles, making this possible only upon condition that the ones who thus publish the gospel first obtain a permit from a police officer. They well know that any real Christian would not apply to any human authority for a permit to do what Almighty God has commanded him to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Furthermore, they well know that if application were made for such a permit the police officer would deny it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ The Roman Catholic religious organization claims that that organization is in a covenant with hell, and frequently uses the expression, “The gates of hell shall not prevail against us.” By that they convince themselves that they are there to rule the world, and frequently say, “Catholic schemes never fail.” But note what Jehovah God has caused to be written about that Devil-made, religious organization. He has permitted them to go on in their wickedness, but makes it certain that in his due time he will avenge his people, vindicate his name, and completely wipe out that devilish religious organization. “Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us; for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves; therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion [Jehovah's kingdom, The Theocracy, with Christ Jesus the Chief Corner Stone (1 Peter 2:3-9)] for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation; he that believeth shall not make haste. Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place. And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.”—Isa. 28:15-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">*<sup>5</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses, by the grace of God, have proclaimed his message of truth, which message of truth exposes the fallacy of religious claims and show’s religion to be of the Devil. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy have long advocated religion amongst the governments, in the schools and elsewhere, until they have induced great political rulers to say, “What we need is more religion.” They have induced the big commercial institutions to say that “we must have more religion or else our government will fail”. But now’ mark the sudden change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>16</sup> During the year that has just passed Jehovah’s witnesses, by a wide proclamation of the truth, have advertised to the world that religion is a snare and a racket, and that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy of Authority are the chief ones who set the snares and are the principal racketeers. Jehovah’s witnesses have not made this publication without authority, but have cited the Scriptures that prove beyond a doubt that religion originates with the Devil and is the Devil’s chief instrument. In order now to deceive the people further, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy suddenly changes its tactics. Consequently the public press throughout the earth for September, 1939, at the request of Pope Pius XII, announced “a nation wide drive to enlist the aid of every American Catholic in a crusade for ‘Christianity’ ’’. Such is a further defamation of the name of God and Christ. Jehovah God has never authorized any creature or organization under the sun to launch or carry on a nationwide drive and a crusade for Christianity. On the contrary, God places his truth before the people in contrast to Satan’s wickedness and permits all to intelligently choose. Those who wish to remain in the Devil’s organization are not driven out; as it is written that those who believe and serve God shall live, and those who do not believe and serve God abide in death.—John 3:35, 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">*' Amongst other things, that announcement for a nation-wide Catholic drive says: “Christianity is definitely on the defensive today.” That statement above quoted is absolutely foreign to the truth. Exactly the contrary is true. Christianity today is proclaiming to the world that the Kingdom, The Theocracy, is here, and that the only means of relief, deliverance and salvation for the people is by and through the Theocratic Government of Jehovah God. Chimtian-ity warns the people that within a short time Jehovah God, by Christ Jesus, will completely destroj all the governments and systems of this world, including the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Christianity never has to be on the defensive. Christ fights no defensive battles. He will lead in the great battle of Armageddon shortly, which will wipe out the enemy and completely vindicate Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ The aforementioned “drive” is in fact a part ol “Catholic Action”, the purpose of which is to obtain money from the people and to further draw the people into the enemy’s hand that the American nation may be completely dominated and ruled by a dictator, even as almost all of Europe is now ruled That one of the purposes of the drive is to get money to fui-ther put the people in jeopardy and to advance Catholic Action to grab control of America, note the following, which is quoted from that same announcement made at the request of the pope, to wit: “Formerly generous European countries can no longer contribute funds, which have been cut from 50 to 85 percent in some cases. As the Holy Father has said, the hope of the missions is in America now. This country’s Catholicism was the gift of Europe, and now is the time to pay the debt. . . . Every wage-earning American Catholic can afford one dollar to become a member of this Society for a year. Those who are more interested can acquire life membership or a family enrollment in a special membership. That is little enough to do on behalf of those men and women who are risking their lives daily in battle zones and in leper hospitals to defend and extend the cause of Christianity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ Mark how this will help them out. It is claimed that there are in excess of thirty million Catholics in America. One dollar from each one for a year’s membership would be a snug sum, and a life membership or a group membership would run into many, many millions. For what purpose? To enable Catholic Action to grab absolute control of the American government and rule it by a dictator, just as Nimrod did when Babylon was founded.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>50</sup> Mark this further quotation from the above: “This country’s Catholicism was the gift of Europe&quot;; not a gift of Christ. If Catholicism were Christian it would be for The Theocracy. Instead it is a broken-down aristocracy of dictatorial organization, ruled by demagogues, thugs, and gangsters of Europe.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>51</sup> Mark furthermore that the above-quoted Catholic announced “drive&quot; says: 'This is little enough to be done in behalf of those who are defending Christianity by engaging in wars in Europe.' In other words, Hitler the gangster is fighting the fight of Christianity. Nothing was ever farther from the truth than that statement, as every honest man knows.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">” No more evidence should be required than that above from the Catholic organization to prove that that and like religious systems and organizations are against the great Theocratic Government. The Theocracy will rest upon the shoulders of Christ Jesus. His is a government of righteousness, and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy of Authority will have nothing to do with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ Jehovah’s witnesses have no fight with human creatures, and certainly not because such creatures are Catholic. Their fight is against the devilish doctrines that have so long been used to deceive the people and to defame God’s holy name and to turn them into the Devil's snare. Jehovah's witnesses have no fight against any person because of what he believes or has been taught. The mission of Jehovah's witnesses is to publish the truth of God's Word of and concerning the great Theocrat and the King. It is the truth that enrages the Devil and his emissaries and causes them to fight against Jehovah's witnesses. In support of this statement that it is the Devil and his emissaries that are fighting against Jehovah’s witnesses, mark the following: “For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.’’—Eph. 6: 12.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>51</sup> Christ and his followers are against the demons ; Christianity is against demonism, and for the Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. Religion is the worship and service of the Devil and his associate demons. Mark the words of the Scriptures bearing upon this point: “And Paul standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said, 'Athenians, I perceive that in all things you are extremely devoted to the worship of demons.’ ”—Acts 17 : 22, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">•’ Religion is the chief means that puts fear into the minds of the people and leads them into the Devil’s snare. “Hell” and “purgatory” and indescribable suffering are held up before the ignorant people, and they are induced to hasten into the snare of the Devil, and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is the chief instrument used in that devilish work. “The fear of man bringeth a snare; but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe.” (Prov. 29: 25) “Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men.”—Isa. 29:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’“Truly then, as stated, “religion is a snare and a racket,” employed wrongfully to ensnare the people and to collect money from them under false representations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">the truth necessary</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>57</sup> The word of Almighty God is set forth in the Bible, and that is the only safe guide for man. “Tin word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto path.&quot; (Ps. 119:105) “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness ; that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.&quot;—2 Tim. 3: 16, 17</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Jehovah’s witnesses are not campaigning to get joiners to any thing or any organization. They arc not commissioned to do such a work. Their work is purely to publish the truth, that men may know the right way to go. As followers of Christ Jesus they must publish the truth, and do so. (John 18:37) From the time that Jesus was on the earth in the flesh until now there have been a few persons who have searched the Scriptures that they might learn the truth, and such have looked forward to and hoped for the coming of Christ Jesus as he promised. Such persons have always been unpopular with religionists and have always been the object of persecution at the hands of religionists. In spite of such persecution and misrepresentation these faithful Christians have pursued their faithful endeavors to learn the truth and to make that known to others. It would not be reasonable to expect them to be in any other class than that class of ones persecuted as Jesus and the apostles were persecuted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions love righteousness and hate iniquity, and in the heart of each is written the law of God. Therefore they do not fear the reproach of men, neither do they fear the Devil and his host of wicked supporters. They fear Jehovah God. Seeing that Jehovah God has promised them life everlasting, they fear that they might come short of the performance of their covenant with Almighty God and therefore fail to receive that which is promised. They delight to do Jehovah’s will, and with full confidence in him they continue to sing from the heart: ‘AVe shall rejoice in thy salvation.' —Ps. 13: 5.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark7"></a>LETTERS</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RESOLUTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As pioneer publishers in Wisconsin Zone 1, we adopt the followings resolution:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We give thanks to Jehovah, the Eternal King, for the privilege of being subject to his theocratic government now established on the earth We clearly recognize </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> as the channel being used of Jehovah to provide the instruction and encouragement so vitally necessary to our spiritual well-being, and the Society as the visible organization being used by Christ Jesus to carry out Jehovah’s purposes in the earth. We rejoice that Jehovah has richly blessed you, Brother Rutherford, and has used and contmues to use you mightily because of your faith and obedience. Jehovah knows that your fearlessness in the face of the enemy and your zeal for the vindication of his name fill the hearts of his little ones with joy and cause them to resolve to do more to honor the name of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We give thanks that the malicious charges circulated in this territory against you and against the Bethel family have been used by Jehovah to draw those more closely together whose hearts are set on his kingdom, and to cause them to resolve to be completely obedient and faithful to him. We clearly recognize that the charges made could not be intended to honor Jehovah’s name and that the purpose of Moyle, and other with his permission, in circulating such charges could only be to justify himself and to cause divisions among the brethren. Particularly are we thankful that, by Jehovah’s good grace, the Jonadabs so clearly see the issue, and, understanding this as a subtle attempt of the Devil to break the morale of the Lord’s people, quickly take their stand on the side of the great Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are thankful to you and to Jehovah for sending Brother Howlett to visit the various companies in this territory with proper information. His visits have nipped in the bud the attempt to disturb the consecrated and have been a stimulus to all the lovers of righteousness We realize that Armageddon is near and we resolve to “press the battle to the gate” with greater energy. We resolve to continue to follow organization instructions and to co-operate with whoever the Lord directs shall be sent to this territory to represent the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With Christian love from your brother and sister in Kingdom service,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Reginald</span><span class="font4"> A. </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bourne</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mrs. Reginald Bourne</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH DISTINGUISHES HIS ORGANIZATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The recent light on the question of the “great multitude” has very definitely settled what to all in the past was a mystery, and since your further treatment of this doctrine in your world talk from London last year the mystery is solved and all can now clearly see the Lord’s gracious purpose to vindicate his word and name before the whole creation, visible and invisible, in accomplishing his original purpose through the “other sheep” m filling the earth with their offspring. How grand to know that the sidestepping of the Divine mandate by Lucifer and Adam will be completely compensated by the fidelity of the Righteous Ruler, Christ Jesus, operating in conjunction with the Jonadabs! Surely one can exclaim with the revelator, ‘Great and marvellous ar&lt; thy works, thou King of the nations; righteous and true are ah thy ways.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This revelation proceeding from the temple and now lighten ing the whole world has placed the Lord’s people in a unique position and quite apart from every other organization on earth that claims to teach Divine truth, and this is more particularly noticed here in France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For a number of years past an opposition movement, obviously borrowing much of its information from [Pastor] Russell's wnt-ings, has been very active in its work of propaganda in France and adjoining European countries, having made a wide distribution of its literature, in which it especially expounds the theory of the filling of the earth during the Millennium by the millions of resurrected dead, and many people influenced by its teachings have become its proselytes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This particular society by its literature very generously places Jehovah’s witnesses as the “last of the sects” and does not hesitate to put itself forward in a modest way of its own as the great and only exponent of direct Divine revelation This and other similar schemes of opposition, more subtle even than the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, in that they are propagated under an apparent cloak of truth, have been the means of misleading many sincere people who have been quite unable to distinguish the Lord’s from other organizations. These latter, however, having always as their principal object the exaltation of the one controlling them (religion' adoration of the creature) and these are cases (as seen in the apostle’s admonition) where Satan transforms himself into an angel of light to deceive many; and in one’s daily experience in the kingdom service out here one has often felt the malignant effect of it and wondered how the Lord would unmask the evil</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You can therefore well imagine that this great truth on Jehovah’s mandate has brought the whole matter to a fine issue and determines for ever which organization the Lord approves, and it is with a feeling of profound satisfaction and joy that one is now, more than ever, able to show the people where Zion is, and. perhaps equally important, where Zion’s enemies are, and I believe every pioneer and company witness in France shares the same sentiments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1931 Jehovah placed his seal upon his people by giving them his name, thus separating them from every other arrangement on earth; and now he further distinguishes and magnifies the organization which bears his name, by this marvelous conception of his word—the real meaning of his original mandate</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It seems that the Lord is making all these things bare—one-after another (Paul says “the day shall declare it”)—and that it is his purpose to completely unmask every section of the enemy’s camp and at the same time bring Zion forth before the world so that all will be able to clearly recognize the only place where they may get the Truth.—Isa. 19: 19</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Well, I felt I must write this line to express the parliculai blessing the revelation of this doctrine (which the Lord in his wisdom has seen fit to keep sealed until “the day”) has brought to me individually, and many of the Lord’s people I have met out here have expressed the same joy. These great and progressive Biblical truths enable us to “drink of the brook” during the march and “lift up the head”—Ps. 110 -7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our company at Marseille joins with me in sending you and all the brethren with you our love in the Lord. The Lord is continually bringing out some of the “other sheep” here, in spite of the opposition of the coalition of religions against the kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In conclusion a word of appreciation for the courage and kindliness of dear Brother Harbeck and the brethren at Berne and Paris offices. We feel out here that we are a happy family in the Lord rejoicing together in our kingdom privileges—seeing “eye to eye” with all the watchmen of Zion</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord abundantly bless you, dear Brother Rutherford. Your brother by His grace,</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">APPRECIATION AND THANKS TO JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I wish to express to you and to Jehovah my God my appreciation and thanks for the wonderful truth and further light I have received since reading the </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two years ago I was an agent for the British and Foreign Bible Society, and as my customers wanted teachers’ and reference Bibles and other translations, I was obliged to look elsewhere, as our firm stocked only a limited number and chiefly the King James version. Incidentally I heard that the Bibles I wanted could be procured locally and if I called on Jehovah’s witnesses, as they had a good supply on hand In calling on the pioneers living in our town I found they had just the identical Bibles I needed and furthermore they were remarkably cheap. From time to time I purchased quite a number of copies, and with every Bible I received one of your bound books, and in this way I nearly completed the whole set of sixteen. I was about finished reading the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font4"> when our pastor, who, by the way, was Apostolic and claimed to be a prophet of God and also to speak in other tongues, ete., came to visit me and said the Lord had revealed to him that I was reading unsound literature and that I was to gather it all up and burn it straightway. Because of my refusal to do so he became very angry and, as a parting shot, said if I was not careful I would eventually land in the lunatic asylum. At that time quite a number of my friends in the church sent me threatening letters suggesting dreadful things would happen if I did not come baek to the fold. Furthermore, the seducing spirits had so confused my mind that I was at my wits’ end. I may say I held a responsible position in the church and many times I used to speak with other tongues, and up till this time I used to spend hours in a neighboring haystack praying for further light, and it came, not the way I expected, but through reading your books and papers, and when I took my stand boldly, like the three Hebrew boys, then, and not till then, did the seducing spirits leave me</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Truly “Christendom” is a snare and a wicked deception I have wasted forty years in the various churches looking for truth, and to my surprise and chagrin I found that religion and churchianity are a devilish racket. I now thank God for opening my eyes and bringing me out of prison. My one regret now is that I did not see the truth sooner. In my spare time I now engage in the witness work, especially- on Sundays, and, by God’s grace, during the last two years I have placed hundreds of pieces of literature; and one lady, on taking the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies,</span><span class="font4"> and pamphlets, said she would like to give me a donation to the work; and on opening the envelope I found it contained £1-4-6. Furthermore, the back-call work is bringing results and we are now in touch with several families.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Friends :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As you know, last week I paid a visit to your rooms (I came because I had promised to come to see you). It all seems so strange to me, that you, a strange company of people to me, should receive me in the spirit that I was received, that of friendship unheard of anywhere else I have been, for I was a stranger to you Your teaching was good and straight forward, i e., taken from the Bible, which I uphold as the Word of God I was learned in all the arts of the Roman faith, which I now reject and desire to become a witness and join you in the teachings of the Word of God In my humble capacity I desire to help in what I now know to be the Truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I cannot come to your sittings often, owing to my work, but whenever I can I will come if you will but accept me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">My friends, in fighting against the Church of Rome, which to me is Baal worship, you are up against a very strong organization. You will find much oppression.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark9"></a>FIELD EXPERIENCES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CALLING THE RELIGIONISTS’ BLUFF (ZONE 28, SCOTLAND)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“To encourage the new publishers at Dumbarton, which also includes Clydebank, a newly formed unit of the Glasgow company, a few of us went over to work the Catholic territory where trouble is usually encountered. We soon found it in the way of threats and abusive language. Down one side of a street some came to their gates forbidding a publisher to enter, and, as usual, loudly proclaiming him a Communist, although one or two forgot their piece and said he was a Fascist and threatened him with violence if he dared to work the other side. Inviting two other publishers to work it with him, he started back, placing 4 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> with booklets and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> No. 516 right opposite (one </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> with a Catholic who was disgusted with what she had seen), while those who had threatened were compelled to look on from their windows and see how well they had introduced the publisher to their neighbors. Forty </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> and over 200 booklets were left in that small Catholic section alone. The following week, a rather frail and comparatively new publisher, having left a CatholicFascist leaflet in a door, saw a woman running after her down the street and calling to her to stop. Expecting trouble, she stood her ground. On approaching, the woman demanded if she had left the leaflet. When informed that such was the case, she said: ‘It’s the finest thing I have ever read. I was cooking my dinner when you put it in, and when I started to read it, I simply had to go right through it. What have you got?’ She took </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> on the spot. So it’s turning on the heat that does it every time. It not only burns down the barriers for the honest-hearted to escape, but singes the ‘old lady’, and when she goes on the ramp she gets burnt some more.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JONADAB’S ZEAL FOR PIONEER SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A North Dakota zone servant writes: “Enclosed you will find an application for pioneer service in behalf of one of good will. I and some pioneers recently made a call on his father, whose name I had in my files. Wallace was present most of the time that we were reproducing the lecture ‘Victory’ for the father. The following Sunday, when the publishers came to bring the father to a meeting to hear ‘Government and Peace’, he was unable to come. Wallace said, ‘I’ll go.’ The pioneers intended to work territory on the way back, intending to give Wallace the opportunity to accompany one of them. But when they came to where there were two homes, Wallace said: ‘You take that house, and I’ll take this one.’ That day he decided to become a pioneer. We took him home, he got his clothes, and joined the pioneers ‘without unhitching the traces of the oxen’. He has been witnessing for three days and does well. Am enclosing an order for a phonograph for him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ABOUT TWO ARKANSAS HIGH-SCHOOL GIRLS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“They took some booklets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font4"> to school. They placed three booklets with their teachers and also did some house-to-house work after school hours. The next day one of the teachers said she had been informed by another teacher to stop the girls from placing the books in school, that it was ruining the churches. The oldest girl said: ‘Well, your churches are going down anyway.’ The next day the teacher wanted the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.</span><span class="font4"> So the girl placed one with her.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">“At the meeting in the town square at Doylestown, Ohio, a mob assembled and two men approached the sound-car and attempted to stop the lecture. Finding themselves frustrated in this, they stepped back and listened for a while and then approached one of the witnesses and said they were sorry for their action, that they were misinformed as to what this was. Shortly a group of four or five huskies approached the car, but were headed off by the first two men, who had attempted to stop the lecture, and after arguing awhile they also melted into the crowd. Later on a group of younger' persons started interrupting the meeting by blowing auto horns, throwing tomatoes and eggs, shooting off firecrackers, etc. Following the lecture, a small article appeared in the Doylestown paper stating permission had been withdrawn by the mayor for any further meetings. This was apparently an effort to bluff us out, since the mayor not only indicated his desire to have the meeting, but was willing to give us a written permit. The report was also circulated that ten carloads of American Legionnaires would be in town to break up the meeting. Yesterday, October 7, about 150 witnesses assembled. The men marehed, the ladies worked the houses with handbills and books. Quite a goodly number of back-calls were obtained. A large crowd gathered to hear the lecture ‘Victory’, and the entire meeting was held without any interference whatsoever. This was due to splendid co-operation of the mayor and marshal . these officers certainly gave us the very best of co-operation Several times when young ruffians, undoubtedly urged on by the Catholic priest of the town, attempted to drown out the talk with auto horns, etc., the officers quickly moved to stop it. During the lecture the bells of the Catholic church started sounding clangorously, but they were so far away the clanging was ineffective. We were informed that at a council meeting during the week the mayor called in the Catholic priest and informed him that he, the mayor, had given his permission for the lecture to be held and he would see to it that order was maintained, and warned the priest not to start anything. We are not sure, but cannot help but wonder whether the mayor was not helped to this stand b\ the witness recently given in Hubbard.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">“A kingdom publisher, witnessing around a Catholic incubator where bad eggs are hatched into priests, witnessed only 45 minutes, placing 2 bound books and 13 booklets, m five housek I stopped at a small white house on the way back to meet the car to replenish my supply of hailstones, and was received by a nice-appearing, well-built gentleman. In reply to his query as to what I wanted, I said. ‘I am one of Jehovah’s kingdom publishers.’ His quick answer was: ‘No religion for me!’ I stated that the reason I had come was to show him from the Bible that religion is a snare and a racket, that I had a short lecture by Judge Rutherford which I would like him to hear. ‘What did you say?’ ‘I said, Religion is a racket!’ ‘Boy, how well I know that! I am a highway patrolman here, and I know religion is a big racket. What did you say those booklets are worth ?’ 'Contribute 25c and take these six.’ ‘Here’s 50c, keep the change, and let me have your name and address, and I’ll let you know what I think of them. Be sure to stop here next time you are in town.’ ”</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God's law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establ</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">ishm</span><span class="font2">ent of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth&quot; with a righteous race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">This special Period which occupies the entire month of December is marked by the term “Courage”, a quality which Jehovah repeatedly exhorted Joshua to exercise in driving out the enemies of the theocracy, for an example to us today. December should shatter all previous records in booklet distribution, due to the almost unbelievable offer of seven of any of the Society’s booklets on a 10c contribution. If possible, every packet of seven should include the latest booklet, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy.</span><span class="font2"> A special wrapper, provided by the Society, helps make the 7-booklet combination all the more attractive. AU this will require special advance work, so start preparing now. Especially, attend the weekly service meeting of the local company of Jehovah’s witnesses, where the details of the work of “Courage” Testimony Period will be discussed. If you are not in touch with such, write this office for references. Keep accurate record of your activities and report same fully at close of December.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark7"></a>SALVATION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.”—Rev. 7:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">TEHOVAH, the Most High, has provided complete I salvation to them that avail themselves of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font5"> great ransom sacrifice. By His permission Jesus purchased the members of the human race that accept and comply with the terms of salvation which Jehovah has made. This great truth is now being made clear to all w’ho seek righteousness and who seek meekness. It necessarily follows that those who hate righteousness and who spurn the truth and who oppose the great Theocracy and the King thereof cannot be among those who will find salvation to life through Christ Jesus, the King of The Theocracy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Why are cruel dictators destroying all the nations that refuse to yield to the totalitarian rule? Why the rapid growth of dictatorial power since the World War ended in 1918? Will the totalitarian rule succeed in overrunning the earth ? Is there any way of escape from the cruel rule of the ‘’corporate state<sup>-</sup>’ organization and control by religionists and their allies ?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> These and related questions cannot be properly answered by the expressed opinions or theories of men. There is but one true and correct answer, and no man is wise enough to authoritatively give that answer. If you believe that Almighty God is perfect in wisdom and supreme in power, and that he is the rewarder of them that are diligent to learn from him, then you are beginning to have faith. If you fear God you are beginning to have wisdom and you will be diligent to seek the Lord. If you believe that the Word of Almighty God is the truth and you confidently rely upon that Word, then you have the foundation of faith by which you can grow in knowledge and understanding.—Heb. 11: 6; John 17:17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">‘ All things that have come to pass upon the human race since the beginning of creation until now wore known unto Almighty God from the beginning: &quot;Known unto God are all his works, from the beginning of the w<sup>T</sup>orld.” (Acts 15:18) Know and understand, then, that God foreknew of these days of peril coming upon the nations of the earth and he foretold the same time and again and caused that prophetic testimony to be recorded in the Bible, which is given to man for his guidance. (Ps. 119:105) Only those who believe in God, “whose name alone is Jehovah,” and who rely upon his Word as the truth will ever learn the correct answer to the foregoing questions. All persons who fear men, and who follow the traditions of men and who refuse to give heed to the information contained in the Bible because of fear of receiving an unfavorable opinion by men, will never get the correct answer. To persons who are sincere and honest and who are suffering under the burdens now weighing upon mankind the Almighty God says: “Come now’, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.”— Isa. 1:18.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> Only persons of good will toward God will reason upon his Word. They will discard everything of the teachings of men because unreasonable. It is such persons of good will that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoue:</span><span class="font5"> desires to aid to the end that they may profit by the provisions which God has made for all those who love and serve him.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ISSUE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> It is necessary to understand the great issue or question for determination in order to get a clearer vision of why the present conditions exist on earth and what will be the end thereof. That great question at issue and which must be finally determined soon is: Who is the supreme one and therefore whose rule shall prevail? God is the Creator and all of his creation is perfect. (Deut. 32:4) He created man and endowed him with the power to multiply and fill the earth with a righteous people. God gave to man his perfect law for his guidance and informed man that willful disobedience to that perfect law would result in his death. (Gen. 2:17) Man’s right to life and his continuance for ever thereafter depended upon obedience to God’s law, and disobedience meant death, or the end of life. Lucifer, also now known as Satan the Devil, introduced perfect</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">man to religion and induced man by religion to take a wrongful course. To Eve he said, in substance: “A violation of God’s law will not bring death upon men, but in the day that you eat of this forbidden fruit, contrary to God's law, you shall be as wise as gods [that is, as the demon gods associated with Satan].”—Gen. 3:1-5.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> The desire to do something contrary to God’s will led man into Satan’s trap. Man’s departure from the Word of God and his yielding to the word of the creature, the Devil, brought man’s downfall, and therefore all of the descendants of Adam were born in sin and without any right to life. “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.”—Rom. 5:12; Ps. 51: 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Having succeeded in turning the perfect man away from God the Devil then boastfully challenged God to put any man on earth that would remain true and faithful to the Almighty. (Job 2:5) If Satan could cause all men to willfully disobey God, that would prove that the power of the Devil is equal to or superior to Jehovah God’s power. Thus the question of supremacy was raised. God accepted the challenge and gave Satan full opportunity to make good his boastful challenge. To that end he said to Satan: “But for this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.”—Ex. 9:16, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>9</sup> The Word of God set forth in the last above text shows that there must be at some time a final settlement of the issue raised by the wicked challenge and at that time God will exhibit his power against Satan and all who remain on the side of Satan. At the settlement of that issue the question must be determined as to who is all-powerful, therefore who is supreme. In the centuries past Satan has had opportunity to use his power in his endeavor to turn men and nations against God. The time must come when Satan’s uninterrupted efforts to rule the world cease. Such time is known and designated in the Scriptures as “the end of the world”, that is to say, of the day of Satan’s uninterrupted rule over the nations and peoples of the earth. The coming of the World War in 1914 marked that time, as shown by the fulfillment of prophecy, and particularly the prophetic testimony of Jesus Christ, the great Prophet. The Lord God brought about the physical facts in fulfillment of such prophecy, thus showing that 1914 was the correct date. There and then the fulfillment of the prophetic words of Jesus was noted, to wit: “For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthqualms, in divers places.”—Matt. 24: 7,8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> Giving further evidence of the end of Satan’s uninterrupted rule, Jesus said that these other things would come to pass, to wit: “Upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; . . . men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth.” (Luke 21:25,26) Those words exactly describe the conditions that have existed since the World War of 1914 to 1918.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> Long ago God announced his purpose to set up his kingdom with Christ Jesus as King, and made known that his King must rule the world in righteousness; and for this reason Jesus admonished his followers to likewise pray to Almighty God: ‘Thy kingdom come; thy will be done, on earth as it is done in heaven.’—Matt. 6:10; John 18: 36,37 ; Dan. 2: 44.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> The coming of Christ Jesus the King and his enthronement as such must be at God's appointed time, and until that time the Lord Jesus must wait. Therefore God said to Christ Jesus when he ascended into heaven: “The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.” (Ps. 110:1; Heb. 10:12,13) The enthronement of Christ Jesus as the rightful ruler of the world would necessarily be resisted by Satan the Devil, and hence a war between the Lord Jesus and Satan and other demons. (See Psalm 110: 2-5.) The fulfillment of that prophecy began in 1914, when Jesus was enthroned according to the will of Jehovah ; as it is written in the Scriptures: ‘Thou hast taken thy great power and reigned, and the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come.’ (Rev. 11:17,18) Then began the “war in heaven”, with Christ Jesus and his host pitted against the Devil and his associate demons, resulting in the defeat of Satan and his army, all of whom were cast down to the earth.— Rev. 12:1-10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WOES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> From that time forward the Devil must confine his operations to the earth; and the facts show that he has done so. Concerning this it is written: “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth [that is, to the powers that rule], and of the sea [the sea symbolically representing the people of the nations of earth under the ruling powers] ! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.”—Rev. 12:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> It was in 1918 that the World War ended, and thereafter the totalitarian dictatorial rule came to the fore. Since then the woes upon all the nations have increased; and the reason is, because Satan knows that his time is short until the final settlement of the question of supremacy and therefore he puts forth his endeavors to turn all men against God and to destroy the human race. It is the Devil who has been bringing woe after woe upon the peoples of the nations, and who continues to do so. With each succeeding year since 1918 those woes have increased, and they will continue to increase until “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”, which will be fought, on one side, by Christ Jesus and his righteous host, against the Devil and all his followers. In the meantime, from 1918 onward, preparation is being made for the great and final battle, and at the same time another great work is going on.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DIVIDING THE PEOPLE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> The kingdom of God, for which Jesus taught his followers to pray, is The Theocracy, because it is the government of the Almighty God with Christ Jesus as King, who is the world’s rightful and righteous Ruler. All unrighteousness is pitted or arrayed against The Theocracy. This marks the dividing of the people of the earth into two separate and distinct groups. Concerning his enthronement as King and his coming for judgment it is written: “When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: and before him shall be gathered all nations; and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats; and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.”—Matt. 25: 31-33.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>lb</sup> Christ Jesus is the great Judge. (John 5: 22, 27) He sits in judgment of his own people and of the nations, and the judgment of the nations is the dividing of the people, and that judgment has for some time been in progress. It was in 1918 that Christ Jesus came to the temple and began judgment. As to the nations and the two classes into which the peoples are divided Jesus shows by symbol that those who oppose him are “goats” and that those who are favorable to him and his righteous rule are designated as “sheep”, that is, those who are of good will toward God and his kingdom. Every person upon the earth now must be put in one of these two classes, and by his own course of action he puts himself in one or the other. Therefore everyone must end up either as a “goat” or as a “sheep”, namely, one opposed to The Theocratic Government or one in favor of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">witnesses</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>17</sup> Christ Jesus is “the Faithful and True Witness” of Jehovah. Therefore he is the Head of and Chief of all of Jehovah’s witnesses. The judgment of Christ Jesus, conducted from the time of his coming to the temple of the Most High, first began with those who at that time had made a covenant to do the will of Almighty God. (1 Pet. 4:17) All the professed followers of Christ Jesus must appear before the Lord according to this prophecy and be tested and judged. Necessarily there would be two classes of these who claimed devotion to the Lord: one class those who are approved after standing the test, and the other class the ones disapproved after being submitted to the test. The announced purpose of such judgment was and is to afford opportunity to the consecrated to prove their integrity and that the approved or righteous ones might “offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness”. Therefore it is written in the prophecy: “And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.”—Mal. 3: 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> The “offering in righteousness” consists of a full and complete obedience to the commandment of the Lord, and particularly in making known the name and purpose of Jehovah, the name and purpose of his King, Christ Jesus, and the great Theocratic Government, of which Christ Jesus is the Head. The Lord there began to make known these great truths, and thereafter the approved ones received from the Lord this commandment, which they must obey, to wit: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations ; and then shall the end come.”—Matt. 24: 14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>19</sup> “Gospel” means good news. The coming of Christ the King and the beginning of his kingdom is good news, or gospel, to all who love righteousness and who hate iniquity. Those approved ones at the temple judgment must therefore be witnesses to the Lord and to his kingdom; hence Jehovah says to them: “Ye are my witnesses . . . that I am God.” (Isa. 43:10,12) These witnesses must bear testimony to the name of Jehovah, to his government, and to his King; otherwise they would be unfaithful.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> From and after 1918 the ones approved to God have gone forward proclaiming the name of Jehovah and his kingdom. Like others who have gone before them, they are Jehovah’s witnesses. They are not a sect, nor an organization founded by men, but have become members of God’s organization on the earth. Those faithful followers of Christ Jesus, and who are promised a place in the kingdom, he calls his “little flock” of sheep, and to them he says: “Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” (Luke 12:32) The last of these witnesses on the earth are designated the “remnant” of God’s organization, symbolized by his “woman”, and therefore against these, as the Lord foretold, the Devil and his representatives wage a warfare of persecution: “And the dragon [Satan] was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.”-Rev. 12:17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER SHEEP</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> Those who serve the Lord and who are pictured under the symbol of “sheep”, both those of the little flock and those who shall receive salvation in the earth, are the people of the Lord. These are all gathered to him. The ‘‘little flock” being first gathered, Jesus then says: “And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd. Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.”—J ohn 10:16,17.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> Those whom the Lord here calls his “other sheep” are the ones who compose the “great multitude” that has no limit to the number but is made up of all those who at the judgment of Christ Jesus are placed on “his right hand”, or place of favor, and are designated his sheep, and who receive the blessings of the kingdom. (Matt. 25: 35) In Revelation the seventh chapter it is stated that this “little flock” consists of 144,000 followers of the Lord Jesus Christ, and who are made members of “his body”. —1 Cor. 12:12,18, 27; Col. 1:18.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PROPHETIC PICTURE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> Immediately following the description of the body members of Christ, designated his “little flock”, Revelation makes this statement: “After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands.”—Rev. 7 : 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>24</sup> From that and other corroborative scriptures now fix in mind the following prophetic picture: Christ Jesus, enthroned as King of the great Theocracy. In 1918 he is seated upon the judgment throne conducting judgment according to the will of Jehovah God. Before him must appear and do appear all the nations of earth, for judgment and separation, whether they know that fact or not. By their own. conduct all peoples and nations show where they stand. The Lord has raised from the dead his faithful followers who died in faith and faithful, and these now are associated with the Lord in heaven. (Rev. 11:17,18) Christ Jesus is accompanied at this judgment by all his holy angels who serve him and carry out his orders or commandments. These are all invisible to human eyes. By faith in God and in his sure Word of prophecy we know that the picture portrays the true condition. On the earth the Lord has his faithful servants who proclaim his name and his kingdom and who are called “the remnant” of his organization. All of these zealously support The Theocracy and continually serve and praise the Most High.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>25</sup> Look now to the nations of the earth where the woes have increased year after year since 1918. The Devil and his company of demons are desperately attempting to carry out Satan's challenge to Jehovah God, and to this end he is putting forth all his efforts to turn the people against The Theocracy. The Devil knows that his time is short to prepare for the final showdown at Armageddon, and therefore he resorts to every known means of wickedness to accomplish his purpose. To this end he is gathering the nations and has gathered them against God and against his people. Accordingly it is written: “And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon [one of the names of Satan, and which mean' ‘devourer’, indicating that Satan’s purpose is to devour all the nations], and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon.”—Rev. 16:13,14,16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>26</sup> The word </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Armageddon,</span><span class="font5"> as used in this text, means the place of assembly of God's servants; hence the Devil gathers all his forces against the sen-ants of God and in opposition to the great Theocracy. This he does in preparation for the final battle. How does he accomplish that work?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TOTALITARIANISM</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2T</sup> “Religion” means the doing or performing of anything that is contrary to the will of Jehovah God. Following the traditions of men and giving honor and glory to creatures is religion. The practice of anything that tends to give glory to creatures is religion. Religion is and long has been the chief instrument of Satan to turn men against God and to carry out his challenge. It follows, therefore, that the great religious organization known as the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is the chief earthly instrument of Satan. The Hierarchy is the head and leader of all religions now practiced amongst the nations, and towers over all other organizations. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy is against The Theocracy. Falsely the Hierarchy claims to serve God. If that organization were serving Jehovah God, then the men thereof would have nothing whatsoever to do with the dictators of the world who are under the control of the DeviL The Roman Catholic Hierarchy freely and fully support the dictators, becoming bolder each day in announcing the support of the Corporate State.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> Nazism, Fascism, Communism, and all manner of religious isms, mean one and the same thing, because all such totalitarian or dictatorial rule that supports the power of government in the hands of dictators is against God and his government. All the dictators embrace and practice demonism or religion. AU are against Jehovah God and against Christ Jesus; therefore all such dictators are against The Theocracy. Dictatorial power, like a great ravenous beast, is overrunning and spoiling the earth. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy is riding upon the back of that ravenous beast, as described in Revelation seventeen. All the dictators and their supporters are against the witnesses of Jehovah who are bearing testimony to the name of the Most High and to his Theocratic King and kingdom. Dictators have turned the nations against God; therefore the nations once professing to serve God have entirely forgotten him and become his enemies.—Ps. 9:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>29</sup> In confirmation of the foregoing, note an article published in the Chicago (Ill.) </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Times</span><span class="font5"> of August 7, and contributed by the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> foreign editor, Irving Pflaum: “Port of Spain, Trinidad, Aug. 7 (Passed by British Censor).—Hitler intends to denounce Soviet Russia this autumn, return to the policy of the anti-Comintern pact, win the official support of the Vatican and ‘appease’ Roman Catholics in Germany, Poland. Belgium, and Latin America. This is the program Nazi agents say will be revealed by Berlin ‘as soon as the attack on Britain succeeds.’ I recently have had the opportunity to learn the inside story of future German policy as told to the highest South American leaders in ‘strict confidence’ by German agents now operating as diplomats or undercover men in South American countries. A president of an important ‘sister republic' himself told me what the Nazis have been telling him. . . . Alto the information which he gave me was confirmed in other quarters by diplomats and observers who are in positions to know what is going on in South America. . . . suspicion is Latin America’s natural attitude toward everyone. They began to believe that the Reich in its assistance to General Franco was really anti-clerical and anti-church. From the beginning, however, German agents smiled knowingly and told South Americans to wait and see what Hitler would do later. These agents spoke of the pact with Stalin as a clever trick which would be scrapped when Russia had been used. Now they are predicting that the time is near when Hitler can return to his former position as the arch foe of Communism and the protector of all things godly. They warn conservative Latin American leaders not to ‘fall’ for Anglo-American propaganda to the effect that Hitler is a godless revolutionary. These agents also say that when England has been subdued the world will witness der Fuehrer in his true and real light. He will then be able to show Latin America that he is a friend of the Catholic church and the one man who made the world safe for the Catholic antiCommunist communities such as Franco Spain and the present conservative forces in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and other Latin American countries.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> In agreement with the above article is an Associated Press dispatch published by the Philadelphia </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Record,</span><span class="font5"> on August 28, which reads: “Berlin, Aug. 27 (AP)—A pledge of loyalty to Adolf Hitler by the German Catholic Bishops Conference at Fulda is to be read to the faithful from pulpits at the end of the war, D.N.B., official news agency, said today. The pledge to Hitler is contained in expressions of gratitude to German troops adopted by the conference which ended August 22. The agency said the view predominated at the conference that ‘the Catholic church in Germany is indebted to German troops for the -victorious advance and defense of the German homeland. Without the successful warding off of enemy invasion by German armed forces, German Catholics could not have pursued so undisturbed and quietly their church work and ministerial offices.’ ‘Publication of the pastoral letter, customary in past years after conclusion of the conference, is to be postponed until after the final victory of German troops,’ the agency added.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>31</sup> All such opponents of The Theocracy, and who therefore persecute the servants and witnesses of Jehovah, the great Judge, Christ Jesus, designates as “goats”. The invisible demons, of which the Devil is the chief, are all in darkness as to God’s purposes. The visible part of the Devil’s organization, led by the religionists, are also blind as to Jehovah’s purposes. All these visible ones are “goats”. Therefore the demons invisible and the demoniacal leaders of the visible part of the organization are blind, and all such are headed to the ditch of destruction, symbolized by the Dead Sea. (Matt. 15:14) All the followers and supporters of that blinded, demoniacal crowd are in darkness; hence it is written in the Scriptures: ‘Darkness covers the earth [the ruling powers], and gross darkness the people.’ (Isa. GO: 2) Totalitarianism is a “complete black-out”, that is, in darkness and entirely away from the favor of Jehovah God. Such is the Devil’s rule, and such is a meager description of his organization. That organization of Satan, both invisible and visible, is fatally bent upon punishing all who support The Theocratic Government under Christ Jesus.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>32</sup> With this foreground the answers to the questions above propounded are clear: Why are cruel dictators destroying all the nations that refuse to yield to the totalitarian rule! Because such is the Devil’s scheme and means to carry out his -wicked challenge against Jehovah God. That religious, fanatical rule, it appears, will overrun the whole earth, but it will succeed for only a very short time, and then its final end must come at the appointed time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>83</sup> The Lord further identifies the goats by showing in his prophetic utterances that they would ill-treat and persecute his servants. Now the physical facts prove the fulfillment of this part of the prophecy beyond any question. Every totalitarian government is against the servants of Jehovah God, and they and all their supporters indulge in the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses. That persecution is induced by the chief religionists, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. In the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses these opposers of The Theocracy completely ignore the fundamental law of the land guaranteeing freedom of worship. Even though the Supreme Court of the United States has laid down the rule in harmony with the Constitution that Jehovah’s witnesses have the full right and liberty to go from house to house and present their literature, and to receive contributions from the people to carry on the advertising of the kingdom, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy incite public officials to ignore the law and to ignore the ruling of the court and to constantly and continuously harass, ill-treat, arrest, imprison and abuse Jehovah’s witnesses because they are announcing the name of God and his kingdom. Not only do they wrongfully and unlawfully arrest Jehovah’s witnesses, but then they cause the radio stations, over which they have control, to broadcast to the people throughout the land words to this effect: “A religious sect, known as Jehovah’s witnesses, have been rounded up and arrested and put in jail because of the selling of their pamphlets.” When these witnesses are discharged because there is no law against their work, the radio stations are silent about such discharge. The clear purpose of the entire combine is to defame the name of Jehovah God and his Theocratic Government. This persecution continues with increased viciousness day after day. The persecutors, including the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and public officials, well know that Jehovah’s witnesses are harmless. They are not afraid of any harm that Jehovah’s witnesses will commit, but their persecution plainly shows that these persecutors are fighting against The Theocratic Government. The Lord so counts it, and designates the persecutors as ones who fight against him, and to such he says: “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.” “Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.” (Matt. 25:40,41) This is proof that the religionists and the totalitarians are the instruments of Satan, working under his supervision and blindly attempting to carry out his challenge to Jehovah God, and hence against The Theocratic Government.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>34</sup> Wickedness in the earth will continue until the battle of that great day of God Almighty, at which time the religious, totalitarian crowd will be completely wiped out in vindication of Jehovah’s name. Opposers of The Theocracy hate the name of Almighty God. This is particularly true with reference to the totalitarian rule. They take a delight in defaming God’s name and the name of Christ. They likewise take a delight in persecuting the followers of Christ Jesus, for the simple reason that such servants of the Lord proclaim his name. This wicked conduct on the part of religionists and their supporters the Lord foretold when addressing his faithful servants in these words: “Ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.”—Matt. 24:9.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">salvation</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>35</sup> But look at the other side of the picture, that glorious picture which the Lord has revealed by his Word. The King of the great Theocracy is enthroned. The glorious light of the Most High shines into the face of the King, and that light is reflected upon all who are of his organization, being fully devoted to The Theocracy. None of these are in darkness. There is no “black-out” for them, because they are in the light and know God’s purpose and know what will be the end. (1 Thess. 5: 4, 5) Those devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom, having been brought into the temple of God, where they receive the reflected light of Christ Jesus, the Head of the temple, now continue to “offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness” by joyfully proclaiming his name and his great Theocratic Government. The angels of heaven, and the faithful ones who have gone before and are resurrected and now with the Lord, join in the song of praise to the Most High and to his King. The Lord opens the gate for his “other sheep&quot; to enter; and behold them coming from every nation, of every kindred and tongue! They come with palm branches in their hands, waving these to the praise of the Lord, and thus hail him as King and the earth’s rightful Ruler. They come with songs of praise to his name and to the name of the great Theocrat. And what are they saying?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> It is the day of salvation, and all those persons of good will toward the great Theocracy and the King thereof are now diligently seeking righteousness and meekness while they joyfully journey to their everlasting home. It is the time of great tribulation on the earth when all the nations are in terrible distress. But out from that great tribulation those persons of good will, that is, the Lord’s “other sheep”, are coming. They are identified as being on the Lord’s side by white robes which they wear, white being a symbol of their love of righteousness and their hating of iniquity, and their faith in the shed blood of Christ Jesus. Their faces are urned to the great Judge upon the throne and to the Ylmighty God. They join in the song of praise with he holy angels and faithful men who have died and ieen resurrected, and the faithful members of “the emnant” are singing. Together all are giving praise, lonor and worship to the Almighty God and to the .amb, that is, the King who sits in judgment upon he throne. It is the time and occasion of great reoicing to all of those who have taken their stand irmly on the side of the Lord and on the side of his government of righteousness. With this picture in nind foretelling what is going to be the result of all he distress now on the earth, those who love right-ousness can rejoice in tribulation, and they do re-'oice.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE REALITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3T</sup> The kingdom, for which Jesus taught those who ove righteousness to pray, is here. Who now will ind refuge from every increasing storm that lashes dl the shores of the earth? Who will be saved to life ind to endless joy? The answer must be found in the Scriptures, not in the theories of men. The answer s clear and emphatic: “To Jehovah belongeth salvation: On thy people be thy blessing! [Selah].”— Ps. 3: 8, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham Pss.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>33</sup> That emphatic declaration from God's Word alone settles the question as to who will be saved and who will perish at Armageddon. What can be said of the combination made up of Fascists, Nazis, Communists, Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and other opponents of The Theocracy? It is certain that salvation cannot come to any of them. It is likewise absolutely certain that none of that organization can minister salvation to any other creature. Salvation belongs alone to the Almighty God. No one can find peace and life everlasting by adhering to that religious, political combination, above named. That organization of the enemy holds out absolutely no hope whatsoever, because it is Satan's organization and Satan is against The Theocracy. That organization of Satan and all its supporters are against Jehovah and against his King. If that organization of religionists and supporters is not for the kingdom of God, they are against the kingdom; and we know that no part of the organization is for the kingdom. (Matt. 12: 30) All such are enemies of God, and concerning his enemies it is written: “Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies; thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.” (Ps. 21:8) That religious, political organization hates the name of Jehovah and his King, and they hate those who proclaim The Theocratic Government and its King.—Matt. 24: 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>39</sup> Will Jehovah God grant salvation to his enemies? The Devil’s doctrines, proclaimed by those advocating “universal salvation”, the teachers of which are the blind servants of Satan, say Yes. God's Word says No. To say that the ransom sacrifice of Christ Jesus is provided for all humankind, including those who hate God and hate his government under Christ, is wholly unreasonable and certainly un-scriptural. God permitted his beloved Son to purchase the human race in order that those who believe and serve him might not perish. This is definitely stated as follows: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16) It necessarily follows that those who do not believe on the Lord Jesus Christ shall perish.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>40</sup> The entire human race came under condemnation because of Adam’s sin, and all must perish unless God provides salvation from death for them. That provision he has made by and through Christ Jesus, his beloved Son. Jesus purchased the human race, and by the will of God salvation is granted to those who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ; and believing means obeying also. Salvation is the gift of God through Jesus Christ our Lord, and certainly a gift is not forced upon those who are unwilling to accept that gift. In fact, a gift is impossible to be conferred upon anyone who refuses that which is offered as a gift. All the wicked do refuse and have refused and continue to refuse, and oppose God and his kingdom. “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Rom. 6:23) The foregoing text plainly states the divine rule. If further proof should be desired, note these words: “He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.”—John 3:36.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>41</sup> But do not those of the religious Roman Catholic Hierarchy claim to be servants of God and to name his name? They make such a claim with their lips, but their heart devotion is entirely against God and for the Devil. They are Jehovah’s enemies and the enemies of his government, and, as stated in the Scriptures, they take the name of God in vain. (Ps. 139:20) The Devil is the great liar and destroyer and deceiver, and those who serve the Devil are in the same class. (John 8:44) The religious, demoniacal totalitarian rulers serve the Devil and follow his course. The claim of the religionists of being servants of God, therefore, is entirely false. Those of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy say of themselves: “The gates of hell shall never prevail against us.” In this saying they entirely misapply the words of Christ Jesus, which he applied to the faithful members of his heavenly kingdom. (Matt. 16:18; Eph. 1:22,23; 2:18-22) The Roman Catholic Hierarchy says: ‘We have made a covenant with death and hell, and no evil shall come to us.’ Jehovah answers that boastful challenge with these words: “And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.”—Isa. 28: 15-18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>42</sup> True, there are many persons who are known as Catholics who are of good will toward God and who desire to serve God and who are held back from doing so by reason of the powerful influence exercised over them by the “Hierarchy of Authority”. It is the “Hierarchy of Authority” that leads in religion and politics, all of which oppose The Theocracy. All connive and conspire together to destroy the people and the nations that will not conform to totalitarian rule. All of them wickedly oppose and persecute the witnesses of Jehovah that proclaim The Theocracy. All such are therefore enemies of God and are wicked, and concerning them it is written: “The Lord preserveth all them that love him; but all the wicked will he destroy.”—Ps. 145: 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>43</sup> Fully corroborating the statement in that text are the words of the Lord Jesus, the great Judge, which he applies to the goats, which goats are made up of the religionists, the Hierarchy and politicians and cruel rulers aforementioned, and to which the Lord Jesus says: “Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.” (Matt. 25:41) The judgment of the Lord is final, and that judgment does not change. The final judgment of the Lord against the goats will be executed at Armageddon, “the battle of that great day of God Almighty,” and none of the wicked shall find any way of escape.—Jer. 25: 34, 35; 1 Thess. 5: 3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DEVIL’S OWN</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>41</sup> Religionist, political and commercial combine, composing the dictatorial rule, is the Devil's own product, organized and used to destroy the earth; and it is written that, at the time when Jehovah God by and through Christ Jesus gives salvation to those who love and serve him, he will destroy those who now attempt to destroy the earth. (Rev. 11:18) The Devil’s servants are workers of deceit. There is no organization ever in existence on earth that compares with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and particularly the Jesuits. That organization excels in deceitfulness. These are a part of the totalitarian rulers, and all of them use means to deceive the people. Concerning all such it is written in God’s judgment: “He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house; he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight. I will early destroy all the wicked of the land, that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the Lord.”—Ps. 101: 7, 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>45</sup> Vv ill any of the wicked be saved 1 “Salvation is tar from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes.” (Ps. 119:155) Further emphasizing the destiny of the wicked, mark these authoritative words from Jehovah God: “Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest; this shall be the portion of their cup.” (Ps. 11: 6) “Evil shall slay the wicked; and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.” (Ps. 34:21) “The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow. to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation. Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken. But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of lambs; they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away. For the Lord loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever; but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.”—Ps. 37:14,15, 20, 28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>46</sup> Many Scriptural texts leave no doubt as to the complete destruction of the wicked oppressors of The Theocracy : “For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it. But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.”—Prov. 2: 21, 22.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THOSE OF GOOD WILL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>41</sup> To be of good will, within the meaning of the Scriptures, is to have a sincere desire to know and to serve Jehovah and his King of The Theocracy. For this reason God sent Jesus into the earth, and at his coming the angel host announced: “Glory in the highest unto God! and on earth peace among men of goodwill.” (Luke 2: 14, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> One who is of good will begins to seek the Lord. That way is now open to all peoples, kindreds, and tongues of every nation who desire to serve the Most High. God is no respecter of persons. Those who conform to his rules receive his favor. God specifically warns all such of the approaching day of his wrath to be expressed in the battle of that great day of God Almighty and tells them what they must do.—Zeph. 2:1-3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>48</sup> The Scriptures abundantly show that only those who call upon the name of Jehovah and declare themselves for him and his Theocracy and its King can find salvation. It is in Jehovah's organization under Christ, the Head thereof, and who is the Minister of Jehovah and his Vindicator, that salvation can be found: “And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered; for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the Lord hath said, and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call.”—Joel 2: 32.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>48</sup> Those of good will who desire to find the way of escape from death and to find salvation to life now say, as it is written: “Truly my soul waiteth upon God; from him cometh my salvation. He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved. My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him. He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be moved. In God is my salvation, and my glory; the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God. Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him; God is a refuge for us. Selah.<sup>-</sup>’—Ps. 62:1, 2, 5-8.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>50</sup> Those of good will do not look to religion or politics to save them, but they say, as it is written: “He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto God the Lord belong the issues from death.” (Ps. 68: 20) “But I am poor and sorrowful; let thy salvation, 0 God, set me up on high.” (Ps. 69:29) This is a time of great distress upon the people of earth, and for those of good will it is written: “Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee; and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified. But I am poor and needy; make haste unto me, 0 God; thou art my help and my deliverer; 0 Lord, make no tarrying.” (Ps. 70:4,5) Everyone of good will desires to put himself under the protection of the Lord and to become one of God’s people, and all such are assured that if they seek after the Lord in his appointed way they shall find him and receive his favor. “For the Lord taketh pleasure in his people; he will beautify the meek with salvation.”—Ps. 149: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">REFUGE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>0 1</sup> The “other sheep” of the Lord are refugees cast out by those cruel rulers who now are overrunning the earth. They are not desired by the religious totalitarians. (Zeph. 2:1) They must flee somewhere in order to find refuge until the great devastating storm passes. To whom shall they flee? Jehovah God long ago made a prophetic picture of the place of refuge by setting up “cities of refuge” wherein refuge might be found and there protection be given. Those cities of refuge pictured God’s organization, of which Christ Jesus is the Head. (Num. 35:6-12) Jehovah God is over all, and he is the great refuge of those who are oppressed by the enemy and who are of good will toward Him, seeking to know and to serve the Lord; and all these blessings he administers through Christ Jesus: “The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms; and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy them.” (Deut. 33:27) Note these further precious words of promise to all of good will: “The Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.” (Ps. 9:9) “Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.” (Ps. 62: 8) “For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.&quot;—Isa. 25 • 4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">“ The religious, totalitarian combine now are actually destroying the nations of the earth. Not only that, but the religious, totalitarian-combine conspirators claim the full and exclusive right to rule the world, although Christ Jesu* is the world s rightful ruler, God’s anointed and enthroned King of the great Theocracy. To all persons of good will God gives this warning: “When ye, therefore, shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:) then let them which be in Judiva flee into the mountains.” (Matt. 24:15,16) &quot;But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains?’-Mark 13 :14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>53</sup> In these texts the word “Judaea” means and applies to those persons who are in the place or condition of giving honor and praise to Almighty God and to Christ his King. The “mountains” there represent The Theocratic Government of Jehovah God with Christ Jesus as King. Refugees seeking refuge and safety, therefore, must flee to The Theocracy, that is, to Jehovah God, the King of Eternity, and to Christ Jesus, the King of The Theocratic Government. All the evidence shows that the present is the time to flee. Therefore all persons who are of good will toward God and Christ must now for ever forsake and abandon religion or demonism and all religious organizations and flee to the organization of Jehovah God and there under Christ the King find refuge. Thus they show that they are for righteousness and desire to know what God’s will is concerning them. To such Jehovah says: “Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness; it may be ye shall be liid in the day of the Lord’s anger.” (Zeph. 2:3) This is not the theory or command of men, but the authoritative statement of Almighty God. Do you desire to be guided by the Most High? Then note this plain statement of his Word: “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.’-Prov. 3 :5,6.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT TO DO</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>54</sup> Christ Jesus is the purchaser of all men who desire to do the will of God. To all who believe on him, and who obey him, God ministers life by and through Christ Jesus, and this He does as a gracious gift. (Rom. 6:23) To all seekers of refuge and safety Jesus says: “I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father but by ine.” (John 14:6) The seeker for safety and life must therefore believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as his</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Redeemer or purchaser, not only of himself but of all those who are of good will toward God. The promise of God is salvation to such. (John 3:16) The seeker must then exercise faith in God and in Christ Jesus by fully agreeing to do the will of God concerning him. That is consecration. Then the seeker must carry out that agreement by studying to show himself approved unto God, and not unto men. (2 Tim. 2:15) That means to study God's Word and the helps that God has provided for understanding his Word. That is ‘seeking meekness’. He must devote himself to God and his kingdom and be diligent to learn what the Word of God discloses that all such persons must do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">IDENTIFICATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>83</sup> Those who form the “great multitude”, that is, the “other sheep” of the Lord, must identify themselves before other creation as having faith in and being on the side of the great Theocrat and his King, and this they must do before the battle of that great day of God Almighty begins. In the Scriptures the garment or mantle a man wears is a means of identification denoting where he stands, and whom he supports. Note what is written concerning the great multitude: “After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands.”—Rev. 7: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>36</sup> The white robe symbolically testifies that the person wearing the same is on the side of righteousness. The Theocracy is the side of righteousness. ‘Palm branches in the hand’ symbolically says: “We are supporters of the King of The Theocracy, Christ Jesus; therefore we are for God and for the Lamb, Christ Jesus.” All of these refuse to hail, honor, praise and worship men or things and thereby ascribe salvation to men or things or man-made organizations. All of those of the “great multitude” ascribe salvation to God and to his Lamb, Christ Jesus, the King. All of these make known that they are for The Theocracy. They are diligent to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">COMPANIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>57</sup> Those of the “great multitude”, called the “other sheep” of the Lord, become companions of the “remnant” of the capital organization of Jehovah and who are called “Jehovah’s witnesses”. Their protection and refuge is under the organization of the Lord, and there they dwell together in peace with all who are of that organization. This is the song all of that organization together sing: “For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee. Because of the house of the Lord our God I will seek thy good.”—Ps. 122: 8, 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>58</sup> Everyone of God’s organization must be busy, and not idle, slothful or indifferent. The Lord says to such (which command is set forth in his Word): “And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come: and whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.” (Rev. 22:17) Christ Jesus is that great Spirit, the King of The Theocracy. He is the “express image” of Jehovah God, his Father, and always does the will of his Father Jehovah. The faithful apostles and others who have followed their lead and devoted themselves entirely to Jehovah and Christ Jesus form the body of Christ, and collectively such are designated the “bride” of Christ, “the Lamb’s wife.” All these in harmony with the will of God make known to the people now that The Theocracy is the only hope of humankind, the only refuge and only place of safety, and therefore all such say to the people of good will: “Come.” This is exactly in harmony with the prophecy of God, which says: “Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money, and without price. Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfied) not? Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.”—Isa. 55:1,2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> No reason to pay money to men for alleged “purgatory” service. Such men are obtaining money under false pretenses and hence are robbing those from whom they take money. Those who receive the blessings of the Lord do so without money consideration. They “buy” with full devotion and service to the great Theocrat and his King. Therefore all persons of good will join in the service and say to others: &quot;Let him that heareth say, Come”; that is, all join in directing the people to the way of refuge and safety under God’s organization, and all together they say: “And let him that is athirst come: and whosoever will [who is of good will toward God], let him take the water of life [truth] freely.” Salvation is free to those who give their heart devotion to God and his King, Christ Jesus. Everyone who takes his stand on the side of The Theocracy and fully supports that government of righteousness under Christ, and who therefore serves God, in spirit and in truth, shall find salvation. Their devotion and service to the great Theocrat and his King brings to them marvelous blessings. “Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple; and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb, which is in the midst of the throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters; and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.” (Rev. 7:15-17) What Jesus said long ago is true now, to wit: “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy’ laden, and I will give you rest.” (Matt. 11: 28) Those who now seek rest, refuge and salvation will find their heart's desire only by and through Christ Jesus and by full devotion to Jehovah and his great Theocratic Government under Christ the King.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark9"></a>&quot;CHRISTENDOM’S” MALADY FATAL</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">W</span><span class="font3">HEN the time arrived to make for Himself a name in ancient Egypt, Jehovah God selected Moses to be his witness and clothed him with the means to bear such testimony. In order that Moses might be sure that Jehovah was with him and upholding him, God gave him three signs. In order that Moses’ people, the Israelites, might know Jehovah God and might know that the God of their fathers had appeared unto Moses and had sent him to the Israelites, these three signs Moses and his brother Aaron performed before the Israelites. The first sign was performed with Moses’ shepherd rod which being cast to the ground turned into a serpent. The second sign was concerning the hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“And the Lord said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom; and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.” (Ex. 4:6) Manifestly the hand in such an instance was used as a symbol to teach Moses and others of God’s chosen people, particularly Jehovah’s witnesses today. Two of the signs were performed by Moses before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. There seems to be no good reason why the sign of the leprous hand should be performed before Pharaoh, and there is no record that it was performed before him. This seems plainly to teach that the sign pertaining to the hand is one of the means employed by Jehovah to testify to his selected people, and to them alone, and is to inform them, that they may be equipped for his service. What is the symbolic meaning of the hand of Moses as here used in this prophetic picture?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It has been said that the hand is a symbol of divine power always, but the Scriptures do not at all times support that conclusion. When Jehovah puts his “hand” upon a creature, such, the Scriptures show, means that Jehovah has selected that creature and clothed him with authority to perform certain duties in the execution of God’s purpose. Jehovah has selected Christ Jesus as his special ‘elect servant’, whom he uses to execute his judgments, and therefore Christ Jesus is symbolically “the hand of Jehovah”. For example, at Deuteronomy 32:41, Jehovah says: “If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment, I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.” AU just powers reside in Jehovah; and the fact that he has committed to his beloved Son all power in heaven and in earth is further proof that Christ Jesus is the elect instrument of Jehovah to execute his purposes and hence is symbolically represented by Jehovah’s hand laid upon him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As further references to the “hand”, note: Ezekiel had a vision concerning which he said: “An hand was sent unto me, and, lo, a roll of a book was therein.” (Ezek. 2: 9,10) The roll or book is a symbol of a message or testimony of Jehovah, and its being in a hand symbolically says: ‘This testimony is provided by the power or spirit of Jehovah, and this is his means of making it known.’ When the time came for Ezekiel the priest to begin his service, he says, “the hand of the Lord was there upon him.” (Ezek. 1:3) “And the hand of the Lord was there upon me ; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.” (Ezek. 3:22) When the time came for Ezekiel to proclaim the prophecy concerning the royal house or temple, it is written, “the hand of the Lord was upon me.” (Ezek. 40:1) In these references “the hand of the Lord” clearly means that Jehovah has bestowed upon his creature divine favor and authority to represent him in bearing his testimony, and this he has done by and through Christ Jesus, who is his chief means of carrying out his purposes, or His “right hand”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When the hand of a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">creature</span><span class="font3"> is employed or used the symbol clearlj’ teaches a different thing. Let it be kept in mind that it was Moses’ hand that he put into his bosom and that there became leprous. For two reasons that hand could not represent divine power: (1) because it was the hand of a creature; and (2) because divine power cannot become leprous. Nor could the hand that became leprous represent anything in the heavenly or invisible part of Jehovah’s capital organization, because that part of his organization never becomes sinful or displeasing to Jehovah God. The conclusion must therefore be that the hand of Moses in this prophetic picture represents something pertaining to the followers of Christ Jesus while they are on earth and while in an imperfect condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For the above reasons the following definition is given of the symbolic meaning of the “hand”: The hand of a creature on the earth, which creature is in a covenant with Jehovah, symbolically represents the divinely provided ways and means or equipment of that creature to actively engage in the service of Jehovah. In support of this definition the following is submitted: Moses was being sent to Egypt, not to deliver his own message, but to deliver Jehovah’s testimony. Jehovah had provided the ways and means and had equipped Moses to do that service For Moses to become negligent or slothful in the performance of that service after having undertaken it would have been sin, and sin is symbolized by the malady of leprosy. Such negligence or indifference would be illustrated by putting the hand in his bosom, even as Moses did. “A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.” (Prov. 19:24; see also Prov. 2G : 15.) He who would thus do would become poor and an unfaithful servant. “He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand, but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.” (Prov. 10:4) These Scriptures definitely prove that the hand is a</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">symbol of activity and service and that when it becomes inactive disintegration always follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To Moses God gave this miracle or sign of the hand, and it was being performed chiefly for the benefit of God’s covenant people on earth at the end of Satan’s world, hence was meant to give them some special instruction. (Read Romans 15:4.) These covenant people, particularly “the remnant” of Jehovah’s witnesses, God has taken out for his name’s sake from among all nations of the earth, and has provided them with the ways and means and equipped them to bear his testimony to the world. (Acts 15:14) To be negligent or slothful in the performance of that service would be sinful. Jesus tells of the “wicked and slothful” servant class, at Matthew 25:26. Jehovah’s witnesses are admonished to be “not slothful in business [the King’s business'] ; [but] fen-ent in spirit; serving the Lord”. (Rom. 12:11) Hebrews 6:12 admonishes: “That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.” Proverbs 21:25: “The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour.” These scriptures show that unfaithfulness and inactivity on the part of the servant result in sin and death, whereas zeal and faithfulness in service bring the promised reward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Under Jehovah’s direction Moses was making a prophetic picture. The putting of Moses’ hand into his bosom symbolically teaches negligence or slothfulness in the use of the ways and means with which Jehovah provides and equips his servant class. As the Israelites were in a covenant with Jehovah God. even so that organization that is called “Christendom” or “organized Christianity” was. because of its claims, in an implied covenant to do the will of God by reason of having taken the name of Christ and assumed to teach God’s Word. Jehovah provided them with the ways and means for bearing testimony, or his message of his kingdom, to others. In this “Christendom” became negligent. slothful, sinful, and was led into death and shall early be destroyed at Armageddon. That organization put its hand in the bosom and became very slothful and hence sinful; and when the World War came on, it became even more sinful by completely repudiating the kingdom of God and adopting in its place and stead the Devil’s makeshift, which is the League of Nations and which has now given way to that beastly totalitarian monstrosity, “the abomination of desolation,” that now attempts to rule the world in conjunction with religion. (Matt. 24:14-16) Thus “Christendom” presumptuously assumed to set up a kingdom of its own contrary to God’s will and to perform a priestly service unwarranted, like unto that which was attempted by King Uzziah of Jerusalem, who was smitten with the incurable disease of leprosy, in the days of the prophet Isaiah. (See 2 Chronicles 26: 16-23.) Attention was called to the incurable condition of “Christendom”, in 1922, in a great world-proclamation by Jehovah’s witnesses, which corresponds with the pouring out of the first vial of God’s wrath upon “Christendom”. The symbolical description of this, at Revelation 16:2, reads: “And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth ; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image [the League].” “Organized Christianity” or “organized religion vv ill never be restored to the favor of Jehovah, because of the incurable disease resulting from unfaithfulness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The picture made long ago by Moses concerns, however, more particularly those of God’s covenant people who will ultimately prove their faithfulness as his witnesses That does not mean that a time would not come when they would be in an unclean condition. There did come a period of slothfulness in the Lord’s sen-ice on the part of those consecrated to the Lord and to which the Lord Jesus prophetically referred in his parable of the ten virgins that went out to meet the bridegroom when he said: “While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.” (Matt. 25: 5) During the World War of 1914-1918 and for some time thereafter the consecrated were fearful of the enemy, and there was very little testimony to God’s kingdom publicly delivered. That slothfulness and negligence or lack of vigorous activity in using divinely provided ways and means to serve Jehovah God brought the consecrated ones into a leprous or unclean condition. Concerning this Leviticus 13:44,45 reads: “A leprous man ... is unclean . . . And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was in the year 1922 that the Lord revealed to his covenant people their uncleanness resulting from inactivity in serving as his witnesses, this revealment taking place at the time that it was discerned that the Lord had come to his temple for judgment; which fact was announced at the international convention of Jehovah’s witnesses in 1922 A picture thereof was set forth long ago in the prophecy of Isaiah, wherein the prophet Isaiah represented God’s covenant people on earth today: “In the year that king Uzziah [who pictured ‘Christendom’] died [of leprosy, for attempting to perform priestly service in Jehovah’s temple unwarranted] I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet and with twain he did fly. And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory. And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke Then said I [representing Jehovah’s covenant people], Woe is me’ for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the King: the Lord of hosts.” (Isa. 6:1-5) That uncleanness clearly was due to lack of activity or to slothfulness in the use of the divinely provided ways and means (the “hand”) to deliver the testimony of Jehovah, and this is shown by the fact that the prophet was cleansed by fire being put upon his lips: “Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar; and he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo. this hath touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged. Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saving, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me. And he said, Go, and tell this people.”—Isa. 6: 6-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The hand of Moses in his bosom particularly represented the period of time from 1918 to 1919 inclusive, when there was little or nothing done in the way of giving the testimony of Jehovah by Jehovah’s covenant people on earth. God told Moses to take his hand out of his bosom, and when he took</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">it out then he discovered that it was as leprous as snow. Then God told him to again put his hand into his bosom: “And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again, and plucked it out of his bosom; and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.”—Ex. 4: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The command of Jehovah here given teaches that Jehovah would not completely cast away his people for their negligence, but that, when informed of their unclean condition, if they then manifested repentance and became zealous for the Lord he would again bring them into his favor. Note the record: “And he put his hand into his bosom again; and when he took it out of his bosom, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font3"> This latter action foreshadowed that, when in 1922 Jehovah’s covenant people discovered their uncleanness because of inactivity in God’s service, they immediately became active and the service work went forward from that time with energy and with a zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The conclusion as to fulfillment of the prophetic picture is further supported by the following: Jehovah has selected his people to bear testimony to his name, as a “people for his name”. (Acts 15:14) He has given them certain work to do, which is pictured by the “hand”, and to be pleasing to the Lord it must be done with energy; as it is written: “Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.” (Eccl. 9:10) This admonition was written for the benefit of the “remnant” of Jehovah’s witnesses as was every other admonition in the Scriptures written. (See Romans 15: 4.) Furthermore for their benefit it is written concerning the time following the second coming of Christ, and particularly after he comes to the temple for judgment: “In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem [Jehovah’s covenant people, including their earthly companions], Fear thou not; and to Zion [the anointed of God’s organization], Let not thine hands be slack. The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love; he will joy over thee with singing.” (Zeph. 3:16,17) God rejoices over his servants when they are zealous and faithful, and is pleased when they thus faithfully bear his testimony. Said Jesus: “Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.”—John 15: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The point of instruction, therefore, is that the remnant keep themselves clean by faithfulness and zeal in the performance of the terms of their covenant, which covenant requires them to bear Jehovah’s testimony as his witnesses. That means that they must be entirely devoted to Jehovah and his Theocratic Government under Christ in order to be clean; as it is written: “Be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord.” (Isa. 52:11) “Give diligence to make your calling and election sure.” (2 Pet. 1:10) And concerning the bride of Christ, “the Lamb’s wife,” it is written: “And it was given unto her that she should array herself in fine linen, bright and pure: for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.” (Rev. 19: 8, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font3"> Such “righteous acts” consist of full obedience to God in keeping his commandments and in giving the testimony of Jesus Christ committed to them. (See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font3"> Book Two, page 156.) The faithful remnant, without slacking of the hand, must continue to deliver the testimony of Jehovah until Satan’s organization is destroyed, as stated at Isaiah 6:11; and the “great multitude” of the Lord’s “other sheep” must be companions with the remnant in such witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No cure for the disease of leprosy has ever been found by man. The only cure is by the power of Jehovah, and he cures only those who obey him. “Christendom,” like King Uzziah, was willfully disobedient to Jehovah at the time the Lord came to the temple, and since, and will never be cured of the deadly malady symbolized by leprosy. The hand of Moses was healed only after full obedience to the commandment of Jehovah. The covenant people of Jehovah can be healed and kept clean only by the willing obedience and unselfish devotion to Jehovah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">“The witness calling at a house was accosted by the woman who came to the door with the expression: ‘You are the one that sold a book to my husband a little time ago. When he brought it in I went for him, for we could ill afford the shilling. I opened the book and saw it was against the Catholic church, so I made after you to tell you what I thought; but when I got to the door I met two men who were looking for lodgings, and by the time I had finished talking to them you were not to be seen. I then wrote you a hot letter, but it was never posted, and I intended, the first opportunity I had, whether in the public street or not, to give you a piece of my mind. Soon after this my two children were laid up with measles Slipping out one morning to get something from the shop, I met the priest and he wanted to know why I had not been to mass. I told him the children had the measles. That he said was no excuse. “But,” I said, “I cannot leave the children in the house by themselves.” “Nothing,” said the priest, “should prevent your attending mass; if you don’t come to mass you will roast in hell, and it will be for your own sin.” I was furious, and when I got home something made me go to that book my husband bought from you. What I read has made me determined never to go near a Catholic church again. I feel wild to think it should have held me in bondage so many years.’ This woman has promised to come to a study of the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font3"> that opened her eyes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">AT PIONEER HOME NO. 4, LONDON, ENGLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“A</span><span class="font3"> lady called at the home last Monday and stayed three hours hearing lectures and having questions answered. She had been looking for the International Bible Students Association and located us by the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font3"> sign in the window. The lady had lived in Canada for some veal's and remembered a visit from a publisher who had told her that the League of Nations would fail. Later she had purchased </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God,</span><span class="font3"> and just recently world events caused her to turn to the Bible for comfort. She found she was unable to understand the Bible and thought </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font3"> would help her. She could not find it, however, and hence tried to find the organization. She was on her way to the doctor’s when she called to see us, and said on leaving that she felt so much better that there was now no need to visit the doctor. She took </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font3"> with her and has been to two studies since. She told us her husband was amazed at the change in her and asks what had happened to cause it. We have now made an appointment to call on her husband with the recorded lectures. Today also a member of the home placed a half-year’s subscription for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch-totcer</span><span class="font3"> with a young gentleman from Edinburgh who had purchased a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> from a witness on the pavement in Edinburgh. There is so much joy in seeing the gathering of the great multitude that we can hardly contain it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ON MY LAST EVENLNG CALL, LONDON, ENGLAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“A girl, aged about 23, having read the testimony card, expressed desire to read the literature, but was afraid to do so, sinee the entire household, herself included, were Roman Catholics. As I continued my witness to her, a boy, much the same age as herself, came to the door to enquire what it was all about. After my explanation he exclaimed: ‘Why, out in Africa three months ago I encountered some of your people doing this same work. Judge Rutherford writes these books, doesn’t he?’ I replied, and he continued: ‘Yes, I read some of his books out in Africa, and I think they’re fine.’ He told me he himself was a Roman Catholic, but expressed fear of taking the literature because of opposition from the rest of the household. He and his sister looked once more through </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace,</span><span class="font3"> which I had handed to them. Glancing furtively over their shoulders to make sure their mother was not listening they said: ‘We’ll take them.’ Just as they were producing the money for the books, their mother, with beetling brows, appeared out of the back room to enquire my business. Quick as lightning the girl hid the literature under her overall, while her brother warded off the mother with evasive replies. When she was safely in the background, the boy and his sister brought me some additional money as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> contribution to the work. As he was pressing it into my hand the boy whispered: ‘To tell you the truth, my sister and I have for some time been coming to the conclusion that the Roman Catholic religion is all bosh. We will certainly read these books.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">POLICE STATION IN MAGAZINE ROUTE (MICHIGAN)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Saturday while engaged in street-corner magazine work I was approached by a police officer, who asked me if I had any free literature. Being careful to answer, because of previous arrests and trouble, I told him we gave free copies to those that have a sincere desire to know about this. However, I soon found that he had read a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Fifth Column </span><span class="font3">booklet, and he said it is the truth. He advised me to leave some free literature at the police station. Publisher: ‘Suppose they will not accept the literature—’ Officer: ‘Tell them that some of the police request that you leave it and they will call for it. The others leave their literature.’ Publisher: ‘You mean the Roman Catholie organization?’ Officer: ‘Yes, and they have a clique down there, and I don’t like to see it so one-sided.’ So I left ten </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Fifth Column </span><span class="font3">booklets and ten </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolations,</span><span class="font3"> and leave ten copies of each current issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ON AN AUGUST SUNDAY IN PHILADELPHIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The man was working in a vacant house. We played the record ‘Enemies’ for him. After playing we were showing him the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font3"> when another man came from behind the house, glanced at the title of the book, and said: ‘I know who our enemies are, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Right?’ We agreed. He then asked if he contributed a quarter would we play the record again. When the record was over he asked if any of his four neighbors had obtained the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font3"> We told him, ‘No,’ and he said, ‘They arc willingly ignorant, but they must know of the impending disaster, even if I have to pay for it myself.’ He took five books, five </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees,</span><span class="font3"> five magazines. As we were leaving he was going to each of his neighbors with the literature he had obtained from us. It was a thrilling experience to watch him witness to his neighbors who would not listen to us.”</span></p>

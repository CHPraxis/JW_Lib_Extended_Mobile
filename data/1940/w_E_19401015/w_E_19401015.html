<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death ; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are bom sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>EHUD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?&quot;—Luke 18:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH is certain to square all accounts. This he will do in his own due time and way. The use of his name by men to operate an organization that opposes The Theocratic Government and does violence to those who love God and advertise his government shall not go unnoticed by the Lord. It is the name of Jehovah, the Almighty God, that is involved. Those who do violence to God’s servants are fighting against God. For many centuries God’s name has been defamed by Satan and his many earthly agents, particularly the religious operators, and now the time has come when God for his own name’s sake will avenge his elect and vindicate his own great name. The prophetic drama in which Ehud performed the principal part is further evidence of God’s purpose to avenge his chosen people and to vindicate his name. It is for his own name’s sake that he takes account in behalf of those who love him. —Ps. 23:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, in their effort to hide their treacherous co-operation with the leaders of the corporate states, such as Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin, falsely charge Jehovah’s witnesses with being what is modernly called the “fifth column”. They falsely charge that the literature Jehovah’s witnesses place in the hands of the people is subversive. The Hierarchy well know that they are lying. There have been no witnesses or others on the earth that have said as much to expose Nazism and Fascism and Communism, and the Catholic Hierarchy, as Jehovah’s witnesses. Because the literature published shows that the Hierarchy is working directly with the enemies of democracies and against God, these truths published greatly anger the Hierarchy; and hence their wicked persecution of the servants of the Most High. Recently the Hierarchy and their deluded dupes, moved by the spirit of the adversary, have attempted to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses, but by the grace of the Lord his faithful servants have escaped. They are under his protection, and God will see to it that the enemy shall not prevail against them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ Ehud made good his escape: “When he was gone out, his [Eglon’s] servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.” (Judg. 3: 24) After Ehud escaped Eglon’s servants were near by, but the Lord held them back until Ehud had finished his work at that place. Eglon’s servants were anxious, of course, to obey his orders. Likewise with the Hierarchy in prosecuting their campaign called “Catholic Action”, the servants of the Hierarchy are always at hand, ready to do the bidding of the Hierarchy and to perform whatever acts may be required of them, whether lawful or unlawful. Eglon’s servants found the door locked. Likewise the Hierarchy and allies sometimes find that the law of the land has locked the door against them in carrying on their wrongful action to prevent the proclamation of the Theocratic message. Thus it appears that the fundamental laws of America were made by men who had the spirit of the Lord and who were guided by the Lord for the very purpose of protecting his servants in the present hour and until God’s “strange work” is completed in America. For this the servants of God are grateful to him, that he makes it possible for them to continue for a time in proclaiming the Theocratic message. It is entirely proper, and therefore must be according to the will of God, that his servants take advantage of the just and righteous laws of the land to prevent the shutting down of their work and service until God’s due time for it to end. Thus the servants of the religious element, engaged in persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses, are prevented from stopping God’s “strange work” until his due time. The work in Europe of proclaiming the Kingdom message seems to be done, and manifestly this is because God’s due time has come. It would then appear that the final witness would be given on the Western Hemisphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>1</sup> When Eglon’s servants found the door locked they said, according to the marginal reading of the text: “Surely he doeth his easement.” The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Douay</span><span class="font4"> or</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Catholic version renders this part of the text thus: “Perhaps he is easing nature.&quot; Today the servants of antitypical Eglon now occasionally find that the door is locked against them and their efforts to carry out the Hierarchy’s demand. The dirt or excrement now proceeding from the antitypical Eglon’s body turns the thoughts of the cruel servants of the Hierarchy to things of dirty or unclean methods of action ; therefore they resort to such things as mobs, burning of books and destroying property in the possession of Jehovah’s witnesses. This is particularly true along the borders of the United States inhabited by blinded religionists. In those places the proof is produced beyond any question of doubt that Catholic priests incite the ignorant and rabid members of their congregation to organize mobs and assault Jehovah’s witnesses, destroy their property, beat them and drive them out of the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’ Under the fundamental law of the land the people have a right to peaceably assemble and confer and speak together about God’s Word, even though that speech or message is offensive to religious racketeers. The Supreme Court of the United States has plainly so held. Here is another example, then, of the servants of the Hierarchy acting in an unclean way. At Madison Square Garden a public assembly of Christian people was had June 25,1939. The Hierarchy had done everything possible, according to law, to stop that meeting. Failing in that, they ordered unlawful or dirty methods to be performed. “Catholic Action’’ then stooped to violence. God’s people there figuratively locked the door against the unlawful deeds of the Hierarchy and their unclean methods, and “Catholic Action&quot; failed. This failure of the unclean or dirty methods of the Hierarchy caused one of their spokesmen to publicly give utterance to words in substance as follows: ‘When political governments fail to protect us [Catholic Action] we [the Hierarchy’s agents and servants] will resort to Franco's way in the use of bullets instead of ballots.” There is abundant evidence that Franco, Hitler and the Hierarchy work together to accomplish their selfish ends, that is to say, to destroy everything pertaining to The Theocracy, that they may rule the world by selfish men. Thus “the abomination of desolation” stands where it ought not to stand. (Matt. 24:15 ; Mark 13:14) This is a warning to people who love righteousness and hate iniquity to flee to The Theocratic Government under Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> The servants wish to carry out the commands of their chiefs; and so the servants hesitated to disturb the king, not knowing that he was dead: “And they tarried till they were ashamed; and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them; and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.”—Judg. 3: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">' Here this point of the drama shows the antitypical Eglon hiding their wickedness, even from their servants or allies. Eglon’s servants waited to the point of embarrassment. True to the picture, the facts at the present time show that officials, the allies of the Hierarchy, stand by and let the Hierarchy ease themselves in an unclean manner against the witnesses of Jehovah, hesitating to interfere with the Hierarchy and their unlawful and wicked action. To illustrate this, mayors of towns, police officers and other law-enforcement officers look the other way when the Hierarchy is engaged in some open demonstration of their dirty methods. As Eglon’s servants finally made an investigation by opening the door, even so now public officials, politicians and the strong-arm squad begin to look into the facts and they find that they have been deceived, that there was much more dirt there than they had anticipated. This they discovered when they ‘opened the door’. The Hierarchy never welcomes investigation, not even by their own servants and allies, because they know of their own uncleanness, and their efforts are always to keep their fraud and hypocrisy hidden from those who serve the Hierarchy’s organization. The Lord now begins to open the door and let the people in general view the wickedness and uncleanness of the hypocritical religious organization. The servants of Eglon used a key to open the door. The Bible truths furnish the key which now unlocks the doors and discloses the deeds of wickedness, and these are discerned by the people who have a desire to learn the truth. The Lord is now opening the door to all sincere persons that such may see the duplicity and wickedness of the religious systems. Other scriptures show that God will cause the servants and allies of the Hierarchy to see and to understand the hypocritical action of big religious systems, and that then action against that element of Satan’s organization will take place; as it is written : “And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast [which becomes anti-religious], these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.” (Rev. 17:16,17) Thus God permits their eyes to be opened to fulfill his purpose. Then the radical element takes action, as the Lord foretells. God makes them to understand what a wicked and hypocritical institution the great religious system is. And after their eyes are thus opened, what do they see! The words recorded in the prophetic drama are: “And, behold, their lord was fallen down dead.” They saw their lord and king exposed in his own dirt; thus indicating that men will see the hypocritical religious element exposed in their own dirty methods. A sorry mess! Religion has never been alive to Jehovah God. Therefore from Jehovah’s viewpoint religion has ever been a dead body. But the politicians and commercial men have been deceived and have not seen the facts, and their eyes are not opened until God’s “strange work” on earth is done. Then those political selfish allies and dupes see that religion is a fallen thing. They see that religion is hypocritical, claiming to serve God while acting at all times as servants of the Devil, having always an unclean record and entirely averse to being viewed in the light of God’s Word of truth. Now the political and commercial elements cry out, “We must have more religion”; because they have not yet seen and realized that religion is diametrically opposed to “Christianity”, hence opposed to everything that is right. When once these people see what a filthy, hypocritical, fraudulent and devilish thing religion is, they will take action against everything that appears to be religious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">' While Eglon’s servants waited Ehud was on his way, making good his escape: “And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.” (Judg. 3:26) Without doubt the servants of Eglon would have pursued Ehud had they been aware of the true situation. Ehud’s escape, then, pictures the members of Jehovah’s witnesses, the faithful servants of God, escaping from the vicious servants of the religionists, bent upon their destruction. Jehovah’s faithful witnesses have had a part in thrusting the “sword of the spirit”, the Word of God, into the belly of the religious systems. While doing so Jehovah’s witnesses have been severely reproached, ill-treated and put in very great danger; yet by the grace of God they have escaped through it all and will continue to escape until their work is finished, before Armageddon begins. In the meantime the allies of the big religious system are waiting and stupidly clamoring for more religion. Then the door opens and they see the real situation of the religious institution. They learn that Jehovah’s witnesses have been proclaiming the truth, to wit, that religion originated with the Devil, is a snare to all who want to serve God, and is employed as a racket by selfish men who hypocritically use religion against truth and righteousness. When these allies become aware of the facts, that religion is in fact fraudulent and wicked, then, the Scriptures show, they are enraged against everything that appears to be religious. Not having given their hearts to Jehovah, they are under the influence and power of the demons and really blind to God’s purpose. Such servants of the religious systems even doubt the existence of God, and, being influenced by the demons, they put forth their efforts to make an end of Jehovah’s witnesses. Disregarding their own human laws, they put forth their efforts to wipe out everyone who names the name of Jehovah God and his kingdom. This is shown by the fact that the servants of Eglon pursued after Ehud with the purpose of destroying him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">• The text shows that Ehud “passed beyond the quarries”. Those “quarries” near Gilgal were graven images, erected under demon influence to reproach the name of Jehovah. (See Judges 3:19, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">margin.) </span><span class="font4">Ehud passed beyond those images “and escaped unto Seirah” (A.R.U.); which name means “roughness”. The place was evidently a rough country, which was assigned to the tribe of Ephraim, and not far from Shiloh, where the tabernacle was erected. (Josh. 18:1) That territory bordered on the territory of the tribe of Benjamin, to which tribe Ehud belonged. At this point Ehud pictured Jehovah’s faithful servants now on earth; and the picture shows that such receive protection and find refuge in Jehovah’s organization, which organization is pictured by the nearness of the tabernacle. That rough or mountainous country furnished protection to Ehud. The Theocratic organization furnishes protection to the faithful servants of Jehovah who have fled to that organization. Have in mind that Ehud in the organization at times pictured Christ Jesus, at other times the “remnant” (Rom. 11:5; Rev. 12:17); while at other points in the drama he pictured or played the part pertaining to Christ Jesus alone; and fleeing near to the mountains would picture those who flee to God’s kingdom for protection now. The scene now changes to show another important thing: “And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.”—Judg. 3: 27.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>J 0</sup> At this point of the drama Ehud pictured or represented Christ Jesus alone. He blew the trumpet to assemble all of the Israelites, and thus pictured the Lord Jesus Christ in command of ‘the armies of heaven’, that hear his trumpet sound for war and follow him. (Rev. 19:14) Undoubtedly Ehud blew his war trumpet that same day of his escape, and the trumpet was to summons the men of war. Ehud must strike at the time, while the enemy was still demoralized. Thus at that point Ehud pictured Christ Jesus at the particular time when the “strange work” of Jehovah on earth is completed. It is the time anti-typically to begin the “strange act”, and Christ Jesus, the Greater Ehud, sounds the war trumpet, calling the angelic host of heaven to follow Him into the war for the execution of the enemy. This part of the picture exactly corresponds with the prophecy of Ezekiel wherein it is written that ‘six men with slaughter weapons’ went into action after the man with the writer’s inkhorn had placed the mark upon those who would be spared in the slaughter. (Ezek. 9:1-6) The “strange work” of Jehovah in which the remnant and their companions participate being completed, then the servants of the Most High are in great danger through the enemy. All the ruling factors of the earth become the open enemies of those who are on the side of the great Theocbat. Then Christ Jesus, the Greater Ehud, sounds his war trumpet and the heavenly host go into action and the battle of the great day of God Almighty begins and rages, resulting in the complete destruction of all of Jehovah's enemies, both visible and invisible to human eyes. This part of the prophetic drama, therefore, shows that God's “strange work” will be carried on in some part of the earth until the time for the beginning of his “strange act”, “the battle of that great day of God Almighty,” and then God will avenge his elect servants who are standing faithful and true, carrying out the terms of their covenant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> No doubt Ehud was carrying out a well-laid plan of action previously arranged; and therefore we must conclude that he had previously organized Israel and posted his key men at certain points, who were to go into action upon a given signal. This he would be doing without the knowledge of the Moabites. So likewise the Lord Jesus Christ, the Greater Ehud, the Executive Officer of Jehovah, is carrying out the purpose of Jehovah and has his host ready to act upon the giving of a command to advance. Ehud’s trumpet sounding from the high point in the mountains would be heard by his posted servants and immediately repeated by many other trumpets stationed throughout the land, and within a very short time the country would be aroused, ready to march, and the march would begin upon the enemy. It was the duty of the priests of Israel to participate in the trumpet sounding: “And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the Lord your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.” (Num. 10:9) It is therefore the duty of all of the anointed of the “royal priesthood” to participate in sounding the kingdom message.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> Hearing the trump call, “the children of Israel went down” from the mountain to follow Ehud their leader. Their going down well illustrates how the Lord Jesus leads his heavenly host, who go down from heaven to fight against Gog, who as Satan's chief officer attempts to destroy everything on earth, and particularly those faithful servants of the great Theocrat. This is particularly shown by the record, to wit: “And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations; and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.”—Rev. 19:14,15.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">” Referring now to the text at the beginning of this article: “Shall not God avenge his own elect?” In this hour of darkness on the earth, when the ruling factors are in the dark as to God’s purpose; in this time of gross darkness upon the people, when the wicked rulers ride in the saddle, and those who are on God’s side are being pursued and persecuted everywhere, the situation seems hopeless to all except those who have full faith and confidence in Jehovah God. Foreseeing this condition, the Lord Jesus propounded the question: “But when the Son of man comes will he find this belief on the [earth] ?” (Luke 18:8, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott)</span><span class="font4"> Clearly this shows that the number of persons who will have such faith, and who will hold steadfastly to that faith, will be small in number; therefore it is written: “According to your faith be it unto you.” (Matt 9:29) Again said Jesus: &quot;He that endureth to the end shall be saved.” (Matt. 10: 22; 24:13) In view of the physical facts that have been brought to pass and of the plain statements of the Word of God, is there now any reason for any of the servants of the great Theocrat to doubt what will be the result? Shall any such quail before their enemies? Those who are strong in faith will be blind to everything except Jehovah’s Word and will permit nothing to turn them away from the great Theocracy. Their determination is and will be: Come what may, we will serve Jehovah God and his King.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> There cannot be the slightest doubt about the result of “the battle of that great day of God Almighty” Christ Jesus, the Field Marshal of Jehovah, is certain to gain the victory. Regardless of how terrible conditions in the earth may become, know this: that victory is with the great Theocrat and his King. The faithful shall share in that victory who fully trust in God and in Christ, and henceforth they will continue to say, as it is written: “But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.” (1 Cor. 15: 57) Also they v.ill continue to sing in their hearts: “My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.”—Ps. 13: 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> Those on the earth now and who are fully and wholly devoted to Jehovah God well know that all of these prophetic pictures or dramas and all prophecy are set down in the Scriptures recorded long ago for the very purpose of giving aid, comfort and hope to those who now sincerely serve God and his kingdom. As the Israelites followed Ehud, so now every one of those who are of the remnant and all those who have taken their stand on the side of The Theocracy, and who continue faithful, will follow Christ Jesus in full confidence. If in doing so some are put to death they have the assurance that their full faith and devotion will be rewarded by a resurrection to life forevermore. The faithful cannot and will not fear and will not for one moment compromise with the enemy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">They have made the great Jehovah God their fear, and by his grace they will now prove their full faith and devotion to Jehovah and to his King, and will thus maintain their integrity to the end. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> sets forth the facts and the Scriptures showing that Armageddon is very near. The darkest hour of all time will soon give way to the most brilliant light that has ever come to humankind. This will be the reward of those who fully trust Jehovah and his King and who remain true and steadfast to the end. God has provided salvation for those who love and serve him, and all the faithful are now and henceforth fully trusting God and rejoicing in their hearts, looking to that hour of salvation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>16</sup> Returning now to the prophetic drama: &quot;We see that the Moabites occupied the territory on the opposite side of the Jordan and that territory God would not permit the Israelites to invade. (Deut. 2:8,9) At the time of this drama the Moabites under Eglon the king had moved from the Jordan to the west side and taken possession of the land which God had previously assigned to the tribe of Benjamin. Eglon had no vested right there. The time had come for the Moabites to get out. Just so now, the time has come when the commercial religionists and allies must vacate. The time had come for the Israelites to make war upon the Moabites and to drive them out of the land which God had given to his people. Ehud there took the lead and the faithful Israelites followed him in the war. “And he said unto them, Follow after me; for the Lord hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over?' (Judg. 3: 28) So now the Greater Ehud, Christ Jesus, summons his faithful followers. Christ Jesus takes the lead, and he says to those who have covenanted to do the will of God: “Follow me.” The faithful on earth obey his command. The host of heaven hear the command of the great Executioner, and to them he says: “Follow after me.” The hour has arrived for the vindication of Jehovah’s name and Christ Jesus leads on to battle. Those who are with Christ Jesus and who remain faithful and true will now falter not; and concerning them it is written: “These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.”— Rev. 14:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>17</sup> Ehud foresaw that the Moabites, when the battle would begin, would attempt to seek safety and therefore to escape across to the east side of the Jordan, and so he arranged to prevent that very thing. “And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab.” Thus the army of the Lord, under the leadership of Ehud, cut off the way of escape for the Moabites. Another division of his army made a frontal attack on the Moabites and started them on the run toward the Jordan fords. Hemmed in on both sides, the Moabites were cut to pieces. This is another prophetic account, drama or picture of the complete destruction of Satan’s forces that will take place at the battle of Armageddon, and which is fully corroborated by the following prophecy: “And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape. A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard; for the Lord hath spoiled their pasture.”—Jer. 25: 35, 36.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> “And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.” (Judg. 3:29) This description here given of the fighting men of Moab, with whom were “all lusty, and all men of valour”, appears to mean that Satan’s visible organization, which engage in the battle, will be in fighting trim and fully equipped when Armageddon begins, but their strength will quickly disappear. They will go down to destruction at the very time when they appear to be at their greatest strength. This is indicated by the number ‘ten thousand that were slain’. Ten thousand is the fourth power of ten (10X10X10X10), meaning all the enemy. Ehud could not have accomplished that great slaughter in his own strength. He had the help of Almighty God. Full and complete power was with him. Even so at the battle of Armageddon, the Greater Ehud will have the full support of Jehovah, the Almighty power. (Ps. 110: 5) That will result in the complete annihilation of God’s enemies. Other scriptures fully support this conclusion, to wit: “And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath magnified himself against the Lord. Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.” (Jer. 48:42,46) “And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army. And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth; and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.” (Rev. 19:19, 21) “Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies; thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee. Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger; the Lord shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them. Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men. For they intended evil against thee; they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.”—Ps. 21: 8-11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>19</sup> The battle, led by Ehud, was decisive. “So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.” (Judg. 3: 30) So likewise the battle of Armageddon, led by Christ Jesus, will be decisive. Ehud made a quick work of it. The Greater Ehud will make a quick work of God’s enemies: “For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness; because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.”—Rom. 9: 28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>20</sup> The Israelites were God’s covenant people, and therefore that nation was a typical Theocracy. The great Theocrat had placed his people in that land and assigned a particular portion of it here under consideration to the tribe of Benjamin, whose name means “son of the right hand; fortunate”. Christ Jesus is the beloved Son and “the right hand” of Jehovah God’s favor. To Christ Jesus Jehovah has given all the earth for his possession. (Ps. 2:8) Eglon held possession of that land assigned to Benjamin, and was where he had no right to be. The selfish and devilish combine of religion, commerce and politics now hold possession of the earth, claiming the right to rule it, and hence stand where they have no right to stand. That is “the abomination that maketh desolate”. (Dan. 11:31; 12:11) It is now desolating the earth. God has made known to those who seek an understanding of the truth that “the abomination of desolation” is today boastfully manifesting itself. Satan’s abominable organization has reached the peak of wickedness. The time for Jehovah’s “strange act” is about due. In the typical fight the Moabites’ god Chemosh failed to withstand the assault of Jehovah’s executioner, Ehud. In the battle of Armageddon the demons now controlling the world will completely fail to withstand the onslaught of the Greater Ehud, Christ Jesus the King.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> In times past there have been many battles fought. The World War from 1914 to 1918 was terrible beyond description of human words, and in that war millions died. The war now being prosecuted by wicked dictators from 1939 and into the year 1940 is without doubt the most destructive that has ever been known to this time. The demons control the invaders or dictators. Millions have fallen into the trap of Satan because they have embraced religion and ignored Jehovah God. It is difficult for the human mind to imagine a more destructive war than that which is now in progress in this year 1940. The whole world is astonished, in perplexity and in great distress.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> The wars that are now in progress, however, are not the battle of Armageddon. The battle of Armageddon, which is “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”, is yet future, and for destructive results nothing that has ever come to pass can or will equal the battle of Armageddon. That will be a time of trouble such as the world has never known, and there shall never be another. This is proved by the words of Jesus recorded at Matthew 24: 21. All the power and all the equipment that the Devil and his agents visible and invisible can bring into action will perish before the onward and irresistible assault of Christ Jesus and his heavenly host. When the battle of Armageddon is done there will be so many dead that the survivors will not be able to bury them. The whole earth will be a place of shambles. —Jer. 25: 33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> Repeatedly God has given warning of that approaching battle. He caused many prophetic pictures to be made in times of old foretelling that great and terrible conflict. Amongst those prophetic pictures is the one here recorded, in which Eglon and Ehud performed important parts. In these latter days God is now revealing to those who seek to know the meaning of such prophetic dramas. Why? In order that those who love God and his kingdom may have hope and be strengthened and may maintain their integrity. (Rom. 15:4; 1 Cor. 10:11) God has permitted his remnant and their companions to be on the earth and have a part in his “strange work” amidst many trying conditions, and now those who love him see that these trying experiences are for their good.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> If God had caused only one prophetic drama to be made and recorded it would now be harder to have and to manifest strong faith. In his loving-kindness God has made many prophetic pictures, and in these present days has permitted to come to pass trying and terrible experiences which try the patience and faith of his people. Those who love Jehovah and his government will by reason of these prophetic dramas and God’s precious promises be strong in faith, “strong in the Lord and in the power of his might,” and will stand firm, trusting fully in the Lord to the end, having in mind at all times that “he that en-dureth to the end shall be saved”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">REST</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> The nations of the earth are torn with strife and war. The masses of the people hate war and long for peace and rest. They do not find rest and peace; and why? Because they have fallen victims to religion and have been ensnared by the demons, of which Satan is the chief. With one hand Satan, by the use of religion, lures the credulous people into his snare, and with the other hand he slays them. His purpose is to carry out his original threat to turn all men against God and destroy them. The religious institutions, and particularly that institution manipulated by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, induce the people to believe that religion furnishes to them protection. Other religious organizations join with the Hierarchy in blindly leading the masses of the people into the snare of Satan and into the ditch of destruction. The peoples of earth who are thus ensnared are well pictured by those who hold on to the leaders of Moab. None of them found any rest or escape. Those who in this day of distress hold on to religion and religious leaders will find no escape and no rest.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> Ehud pictured Christ Jesus, “the Prince of Peace.” Those who went down with him to battle and who remained with him saw the result of that battle and afterwards enjoyed rest. “And the land had rest fourscore years.” That was eighty years of peace and rest, which were enjoyed by the Israelites because that typical nation served God. A “score” is a double ten, and four times ten a symbol of perfection or that which is evenly balanced. The “fourscore years of rest” which followed Ehud's victory is symbolical of the rule or government that is first righteous and wholly devoted to the Almighty God. Therefore it pictured the everlasting government of the great Theocrat ruled over by “the Prince of Peace”, Christ Jesus, the Greater Ehud. That government of the great Theocracy is “the holy city” representing the organization of the Most High, over which Jehovah has placed Christ Jesus, and concerning which it is written: “And the city lieth foursquare.”—Rev. 21:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>27</sup> That Theocratic Government is the only place where men will ever find rest. The faithful remnant will be blessed by having a part in that glorious organization under Christ their Head. The “other sheep” of the Lord will form the “great multitude” (Rev. 7:9-17), and these now must hasten to that city of refuge, and must do so before Armageddon, if they would find protection and rest. The remnant by faith have entered into rest. (Heb. 4:1-3) They are in Christ Jesus, fully united to him, and hence a part of the antitypical Ehud. They know what is certain to come to pass, because they have learned it from God’s Word. They stand firm and immovable in Christ Jesus. They trust wholly and completely in Jehovah and continue to say: “My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.” All of such now must be fully and completely united, standing foursquare, shoulder to shoulder, fighting for the good news of The Theocratic Government.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> All persons of good will toward God, who have abandoned religion and fled to the antitypical city of refuge, the Theocratic organization under Christ, and who there remain in faithful obedience unto the Lord, now by faith have rest, and they confidently trust in the Lord for full deliverance at Armageddon, and look forward to deliverance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> The present duty of the remnant and their companions is to be now fully and completely at unity in heart devotion to God and in his service. They must be active and diligent in informing others of the only place of safety and rest. Only those who have a desire for righteousness will hear the message delivered by the faithful servants of God. It is the duty and privilege of all who have been blessed by a knowledge of The Theocratic Government to inform others who will hear. Waste no time now in brooding over present wicked conditions existing in the earth. With faith and joy lift high the banner of The Theocracy that those who desire to learn may find the way to salvation and rest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>80</sup> During the remaining days of Ehud there was rest in Israel. The Greater Ehud’s day will be endless. Of his government and peace there shall be no end. (Isa. 9: 6, 7) That means that never again shall the wicked be permitted to rise up and oppress the people and take away their ease and comfort. “Affliction shall not rise up the second time.” (Nah. 1: 9) Under The Theocratic Government there shall be peace and rest and joy forever. All persons that find life must come under and be fully and joyfully obedient to The Theocratic Government. Every creature that lives shall delight to serve The Theocracy. The name of Jehovah will then be upon every tongue. Then shall “everything that hath breath praise Jehovah”.—Psalm 150: 6, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Arn. Rev. Ver.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark7"></a>THE ROD UPON THE NATIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font2">EHOVAH employs signs or miracles to bear testimony. Hence it is written that ‘the sign has a voice’. The term “voice”, as used in the Word of God, means a proclamation or address. It is a message bearing testimony of and concerning Jehovah’s purpose. At times Jehovah has given his creatures the power to perform miracles or signs, which signs bear testimony of Jehovah’s purpose and from which testimony the wise derive profit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the burning bush at the base of Mount Horeb Jehovah ordered the refugee Moses to return to Egypt, there to serve notice on the king Pharaoh and then to lead the enslaved Israelites out of Egypt and bring them to Mount Horeb to worship Jehovah. Moses feared that they would not believe he was sent by Jehovah God. “And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice; for they will say, The Lord hath not appeared unto thee.” Thereupon Jehovah gave Moses the power to perform signs or miracles. The three signs Moses performed before the Israelites, and in this Moses’ brother Aaron was associated with him. Two of those signs were performed before Pharaoh. First Jehovah would supply the evidence and convince the Israelites that He had sent Moses to them, and then He would also give proof to Pharaoh as a warning to him and his organization. Both the Israelites and Pharaoh must know that Jehovah is the Almighty God. Now, in our day, both the people of Jehovah and those of the organization of the greater Pharaoh, Satan, must be informed that Jehovah is God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The first sign was with the rod of Moses which was thrown to the ground and which became a serpent. As a herder of sheep Moses carried a shepherd’s rod. This was used in connection with the first sign. “And the Lord said unto him, What is that in thine hand! And he said, A rod. And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. And the Lord said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand: that they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.”—Ex. 4:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The time had then come for Jehovah to send his deliverer to Egypt to make for Himself a name; concerning which it is written: “And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt!” (1 Chron. 17:21) Jehovah had selected Moses for this purpose to deliver his testimony to the Israelites, and Moses had raised the question as to whether the Israelites would hear him and believe that the Lord had appeared unto him or not. The modernday fulfillment of this prophetic picture began in A.D. 1914, the year the first World War broke out, and when the “times of the Gentiles”, the “seven times”, expired.—Luke 21:24; Dan. 4:16,23,25,32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The time had then come for Jehovah to send forth his beloved Son, Christ Jesus, whom the prophet Moses foreshadowed, to make for himself (Jehovah) a name. It was then that Jehovah placed Christ Jesus his King upon his “holy hill of Zion”, which is Jehovah’s capital organization ; wherefore He says to the opposing nations of earth: ‘Wet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.” (Ps. 2: 6) It was then that He sent him forth to rule amongst the enemy, as foretold at Psalm 110: 2 : “Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion: Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” (Am. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font2"> That was the appropriate time for Jehovah to propound the question to the Greater than Moses, Christ Jesus: “What is that in thine hand!” Moses of old held a shepherd’s rod in his hand. The shepherd’s rod of Moses could be used as a weapon against beastly and human enemies. It was a rod that could be used as a scepter.—See Ezekiel 19:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Concerning his second coming as Judge and King, Christ Jesus said: ‘When the Lord shall come in his glory, and all his holy angels with him, then will he sit upon his throne of glory.’ He said that then would be the time that he would as a shepherd divide the sheep from the goats. (Matt. 24: 31-46) The proof, from modern physical facts and inspired prophecy, has been set forth elsewhere that Christ Jesus began his reign from heaven in A.D. 1914, but it was in 1918 that he came to Jehovah’s spiritual temple for judgment of Christians and for the separation of the sheep and the goats. He was sent to shepherd the nations, and his rod appears then to be “a rod of iron” toward the wicked. To him Jehovah says: “Ask of me, and let me give nations as thine inheritance, and as thy possession the ends of the earth: thou shalt shepherd them with a sceptre of iron, as a potter’s vessel shalt thou dash them in pieces ” (Ps 2 • 8, 9, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham)</span><span class="font2"> Concerning the birth of The Nation, or the beginning of the kingdom of which Christ Jesus is King and which is symbolized as the “man child”, it is written: “And she brought forth a son, a manchild, who was about to shepherd all the nations with a sceptre of iron.” (Rev. 12: 5, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font2"> These scriptures prove that the rod or scepter is a symbol of authority and power which Jehovah has delegated to Christ Jesus and to be used to carry out Jehovah’s purpose by his Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Referring back to the prophetic picture: At the command of Jehovah Moses cast his rod on the ground. This could not mean the casting away or letting go of all power and authority by Jehovah or by Christ Jesus that wickedness might run riot in heaven and earth. Long before Moses performed the sign with the rod Satan, who possessed the power to rule, had rebelled against Jehovah and had challenged Jehovah to put on earth men who would maintain their integrity toward God. The wicked one thereafter continued to operate in heaven as well as on earth. (See Genesis 3 :1-15; Job 1: 6-12; 2 : 1-5.) Later in the prophetic picture made at Egypt Satan is represented by his servant Pharaoh who was then opposing God’s power as expressed through his prophet Moses. Moses represented Christ Jesus, concerning whom Moses said: “The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me, unto him ye shall hearken.” (Deut 18:15) At the end of the “times of the Gentiles”, in A.D. 1914, that is, at the end of the time of Satan’s rule without interference from Jehovah, Christ Jesus is sent forth to begin his reign. It would be inconsistent for Christ Jesus then to let go his power and authority to rule and at the same time fulfill Jehovah’s commandment, to wit, “Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” On the contrary, the casting of the rod to the ground or earth by Moses pictured the projecting or extending of the active power of Christ Jesus to things pertaining to the earth. Thus he did when the kingdom was born in heaven and the war in heaven thereafter took place and Satan and his angels were cast down to the earth. (Rev 12-1-10) Thereby Christ Jesus made all his enemies his footstool, that is to say, he confined them to the earth and its vicinity. No longer are there any enemies in heaven; and now there is but one center of disturbance, to wit, the earth, where Christ Jesus keeps a watchful eye upon the enemy and by his power holds the enemy in restraint until God’s due time for the enemy and his organization to be destroyed. Casting the rod to the earth or ground had nothing to do with the permission of evil or wickedness which began long before Moses was used to make the prophetic picture in Egypt. The “voice of the first sign” (Ex. 4: 8) speaks a message relating to the coming of the Greater Moses to deliver God’s creatures; and this deliverance is done centuries after wickedness has been in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Immediately after Moses cast his rod to the ground “it became a serpent”. It was the rod that became the serpent when it reached the ground or earth. The serpent is a symbol of evil, but not always a symbol of wickedness. The power and authority which Jehovah has delegated to his beloved Son, Christ Jesus, the Greater Moses, now takes on the form of evil to the things pertaining to the symbolic “earth”, that is to say, to Satan’s organization, which is now confined to the earth. Evil is that which is hurtful and brings distress, adversity, affliction and sorrow upon the one against whom it is used. Jehovah God exercises his power to inflict punishment or to enforce his judgment, and such exercise of power results in evil or that which hurts the wrongdoer; but that evil is righteously used. Jehovah says: “I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil; I am Jehovah, that doeth all these things.” (Isa. 45:7, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font2"> That is, Jehovah forms the light for the righteous, and creates darkness for the wicked, his enemies; he makes peace or “prosperity” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{Roth.)</span><span class="font2"> for his faithful remnant of witnesses and their earthly companions, and creates evil for Satan and his organization. (See also Psalms 97-11; 82:5-7; 107:10; Jude 13; also </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> 1930, pages 131-147.) All wrongdoing or wickedness results in evil to someone, but not all evil is wrong. When Jesus punishes his enemies, that is evil administered in righteousness. Therefore the Scriptures support the conclusion that the casting of the rod to the ground and its becoming a serpent foreshadowed the extension of Jesus’ power and authority and activities to the earth, which action becomes serpent-like or hurtful to Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This conclusion as to evil as used by Christ Jesus against his enemies is fully supported by other Scriptures. At Revelation 9:11 Jehovah’s anointed witnesses are likened to locusts, concerning whom this verse says: “And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon [that is, Destruction], but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon [that is, Destroyer].” Christ Jesus is that king, and as such he commands his organization and he inflicts punishments, which is evil, upon Satan’s organization. (See </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font2"> Book One, page 145.) According to Revelation 9: 19, even the “horses” in the army of the Lord inflict evil like serpents; as it is written: “For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails; for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt.” To those who become the enemies of Jehovah he says: “For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the Lord.” (Jer. 8:17) Also Amos 9:3- “And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them.” The Scriptural evidence is therefore conclusive that Moses’ rod cast to the ground and which became a serpent pictures power and authority from Jehovah which he had delegated to Christ Jesus and which is being used against the enemies of Jehovah who are now confined to the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Christ Jesus is “the head over all things to the church, which is his body”. “And he is the head of the body, the church.” (Eph. 1:22,23; Col. 1:18) He does not flee. When the rod of Moses was suddenly turned into a serpent, “Moses fled from before it.” It is certain that Moses did not here represent Christ Jesus himself. In this part of the picture Moses represented the footstep followers of Christ Jesus on the earth at the time when Christ cast the enemy out of heaven by the exercise of power and authority conferred upon him by Jehovah. Christ Jesus, clothed with all power in heaven and in earth, did not flee. Those in Christ and on earth and who are, because of their devotion to God, counted as members of the body of Christ, did flee, as foretold at Revelation 12:6,14: “And the woman [symbolic of God’s organization] fled into the wilderness where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days. And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.” (See </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font2"> Book One, pages 246, 247.) The rod of Moses did not at any time picture Satan the Dragon. The rod pictured the power of Jesus Christ exercised against Satan and his angels, and it was that power that cast him out of heaven and thus stirred up the hatred of Satan against the members of Jehovah’s organization then on earth, and these fled to the wilderness where Jehovah had provided shelter and protection for them after tiie strife of the World War. The fleeing of Moses before the serpent corresponds to this; and the one fact corroborates the other and thus shows the fulfillment of the prophecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">About A.D. 1918 fear laid hold upon Jehovah’s people on the earth. The faithful must overcome fear in every way as it relates to Jehovah’s use of power to bring about evil or punishment upon the enemy. Jehovah then sent forth his witnesses, the approved and anointed remnant, to declare his message of evil or his vengeance against the enemy ; and now his witnesses, the remnant, must take in their hand the prophetic message of God’s vengeance and use it against the enemy as an evil thing, as a serpent, serving notice upon the enemy organization and sounding the warning to all. In making the picture, therefore, Jehovah said to Moses, who here represents the faithful remnant: “Put forth thine hand, and take it [the serpent] by the tail.” In fulfillment, the world-wide distribution of the message of truth which declares God’s purpose by his Theocratic Government to vindicate his name and to destroy Satan and his organization is the exercise of evil against the enemy. This message has been and is being distributed by the remnant throughout the earth, and symbolically that work represents the taking of the serpent by the tail.—See </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font2"> Book One, page 167.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Moses put forth his hand “and caught [the serpent], and it became a rod in his hand”. In this he pictured Christ Jesus. This part here pictured shows that Jehovah determines the time when the final battle of the day of God Almighty, the battle of Armageddon, is to be fought against Satan and his organization and when it shall end. Christ Jesus uses the rod of power and authority as a serpent of evil against the enemy organization and fully and completely metes out judgment against Jehovah’s enemies. This being accomplished, there is no further need for the rod to be used as a serpent, but thereafter it is used as a means of shepherding and healing; as it is written: “I will also smite mine hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the Lord have said it.&quot; (Ezek. 21:17) Jehovah’s power and authority delegated to and used by Christ Jesus, the Greater Moses, ceases to operate as a serpent at the conclusion of the battle of the great day of God Almighty. Christ Jesus then reports to Jehovah with his rod or power, and thereafter the rod is used, not to smite, but to heal; as prophetically foretold: “And the Lord shall smite Egypt; he shall smite and heal it: and they shall return even to the Lord, and he shall be entreated of them, and shall heal them.” (Isa. 19:22) This Jehovah does in vindication of his holy name, that all may know that he is God and has sent Christ Jesus as the Deliverer; as stated: “That they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee [the Greater Moses].”—Ex. 4:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1914 Christ Jesus began to exercise his power to cast the enemy to the earth. From and after 1918 he executes judgment, which will terminate in the great battle of God Almighty. Since the beginning of his exercise of judgment the faithful remnant have learned that Christ Jesus is at the temple and that the name of the Almighty God is Jehovah, and have been advised as to the meaning of that name It is since 1918 that the remnant have learned the meaning of “evil” and why Jehovah does “create evil” like a serpent. For the first time, in May, 1930, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> published the Scriptural proof of this, under the title “Peace and Evil”, and this is a confirmation to the remnant that Jehovah has sent his Vindicator, his Great Prophet Christ Jesus, who was foreshadowed by Moses. The remnant therefore see why these things “written aforetime” are for their comfort, and now also their earthly companions, the “great multitude” of the Lord’s “other sheep”, draw comfort and strength therefrom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark9"></a>END OF WAR IN HEAVEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">{ { A ND there was war in heaven: Michael and his X-X angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">** fought and his angels, and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.” These are the words of an eyewitness, who foresaw the events of our modern years in prophetic vision and symbolisms, and recorded them at The Revelation chapter 12 verses 7-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He that began the war against Satan is identified by the name “Michael”, which means “Who is like God?” and which name designates the great Godlike Prince, Christ Jesus, who is “the brightness of [God’s] glory, and the express image of his person”. (Heb. 1:3) The manifest purpose of the use of this name is to call attention to the corroborative prophecy of Daniel, thus furnishing two witnesses to this important fact. The only place in the ancient Hebrew Scriptures where the title Michael is applied to God’s great Prince, Christ Jesus, is in Daniel’s prophecy, chapter 12, verse 1, where it is written: “And at that time [at the birth of the man child or kingdom of God described in Revelation 12:1-5] shall Michael stand up, the great [heavenly] prince which standeth for [is ruler of] the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble [in heaven and also on earth], such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time [A.D. 1914, when the World War on earth began].” In heaven the trouble ended with the casting out of Satan and his demons; and the time of trouble on earth was halted in 1918 for an interval in which the witness work by Jehovah’s witnesses must be done, and then shall come the final end of Satan’s world organization.— See Matthew 24:14, 21, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This and other scriptures prove that Satan had a plaee where he was permitted to be in heaven. Probably God confined him to a certain zone, but that he was permitted to appear in the presence of God is made certain by other scriptures, such as Job 1: 6; 2:1-5; Zechariah 3:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Four names, to wit, Dragon, Serpent, Satan and Devil, God gave to the great adversary as a means of identification, and those names symbolize the wicked work in which he engages. It is stated that he “deceiveth the whole world”, but evidently what is meant is ‘the whole inhabited earth’; and this meaning is in harmony with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">American Revised Version</span><span class="font2"> and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Emphatic Diaglott</span><span class="font2"> translation rendering of the text. It would not apply to God’s anointed witnesses and their “great multitude” of companions, who arc not a part of the “earth” under Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When Christ, the great Prince, was placed upon his throne as the world’s Rightful Ruler, in A.D. 1914, the first work was to oust Satan from heaven. Satan assembled all his host of powers and principalities and angels, symbolized under the figure of the “seven heads” of the dragon, as described at Revelation 12: 3. Then Satan and all his associate demons resisted the new king, and war followed It was a war between Satan’s heavens and the “new heavens” under Christ the Messiah. The “kings of the earth” were not in that fight, because they could do nothing in a heavenly battle to assist their father Satan. But every head or prince in Satan’s invisible organization would be involved. These would induce the visible organization of Satan on earth to war against the members of God’s organization on earth, which did take place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the side of Christ in this fight were his myriads of holy angels, but none of the Christians who make up the anointed “body of Christ” were involved. Christ Jesus had not yet come to God’s temple for judgment of Christians, and hence those Christians who had died faithful had not even been resurrected, and none of the members of the anointed servant class on earth could render any aid in that warfare in the invisible heavens. The strength of the enemy was no match for Christ, who has all power in heaven and earth This is proof that the former interpretation by men of Matthew 12: 29 is wrong and that Jesus does not have to first bind Satan before his demons can be cast out of those demon-possessed or before Satan’s earthly organization can be destroyed. We may expect the Lord to give Satan full opportunity to fight all he can and then bind him when he is thoroughly whipped. Satan and his forces in that fight were completely defeated and cast out of heaven, and this is proof that in God’s due time Christ will completely destroy Satan’s organization and then put Satan into the pit. —Rev. 20:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It was not Jehovah’s due time to kill Satan; therefore he had Satan and his angels literally thrown out of heaven. Speaking of things certain to be as though they had already occurred, Jesus had prophesied: “I beheld Satan as lightning [that is to say, with lightning speed] fall from heaven.” (Luke 10:18) The time arrived for Jesus to do that very work, and it must have afforded him great joy to thus vindicate his Father’s name before the hosts of heaven. That work, however, could not serve to vindicate the name of Jehovah before earthly creatures. That vindication will take place at the battle of Armageddon, now near. God permits Satan to continue his wicked work about the earth, and in due time God will destroy Satan’s organization by and through His great Prince, and that will be a complete vindication of His name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Satan having been cast out, a voice in heaven is heard by the apostle John, who represents Jehovah’s anointed witnesses today on earth, proclaiming, ‘'Now is come salvation. and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.” (Rev. 12: 10) This further shows that the war in heaven and the proclamation took place at the birth of the kingdom or nation of God. The proclamation would be heard by all the angelic host of heaven, and heard by the Christian saints after their resurrection out of death and being made like Christ Jesus in heaven. (1 Cor. 15: 42-44; 1 John 3: 2) It was not until 1925 that the faithful saints on earth who were devoted to The Theocratic Government began to see and understand; therefore that must have been God’s due time for the latter to see. The Lord revealed this and caused it to be published in the March 1, 1925, issue of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font2"> to wit, that there had been a war in heaven, Satan had been cast out, and there was much rejoicing in heaven because the birth of The Nation or kingdom had come. The “strength” of the Lord was demonstrated against Satan and his angels, and later demonstrated to God’s resurrected saints, and revealed to his faithful ones on earth. These then learned that “the Lord is my strength and song, and is become my salvation”. (Ps. 118:14) Isaiah had long before prophesied of the “robe of righteousness” and the “garments of salvation” with which the Lord would clothe his organization Zion and those who were members or children thereof (Isa. 61:10), but such robe of righteousness and garments of salvation were not understood by Jehovah’s witnesses until the February 1, 1925, issue of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font2"> Then they appreciated what was meant by the robe and the garments of salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The period of waiting by Jesus at Jehovah’s right hand had ended, as foretold at Psalm 110:1, 2, and the time had come for Christ’s “all power ... in heaven and in earth” to be exercised. (Matt. 28:18) This is what constitutes the &quot;dispensation of the fulness of times”, or (according to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham)</span><span class="font2"> the “administration of the fulness of the seasons”. (Eph. 1:10) The immediate ousting of Satan from heaven shows the beginning of the exercise of the power of Christ and marks the beginning of a new era in the kingdom of the great “King of Eternity”, Jehovah, and a new era or kingdom beginning before the complete destruction of Satan’s organization and power at the battle of Armageddon near at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All the holy angels are sons of God, and are therefore the “brethren” of those Christians who have died faithful and of the faithful ones yet on the earth and who are “in Christ” as members of His anointed body. To these the proclamation in heaven refers, saying: “For the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.” This accusing is well illustrated in the case of one of the ancient witnesses of Jehovah named Job Satan accused him before Jehovah and declared that Job would not maintain his integrity toward Jehovah if he were put to the test. God permitted Satan to try out his scheme on Job. The test was made and Job did maintain his integrity before God. Satan has always constantly accused the followers of Christ, declaring they would not remain faithful when put to the test. But those who have been faithful and true to God have maintained their integrity and Satan could not overcome them. On the contrary, these faithful ones have overcome Satan, as it is stated in the further part of the proclamation: “And they overcame him [the accuser] by the blood of the Lamb [Christ Jesus], and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.”—Rev. 12:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By their faith in the blood of Christ as compensating for all their natural weakness and other unintentional imperfections, and holding on to Him, these anointed Christians gained the fight. “This is the victory that o\ercomcth the world, even our faith.” (1 John 5:4) They overcome “by the blood of the Lamb”; which means that the Lamb of God is their advocate with God, making intercession for his weaker brethren. (1 John 2:1) “The word of their testimony” is also mentioned in the proclamation, which manifestly means that these have been faithful witnesses to the name of God and of Christ, giving testimony thereto One cannot be pleasing to God who does not act as a witness to the name and word of God. To be his witness is one of Jehovah’s positive commandments. The truth was given to God's people, not merely as something to enjoy personally, but to tell to others to the glory of his name. For a time his witnesses testified “in sackcloth”, figuratively speaking, and when that period was ended their witness was killed, as described in Revelation 11:3-8. In his due time, to wit, in 1919, God resuscitated his witnesses on earth and gave them a change of raiment to identify them as his cleansed witnesses; and now, clothed “with the garments of salvation” and “the robe of righteousness”, these go forward with great zeal to the giving of the testimony, and their witness work is a boomerang to Satan and his agents on earth —Re\ 11: 9-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the language of the proclamation (Rev. 12.11), those who went to make up the “two witnesses” testifying in sackcloth “loved not their lives unto the death”. They preferred to die rather than to yield to the solicitations or demands of Satan’s crowd. They would be faithful to the Lord at the cost of their lives. To such God’s “lovingkindness is better than life”.—Ps. 63: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The proclamation continues: “Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them [ye who in them are tabernacling </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)].”</span><span class="font2"> (Rev. 12:12) The remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses or “faithful servant” class on the earth are, by reason of their conditional right to eternal life in heaven, truly now tabernacling or tenting in the heavens or heavenly places. (Eph. 2:6) By faith they now see how marvelously God has dealt with them and how his purposes he so wonderfully unfolds for them, and that soon his word and name shall be completely vindicated and their own joy shall be complete. Such is the portion of those who faithfully serve God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Since being cast out of heaven Satan is limited in his operations to the things of the earth. Therefore warning is given to the inhabitants of the earth, at Revelation 12:12: “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” The remnant and their companions who are the Lord’s “other sheep” are no part of the “earth”; hence the “woe” is not to them or for them, but is directed to Satan’s visible, earthly organization and those who bear it up and support it, and who are subject to it. The remnant and their companions are now proclaiming this “woe” of warning; and for this reason and cause they witness to God’s name and word and Satan tries to destroy them. This text would further indicate that Satan will drive his representatives, to wit, Big Business, politicians, and clergy, to the extreme limit in their opposition to God and to Jehovah’s faithful servants on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Satan’s great wrath is directed against God and his organization. He therefore oppresses the people in divers and numerous ways and causes great sorrow and trouble to befall them and then induces his pious-faced and lying-lipped clergy to charge all these sorrows, woe and calamities up to Jehovah God. The reason is to turn the people away from God before Armageddon is fought. Satan sees that his time is short before the battle of Armageddon, when he shall be destroyed, and his purpose and attempt to turn people away from God is to get all on his side. The proclamation of the voice from heaven ends at this point of the Revelation, which indicates that the woes of the peoples of earth will continue and will reach a climax in Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The result of the war in heaven found Satan entirely excluded therefrom and he could take no further offensive operations against the heavenly host. His wrath was great against God’s “woman”, that is, God’s organization, of whom God’s anointed remnant of witnesses on earth are a part, and therefore the Devil must exercise his vengeance against God’s people on earth. Hence it is written that the Dragon, or Serpent, Satan, and his associate demons “persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child [God’s kingdom under Christ Jesus]”. (Rev. 12:13) This is a warning to all of God’s anointed witnesses, and now also to their earthly companions who form the “great multitude”, that they should expect the persecution of Satan and his opposition to be exercised by and through his agents as long as the “strange work” of Jehovah continues and until his “strange act” at the battle of Armageddon, when he will destroy all the demons and their chief, Satan. This is conclusive proof that if anyone is found earnestly and zealously serving God by giving testimony concerning God’s great name and purpose and his Theocratic Government, that one will be persecuted by Satan and his demons and some members of his visible organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the face of the continuing persecution, Jehovah resuscitated the work of his witnesses on earth in 1919 Now call to mind that, immediately following Jesus’ baptism in the Jordan river, Jehovah by his spirit led his beloved Son away into the wilderness for a period of time. At the end of that period of time Satan violently opposed the Lord Jesus, in the great temptation. (Matt. 4:1-11) And then Christ Jesus began his aggressive work in preaching the kingdom of God. (Matt. 4:17) So likewise it would seem appropriate that, immediately following the reviving of his witnesses in A.D. 1919, Jehovah God should lead his faithful ones on the earth away into a “wilderness”. Thus it is written: “And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days. And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.” (Rev. 12: 6, 14) In olden time the prophet Elijah fled from before wicked queen Jezebel because of fear. But God’s “woman”, represented by the faithful remnant of his organization on earth, fled because God had made provision for these, and while they were in such wilderness condition the Lord fed those of his organization. During the period of the World War (1914-1918) and while God’s organization on earth was prevented from activities, the members thereof prayed the prayer the psalmist had put in their mouth, to wit: “Oh that I had wings like a dove ’ for then would I fly away and be at rest. Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.”—Ps. 55 ■ 6-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">God resuscitated his witness work in 1919, and then he heard the prayer of his faithful ones and answered and provided even more than was asked of him. Jehovah God is “the great Eagle” whose wings provided the support and protection for his organization. Therefore his “woman” was given two wings of his provision, to wit, his love and power, to bear her away. As Jehovah had said concerning Israel “I bare you on eagle’s wings, and brought you unto myself ” (Ex. 19:4) After the birth of The Nation, or Kingdom, m 1914, and while the witness work was yet in restraint, Jehovah’s faithful ones on earth continued to pray • “Keep me as the apple of the eye; hide me under the shadow of thy wings.” (Ps. 17 : 8 ; also Pss. 57 ; 1; 61: 4) When the Lord’s people began to see his provision for them they said . “How excellent is thy loving-kindness, 0 God' therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings ” (Ps. 36:7) And Jehovah God, by his truth, revealed himself and his name and his Theocratic Government to his faithful remnant and their companions, and his ministration to them ever since has fed them.</span></p>

Two remarkable facts about this raid were that the sirens did not sound until bombs were already dropping, and the defense seemed very weak; at least, no French planes went up to try to drive the raiders off. Next day I cycled some 100 miles south to a port called Bayonne. ... It was not until we landed at Plymouth, feeling very thankful to Jehovah for having escaped the Nazi menace, that we heard about the armistice and the collapse of another pillar of democracy. But, of course, when a country is sold and betrayed right and left by Fascist intrigues with the able help and support of the Catholic Hierarchy, there is little hope for it. All the Jonadabs and the people not duped by the clergy could see that the Roman Hierarchy had a lot to do with the downfall of France.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">In Lord’s providence thrilling London convention held today. 2500 children of light assembled. All send you and American brethren love and greetings. Your speeches have filled us with joy and zeal to continue the fight for The </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Theocracy,</span><span class="font2"> despite conditions. Standing alert for the sign of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH GIVES GRACE AND STRENGTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your air-mail letter of August 17 brought me great joy and encouragement. It came just the day before I left for the Manchester convention. I read most of the letter twice at the convention, which brought much delight and joy to the brethren. After much anxiety we also received on Thursday night the recordings of “Religion as a World Remedy”, which had arrived by air mail in London on the Monday previous. It took three days before the government released these to us, having been in touch with them night and day on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The holding of this convention in the heat of war was a miracle of the Lord. For the past ten days we have suffered constant heavy air raids which have resulted m much destruction in many parts of the country. In spite of this, 3,500 brethren made their way to Manchester. One thousand pioneers came from all over; some hitchhiked, others cycled or walked. But they got there. The brethren were most enthusiastic, and every session of the convention served as Theocratic instruction. The high point was Sunday night, when 4,000 packed out the Free Trade Hall and the lesser halls connected by wire to hear your talk “Religion as a World Remedy”. The lecture was so clear that it sounded as if you were there. The audience applauded most enthusiastically with the American audience. Your very warm remarks to the brethren at the end of the resolution stirred the hearts of the British brethren as much as it must have the American brethren. Then the reading of the London cables by Grant Suiter came as a pleasant surprise to all of us. Then Sunday evening we received your wonderful cable from New York. This came too late for the convention, but its warm message has been conveyed to the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At a public meeting I also answered the many false charges made against us by the Manchester judge, Frankland, and the local press. In quoting from the 1936 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font2"> and the general financial report therein, I pointed out how the deficit shown in the report should fully answer their charges that the Brooklyn office of the Society owns a good share of America’s gold reserve. The brethren gave me most enthusiastic support throughout the halfhour’s talk, and especially when I asked the press and Judge Frankland why they did not ask for the balance sheet of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. This indeed brought down the house. Much of the press have made reports of this speech, but, of course, as is their policy, they left out the charges made against the old “harlot” and her agents. The entire assembly supported this statement I made in answer to these enemies, and copies will be sent to the judges and press concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There were 249 immersed. It was a sight to see more than a thousand brethren wearing their magazine bags wherever they went in Manchester. On Saturday night a thousand of them were on the streets with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. Kingdom News</span><span class="font2"> No. 7 was released for the first tune as far as Manchester was concerned. The whole city was covered. On Sunday morning a serious not occurred in the Catholic section of Salford, where five brethren were badly injured. Enclosed find several press reports from Manchester.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The field report for the convention showed 2,843 publishers in the field, placing 2,026 bound books, 13,395 booklets, 2,020 magazines, and sound attendance of 1,230.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Manchester had air raids every night of the convention and it seemed as if the demons were bent on preventing us from having this convention. One bomb fell and destroyed a theater located 100 yards from the Free Trade Hall on Saturday night. On Thursday night a large department store was destroyed not so far from the hall. But all this did not faze the brethren and everything went off as scheduled. The brethren had no fear and they went about their busmess as if there were no war. I have never seen such a large group of brethren so full of life, smiling, possessing great peace of mind and determination to serve The Theocracy. Your reference to Britain in the public lecture and your remark in my letter “I feel sure that a great portion of the multitude will come from Britain and will be the ones that will be privileged to fulfill the divine mandate of populating the earth with a righteous race” have pleased the faithful brethren very much, likewise the host of Jonadabs who attended their first convention. Surely this determination on the part of the brethren in this hour of great distress upon this land will bring much pleasure to our heavenly Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I personally wish to express my gratitude to the Lord and His organization for having had a share in this Theocratic convention, which has been the happiest I have attended. At a special pioneer meeting the thousand full-time warriors wished to send you their special love and wish to thank you for the gift of the new book, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion.</span><span class="font2"> I promised to send you their greetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I am sorry to learn from your letter that you are not so well, but am glad that you are slowly gaining strength. Surely Jehovah gave you grace and strength for the Detroit convention, and indeed he will preserve you for the victory shout just ahead It is my earnest prayer that the “everlasting arms” will continue to uphold you that your faithfulness and boldness may be an inspiration to all of us.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">With especial pleasure we announce the new book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion, </span><span class="font2">released by its author, Judge Rutherford, at the recent Theocratic convention of Jehovah’s witnesses. It offers the indisputable evidence, both Scriptural and factual, that religion is opposed to Jehovah’s Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus and is therefore the mortal enemy of man, and that Christianity is the only way of escape for people of good will. The book contains 384 pages, including color-illustrations, and a valuable reference index, all bound within beautifully embossed covers in a refreshing green cloth and gold-stamped. You will prize the author’s edition, which contains an autograph of a letter m his own handwriting addressed to the Theocratic ambassadors. This special edition is limited and may be had on a contribution of 50c per copy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEERING IN WAR-RAVAGED FRANCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Outbreak of war in September, 1939, found me in southwestern France where for the past three years I had the privilege of pioneering. Naturally Satan lost no time in attacking those who bear witness of our Lord and the next month the Society’s activities were forbidden by ministerial decree and the Paris office was closed. There were several reports in papers obviously of Jesuit origin. One described the Society as a ‘secret society called “The Knights of the Watchtower’'’, or shameful, disguised Communists, and mentioned that in the hall for meetings there was an altar with a white cloth and candles and that the chairman wore a hood. Anyone with the slightest knowledge of Jehovah’s witnesses knows how ridiculous this account is. Shortly after the closing of the Paris office I was called up by police authorities in Bordeaux and questioned by one official after another. Why was the Society forbidden </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font2">1 replied, ‘Because our books expose the lies of religion.’ They wanted to know what I intended to do. I replied that as the Bible itself was not forbidden (at least not yet) then I would carry on with that. Of course, I made no mention of the large stocks of literature hidden in the homes of people of good will which would not be idle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“A few weeks later my partner, a French pioneer, was called up for military service. He took his stand as a faithful member of Jehovah’s Theocracy and was arrested and imprisoned. After two months in jail he so bewildered the authorities with his determined stand and bold witnessing that they certified him as a lunatic and sent him to an asylum. (Acts 26:24) But his faith and determination were a great encouragement to the Jonadabs in Bordeaux.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Not being of French nationality, I was free to carry on and soon adopted the system of working in the morning offering first the Bible and then, if a spirit of good will was shown, placing a booklet or two, of which I carried a small quantity in a hidden pocket. The afternoon was dedicated to back-calls. Despite adverse circumstances this system worked well; interest steadily increased, so that several small studies were held in private homes in different parts of the city. Meetings in halls were out of the question, as we had to go very carefully. In January of this year we held a small immersion service, when four Jonadabs symbolized their consecration. This was held in a carpenter’s workshop. Although circumstances were so difficult, a few Jonadabs engaged in service work and the rest gave a witness among their family and friends. One sister living in a country village who has never had the privilege of attending meetings forged ahead with the door-to-door work in the face of much opposition. She was arrested and threatened several times, and police came to her home and seized her literature. We just cycled out to her place and left her a stock in the home of a near-by Jonadab. Finally she was prohibited even from selling the Bible, but she got over that by calling from door to door and simply giving away New Testaments to anybody who desired one and reserving the Society’s literature for those who showed real good will. In the spring of this year my stock of literature ran out, it being impossible to replace it from the Paris office, though right up to the last we received </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower. We</span><span class="font2"> also received small quantities of the two latest booklets </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees.</span><span class="font2"> However, this supply was not sufficient to keep us going. If we were to carry on, a larger stock was necessary; and the Lord made provisions for that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“A few months previously an American pioneer working in a country district had been arrested and, after many complications, finally expelled. He had been obliged to leave his stock of literature at his last lodgings in a small village To get his stock out and transport it to Bordeaux was a rather tricky job under the circumstances, but with Jehovah’s help it was done and we were supplied with spiritual ammunition for months ahead. I had to spend a night at this lodging house where the literature was and I was very touched by the kindness of the old landlady. The American pioneer had left such a good impression that she gave me a warm welcome and (without my knowing it) she even slept on the floor in the kitchen so that I could have her bed</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Meanwhile the ‘old harlot’ had been twanging her harp with great gusto and the Roman Hierarchy had increased their influence with the politicians. Nearly every day over the wireless we were subjected to some of this harp music in the form of Catholic propaganda and broadcasting of different ceremonies. One day, for example, the pope was referred to as ‘the Christ of 1940’, and on the occasion of Cardinal Verdier’s death his praises were sung to a nauseating degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Finally the big Nazi offensive began in May, and I shall never forget the wave of dismay, fear and utter amazement that passed over France when Paul Reynaud announced over radio that the Germans had broken through and reached Amiens. . . . When Italy declared war on France and England there was no great sensation, the spirit of the people was so low already. Certain Catholics had believed the pope would prevent this step. What hopes! This situation with other circumstances must surely open the eyes of many people befooled by the religious racket. For example, when the new cardinal of Paris took over his position, he held a special ceremony in the Sacre Coeur of Pans, during which he ‘blessed’ France and dedicated it to the ‘saered heart’; they also sang the Marseillaise, a political revolutionary song, for the first time in church history When I heard all that, I said to the brethren: ‘Poor old France! she’s done for now.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Then new circumstances of the war made the work more difficult. I was constantly being suspected of being a spy or a parachutist Several times police or soldiers stopped and questioned me. On one occasion a gendarme was curious to know what I had in the cases of my bike Now there were some booklets there which I was not keen on his seeing But the first thing I brought out was a phonograph record en titled ‘The End of the World’. When the gendarme saw that he said hastily, ‘Oh yes! that’s all right,’ and wanted to sec no more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The Nazis steadily came south, and in the middle of June the British consul warned British subjects to leave Being loathe to abandon the work and the Jonadabs, I hesitated; but when I heard that the British consul had already left and no more boats would leave Bordeaux, it seemed time to move, unless one was keen on having firsthand experience of a Nazi concentration camp. On the last night I spent in Bordeaux, June 19, the city was heavily</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">A little girl was showing a visitor over her father’s farm, and proudly pointed to a cow which, she said, was her very own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“And does your cow give milk?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">asked the visitor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Well, not exactly,” replied the child. “You’ve sort of got to take it away from her.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Why, the Very Idea!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A lady, having guests to dinner, told </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">her </span><span class="font12">maid to make mushroom sauce. On opening the can of mushrooms, the maid noticed </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">disquieting color.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Well,” said the lady, “put a little </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">on some </span><span class="font12">toast and .give it to the dog. If he eats it, probably it’s all right.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The maidjlid so; and reported that the </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">dog </span><span class="font12">begged for more. She was instructed to serve the sauce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">All went well until the guests were </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">having </span><span class="font12">coffee, when the maid, white-faced, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">came in </span><span class="font12">and whispered to her mistress: “Oh, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">ma’am, </span><span class="font12">the dog has just died!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There was only one thing to do—explain to the guests and call the nearest doctor to come running with his stomach pump. Eight steak and mushroom dinners were removed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Then the mistress went to the kitchen and asked the maid where the dog was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Oh, dear,” said Mary, still ;in a </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">state of </span><span class="font12">distress, “he’s lying under the jporch, </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">whpre </span><span class="font12">he was put by the man whose car. hit </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">him?<sup>1 </sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">—Labor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font17"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Sweeping Away Their Refuge of Lies</span></h2>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-variant:small-caps;">T</span><span class="font15" style="font-variant:small-caps;">he roman catholic hierarchy </span><span class="font12">are responsible for all the extensive persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses that has been carried on through the United States. This furnishes Jehovah with provocation for entering against them His just decree for their execution. The Hierarchy’s end is near, and their corpses shall not even have burial.— Psalm 83:10; Jeremiah 25: 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Before their destruction, the Lord declares, He will sweep away their refuge of lies, and this work progresses today with lightning velocity. On Friday the 13th of October, 1939, Judge Rutherford, as counsel for Jehovah’s witnesses, argued the case of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Clara Schneider vs. The State (Town of Irvington) of New Jersey</span><span class="font12"> before the United States Supreme Court, while the Hierarchy of Catholic Action choked on fishbones. On November 22, when the Court handed down its decision annulling the Irvington (N.J.) ordinance and reversing the decisions of all the courts of New Jersey, thus setting Clara Schneider at liberty, there was more gnashing of teeth in Rome. The authors of “mischief laws” received a judicial kick in the pants,—Psalm 94: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But even the seven Supreme Court justices who declared themselves for freedom of speech ignored the main issue, the supremacy of JEHOVAH’S Law. How forcibly this was presented to the Court, who were unable to avoid hearing the proclamation of God’s Word, by Judge Rutherford, counselor for His people!—</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This Court has heretofore held, in the case of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Holy Trinity Church vs. United States,</span><span class="font12"> 143 U.S. 457, that America ‘is a Christian nation’. From the foundation of the United States this has been recognized as and declared a Christian nation, which means that the people endeavor to follow the lead of Christ Jesus. The Lord Jesus Christ always obeys the will of Jehovah God. All Christians are duty-bound likewise to obey the law of Almighty God. Even the Constitution of the State of New</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY 10, 1940</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Jersey recognizes that a Christian’s right to worship Almighty God must not be interrupted nor interfered with by the State:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“No person shall be deprived of the inestimable privilege of worshipping Almighty God in a manner agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience.” —New Jersey Constitution, Article 1, Section 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Human creatures or human powers cannot set aside the Divine law nor prevent the individual person’s conscientious obedience to the law of Almighty God, The law of Almighty God is supreme, and this Court, by holding that America is a Chris-. tian nation, even so derides.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy are back of all this persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses. They are attempting to frame mischief by law to prevent the promulgation of God's Word. And although they claim to teach the Bible, they are putting'the State above Almighty God. For this reason, in America the Supreme Court is the last bulwark of freedom of speech and freedom of worship. In his argument before the Supreme Court of the United States, bearing upon this point, counsel for Clara Schneider said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This court is the last bulwark of American liberty. And unless this court upholds the right of freedom of speech and freedom of worship, all liberty in America is gone. ... I hope this case is not decided solely on the authority of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Lovell vs. The City of Griffin.</span><span class="font12"> While the decision in that case is sufficient upon which to base a reversal of the judgment in the instant case, I hope this court will decide that in America a person may worship Almighty God JEHOVAH in a manner agreeable to his conscience, and as set forth in the Bible, without first obtaining permission of a police officer. . . . Upon the point of which is supreme, the law of Almighty God or the law of the State, a distinguished authority on Constitutional Limitations says: “No external authority is to place itself between the finite being and the Infinite when the former is seeking to render the homage that is due, and in a mode which commends itself to his conscience and judgment as being suitable for him to render, and acceptable to its object.”—Cooley’s </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Constitutional Limitations,</span><span class="font12"> Sth Ed., page 968.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">3</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Mr. Blackstone, an authority recognized by this Court, has well said: “Man, considered as a creature, must necessarily be subject to the laws of his Creator, for he is entirely a dependent being. . , . The will of his Maker is called the law of nature. , , . This law of nature, being coeval with mankind, and dictated by God himself, is, of course, superior in obligation to any other. It is binding over all the globe, in all countries, at all times. No human laws are of any validity if contrary to this; and such of them as are valid derive all their force and all their authority, mediately or immediately, from the original. . . . Upon these two foundations, the law of nature, and the law of revelation, depend all human laws. That is to say no human laws should be suffered to contradict these.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Counsel for Clara Schneider further said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is hardly necessary for me to say that there is a rapidly rising tide of Nazism and Fascism sweeping the whole world. This Totalitarian doctrine and rule has gained control of ’most all of Europe and is reaching out to control America, and one of the means of accomplishing this purpose is to deny persons the right to serve and worship Almighty God without first obtaining a permit from a police officer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Not all lawyers of America are ashamed to mention the name of Almighty God before the highest court of the land. For more than twenty years the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the leading religious institution on earth, has attempted to control the politics of all lands, has published far and wide statements to this effect: That Judge Rutherford is an “exconvict”. Convicts are denied the right to practice law before any court. The fact that Judge Rutherford appeared before the highest court of America and argued this important ease of the liberty to worship Almighty God should for ever put to silence the Hierarchy, which constitutes a crowd of the most fertile liars that encumber the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Because Judge Rutherford has insisted on telling the people the truth, as set forth in God’s Word, which truth exposes the duplicity of the Hierarchy and their unholy racket that they have practiced upon the people for centuries, the Hierarchy h$s tried to destroy the force of his argument; and in their attempt to silence Judge Rutherford they have repeatedly denounced him as an “ex-convict”. In making this statement they well know that they lie, and what occurred in the Supreme Court of the United States in October stamps the Hierarchy as willful and deliberate liars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Hurried away to the Federal penitentiary on the 4th of July after Manton had denied him bail, Judge Rutherford was held in prison for nine months for the sole reason that Manton, one of the mainstays of the religio-political Hierarchy, had denied him his Constitutional right of bail pending appeal. After the case was presented before the Supreme Court of the United States he was admitted to bail. Shortly thereafter the case, which contained 125 errors, was tried and the majority of the Appellate Court readily reversed the adverse judgment, while the “Knight of St. Gregory the Great” (Manton), working with his eoeonspirators, the Hierarchy, dissented in that opinion. To show that he was not ashamed, Judge Rutherford immediately thereafter began a campaign throughout the United States and engaged the largest halls in the largest cities, and made announcement with full-page ads in the metropolitan press to this effect: “Sentenced to Prison for Eighty Years; Result of a Conspiracy by the Clergy. Come and Hear the Reason Why”</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> (or, </span><span class="font12">about it)'. On numerous occasions thereafter he appeared in the courts, because his citizenship was never taken from him, as is shown by the reversal by the higher courts. But even to this very day the Hierarchy still denounces Judge Ruiherford as an “ex-convict”; and this they do in order to hide their own nefarious deceptive methods of robbing the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“A Liar and a Murderer</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">from the Beginning&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Hierarchy is trained by the Devil, whom Jesus described as “the father” of lies and “a murderer from the beginning”. (John 8:44) When they accuse one of a serious crime such as that of which Jesus was accused and such as they have constantly charged against Judge Rutherford they well know that more often than not the accused is never fully exonerated in the public eye. No doubt there are many people today who think Jesus was a seditionist; others, that He was a fake. The Hierarchy proposes, by the simple process of repetition, to induce many people to believe that Judge Rutherford, who had the respect of the highest court of the United States, is an “ex-convict”. The Devil induced Adam to blame a woman when he was caught in a crime. He now causes his agents, the Hierarchy, to besmirch the Lord’s servant in order to hide their own crimes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Thesame methods are also to be observed among the Hierarchy’s allies such as Germany and Russia, the “red Fascists”. When an effort</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">is made by smaller nations acting through the League of Nations to have Russia arbitrate her differences with little Finland, the Comintern’s reply is to the effect that no war is fought with Finland (although at this writing some 50,000 Soviets and unnumbered thousands of Finns have been slain), but that a new government has been set up in Finland which “does not endanger Russia”, that this government has been recognized by Stalin’s monstrosity, and that a state of rebellion exists which Russia must assist in quelling. One does not exactly gather just of what Russia is relieving the Finns, but it appears certain that soon they will have nothing more &quot;to be relieved of”. A repetition of the Austria and Czechoslovakia “swipe” is executed while the master liar and murderer looks on in approval at his puppets. And the Hierarchy gets its share of the loot. Soon, no doubt, the robbers will become tired of dividing up with Rome and take the “ole lady’s” share.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Supremacy of JEHOVAH’S Law at Issue</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Is it not a terrible condemnation against the Hierarchy that the only man who honored the name of Jehovah at this United States Supreme Court hearing is one they have dubbed “ex-convict”? And the fact that it is not a personal fight, but an effort on their part to dishonor the Lord’s message, puts them first on the docket for His execution. The words of this servant of the Most High were so inescapably plain: &quot;I hope this Court will decide that in America a person may worship Almighty God JEHOVAH in a manner agreeable to his conscience, as set forth in the Bible, without first obtaining permission of a police officer.” The supremacy of</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> JEHOVAH’S </span><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Law is the vital issue, but the Court, an excellent man-made institution, ignored or disregarded the great Life-giver. Those who do not discern His THEOCRACY will not receive His blessings.—Isaiah 45: 23; Acts 3:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">No lesson teaches the wicked anything, because they despise instruction. (Proverbs 1:7; 13:13) The fact that Judge Rutherford, who was wrongfully held in prison by the Hierarchy’s Manton, has lived to tell of Jehovah’s Theocracy for more than twenty years and his voice has been heard over the whole world in the Lord’s name, while Manton has been convicted of a filthy crime and is in durance vile, will teach them nothing. When recently the Hierarchy’s demonized agents, under the influence of Coughlin, attacked one of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY to, 1940 </span><span class="font12">the Lord’s assemblies and, through the assistance of certain officers of the law enforcement department of New York, had Jehovah’s witnesses arrested for attempting to keep order, when the outcome of this case was to free Jehovah’s witnesses, and the Coughlinites had sore heads and other parts for their pains, they still learned nothing. The further fact is that the opposition of the Hierarchy to the Lord’s message, in which they have used every weapon, from gagging the press to murder, has had no result, but, on the contrary, this message has increased in volume until the last year saw the largest number of publications, and greatest witness, of any. But none of these facts will teach the Devil’s hirelings anything. They are “vessels fitted for destruction”, and not good for anything else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“The Crime” of Clara Schneider</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It has always been one of the Devil’s methods to have his agents accuse a servant of the Lord of sedition or some other crime. Daniel, Jeremiah, Nehemiah, Zerubbabel, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego, Jesus and the apostles, were all accused of some crime against the government. The Hierarchy’s modern method of ‘framing mischief by law’ is simply the time-old custom of the Devil, the purpose always being to interfere with the Lord’s servant in carrying out His purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Facts</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In New Jersey’s town of Irvington, in December, 1935, Clara Schneider went from door to door leaving with interested persons literature explaining the purposes of Almighty God as written in the Bible. From some of such persons she accepted contributions given to aid in printing and distributing more like literature. She was maliciously accused and wrongfully convicted as a violator of the town’s canvassing ordinance. She purposely had not applied to police for a permit, for she considered herself as sent by the Most High God, Jehovah, to do His work under Christ Jesus, and that therefore to apply to any creature for a permit would be an act of disobedience to her Creator. Her wrongful conviction was reversed by America’s highest court as an unlawful encroachment upon rights safeguarded for every inhabitant of this country by its Constitution, as defined by the same court in that earlier case of another of Jehovah’s witnesses, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Lovell</span><span class="font12"> v. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">City of Griffin</span><span class="font12"> (Ga.), 303 U.S. 444.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">At this </span><span class="font12">writing the town officials </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font12">Irvington riaim they will not be bound by this ruling of the United States Supreme Court. Many parts of New Jersey have difficulty in learning that they remain a part of the United States and are not a Papal state. The Supreme Court called their attention to this fact in CIO-Hague case. It is hard to imagine a more astounding example of Inquisition law than the license which Irvington town fathers sought to enforce in the United States of America. This license required those who applied to have their picture taken, be fingerprinted, notify police of their kind of clothing, and made it “mandatory&quot; upon the chief of police to refuse license to any who in his opinion was not of good character. This law was never enforced except upon eleven members of Jehovah’s witnesses, against whom it was obviously drafted and executed. When these eleven witnesses of Jehovah, after their arrest by the police of Irvington for “canvassing without the required license&quot;, applied to court for relief, be it said to their everlasting shame that the courts of New Jersey upheld this Nazi mischief law even in the highest tribunal of the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Counselor for Jehovah’s witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Before the highest tribunal of the land Judge Rutherford, representing the cause of Jehovah's witnesses, proved the absurdity of this ordinance as a law and plainly demonstrated to the satisfaction of the court that it was simply a relic of the Inquisition. His argument continued as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">May it please the court . . . This is not a religious question. The undisputed evidence that appears in the record is that the petitioner was at the time she was arrested “an ordained minister of Jehovah God to preach the gospel of God’s kingdom under Christ&quot; and that she was engaged in this work for that sole purpose. It would be wholly inconsistent to require a minister of the gospel to apply to a human official for a permit to do that which the Almighty commands must be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Irvington Ordinance is subject to the same vice as the Ordinance of the town of Griffin, Ga., considered in the case of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Lovell vs. Griffin,</span><span class="font12"> for the reason that it attempts to license the press and activities of the press and to license one’s activities in performing the duties which Almighty God commands His servants to perform, and for that reason alone it is void on its face, without regard to its application. The ordinance here in question says: “No person shall distribute circulars or other matter or call from house to house in the town of Irvington without first having reported to and received a written permit from the Chief of Police.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">To illustrate the point: It is customary for the nuns of the Catholic &quot;Church organization in the performance of their appointed duty to regularly caU from house to house, and solicit and receive money and 'other contributions. Under the </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Irving</span><span class="font12">ton ordinance as applied they must first obtain a permit to so call from house to house. Otherwise they would be guilty of a misdemeanor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The religious organization known as the </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Salva</span><span class="font12">tion Army sends its representatives amongst the people and they call upon them from house to house soliciting contributions and selling their literature. Under the construction placed upon the v Irvington ordinance by the Respondent their acts in so doing are in violation of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font12">motorist might be driving through the town of Irvington and stop to call on several of his former friends residing in different houses in that town, and in doing so “call from house to house”. To do so without first obtaining a permit from the police would be a violation of the Irvington ordinance according to the construction the courts </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">be</span><span class="font12">low put upon it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Let us assume that the Nazis, Fascists, and Soviets were moving in secret to invade the American shores and some good citizen learning this fact went from house to house to notify the people of the impending danger and in doing so </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font12">printed folders containing such warning which he distributed from house to house without first </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">ob</span><span class="font12">taining a permit from the police. According to the New Jersey courts he is guilty of a misdemeanor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Should the ride of Paul Revere be repeated in the town of Irvington, New Jersey, without first applying to the police for a permit, the informer would be subject to spend a term in jail, according to the construction placed upon its ordinance by the Courts below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font12">submit that if the Lord Jesus Christ, acting exactly as He did when He was on earth in the flesh, were here again and went from house to house in the town of Irvington doing good and preaching the gospel (Luke 13: 22), He would </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font12">liable to be incarcerated in the town calaboose for not having first applied to the police to grant Him permission to do what His heavenly Father commanded Him to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The petitioner in this case is a follower of the Lord Jesus Christ, doing exactly what Jesus and His disciples did; and, since she was so doing in obedience to the commandment of Almighty God, it is not within the power of the State or any municipality to regulate or attempt to regulate the manner in which she shall preach the gospel. To apply an ordinance to any person named herein as it has been applied to the petitioner would certainly disclose that the ordinance' is void on its face, for the reason that the persons against whom the ordinance is made “do not come within the terms of the ordinance”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Certainly this honorable court would not hold that a person is required to first violate the law of Almighty God and his own conscience by applying for a permit to do what Almighty God commands him to do and this he must do before he could question the validity of the ordinance under which he is arrested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Only the corporate or totalitarian states attempt to regulate the conscience of men or attempt to compel them to obey man’s law which is in derogation of the law of Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The very act of applying for a permit to engage in the service or the worship of the Lord God, as the petitioner was doing in this case, would cause her to violate her conscience and to violate the specific command of the Lord to preach this gospel of the Kingdom and to go from house to house to do so; and certainly it is not within the power of the state or the courts to compel a person to violate his conscience or violate the supreme law as a condition precedent to raising the question of the validity of an ordinance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The United States Supreme Court vs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Inquisition</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In these days of framing mischief by law, as foretold by the psalmist, most cases are decided on some legal technicality and not upon their broad merits. The lawmakers and courts of New Jersey took the unenviable position of not only framing such mischief laws but upholding them even in their Supreme Court and their Court of Errors and Appeals. The town of Irvington set about to destroy the work of Jehovah’s witnesses, and in this the courts of New Jersey backed them up, but the United States Supreme Court repulsed the New Jersey branch of Catholic Action; their opinion announced November 22, 1939, reversed the Inquisition and declared unconstitutional New Jersey’s anti-Christian act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Caught in the Snare</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">At</span><span class="font12"> this time the Lord Jesus Christ, Field Marshal of Jehovah’s armies, gathers the enemy to battle. (Joel 3:9-15; Revelation 16:16) By means of the message of the Kingdom He is dividing the sheep from the goats, that is, separating the people who are friendly to The Theocracy, and shall therefore live, from the opponents of The Theocracy, who are slated for destruction. The battle is imminent ! Viewing this great maneuver in the light of recent events in the state of- New Jersey, it appears that certain authorities there and certain courts, who have been doing the will </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY 10, 1940 </span><span class="font12">of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, are taken in the Lord’s snare: “I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, 0 Babylon , [Hierarchy], and thou wast not aware: thou ' art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the Lord.” (Jeremiah 50:24) These same officials will find that their hire, whether it was money, indulgences, or fire insurance against “purgatory”, will seem poor pay, when they must face the fierce anger of the Lord’s Executioner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When they are confronted by the Final Arbiter they will not be able to avoid the issue by some legal chicanery as they did in deciding against Clara Schneider in her various appeals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Evidently these courts of New Jersey are similar to that of ex-judge Martin T. Manton, who so delighted to do the Hierarchy’s will. Otherwise they would not function as tools of Rome, but would decide on the plain issue involved, which really was The Inquisition vs. Christianity, Communistic Nazism vs. Freedom ; nor would they have asked Hague, the New Jersey pope, or anybody else for suggestions before rendering a decision. And they would scarcely have acted like brother polecats endeavoring to hide the foul scent of despotism, which has been rising up from Irvington these several years past to offend the nostrils of the nation. Otherwise, could they have ignored their oaths of office, strengthening enemies of the Constitution? Could they have forced a Christian, guilty of no wrong and so declared by the honorable Supreme Court of the United States, to carry her case through five courts, costing her much time and burdensome expense, to gain her freedom? They would hardly have done this had. they been American institutions, unhampered by pressure from a foreign power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">But no matter to the Christian. All accounts will be settled at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">However, the United States Supreme Court recognized the methods of the Inquisition, as is clearly shown by their language in the opinion written by Justice Roberts. They saw that it was simply a modern version of the time-honored trick of the more ancient Inquisition when fiends, such as the Roman Catholic Torquemada, destroyed books, including the Bible, throttled free speech, and killed by rack and stake every critic of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, Referring to Ciara Schneider the opinion stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The applicant must submit to that officer’s [the</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Irvington chief of police’s] judgment evidence as to his good character and as to the absence of fraud in the “project” he proposes to promote or the literature he intends to distribute, and he must undergo a burdensome and inquisitorial examination, including photographing and fingerprinting. In the end, his liberty to communicate with the residents of the town at their homes depends upon the exercise of the officer’s discretion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As said in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Lovell</span><span class="font12"> v. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">City of Griffin, supra, </span><span class="font12">pamphlets have proved most effective instruments in the dissemination of opinion. And perhaps the most effective way of bringing them to the notice of individuals is their distribution at the homes of the people. On this method of communication the ordinance imposes censorship, abuse of which engendered the struggle in England which eventuated in the establishment of the doctrine of the freedom of the press embodied in our Constitution. To require a censorship through license which makes impossible the free and unhampered distribution of pamphlets strikes at the very heart of the constitutional guarantees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The justice, after commenting upon the possibility of fraud being practiced in the name of religion, declared that this is not sufficient consideration for invading the cherished' right of freedom of speech. He continues:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We are not to be taken as holding that commercial soliciting and canvassing may not he subjected to such regulation as the ordinance requires. Nor do we hold that the town may not fix reasonable hours when canvassing may be done by persons having such objects as the petitioner. Doubtless there are other features of such activities which may be regulated in the public interest without prior licensing or other invasion of constitutional liberty. We do hold, however, that the ordinance in question, as applied to the petitioner’s conduct, is void, and she cannot be punished for acting without a permit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The judgment in each case is reversed and the causes are remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">So ORDERED.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">(This ease was considered, together with three others, from California, Massachusetts and Wisconsin, involving similar rights to distribute information, and ail these cases were reversed in favor of free speech.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Nations That Forget God”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is to be regretted that the Supreme Court did not decide on the important issue as to whether God’s law or man’s law is supreme. Earnestly Judge Rutherford, as a witness for Jehovah to the Supreme Court, urged upon them, and this for their own welfare as well as for the 130 million whom they represented, that this case should not go off on the Lovell decision, but, said the counselor, “I hope this court will decide whether in this country a man shall obey the commandments of the Lord God without asking permission from a police officer.” But on this point the court remains silent, ignoring the great Creator of the universe. Perhaps some of the individuals may yet remember Jehovah and not suffer the fate of the nations that have forgotten God.— Psalm </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">9:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Court Gave Courteous Attention</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Lord is no respecter of persons. Kings, judges and common people must be given the witness alike. It was but another testimony to the Lord’s name, even though directed to eight brilliant jurists in a dramatic setting. The justices gave close attention to the arguments of the counselor. Many questions were asked, and in friendly vein. One asked if Jehovah’s witnesses were traveling missionaries. He was answered that they were similar. </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">An</span><span class="font12">other justice asked why it was that counsel for the petitioner (Judge Rutherford) eited in his Brief the statutory rights of freedom of religion, and yet claimed that this was not a religious issue. The answer was:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Certainly, these citations were offered in the Brief. If one is granted freedom to practice his religion by the words of the Constitution, with stronger reason he is entitled to obey the commandments of Almighty God without interference. Again was emphasized the difference between religion and Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">God’s Enemies Maneuvered</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Is it not a tribute to the power of Jehovah that a cause made against His people, begun in a dirty recorder’s court of New Jersey, should be carried through all the courts of the state as a testimony against them and finally, in the ornate Supreme Court of the land, turned back in the enemy’s face ? This was the power of Jehovah, and they are henceforth responsible to Him. The somber elegance of the Supreme Court room, with red carpeting, light marble columns, clear in the illumination from a figured ceiling, decorated with geometric rosettes 100 feet over head, was vastly different from the dirty, evil-smelling courtroom where the Devil first caused one of Jehovah’s witnesses to be taken. The Lord made it clear, too, that the authorities of New Jersey had been fighting against Him. When the attorney for Irvington was asked by the court how many persons had been arrested for faiL</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">ure to comply with the tyrannical ordinance he was compelled to admit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Only Clara Schneider and ten other of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the end, while the court did not declare itself for Jehovah, it did speak emphatically in defense of freedom of speech, and brought a setback to those promoters of Catholic Action who would like to model New Jersey after Nazi Germany:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Although a municipality may enact regulations in the interests of the public safety, health, welfare or convenience, these may not abridge the individual liberties secured by the Constitution to those who wish to speak, write, print or circulate information or opinion . . . This court has characterized the freedom of speech and that of the press as fundamental personal rights and liberties. The phrase is not an empty one and was not lightly used. It reflects the belief of the framers of the Constitution that exercise of the rights lies at the foundation of free government by free men. It stresses, as do many opinions of this court, the importance of preventing the restriction of enjoyment of these liberties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Religionist Prefers Inquisition</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The decision of the Supreme Court was unanimous with the exception of Justice McReynolds. He dissented, thereby siding with the Hierarchy in giving his support to a foreign power opposed to the principles of American liberty. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font12"> magazine, issue of December 4, 1939, describes how this justice has sided with the principles of Rome for many years:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">On </span><span class="font12">a hot August day in 1914, Woodrow Wilson appointed to the Court his attorney general, hotheaded, hard-headed Mr. McReynolds of Tennessee. Legend has it that Woodrow Wilson regretted no appointment more than that one. And legend also gave Mr. Justice McReynolds a bad name: a man intolerably rude, anti-Semitie, savagely sarcastic, incredibly reactionary, Puritannical, prejudiced. . . . For many years he had refused to speak at all to Justice Louis Dcmbitz Brandeis, Reportedly he fought the appointment of saintly Benjamin Cardozo to the court; urged Hoover not “to afflict the Court with another Jew”. Fortnight ago his one remaining mainstay, solid old Pierce Butler, died. (Time, November 27) In silence last week he heard Justice Owen Roberts read the majority decision re-affirming the civil liberties of the United States citizen, proclaim the right to pamphleteer without </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">police license.* (*In Irvington, N.J., Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Worcester, Mass., pamphleteers, denied that right, had appealed.) The decision presented no new point of Constitutional doctrine, but to many a thoughtful United States citizen came as a solemn reminder, in anxious days, that beneath the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUAflV 10, 1940 </span><span class="font12">stated rights of citizenship lies a rock-founded base guaranteeing their preservation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In his familiar attitude of somnolence old James McReynolds heard Justice Roberts announce the Court’s decision, seven to one for freedom of the press. Scribbling swiftly, newsmen shoved into the press-room tubes the line, “Justice McReynolds dissents,” turned back to stare at the lonely old man nodding in his huge black ehair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">American Catholics Also in Danger</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It is to be taken as a grim warning that even a Supreme Court justice should be controlled by Rome. Yet opposing liberty of religion, of worship, and of press seems wholly foreign to an American, be he Catholic or otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Such a course fosters the persecution which our forefathers sought to escape. Religious liberty was nurtured here by those who had seen the effects of the torture chamber and the rack; men who sought a country where their conscience might no longer be outraged by tyrannical restrictions. They wished to worship Almighty God without being charged with heresy because they did not share the tenets of others. Nor was it Protestants alone who sought these shores to enjoy the cherished jewel of liberty. The colony of Maryland was established to give like immunity to Catholics, who were oppressed at the time in England. Many were the Jews who sought relief here from every land. America has therefore been a haven for the persecuted, the land of the fulfillment of their dreams of untrammeled freedom where every man, no matter what his convictions, might lay his head down at night without the horror that tomorrow might bring the end either of honor or of life. Here was blessed relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">These facts were once well known to every school child. Now many “history books have been tampered with” and a great deal of ignorance prevails in America concerning the birth of the United States. One hears such appalling lies as the statement that 'George Washington was the first Fascist’. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, in many statements by their members besides Coughlin, have advocated the “corporate state” or dictatorial government for this country. Let it here be stated that the Catholic people should be just as much opposed to this infringement of the people’s liberties, or rather such a deathblow to the freedom of Americans by the introduction of totalitarian rule, as should be the remaining people of this nation. And this in spite of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">9</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">fact that such a government would be controlled by Vatican City. Well may the Catholics of the Loyalist cause of Spain, the Catholic followers of the devout Catholic von Schusehnigg of Austria, and the silent bodies of the Catholic slain of many nations, attest to the fact that Home pities not her own people. Let Americans of all creeds remember that their interests are mutual if they are to protect and continue to enjoy the freedom which was bought by the blood of our forefathers! —Elton Groves.</span></p>

One ton of phosphates or guano is worth thirty to forty tons of farmyard manure as a fertilizer. The reason for the huge accumulations at Nauru is that there are no rains at that place.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">♦ The (R.C.) Church and the state are independent powers, each supreme in its own sphere; but with the condition that in matters of common concern the Church’s view shall prevail. (Leo XIII, encyclical &quot;Arcanum”) The Church is an entirely perfect society, dependent on no other power. (Leo, “Immor-tale”) The Church has power not only to teach, but also to judge and punish. (“Immor-tale”) The state should profess (Roman) Catholicism as being “alone true”. (“Immor-tale”) Equality in the state, of other &quot;religions as they call them”, is wrong. (“Immor-tale”) Complete liberty of speech, publication, etc., is wrong. (“Immortale”) The Church and her teachings are the standard by which to judge what the state should allow. (“Liber-tas”) The Church, while recognizing that toleration, by the state, of opinions contrary to Catholicism, may at times [be expedient], nevertheless regards it as an evil, to be restricted as far as possible. (“Libertas”) State laws, if opposed to the teachings of the Roman Church, are not binding in conscience. (“Sapient iae” )</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">These principles are obviously the same as those of the most intolerant mediaeval periods; and Leo XIII definitely said (“Immortale”) that “whatever the Roman Pontiffs have taught in the past, or in future shall teach, must be held firmly—especially as to the so-called ‘liberties’ which now are so greatly coveted”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It must also be remembered that the Roman Church claims jurisdiction over marriages of all baptized persons. (See Leo XIII’s “Areanum” ; Pope Pius Xi’s “Casti Connubii”; and the 1917 “New- Code of,Canon Law”.) She also claims a divine right to supervise education “and no power on earth can stand in her way”. (Pius Xi’s “Rap resent anti”) Finally, it is an offense, punishable by excommunication, to cite any member of the Roman Catholic clergy before a civil court without previous permission of the bishop. (Pius X, &quot;Mo-tu proprio” decree,. &quot;Quantavis,” issued in 1911)—J. W. Poynter, England.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>Nun Gives Child Her Idea of Hell</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">♦ In the analytical report of the Municipal Council of Diff ending (Luxemburg) appears in shorthand the following verbatim report of the meeting of Tuesday, November 9, 1938:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Councillor: I have heard of a certain occurrence in a school at Lasauvage, and I wish to have the matter made public, so that everybody may form his opinion on the ease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Mayor: The matter is quite correct. As soon as it was reported to me I ordered the police to make an inquiry. We have submitted the case to the inspector of public examination, and to the responsible authorities, in order that the necessary legal steps may be taken. It is the ease of a girl pupil who attended mass on Sunday, but not high mass. In order to demonstrate to the children the pains of hell, the sister, who was instructing the class, lit a candle and made the pupil who had not been to high mass hold a finger over the Same, while the class recited the Lord’s Prayer, The child suffered her index finger to be burned until she fainted. At first the doctor thought the finger would have to be amputated, but he now states that it will heal in a fortnight’s time. The sister pretends that she forcibly kept the Same away from the child’s hand, the latter wishing to he grilled longer. This exceptional act deserves an exemplary punishment. I am holding back the police reports. The guilty woman will be punished by the magistrates and by the scholastic authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Councillor; Your explanations are quite sufficient. That instructress will not escape her responsibilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Mayor: When I was informed, I immediately took all necessary steps. The matter will proceed.—From the French </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font12"> Sept., 1939.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>Gas Masks at the Vatican</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">♦ In the view of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy Italy is a part of the Kingdom of God and Germany another part, while itself is the most important part. Now that gas masks have been issued to the inhabitants of Vatican City, one wonders mildly if some one of the horned-toad “saints” has been put to work on the poison-gas end of the Kingdom, and just which one of them the pope will “pray” to while he is fastening his new bib around his neck. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>Collections Kept Up</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">♦ The London </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald</span><span class="font12"> states that during 1937 Franco’s soldiers, and others who hoped for the re-establishment of the church burden upon the backs of the Spanish people, contributed nearly a quarter of a million pesetas for their cause and in 1938 over a half a million pesetas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark68"></a>“They Shall Take Up Serpents”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Many papers contain mention of religious groups that make a specialty of handling rattlesnakes and copperheads, quoting as their authority Mark 16; 18. Handling serpents without removing their fangs is nothing new. It has been done by devil-worshipers from time immemorial, in India, Arizona and elsewhere. It is as much an impiety to claim that Mark 16:18 is a part of the Bible as it is to make that claim for John 21:25. Both are spurious, and neither one is true. Any person with a copy of the Revised Version, or any other scholarly translation, will see from the marginal comments that these verses are no part of the original Scriptures. Pictures of the snake-handlers show that they are demonized. The account of the performance immediately preceding the snake-handling says, “Some shriek, some dance, some sing, some babble in what is known to the mountain folk as the 'unknown tongue’. Others shut their eyes in a semi-trance.” These concomitants of demonism are widespread over the earth.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>A Story from Catholic Portugal</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Once upon a time a priest was delivering his sermon in a crowded church. He said, “All those whose </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">fathers</span><span class="font12"> are Jews will please leave the church; they are not welcome here.” Half of the congregation got up and left. The sermon continued, and then the priest said, “All those whose </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">mothers</span><span class="font12"> are Jews will please leave; they are not welcome here.” The other half of the congregation left, except one old man, who was leaning against a “colonna”. The priest continued and then stated, “All those who have Jews for </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">hath</span><span class="font12"> father and mother, let them leave, as they are not welcome.” Then the Christ came down from the altar crucifix and took the old man by the arm and said, “Come on, let’s get out of here, it seems we are not welcome 1” The old man hung back and pointed to the priest, “How about him?” . . . And the answer was made by the Christ, “Oh, him? Let him stay; he doesn’t know </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">who</span><span class="font12"> are his father and mother!”—■ Translated from a Lisbon (Portugal) paper.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>Looking to a Japanese Triumph</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Looking to a Japanese victory in China, the “Reverend Father” John T. S. Mao, a priest from Nanking, China, in an address in Washington, told of the hope of the Roman Hierarchy to make China predominantly Catholic in the coming post-war period.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark74"></a>Lord Provost of Glasgow</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">♦ The lord provost of Glasgow (fancy name for mayor), Patrick J. Dollan, was in New York, and everybody at St. Patrick’s Cathedral was glad when he came in wearing his gold chain of office. Each link weighs an ounce, and represents a former mayor. Also there was a three-inch medal. The chain is 100 years old, and in that time Glasgow has had, apparently, 27 mayors. Now at that rate, 1,000 years from now, if nothing happens, the boy that holds down the job in Glasgow similar to Lord Provost Frank Hague’s in Jersey City, will be burdened with a chain that will have some 297 links in it and will weigh over 18 pounds. The medal by that time ought to be 33 inches across, if they want to do the right thing, and when the lord provost comes to little old New York the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font12"> ought to come across with a story that will occupy the best part of a page instead of only 12| inches. Lord Provost Dollan was born 1,000 years too soon.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>Look for the Adjective</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">♦ In his peace address to the cardinals the pope said,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Since the beginning of its existence the church has always raised to the Lord its prayer and among men taken action for the triumph of true peace. [Los Angeles </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Herald and Express]</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The catch is in the word “true”. Thus the overthrow of the Spanish Republic, with the murder of something like 2,000,000 Catholics, was a “true peace” to the pope because it put the Hierarchy back on the necks of the Spanish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Pope Provides Spanish Constitution</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ In the days of the Papal states those states were admitted to have the very worst government in the world, and it is therefore of peculiar interest that the pope, according to </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Herald,</span><span class="font12"> supervised the preparation of the constitution that takes the place of the liberal one of the Spanish Republic, which constitution and which government the pope and Franco destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Incensed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ A correspondent in Bombay sends a clipping from </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Herald</span><span class="font12"> of Calcutta in which occurs the statement that after mass had been celebrated in the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, Madame Lebrun, wife of the president of France, and another lady were incensed. And then he asks, “And wouldn’t you be ?”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark78"></a>Franco’s Tears</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">♦ When Franco finally turned his sword over to “god” (meaning thereby the god of this world, the Devil) in the presence of the . cardinal-primate of Spain and twenty bishops, he was so overcome with emotion that he wept. Now, if he would go off into a back alley somewhere and weep by himself over the thousands of families he has broken up, and the 40,000 teachers, doctors, lawyers, journalists and artists who were the backbone of the Spanish Republic, and are now homeless refugees in France, and whom lie says he will murder if ever he lays hands on them, his tears would be a sign of humanity; but as it is his tears were merely tears of emotion because he was and is so stuck on himself that it makes him cry to think “how nice” he is.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>Working in Harmony</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Working in harmony with the Hitler-Stalin-Vatican arrangement, The London </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald</span><span class="font12"> reports the arrival in The Netherlands of twenty nuns who left Finland before the . Soviet attack took place. They had been working ip Finland seventeen years when the order to leave came from their higher-ups. The actual attack on Finland did not come until more than six weeks after they left, but somebody must have known it was surely going to come and that they had better be elsewhere. Of the nine Roman Catholic priests in Finland, two are Finns and seven are Dutch.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark81"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark82"></a>Can You Beat It?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">♦ The man who violated his oath of loyalty to the Spanish Republic, and thereafter caused the death of approximately 2,000,000 of his fellow Catholics, receiving the blessing of the “holy father” at Rome for so doing, sent a telegram to King Leopold, of Belgium, in which he said, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font12"> wish to express the profound interest of Spain in all acts which tend to re-establish peace for the benefit of all humanity.” What beautiful, sublime hypocrisy!</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">♦ The Druids honored the sun upon the first of May by lighting huge fires. Some Irish villages still do this, and pass their cattle between two fires, and even pick up their children in their arms and run through the flames. This appears to be a substitute for the old Phoenician custom of child sacrifice to Moloch, or to Bel, when the children were fed into the fiery furnace.—</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Picture Post.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark85"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark86"></a>Pinkussohn’s Bad Act</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">♦ David Pinkussohn, of Chicago, should shame himself. Formerly in the ancient and honorable business of bootlegging, he deceived and misled the “Reverend Father” P. K. Collins, of Butler, Pa., the “Reverend Father” M. A. McDermott, of Windber, Pa., the “Reverend Father” E. M. Barry, of Waterville, Minn., the “Reverend Father” Charles Havor-ka, of Hopkins, Minn., and the “Reverend FatheF’ F. S. Strobel, of Bandera, Texas. By ways that were dark and tricks that were vain, according to the Government, Pinkus-sohn persuaded these five priests to surrender to him $15,000 worth of bona fide receipts for whisky in a warehouse and gave them counterfeit receipts in return. This business of cheating Catholic priests out of their whisky certificates has got to be stopped. It puts too big a burden on the servant girls to have to put up the money twice over. Once should be sufficient.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark87"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark88"></a>Bishops Solidly Back of Hitler</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">♦ “The Catholic leaders of Germany, forgetting for the moment their differences with Third Reich leaders, have been exhorting the faithful at home and abroad to do their utmost in the fight for the righteous cause of the German nation under the guidance of Chancellor Hitler”; so says a dispatch to the New York </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font12"> from Frankfort-on-the-Main, Germany, in reference to the attitude of the bishops and their superior officers in the Roman Hierarchy. The same dispatch states that in the diocese of Wurttemberg, with a Catholic population of 670,000, there was an average of 437,000 at mass each Sunday during the first three months of the war.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark89"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark90"></a>Catholic Periodicals</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">♦ The American Roman Catholic </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Register </span><span class="font12">carried a dispatch from Amsterdam to the effect that “circulation of German Catholic periodicals has increased by a total of 7,000,000 copies since Adolf Hitler’s advent to ,• power six years ago”. Does that look as if there were much to the oft-repeated ballyhoo that the Catholic Church is being persecuted in Germany ?</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">♦ I, Patrick Morgan, am prepared to give three thousand dollars in all, to any Roman Catholic priest or layman who can produce a single passage of Scripture that will infallibly substantiate the following Roman Catholic teachings: One hundred dollars per text proving that we ought to pray to the Virgin Mary; that the Virgin Mary was born without sin; that Saint Peter had. no wife; that priests ought not to marry; that Peter was a bishop of Rome; that the pope is the Vicar of Christ or the successor of Peter; that priests ean forgive sins; that the wine at the Lord’s Supper ought to be taken only by the priests; that there is such a thing as the Roman Mass; that priests have power to change the bread and wine into the body, blood and divinity of Jesus Christ; that there are seven sacraments; that the use of images was recommended by Christ or His Apostles; the existence of such a place as Purgatory; that there are more mediators than One; that we ought to pray to the dead, or for the dead; that we should fast on Fridays or during Lent; the infallibility of the pope; that unbaptized children, after death, go to a place called ‘Limbo’, or that there is such a place; that a man should be persecuted and cursed, who conscientiously leaves the religion in which he was born; the baptism of bells; that everybody should not read the Bible; that a man sins when he leaves a false religion; that Christ did not believe in freedom of conscience and freedom of speech; that anyone is justified in blindly submitting to priests, bishops, or pope; that the Church of Rome is the first Church or the oldest Church.-—Patrick Morgan, editor, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Converted Catholic.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Bad Outlook for America</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ All systematized religions are elaborately organized in the United States, but no other has so powerful or elaborate an organization as the [Catholic] Hierarchy system or has the same gigantic wealth and income. The total value of the religionist property in the United States was £134,000,000 in 1890, and is now, though the number of church members is cer-tainly not doubled, about £800,000,000. The Catholic Church no longer boasts of this— possibly because there is a cry for the taxation of church property—but, since it owned onefifth of the whole in 1890, and one-fourth in 1906, it now must have about one-third, or certainly more than £200,000,000. Its income is assessed by Catholic writers as £160,000,000 a year. And this vast income is used in very large part for the purpose of getting further income. Between 1890 and 1906, the value of religionists* property generally rose by 85.1 percent, but that of Catholic Hierarchy property rose by 147.7 percent. In the last forty-five years the number of Catholic chapels has increased by 80 percent, but the wealth of the Hierarchy system has increased tenfold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Upon this massive basis rests the power of the Hierarchy in America. At the head of the organization are four cardinals, one has just died, sixteen archbishops, 102 bishops, 29,782 priests, and 75,000 nuns, who run innumerable schools, hospitals, orphanages and so on. Next to these are the teachers in the Hierarchy parochial schools, colleges and universities, and the staffs of journalists on about fifty newspapers and magazines. With salaried secretaries, publicity agents and other secular employees, there are about a quarter bf a million paid workers in the United States under the ensign of M.A.C., that is, Make America Catholic. And as this well-organized machine is under the thumb of a religious dictator, himself in sympathy with Fascist and Nazi • aims and ideals, the prospect for freedom and liberty in America does not seem so gbod.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark93"></a>Whom Do You Fear?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font20">T</span><span class="font12">HE entire world is “jittery”. The people of the world fear what men may do to them and what others may think of them, but they do not fear God, and henee are against Him and His kingdom, even though they profess to be Christians. God’s greatest prophet pointed out specifically that this condition would exist at the end of Satan’s world, and all the facts prove that that prophecy is in course of fulfillment, to wit (Luke 21; 25, 26) : “Upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity ; . . . men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those tilings which are coming on the earth.” And what is the end of such fearful ones? The answer is found in the prophetic Scriptures: “Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, 0 inhabitant of the earth [and particularly so-called ‘Christendom’]. And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that eometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare; for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake.”— Isaiah 24:17,18,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Every government of earth is part of the earthly organization of “the god of this world”, who is Satan (2 Corinthians 4:3,4), and every government of earth is now against the Theocracy. That Theocracy is God’s government or kingdom by Christ Jesus: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” (Matthew 6; 10) There is not one earthly government that is for that Theocracy. The King of the Theocratic Government says: “He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me seattereth abroad.” (Matthew 12: 30) The facts now well known fully prove that all the political, commercial and religious organizations are against the kingdom of God. The reason is that Satan, the invisible “god of this world”, and all his power and the power of his agents are against the Theocratic Government. (John 14:30) Prompted by the Devil and at the immediate instance of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which aims to rule the entire world, all the political and commercial and religious elements of the world have conspired together against the Theocracy, to destroy those who now truly serve that righteous government as witnesses for Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Concerning this God prophetically foretold (Psalm 2: 2, 3).- “The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords [restraints] from us.” Psalm 83:3: “They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones [under God’s protection].” All the nations practice some kind of religion, and all the nations have left Jehovah God out of consideration and thus have forgotten God, and none of them eall upon His kingdom or look to it as the means of salvation and deliverance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The end of Satan’s operation is at hand. Knowing that his time is short, Satan has brought great woes upon the peoples of earth, as foretold at Revelation 12</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">; 12.</span><span class="font12"> Fear has gained control of the political and commercial elements, and these have invoked religion to bring them aid. Upon earth there* is “distress of nations”, “men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth.” All the forces of the world under Satan’s command are gathered together for Armageddon, the battle of the great day of God Almighty. (Revelation 16:13-16) All of Satan’s forces are against The' Theocracy and those who stand for The Theocracy. As He stated at Exodus 9:16, Jehovah’s time has come to show His power against all that oppose His government. It is Jehovah’s time when He, by His right hand (Christ Jesus), should “destroy them which destroy the earth”. (Revelation 11:18) That means everything that is against The Theocracy. Agreeable to His expressed purpose, Jehovah, “the Possessor of heaven and earth,” has given to Christ His King the worldly nations for an inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for possession. (Psalm 2:8) And what shall the Lord do with all the nations that are against The Theocracy ? He answers in these words to His King Christ Jesus: “Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.” (Psalm 2:9) Such disaster will befall the nations at Armageddon. Only those</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">who </span><span class="font12">fear God and serve His government will survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">One who now has a vision of the Theocratic kingdom, and who loves the King, fears God, and thus continuing to fear God he will never turn back to the world, which is Satan’s. How can a man escape the snares of the Devil? Proverbs 29;25 declares: “The fear of man bringeth a snare; but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord [Jehovah] shall be safe.” Thus it is shown that one’s only safety is to put one’s </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">trust </span><span class="font12">wholly in the Lord. Fear of man leads into the Devil’s snare and into destruction. Fear of God is the way of escape from the Devil’s snare and leads to life. One who undertakes to serve God must love Him, which means to be unselfishly devoted to God and to His service. That man who has unselfishly devoted himself to God’s service is pursuing a wise course; as it is written (Proverbs 9:10): “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.” Otherwise stated, the man does not begin to be wise until he fears God. He begins to see and to appreciate the relationship of man to Jehovah the Creator. He learns that God is the fountain of life. (Psalm 36:9) Only those who fear God can receive the blessings of the fountain of life. Proverbs 14:26,27: “In the fear of the Lord is strong confidence; and his children shall have a place of refuge. The fear of the Lord [Jehovah] is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">While darkness covers the earth, and gross darkness the people, as foretold at Isaiah </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">60:2, </span><span class="font12">and while strife and wickedness rule today amongst men, all persons of good will are invited to give their allegiance and devotion to The Theoerat and His King. Such is the only hope of mankind, as Jehovah has plainly ■ proclaimed to the world. (Matthew 12; 18-21) No one can pin his hope to anything the nations of the present wicked world offer. He that devotes himself to the full and unselfish service of the Theocratic Government shall live. None other shall live. Let all who have a desire for life, and all who hate wickedness and love righteousness, give heed to the words of the Lord. The earth is His, and the fullness thereof, and He alone can give salvation to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The man who fears God does not give heed </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font12">what other men may say about him. The wise man is one who is concerned altogether about what God may think of him. He craves the approval of God because he knows that he t &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">18</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">must have God’s approval before he can obtain life. To have the disapproval of Jehovah God means destruction. As the fear of </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font12">is the beginning of wisdom </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font12">the part </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">of man, </span><span class="font12">it follows that man must ever thereafter </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">con</span><span class="font12">tinue to fear God and particularly to fear that he might not receive God’s approval. The only means, therefore, of escaping the snare of the Devil is the fear of God and. to have no fear whatsoever of man. The approval of man by the Lord God means everything. “Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread. And he shall be for a sanctuary.&quot;—Isaiah 8:13,</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">14.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark94"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark95"></a>New Zealand Needs Kingdom</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">♦ As to workers’ getting $5 per day in New Zealand, this is not in United States money, as I received only $3.60 for a New Zealand pound. A bricklayer gets 3/- per hour, or about 54c U.S. Oranges are 5 for 1/-, or 18c. Bananas were 5d to 6d (7|c to 9c) per pound; potatoes 4d (6c) per pound. Washing machines are out of reach of the workers; radios are three times what they cost here. House rents are sky-high in Wellington and Auckland. It costs nearly as many pounds to build a house there as it does dollars here. As for the government’s taking over the banks, the Bank of New Zealand at Suva, Fiji, would not change New Zealand currency; I was there on a visit to my brother last winter. Fiji has been run in the hole; they even charge 6d to get on the dock to meet one’s friends. The shipping company makes money out of people from misleading them into thinking they are going to do well in New Zealand; I met several who wished they were back here, as the price of living is out of proportion to one’s income, and the wind almost blows one’s head off. I went down on the Orange and came back on the Niagara third-class. There was no hot water; I had to go to the cook for hot water to shave with. The C.P.R. are the main shareholders in that company. In New Zealand gasoline is 2/- to 2/3 per gallon (36c to 40c); the place is the same as all the rest of the world—very much in need of the Lord’s kingdom. It is too bad for poor folks to go there and get fooled.—George Eshelby, Washington.</span></p>

Such a situation sooner or later results in harm on a great scale. A public servant in a democracy is, as a matter of fact, a steward and not a master. In a government of the people, by the people and for the people, the people are themselves the rulers, subject only to the higher law of God, and that law administered, not through a bureaucratic ecclesiastical system, but through the operation of divinely decreed laws whose effect none can escape. Their servants must be governed by the expressed will of the people, who, as sovereign rulers, decree the ends for which the public servant must seek to contrive the means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In a democracy it is inevitable that representative bodies of men should have delegated authority to act for and in behalf of the people as a whole. These representative groups may, in turn, assign to some of their number specific tasks and duties and may appoint committees to handle more expeditiously the details. In the United States two such committees have within the recent past been appointed by the Congressional bodies and their activities have been given wide publicity in the press. They are the La Follette Committee and the Dies Committee, so called from the names of their respective chairmen. Both are investigating subversive groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As a subcommittee of the larger Committee on Education and Labor, appointed by the Senate, the La Follette Committee was given the work of investigating “violations of the rights of free speech and assembly and interference with rights of labor to organize and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JANUARY 10, 1B40 </span><span class="font12">bargain collectively”. Obviously the purpose of the investigations was a worthy one, fully in harmony with democratic principles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">An examination of the record reveals that the committee has had over three months of public hearings, examined hundreds of witnesses, and taken millions of words of testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The La Follette Committee set out to unearth evidence of interference with the right of workers to organize unions for self-advancement and protection; to discover the nature of this interference and by whom it was carried on; and to determine, if possible, what could be done to remedy the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The committee’s investigations w<sup>r</sup>ere concerned chiefly with labor spies, strikebreakers and industrial munitions as these were employed by employers to hinder labor in its lawful right to organize and co-operate. Months of effort disclosed that industrialists were engaged in a cold, merciless and vicious warfare against employees. These industrialists have collaborated with professional spies and sluggers in violent assaults upon citizens who were merely exercising their legal rights. Recognizing that in union there is strengtii, and preferring to deal with employees as individuals, employers (generally corporations with factories and equipment) resorted to unlawful and vicious tactics in their efforts to break up established unions and prevent the organization of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Spying</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Big business annually spends millions of dollars for spying on its employees. There are agencies specially organized and operated for the purpose of furnishing spies. These agencies designate themselves detective agencies. The La Follette Committee investigated five: the Railway Audit and Inspection</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">19</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Company; the National Corporations Service; Pinkerton’s National Detective Agency, Inc.; Corporation Auxiliary Company, and the William J. Burns International Detective Agency. Officers and employees of these agencies were summoned to appear before the committee and records were subpoenaed for examination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The concerns mentioned did not like being investigated and did what they could to block the efforts of the committee. They destroyed or concealed records; lied about reports; established secret offices; changed their books; tampered with witnesses and refused to testify.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The committee then indicted six officials for contempt of the Senate, secured enough waste paper from the baskets to reconstruct records and obtained further information from reluctant and evasive witnesses. Its discoveries were interesting, to say the least.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The record of labor spying runs as follows: The “detective agency” is interested in getting business. Employers are interested in keeping down labor trouble. Where there is no trouble the agency goes to the employer and tells him of dangerous radicals working among his em-. ployees; that Communism is spreading and that there is danger of a strike. The agency then offers its services under the title of “specialized efficiency engineering”. The employer concludes he will take some, and the agency gets busy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The “detective agency” proceeds about as follows: It will try to bribe members of a union or plant its own men among the members. The spy becomes unusually active in the union and seeks to get a place of trust and authority so as to have access to information wanted by the agency. Or he may get the information by rifling desks or bribing union officials. Other spies in the union stir up trouble and dissension, sending a regular report to the agency. The spy is not overly honest, as a rule, and his report may be true or not. But, in any event, trouble is not hard to find when a spy is looking for it. Honest and active union members and officials in ay be framed and misrepresented to the employer and in eases one may even lose his job. Or he may be taken for a ride, or be beaten up. As a result the activity of the union is effectively hindered or broken up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Labor spying or espionage is not the only activity of the industrial detective agencies. In the event of a strike it will co-operate with</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19400110_files/g_E_19400110-6.png" alt="" style="width:40pt;height:22pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">the employer in breaking the strike. It is not particular about the way this is done. The agency will furnish strikebreakers, strike guards and strike missionaries, so called. A strikebreaker is supposedly a worker who replaces another worker who is on strike. These strikebreakers arc really shock troops rather than workers, and are put into the factory to break the strike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The ostensible work of the strike guard is to protect the property of the employer as well as the workers who are still on the job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Strike missionaries fulfill a unique mission. They work among the strikers in an effort to persuade them to stop striking. They may work on the pickets or call on the families of the strikers, bringing pressure to bear upon the wife or mother or other member of the family. They may profess to be strikers themselves and urge violence or produce it themselves so that the real strikers may be blamed for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In bringing to light the facts on these matters the La Follette Committee, as an honest public servant, has rendered a valuable service. Many pages of testimony show that the use of violence is not brought about by the strikers, who generally picket peaceably. As peaceful picketing is effective, the employers and the detective agency, so called, must do something to put the strikers in a bad light and the strikebreakers and strike missionaries proceed to supply the violence and charge it to the striking employees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A large number of the strikebreakers and guards and missionaries hired by the detective agencies have criminal records. Any employer who hires criminals to engage in unlawful activities like the foregoing will in all probability be swindled himself by these same men. The committee has brought to light evidence showing that this is the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">There was a strike in progress at the Willard Storage-Battery plant, of Cleveland, Ohio, and strike guards furnished by </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font12">detective agency walked off with a large number of the batteries, which they sold at a low price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At the Ohio Rubber Company strike gas grenades, costing $12 each, were furnished the strikebreakers. Instead of returning the unused grenades after the conclusion of </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font12">strike, these men sold them for $2 each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During the New York elevator strike elevators were in many eases run by strikebreakers. One of these looted a Park Avenue apartment and carried off jewelry and a mink eoat costing $55,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Strikebreakers frequently tear their own old elotlies and, claiming the pickets did it, get a new suit from the employer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In a New Orleans streetcar strike the cars were operated by strikebreakers, who kept ail the fares. While the employers thus stand to suffer considerable loss, the real losers are the striking workmen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Private Munitions</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19400110_files/g_E_19400110-7.png" alt="" style="width:199pt;height:245pt;">
<p><span class="font12">IIow about a real effort, Mr. Dies?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">A large-si zed munitions industry has been built up in connection with the strike-breaking profession. Industrialist employers have purchased millions of dollars’ w<sup>r</sup>orth of munitions : veritable war equipment consisting of pistols, shotguns, rifles, machine guns, sub-machine guns, baseball bats, blackjacks, tear gas, picketing gas, ax handles and other things calculated to make an impression on striking workers. And these instruments have been used, too. To make the purchases look all right, or to make them inconspicuous, they may be billed to an attorney or a dummy corporation. Of course, it was all intended for the protection of the plant— and the workers! The committee found, however, that they were used to break strikes in actual warfare against striking and nonviolent workers. An illustration is that of the Black and Decker Electric Company, of Kent, Ohio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A strike began at this plant in May, 1936, and was quite effective. The company obtained a supply of gas equipment and guns and through the co-operation of a “detective agency”, so called, a number of strikebreaker guards were obtained. When 42 of these arrived they immediately attacked three peaceful pickets at the gate, using gas and shotguns. The strikers were greatly incensed (as was intended) and availed themselves of what weapons they could find. The result was considerable personal injury and property damage. The armed strikebreakers precipitated the trouble in order to bring the strikers into disrepute. The strike was finally settled peaceably. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In addition to unearthing and bringing into the open the foregoing facts the La Follette Committee made other discoveries. In Chicago it investigated the massacre of workers by policemen. In Harlan county, Kentucky, it exposed Nazi tactics employed by industrialists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The La Follette Committee has, as a result of its efforts, given publicity to practices detrimental to a democracy, and a number of the detective agencies exposed by it have been driven out of business. The committee has proposed to Congress legislation barring the use of spies, strikebreakers and guards, or the use of industrial munitions in dealing with striking workers, to limit employers to lawful tactics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Dies Committee</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The other Congressional committee referred to, the Dies Committee of the House of Representatives, started operations while the La Follette Committee was busy exposing anti-labor tactics. The Dies Committee was appointed to investigate un-American activities, such as Fascism, Nazism, and Communism. It has received considerable newspaper publicity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It has gained some notoriety by tacking the epithet “Communist” or “pro-Comm uni st” to certain organizations and individuals. Among those so labeled are the La Follette Committee, the Farmer-Labor Party of Minnesota, and the American Civil Liberties Union. Individuals suspected of Communism are Secretary Harold I ekes; Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter; President and Mrs. Roosevelt;</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19400110_files/g_E_19400110-8.png" alt="" style="width:43pt;height:43pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">ex-Governor Benson, of Minnesota; and— Shirley Temple1 Some newspapermen have recommended that the Dies Committee be itself investigated as un-American.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When Gerald Winrod was candidate i'or senator from Kansas he appeared to be supplied with plenty of money, coming from a mysterious benefactor. His campaign was a mixture of pro-Nazism, antiSemitism and hell-fire. An investigator from the Dies Committee investigated—for two days. Then he was recalled. Wiiirod (a “Reverend”) had got in touch with another “Reverend”—Hodge, of Beaumont, Texas, who was spiritual adviser of Mr. Dies. Hodge Spiritually advised” Dies to kill the investigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Paul Y. Anderson, in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Nation,</span><span class="font12"> states that the real purpose of the Dies Committee was to offset the work of the La Follette Committee, to create the impression that the CIO is dominated by Communism, to discredit the National Labor Relations Board, and<sup>1</sup> to snipe at every public official who had demonstrated friendship for organized labor or devotion to the Bill of Rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When the new Congress convened, the Dies Committee received an appropriation of $100,000. The La Follette Committee, which received but $15,000 in the first place, was denied any further appropriations. The Dies Committee has since been given a great deal of newspaper publicity, and it cannot be denied that it has brought to public notice some facts of considerable significance. It has unearthed information tending to show that Nazism, Fascism and Communism are active within the borders of the United States, and anything that will keep these monstrosities at bay, particularly the light of publicity, is entirely in order. But the Dios Committee has not yet discovered that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is in covert alignment with these forces, playing Nazism and Fascism against Communism, and both against Democracy, in an effort to divert the attention of the people from its own definite purpose to dominate everything in the end. Nor does the Dies Committee appear to be in great danger of discovering the real culprit in the very near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It may not here be out of order to give Mr. Dies some extracts from the Declaration of Independence of his own state, Texas, from Mexico. In this declaration the Texas convention of its delegates stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Mexican government . . . now offers us the cruel alternative either to abandon our homes, acquired by so many privations, or submit to the most intolerable of all tyranny, the combined despotism of the sword and the priesthood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It denies us the right of worshiping the Almighty according to the dictates of our own conscience; by the support of a national religion calculated to promote the temporal interest of its human functionaries rather than the glory of the true and </span><span class="font11">living </span><span class="font12">God. [March, 1836]</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The “human functionaries” of religion are again at work, and a little investigation in that direction would prove of no small significance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">3,000 Cases </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Face Reopening</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ One of the interesting situations resulting from Catholic Manton’s sale of justice is that there is a possibility of some 3,000 cases’ being reopened. Certainly, if justice were done, he should be brought into court and made to explain why he denied bail to Judge Rutherford and his associates, and was for their continued imprisonment even when the judge that sent them to prison wrote and telegraphed that they ought to be set at liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The New York </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">World-Telegram,</span><span class="font12"> one of whose reporters had much to do with the bringing of Manton’s conduct to light, takes note of the interest of the legal aspects of cases which he tried. Justice Sutherland said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">We cannot doubt that the other judges who sat in the various eases acted honestly and with pure motives in joining in the decisions. No breath of' suspicion has been directed against any of them, and justly none could be. And for aught that now appears we may assume for present purposes that all of the cases in which Man ton’s action is alleged to have been corruptly secured were in fact rightly decided. But the unlawfulness of the conspiracy here in question is in no degree dependent upon the indefensibility of the decisions which were rendered in consummating it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Judicial action, whether just or unjust, whether right or wrong, is not for sale, and if the rule should ever be accepted that the correctness of judicial action taken for a price removes the stain of corruption and exonerates the judge, the event will mark the first step toward the abandonment of that imperative requisite of even-handed justice proclaimed by Chief Justice Marshall more than a century ago that the judge must be “perfectly and completely independent, with nothing to influence or control him but God and his conscience”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When the good news comes that the archcrook, Manton, is in prison every honest man in the land will give a sigh of relief.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark123"></a>The Wisdom of Solomort</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">♦ The wisdom of Solomon is manifest in the discovery of the ancient copper-smelting city of Ezion-Geber, at the head of the Gulf of Aqaba, on the eastern side of the Sinai tic peninsula. Here was located the greatest smelting plant of ancient times, and the particular reason why it was located here was to take advantage of the furious winds constantly blowing from the north.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The archaeologists who found the city discovered a completely novel type of structure on the northwest comer, different from any previously found. The report, reprinted from Asia magazine, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The walls of the rooms were pierced with two rows of flues, and the main walls were interconnected by a system of air-channels inside the walls, into which the upper rows of flues opened. The spaces between the two rows of flues had been turned green by reason of sulphurous gases to which they had been exposed. The originally unbred yellowish mud-bricks had been baked, by the heat of the fires in the rooms, to the consistency of kiln-fired bricks. Masses of hard baked elay-debris, on which pottery crucibles had been placed, completed the picture. It became evident that the building was an elaborate refinery, where previously “roasted” ores were worked up into ingots of purer metal. It was obvious, both from the sulphuric discoloration of the walls and the fragments of - raw ore and numerous finished articles discovered in the site, that the refinery at Ezion-Geber was devoted to copper, of which great quantities abound in the immediate vicinity and along most of the length of the Araba, and in adjacent Sinai. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A long period of mining and smelting and refining must have preceded the construction of the elaborate refinery at Ezion-Geber. The Kenites, who were native to the country and whose very name indicates that they were smiths, and the related Kenizzites, who were also smiths by profession, were in all probability the ones who introduced the Israelites and the Edomites to the arts of mining and metallurgy. It will be recalled that Moses took a wife from the Kenites, and that the Israelites ever afterwards maintained the closest relationship with them. The Edomites too were related to the Kenites through the Kenizzites. The Bible tells us that Tubal-Cain was the first forger of copper and iron instruments, and that the Kenizzites lived in the Valley of the Smiths, which we take to be the Wadi el-Araba, with its many copper mining and smelting sites.</span></p>

It belongs to the Persian people and bids fair to sometime be of real advantage to them. It was necessary to build 94 tunnels, one of which is two miles in length.

<p><span class="font12">♦ As long as the Baltic Sea remains under control of Germany, and as long as the Corridor through Danzig remains open, you can be sure that Germany will not want for raw materials. Nor will Russia want for engineers. German engineers are flocking into the new Promised Land, and a great flood of the things needed in a great war are certain to be at Germany’s demand.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">Thirty million living creatures die fe._ A annually to keep the markets sup-%&gt;, plied- Most, of these furs are ob-<sup>1</sup>'<sup>J</sup>” tained by trapping. Enough animals escape from the traps that one animal out of every fiva eaught has only three legs. The missing leg was one he gnawed off to escape the previous trap, A trapper once caught a muskrat that had only one leg. He was finally caught by his tail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Do you enjoy hearing about a queen or a member of the judiciary decked out in ermine (or a pope in his coffin similarly bedecked)? The finest ermine comes from Siberia. The method there employed is to grease a piece of steel. The little ereature wants food and tries to lick the grease. Its tongue adheres to the metal and it freezes to death. Sometimes it escapes by tearing its tongue from the mouth, when it dies of starvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Persian lamb is nice, don’t you think? The best is obtained by clubbing the mother sheep with iron rods until they give premature birth to their young, which are then skinned. The usual method of obtaining the best sealskin is to club the baby seals, and skin them alive, since the pelt then comes off with less trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Maybe the fur liked best is the silver fox, raised on fox farms. The two standard methods of getting the furs in prime condition is either to cut out the fox’s tongue, so that it will bleed to death, or to jump on the prone fox and break its ribs. The reason why chloroform is not used is that, if used, it deadens the luster of the furs.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark150"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark151"></a>The Invasion of Massachusetts</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">♦ The invasion of Massachusetts by an army of soldiers with sharp teeth and flat tails caused excitement in Hancock township, which is a strip of mountain territory sixteen miles long and three miles wide bordering on New York state, whence came the soldiers, four-footed ones. These soldiers, sometimes called beavers, are very appreciative of little favors. In a certain place they built a dam every night. It interfered with a road, so a highway employee removed it every day. One night the highway expert thought to outwit the beavers and hung a lantern in a beech tree eight inches in diameter. The beavers worked all night that night, and one of the trees they cut down was the eight-inch beech, which fell without damaging the lantern. The highway expert said they built twice as big a dam as usual on the night when he tried to frighten them away with the lantern.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark152"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark153"></a>Busy as Beavers</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">♦ In twenty minutes a beaver will cut down a four-inch tree, and will sometimes cut down a tree eighteen inches in diameter. It is the greatest dam-builder known, and can stay under water eleven minutes at a time. Its reason for building dams is to keep its winter supply of food, barks, branches, lily buds, etc., under water. In 18 years more than 2,000 beavers are known to have sprung from three pairs released at Palisades Interstate Park at Bear Mountain, forty miles north of New York city.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark154"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark155"></a>Beavers All Killed Off</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">♦ The beavers that once worked so faithfully in Britain to make ponds, and thus provide fertile meadows, were all killed off long ago. The destruction of these useful little creatures has been astonishing. In the year 1743 France obtained 127,000 beaver skins from Canada alone. The top hats worn by all the real and shoddy aristocracy a century ago were made of beaver fur.</span></p>

The stowaways were mostly wild canaries, with a few swallows among them.

<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark177"></a>Gathering Clouds of War</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">• There can be little doubt that the actions of Germany in seizing Austria, Czechoslovakia, and in making a grab for the whole of Poland, inspired Stalin to act in similar fashion, or Hitler provided an open door for a purpose hidden by Stalin till opportunity offered the chance. That Russia has changed her policy of advancing the Bolshevik ideas by propaganda and underground means and has come out openly as imperialistic is openly declared by the ruthless attack on Finland. Nor can there be much question that Russia will, if possible, carry on this aggression till Sweden and Norway are under her control, at least so much as to give Russia freedom to the open waters of the north Atlantic. This at least is plain, namely, that the whole of Scandinavia, with Finland, countries which escaped the devastation of the great war, are involved in the trouble which has now broken out in Europe. That all the countries which have been united in the term “Christendom” must be brought into the gathering of the nations for judgment according to the word of Jehovah by His servant Zephaniah (3:8) is part of the warning to these nations which has been voiced by Judge Rutherford, and passed to the peoples by Jehovah’s witnesses. The unwarlike peoples of Scandinavia have had the warning, as well as the witness to those of good will, that all who will seek the will of God at this time, and become obedient thereto, may find a place of safety and an assurance of life even when Armageddon shall come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">This new war adds complication to the British government and may very seriously affect the British people. The shipping between Britain and Sweden and Finland, already partially stopped by German action in the Baltic and their mines in the North sea, will not be possible so far as Finland is concerned while this new war is on. Britain got a large portion of its wood pulp for its newsprint from Finland, and already the newspapers are pinched in their supplies; also the big trade in dairy products between the Baltic states and Britain has been stopped and Britain’s butter supply greatly curtailed. How the general policy of the Government is affected by the unexpected conditions and by its possibilities is a matter for the Cabinet and the Government; but it certainly is an added burden for those men who are already carrying a heavy load of care. There is no rest for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">/ Owing to the slow development of the war, declared on September 3, this land has had a “peace” which it did not expect. The war has been most active on the sea, and many lives have been lost, and much destruction effected. All the people arc pleased to have had freedom from the aerial attacks which seemed<sub>i</sub> so certain to come quickly. But there is the fact of war, and the certainty that its havoc must come; in the meantime the absolute “blackout” almost from sunset to sunrise is an affliction, borne in patience, and the rationing of food, already in partial operation, will be taken in the same spirit. The country generally^ rests in its confidence in the Government and supports it in the main purpose of ridding Europe from this gangsterdom which threatens all the peoples. In the meantime there is a general advance in the costs of living. The Government has done much to stop a ramp in food prices, but in general goods there are, because of the war needs, both shortage of supplies and advance in costs. The evacuation of the children has brought its own crop of difficulties, and the transferring of the Government offices to various places less liable to air attacks than London, and the voluntary evacuation of residentials of London to homes inland, have hit storekeepers very hardly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Roman Catholic interests in Britain, mainly represented by the priests, are crying out about the injury done to them in the evacuation of the children. The priests say the authorities ought to have consulted with them about the children. That was not done: irrespective of the religious interests the. children were placed in the country families, and to the horror of the priests great numbers of Catholic children were placed with Protestant professing people. The priests have had to scramble for their young, and as the hope of increase of that system is in the increase, of children they are vexed and greatly disturbed.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark178"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark179"></a>Emergency Defense Regulations</span></h4>
<p><span class="font12">• These regulations, issued immediately after the declaration of a state of war, gave very</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">wide powers to the executives of the Government; so wide and so great that an outcry was raised in Parliament about them. Owing to the activities of a few members of Parliament, and the help and activity of the National Council for Civic Liberties, the Government, agreeing that some of the regulations were such as might lead to abuse, agreed to reconsider them, and this they did. A new set has been issued, less obnoxious to the liberty of the subject which has been for so long one. of the greatest of possessions of a British subject. However, it is still possible for a pcr-S* son to be arrested and not brought to trial in open court, and it is still possible for a prejudiced individual to assume an offense against the defense of the realm and bring an innocent person into a very undesirable position.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">• This “prayer” in the National Anthem still holds good! In a form of prayer issued by the two archbishops for the guidance of the parsons, and authoritatively given for church services, a portion reads, “0 Almighty God, King of all kings, and Governor of all things . . . Save and deliver us, we humbly beseech thee, from the hands of our enemies: abate their pride, assuage their malice, and confound their devices . . . that we being armed with thy defence, may be preserved evermore from all perils, to glorify thee.” There are many sections in the whole form of prayer, appointed for the church services, but there is an entire.absence of anything that would indicate acknowledgment that possibly the church or the nation might need some attention by God. It is a self-righteous production.</span></p></li></ul>
<h4><a name="bookmark181"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark182"></a>Stung by th,e Truth</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">• No doubt many were surprised when in the exposition of the Apocalypse, and in the direction of Jehovah’s witnesses, Judge Rutherford showed that the ‘locusts”, and the stinging like that of scorpions, pictured the witnesses tw whom God would send abroad among religionists, and the effect on them as the truth touched them. (See chapter 9 of Revelation.) This same illustration and symbolism God had already given .by his prophet Joel, and in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> this and its effect on religionists have been dealt with and at length. That the leaders of religion are being stung is evident from the noise which many of them are making in their religious newspapers, magazines, and in leaflets circulated in local districts in which “their people” are warned against listening to the truth. The witness to the Word of God which is carried by Jehovah’s witnesses carries no personal vituperation: it is to the fact of the truth in the Word and against the untruths and deceptions which have misled the people and have turned multitudes from belief in the Scriptures as the revelation of God and have brought dishonor to His name. It exposes the falsity of the claims of religionists as represented in the great systems which have been established in the earth and have become one of the main factors of what is called “civilization”. These claim to represent God and in His name to direct the lives of men and nations. The claim is shown to be false, and the warrant of authority whieh they take from selected portions of the Scriptures is assumed from perversions of the texts.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">St. George’s, Yarmouth</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Recently the editor of St. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">George’s</span><span class="font12"> magazine (local to the church) let out a cry showing he and some others have been stung by the witness. The parishioners have been pestered, and the witnesses are pestilential purveyors of blasphemous trash, he says. Instead of acting sensibly and asking himself why a message from the Scriptures is a pest, and then seeking for truth, this would-be instructor of his church’s members speaks evil of those who have sought and those who now seek to carry the enlightenment of the Scriptures, for their benefit, and in doing so to honor God, and at the same time carry out the instruction of Jesus in giving His witness to the kingdom of God now set up in the earth, and the warning that religionists are helping to lead the world to the destruction of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The fact is that these men see their church is in danger if the light of truth is perceived by men of honest mind, and they are not particular as to the means they use to damage the message and the messengers of truth. This church magazine editor cries out that Jehovah’s witnesses are not “orthodox”, which, to a church-minded devotee,.or to their ignorant dupes, is considered a warning sufficient to keep them from “contamination” by the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What Is Orthodoxy? .</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Orthodoxy is the basic errors promulgated in the early days of this “Christian” eira by</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">the false teachers who entered the communities of the disciples of Jesus, and of whom they had been warned by the apostles. It took quite a long time before these errors got really fastened on the professed followers of Christ, but set they became and they have now a strangle hold on religionists of all the varied sections. The chief points of orthodoxy are, the statements that Jesus, the Son of God, is “Very God of very God”, and in this is “equal to the Father”; that the God of the Bible is a trinity of persons; and that every human creature has an immortal soul. These are church fixtures, plainly contrary to the intent and purpose of the Scriptures in their revelation of God and His relationship and purpose toward men, and are in fact those seeds of evil which Jesus said men would sow in the field while the disciples were asleep (see Matthew 13, the parable of the wheat and the tares), and which would be separated from the “wheat” only in the time of harvest, and ■which time is now come. The declaration that the God of the Scriptures is there revealed as existing in a trinity is derogatory to His holy name. This church dogma not only is entirely without warrant, but is contrary to common sense, and not all the thousands of books written to explain it get one bit farther in trying to do so. But a good churchman must believe, and say so, or, according to his creed, he is in danger of being damned. As for the dogma of “the immortality of the soul”, that is foisted on religionists for the purpose of giving the parsons a hold on the people. There is not a word in the Scriptures to give it even a face warrant, and that they know quite well. But what the good folk of orthodoxy do not know is that these dogmas of “trinity” and man’s inherent immortality arc transmissions from paganism, and were hoary with age when so-called “Christianity” accepted them as the basis of church membership.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The editor of St. George’s church magazine is evidently a “good Catholic”, perhaps an “Anglo”, but he is certainly “Roman” in mind; for, like a “good Roman Catholic”, he gives quotations from the “fathers” as authority for his beliefs, making them of authority equal to or 'even greater than the Scriptures themselves. He quotes readily from a recent Boman Catholic publication (from the Bellarmine Society) to help him out, revealing his affinity or association with that section. The parishioners of St. George’s, and all others bound in the same fashion, should shake off these shackles of their creeds, and get the freedom and enlightenment of the truth, and thus get a chance of saving themselves from the destruction hastening on all false systems. They would then learn that “orthodoxy” not only is the evil bondage which binds religion in wrong thinking about God and prevents light from entering the mind, but is the link which binds religion with paganism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Church of Scotland</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Through its “Home Board” the Presbyterians of this church give further evidence of being stung with the truth, and they follow the same lines as other religionists in that they continue to speak evil of it and of those who seek to carry enlightenment to them. For many years it has pleased God to have a people, faithful to His Word, who, enlightened by it, know that the time is come when His judgments are abroad in the earth, the time of which Jesus spoke when He said, 'This gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world, and then shall the end come.’ Religionists must perforce accept these words unless they are of the mind to deny them altogether ; but it pleases them to make the verse refer to some far-off day, hundreds, perhaps thousands of years hence, and after religion has got the world submissive to it. That that day with its judgments can come now is a thought repugnant to them; for they not only have made but little progress towards their end, but are losing grip on men, and the Lord’s coming now would certainly mean that they could give a poor account of their stewardship, and, like the false stewards, must be east aside. There is an even harsher word for them; for Jesus also said of those who had professed to do many mighty works in His name, “I never knew you.” The Home Board of the Church of Scotland, speaking evil of faithful men and women who witness from Jehovah and serve Jesus Christ as disciples, says these are those who make no endeavor to help their fellow men, but are cowards, judged to be that because they make no attempt to tackle the evil in the world in the way the Church of Scotland and its pamphlet writers are supposed to do. The writer of the pamphlet or any of his associates should endeavor to meet any one of the company of Jehovah’s witnesses to discover from personal contact whether dr not he has met a coward. Such a meeting can be arranged at any time the pamphlet writer may choose.</span></p>

The dispatches from Managua, Nicaragua, tell of a child there named Lucifer Satan Adam, in open contempt of the God of the Bible on the part of his parents who so named him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Hard Luck for Dredgers</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Working in San Juan harbor, Puerto Rieo, the United States dredger Orleans dug up about 100 gold coins, which jammed the machinery and cracked some of the joints in the 1,200-foot dredging pipe. The sailors got the coins out and then were warned by the local United States attorney that if they sold them they would be selling United States property and if they kept them they would be liable for hoarding. They could not pass them as legal tender either; for it is unlawful for United States citizens to have even law<sup>F</sup>ful United States gold money in their possession. Uncle Sam has so much gold he does not know what to do with it, and so has billions of it buried back in mother earth from ■which it came.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Bermuda Is a Paradise</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Bermuda is a paradise of 20 inhabited islands and 340 small uninhabited ones, 677 miles southeast of New York. The climate is ideal, never hot and never cold, but it is unsuited to consumptives, because too moist. Everybody who can afford to go to Bermuda likes to go there, because the hotels and beaches are splendid, and there are no automobiles. The inhabited islands are all connected by roads, but if you want to get around you have to use old-style conveyances. The recent governor, Sir Reginald Hilyard, resigned because the Bermuda Assembly would not pass a law permitting him to have an automobile. He felt as though he could not adequately govern the 19 square miles without one. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Japanese Fishermen in the Caribbean</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">♦ Japanese fishermen were to be seen in the Caribbean at the time of the recent American war maneuvers. This is the first time Japanese fishing vessels were reported in the Caribbean.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">A </span><span class="font12" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Calendar</span><span class="font11"> is printed to keep track of days and dates. However, the Society publishes a calendar which is of particular importance to a Christian because it keeps before him the special work that Jehovah ’a witnesses are doing throughout the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Calendar picture is very striking, as it shows the totalitarian rulers, who are grabbing control of all nations, meeting their final destruction and the honest-hearted people rushing to the only place of safety. This picture depicts the text for the year, <sup>1</sup> ‘ My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.”—Psalm 13: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Order your Calendar now because, as a Christian, you will want to keep in close touch with the planned campaigns for 1940, as arranged by Jehovah’s witnesses. The supply of the Calendar is limited and is usually gone before the first month of the year passes. Single copies are 25e; five copies sent to one address, $1.00.</span></p>

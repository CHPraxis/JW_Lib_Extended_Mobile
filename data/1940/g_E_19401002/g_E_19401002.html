<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark31"></a>New York “Post” and “Fifth Column”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font8">HE newspapers of America are tied hand and foot by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and dare not come out in the open and tell the truth, even when they ask for it. This was illustrated in the colloquy between the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font8"> and Judge Rutherford, which terminated in two statements to the public, one from each party,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A lifelong experience with the newspapers and their unfairness toward Christians not connected with any of the sects or cults which number their devotees by the millions, has made Judge Rutherford justly suspicious of the motives of reporters who come seeking interviews. The inevitable object of such reporters is to try to find something they can criticize, or even ridicule, if possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If this statement seems extreme, just get out </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font8"> No. 475 and read the leading article on “Suppression, Distortion and Reversal of News”. See for yourself the story of how an innocent Italian was done to death by a judge and a millionaire, both drunk, and the event was hailed in next morning’s newspaper as an act of justice and a blessing to the community. The object, of course, was to cover the carelessness of a drunken driver who chanced to be both a millionaire and a Roman Catholic. The judge also was a Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After a lifetime of acquaintance with the kind of “service” the newspapers have to offer, and which they always use as a means of underhanded attack of the innocent, Judge Rutherford, at the Detroit convention, made the following public statement of his attitude henceforth toward newspapermen who come to him requesting interviews. He said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">manager of the convention informs me that many reporters for the public press are here and have requested that I give them an interview. Past experiences show that the reporters gather the information, which the paper straightway refuses to print and instead prints many falsehoods against us. If the re</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OCTOBER 2, 1940 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">porters will bring to me a written and signed statement by the editor in charge of their respective papers, which statement promises the publication of what answers I give in answer to their questions, I will answer every question that they propound and grant an interview for this purpose. Otherwise it would be too bad to take up the time of the reporters to speak with them.&quot;</span><span class="font8"> [Tremendous and prolonged applause]</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Experience with the &quot;Post’*</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">The experience with the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Post </span><span class="font8">was of the same general nature and had the result that Jehovah’s people have come to expect. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font8"> asked for information which they never intended to use, and took up the time of one of the busiest men in the world with no other object than to try to find some “dirt” that would be of aid to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Judge Rutherford took the time to answer patiently and adequately the 25 questions submitted. He was under no obligation to do this, and he knew in advance that the seeming frankness and openness was but hypocrisy ; and this turned out to be the case. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font8"> made four articles, the first fair, the next not so good, and so on down to the last, which was nothing but a dirty dig from first to last under the title “Jehovah’s witnesses Ignore Russell, Their Founder”. It will be news to Jehovah’s witnesses that when Jehovah himself said, “Ye are my witnesses,” he was making them followers of any man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some of the ipean “cracks” in the story of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font8"> may be gathered from the headings of the stories: “Jehovah’s witnesses High-Pressure Satan,” “Pale-Face Father Divine,” “Slick in Operation,” “Making the Kill,” “Jehovah’s witnesses Glory in Martyrdom,” “$10 a Month Allowance,” “Plenty of Overtime,” “Profits Run High,&quot; etc.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dear Judge Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As we agreed in. bur telephone conversation yesterday afternoon, I am mailing you herewith a list of questions concerning Jehovah’s Witnesses. I still feel that a personal interview would be mote satisfactory to both of us, but I know that, you are a very busy man and am quite willing to defer to your wishes. It is understood that any, quotation attributed to yon in the articles I intend to write Will be aefibrate and that no.effort will be made to distort ths -meaning of your words. I have retained a copy of my questions and if you retain a copy of your answers, you will be in a position to see that this promise is carried out. ■..</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I have asked a few questions about your interpretation of the Bible and your attitude toward war, religious organisations and other similar matters hbcaiise I have read your book “Salvation” and a number of the Watchtower publications, and I feel that I understand your religious beliefs and their application to present-day events. My questions, as you will see, are divided into threfe categories: 1, the recent attacks upon Jehovah’s Witnesses; 2, the history and growth of your movement; and 3, the direction and finances of the Watchtower organisation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In this third group you will find several broad questions about the finances of the Watchtower society. I hope you will answer them frankly. I have included them because, as I understand your teachings, you hold that religious organizations become materialistic through the acquisition of wealth and that you believe all such organizations to be instruments of Satan. Undoubtedly anything we may publish about Jehovah’s Witnesses will be sharply scrutinized and criticized by the churches, and we feel that we must be prepared with the facte to refute any.charge that Jehovah’s witnesses, while criticizing the churches, has itself built up a large and powerful religious organization, with large rev-eBnes. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ In our conversation you expressed doubts about the, attitude of my superiors, here toward you. I am enclosing a recent editorial from The Post which may convince you that we are nqt unfriendly and that we defend your right to .refuse to salute the flag. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">Mri Malcolm Logan</span><span class="font8"> .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dear Sir:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You have stated to me that the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font8"> has assigned you th get information concerning Jehovah’s witnesses. For the past fifteen years, at the.request of the- public press; I have repeatedly furnished information eoip . eeming the work of our organization, and tbit without any of the facts being published. Frequently the press, would misrepresent what had been stated, making us appear entirely in a different light from what the facts show. For ten years I used on an average 240 radio stations each week, detailing important information to the public. The press ignored , that information. I have been informed by. reporters for the public press-to this effect: “Higher-ups have said to us that nothing shall be published that Rutherford furnishes.” During the past twenty years I have written and published books to the nupiber of ninety-nine and which have been published in seventyeight different languages, and more than three hundred million placed in the hands of the people; yet the public press asks for information. I sometimes wonder what the press tries to find, outside of sensational matters. During the past year I‘have addressed millions of people in various assemblies throughout Europe and America, all of which the press has had notice of but studiously ignored. The reason was very well stated by the managing editor of one of the largest papers in Seattle, Washington, to this effect:: “We know that this copy furnished is the truth, but if we would publish it wa would: have io close our shop. We have so many men. back there Riat belong to the organization thkt hates youthat we could not afford' to publish it,”A^hether I am in Australia, .Europe or America, the same answer comes from tiw representatives of the press, showing a.well-organized determination to keep the people in ignorance of that which menaces the whole world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In view of these facta you can appreciate why I have hesitated to give answers to your questions. I; have nothing to Ipde, of course, but there seems to be no good reason why I should further waste time and energy to</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">, consolAtion </span><span class="font8">furnish information that will not be used for any good purpose, and the public be kept in ignorance of the facts, so far as the public press is concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This acknowledges your letter of the 12th inst., enclosing a list of questions which you have propounded. I have decided to briefly answer these questions. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font8"> will not publish what I have to say, of course, but I make this request: that the answers which I am giving here to the questions propounded may be put in the morgue of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Post,</span><span class="font8"> and any other public paper that wishes a copy, and when the terrible conditions that now obtain in Europe have come to America, that the managing editor may open the morgue and read these answers, and then never be able to say: “We had no notice that these things were coming?’ 1 feel that this is an opportunity to serve notice, once and for all, upon the public press, not for my benefit, but because it appears to be a public necessity and a duty to be performed by anyone who has the facts at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">My answers to your questions necessarily must briefly cover the points. For detailed proof I refer you to the books and booklets which I have written, and which contain ah abundance of proof. I have at hand much more proof that has not been published, and which the public press would not publish if it had an opportunity. And now referring,to your questions by number:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">(1) Why, in your opinion, has there been a sudden recent outburst of violence against Jehovah’s witnesses in widely separated parts of the country?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer ; Because the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, operating what they call “Catholic Action”, are carrying out a well-laid scheme to destroy everything in this world that publishes the truth, and this the Hierarchy are doing in order to camouflage their own wicked action in attempting to grab control of the nations of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, operated from Vatican City, Rome, have permeated every part of every nation under the sun. Their objective is to establish again the old “Holy Roman Empire”. The Nazis, Fascists and Communists are all for a Corporate State and all determined to destroy republics. The “Hierarchy of Authority” of the Catholic system are working with these totalitarians tb rule the earth. The Hierarchy claim they are divinely authorized to rule the earth and that</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OCTOBER 2, 1940 </span><span class="font8">therefore the Hierarchy will act as the “spiritual overlord” of the nations of earth, ruled by dictators. If you would read volumes One and Two of my book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font8"> there you would find an abundance of evidence to this effect. Again, the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font8"> contains much more information. A book published by an exCatholic priest, E. Boyd Barrett, entitled “Rome Stoops to Conquer”, contains also an abundance of information showing that the Hierarchy are really a political organfeation, bent on destroying everything that, represents the interests of the common people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The real “fifth column” in America is organized and carried on by “Catholic Action”. The facts prove this to be true with what has recently come to pass in Europe. All along the Mexican border “Catholic Action” has planted its Nazi representatives and allies. The same is true along the border of Quebec, and the recent outbursts of violence against Jehovah’s; witnesses have come from those points. In this mob violence public officials, sheriffs, police officers, prosecuting attorneys and others have acted in conjunction with the Catholic priests to launch a vicious attack upon Jehovah’s witnesses. Everybody who knows Jehovah’s witnesses knows that they are against the totalitarian state. No one organization has published as much against Nazism, Fascism and Communism as the. Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, of which I am the president. The publication of these facts has greatly angered the Hierarchy, and the Hierarchy are determined to crush all of Jehovah’s witnesses. Maliciously the Hierarchy have charged Jehovah’s witnesses with being of the “fifth column”, well knowing that they are lying, and they are doing it for the very purpose of camouflaging their own wick-, edness in their attempt to deceive the people, while they further the “Catholic Action” in America. When the time comes, andjhat seems to be in the near future, it will be found that there are at least ten million “fifth columnists”' in America, and that ninety percent of these are under the absolute control of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In 1938 I delivered an address on “Face the Facts” at Royal Albert Hall, London^ and which was transmitted by radio to almost all the earth. In numerous states in the United States Catholic priests, together with their radical element under their control; attempted to prevent this address from being delivered</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5 by radio or transmitted to halls. If you will read the booklet </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font8"> you will readily see the reason why. Shortly thereafter I delivered an address in New York city, which was transmitted by radio to many other states in America, and the Catholic priests attempted to break up those meetings. On June 25, 1939, I delivered a public address at Madison Square Garden, and the Catholic Hierarchy, together with Nazi representatives, attempted - to break up that meeting, as well as others throughout the country that were connected by land wires. If you will read my lectures “Fascism or Freedom” and “Government and Peace” you will find an abundance of evidence supporting the foregoing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Hierarchy repeatedly have coerced radio stations in America to prevent me from speaking to the ’public. The answer, therefore, to your first question, in brief, is this: The outburst of violence against Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the United States that, took place about the time the decision was handed down by the Supreme Court on the flag-saluting case from Pennsylvania in every instance was started and carried on by “Catholic Action”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">(2) Have you been able to identify the persons inciting violence as members of any particular group?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer: Yes, without any question of doubt. We have photographs of mob violence being led by Catholic priests. Priests have appeared in magistrates’ courts in Texas and testified that they sent their representatives to drive Jehovah’s witnesses out of the town. More detailed information has been furnished to the Department of Justice at Washington.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">(3) Have you appealed for protection to the Civil Liberties Division of the Department of Justice, and, if so, has any help been promised ?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer : The American Civil Liberties organization has voluntarily taken up the fight of Jehovah’s witnesses, and the Bureau of Department of Justice is now interesting itself concerning the same; the F.B.I. is also duly informed. Action is awaited.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">(4) In newspaper stories from Del Rio, Texas, and Kennebunk, Maine, it appeared that an effort was being made to label Jehovah’s witnesses as Nazi or Communist sympathizers. All your publications which I have' read emphatically show that you are opposed to all such dictatorships. Why do you think</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">this attempt to distort your position is being made ? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer: Tn each of the towns named by you in the fourth question, an effort has been made to label Jehovah’s witnesses as Nazis or Communist sympathizers. This is another scheme of “Catholic Action”. In doing this they well know that they are lying. Not one word can be found in any of our publications, or amongst the utterances of any of our people, that we have sympathy with Nazis or Communists. On the contrary, there is an abundance of publication from our organization showing that Nazis, Catholics, Communists and Fascists are working together.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">(5) Do you feel that there is any general plan in the acts against Jehovah’s witnesses, since most of these have started with an attempt to force members to salute the flag ?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer: It has always been the scheme of the Devil, as disclosed by history, to begin on the outskirts and bring his forces against the stronghold of righteousness. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy are the chief instrument on earth of the Devil. The compulsory flag saluting by school children was instigated under the direction of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the purpose being to destroy the liberties of the people. It was begun in 'a subtle way apparently for patriotic reasons, but the re&amp;l reason is to break down liberty of conscience and liberty of thought and liberty to worship. For more than 150 years honest people of America have obeyed the laws represented by the flag, and that, without being compelled to salute. The Catholic Hierarchy well know' the position of real Christians concerning the bowing down to images and the saluting of any flag, and, knowing this, the Hierarchy have seized upon compulsory flag saluting as another means of accomplishing their purpose and discrediting, browbeating and coercing every person who stands for liberty of conscience, liberty of worship. It is only necessary to refer to the book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Inside Europe,</span><span class="font8"> by John Gunther, and the book by E. ' Boyd Barrett, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Rome Stoops to Conquer,</span><span class="font8"> to get an abundance of evidence outside of what Jehovah’s witnesses have published, showing that Catholics and Nazis are working together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I spent much time in Germany from 1922 to 1934. I observed the gradual development, of Nazism under Catholic direction there. I have observed the same method carried out in America. “Catholic Action” together with </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">consolation</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Nazis has destroyed all liberty in Europe. It is going to do the same thing in America!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Let this be distinctly understood: that, when I speak of “Catholic Action”, I have no reference to the people who practice the Catholic religion conscientiously. There are millions of such honest and sincere people. It is only the ambitious, devilish representatives in the Hierarchy organization that arc determined to rule the earth contrary to the will of God and against the interests of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You probably noticed a United Press dispatch from Berlin, published about the 6th of this month, and which states: “Berlin, June 6th.—Special meetings of the Boman Catholic bishops throughout Germany have resulted in a decision to hold thanksgiving masses for the German victory in Belgium and Flanders, it was reported today.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This shows that occasionally a little truth leaks out that “Catholic Action” is supporting Nazis and Fascists, regardless of how much injury may result to the common Catholic people. The population of Belgium is largely Catholic, and yet the Hierarchy connive with Nazis to destroy that people in order to get control of the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It might be interesting to note that Mussolini declared war against France June 10. On the same date a paper was issued by the American Legion, announcing that the time had come when the Legion must take “summary” action. At the same time riots began and summary action was begun along the Mexican border in Texas, and along Quebec border in Maine. For instance, in Texas, in one prison room ninety men, women and children of Jehovah’s witnesses were thrown in prison, kept there twenty-four hours without food or water, and not even a place to sit down. They were then taken from the jail and driven along a railroad track in the heat, with representatives of “Catholic Action” and American Legion marching on the road beside them, deriding them and not permitting them to stop for refreshments. Many of them fainted. At the same time those that were heckling Jehovah’s witnesses and marching them were howling “Heil, Hitler”. At the same time the riots broke out in Maine, the so-called representatives of the American Legion, and also those of “Catholic Action”, mobbed Jehovah’s witnesses, broke into their houses and burned down the houses in which some of Jehovah’s witnesses resided. Most of the American press either remains silent or speaks in a sarcastic</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OCTOBER 2. 1940 </span><span class="font8">way of Jehovah’s witnesses, as though they were some criminals, and this is done at the instance of influential ones connected with the public press and who are acting under the command of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">(6) Do you attribute the troubles to a rise in the martial spirit in the country?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer: Emphatically, No! These troubles do not rise because of the martial spirit in America. The military organization of America is not interested in compelling school children or others to salute the flag. I refer you to the article published by General Moss, Chap. 14, entitled “Patriotism of the Flag”, in which he says: “Another form that false patriotism frequently takes is so-called ‘Flagworship’—blind and excessive adulation of the Flag as an emblem or image,—super-punet iliousness and meticulosity in displaying and saluting the Flag—without intelligent and sincere understanding and appreciation of the ideals and institutions it symbolizes. This, of course, is but a form of idolatry—a sort of ‘glorified idolatry’, so to speak. When patriotism assumes this form it is nonsensical and makes the ‘patriot’ ridiculous.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Hierarchy have seized upon the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States concerning flag saluting, and which applies only to little children, as an effort to discredit Jehovah's witnesses. The Hierarchy do not wish to know the truth as to the position taken by Jehovah’s witnesses. In that case of Gobitis the American Bar Association filed a Brief and also the American Civil Liberties filed a Brief, as friends of the court, setting forth the reasons why compulsory flag saluting, even in schools, is wrong. As to the position of Jehovah’s witnesses I refer you to the Brief which I filed in that case, and the argument which I made before the Supreme Court; and the position that I took in behalf of Jehovah’s witnesses is exactly the position taken by Wm. Penn when he fled from Europe and founded the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. “Catholic Action” knows this, but the Hierarchy deliberately lie, exactly as the Lord foretold they would lie. I refer you to the prophecy of Isaiah, chapter 28, verses 14-18 inclusive, which, without a question of doubt, refers to the Catholic Hierarchy organization as the one composed of scornful men and who say: “We have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Results: Here I am going to venture what will be the result of this fanatical, devilish pro-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">7</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">cedure to destroy democracies, destroy. freedom of press and freedom of speech, and destroy all publishers of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I base my conclusion, not upon human wisdom. I do not claim to have any inspiration higher than others who are devoted to the Lord. I base my conclusion upon the Word of Almighty God, which is true. Prophecies were written long ago and could not be understood until in course of fulfillment. Now the Lord has brought about the physical facts and brought them to the attention of men who are devoted to Him, and it is easy to be seen what will be the result. Based upon this authority, I stated in a public address in Paris more than three years ago that the Nazis and Fascists would overrun France. That has been accomplished. I stated in a public address in Berne, Switzerland, that the Nazis and Fascists would in time grab Switzerland. Watch for that to be accomplished in the near future. At a public address in London, which was transmitted throughout the British Empire, and was delivered in 1938, I stated that the Nazis and Fascists were bent upon destroying the British Empire, and that that would be accomplished. The Nazis have planted their agents.throughout the earth. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy have planted their men in every big newspaper office in America, and their men in every department of the government of the United States. Their purpose is to seize the government of the United States, as Holland and other countries have , been seized. I ask you now to refer to the booklet </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom.,</span><span class="font8"> page 14, under the subtitle of “America”, and read there what Catholic priest O’Brien has to say about grabbing America in 1940, and mark at the same time how these are coming to pass, showing that O’Brien, in a measure, announced the purpose of the Hierarchy. That booklet, together with </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace,</span><span class="font8"> contains considerable information on this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You may expect totalitarian dictators, acting with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, to overrun the earth, seize control of almost all the nations, if not all, and rule them fora short season, and then will follow the worst trouble that this earth has ever known. Based upon divine prophecy, briefly this will be the result: The big religious institution, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, acting with dictators, will say: “We have accomplished our purpose. We are now at peace, and we are safe.” Then the Lord will take a hand. Christ Jesus will lead the forces invisible to human eyes, and there shall result the battle of Armageddon, “the battle of that great day of God Almighty,” which will completely clean up the earth of wickedness and destroy everybody that willfully practices wickedness. Jesus described that battle as <sup>(</sup>a time of tribulation such as never was’. (Matthew 24:21,22) The prophet Jeremiah describes it specifically in the 25th chapter. You will read these with some profit and interest. Other prophecies describe that great and terrible time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The United States was established as a Christian nation, not as a religious nation. It was established by men who loved God and His Kingdom, and who prayed and worked for righteousness. The Supreme Court of the United States, in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Church</span><span class="font8"> vs. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">United States, </span><span class="font8">explicitly stated: “This is a Christian nation.” Other decisions support that conclusion. The fundamental law writers have so stated. What, however, is the situation today? Every nation under the sun is against Jehovah God and against Christ Jesus His King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Kentucky six men are now under arrest, charged with treason, the evidence being that they “advocate a government by one Jehovah God”. I cite this as merely one instance. The evidence is too numerous to go into detail. I refer you now to the declaration of Jehovah God himself, recorded in Psalm 9:17: “The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses are not a sect, not a religious organization. They are in the class of faithful men mentioned in the eleventh chapter of Hebrews; whose sole purpose is to inform the people of God’s purpose to establish a righteous government on the earth, and ip obedience to God’s commandment to warn the people of the impending disaster upon the nations. America, with the other nations, is in for the worst trouble it has ever had, and the ones most reprehensible for bringing that trouble upon America are those men who compose the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which men have hypocritically claimed to represent God, but who, in fact, represent the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The American press will not publish the truth because the press is either owned or controlled by the power and influence of the Hierarchy and allies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses obey every law of the land that is not in conflict with God’s law. They are for Almighty God and Christ Jesus.. They do no injury to anyone. They have nothing against individuals because of their religion. They simply tell the truth in order that the people might find the way of escape. They are hated by the Devil and all the Devil’s agencies. The Hierarchy are in the same class as the Pharisees, to whom Jesus addressed His words in John 8:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Escape : There is but one means of escape from the terrible trouble that is coming upon the earth in the very near future, and that is the Kingdom of Jehovah God under Christ Jesus, which Kingdom is The Theocracy, because it is the government of the great Theocrat. No one in America or any other nation will escape that terrible condition of distress, resulting from Armageddon, except those who seek the Lord God and who devote themselves to Jehovah and to Christ Jesus His King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I sound this warning now, and let the press put it in their morgue and take it out when it is desired. God has declared that they shall all know that He is the Most High. Honest and sincere Catholies, Protestants, Jews and others who desire righteousness and life will abandon all religious institutions and put themselves under the protection of Almighty God and Christ Jesus. There is no other means of escape.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">(10) How long have you been active in the movement? Please include a brief biographical sketch.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer : More than thirty years. The Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society has been in existence for more than sixty years. It is merely a corporation, acting as publishers for Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">(11) How many copies of your books have been sold? How many copies of your phonograph records ?

<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer: Books and booklets published in 78 and more languages, in /he hands of the people, to the number of more than 300 million copies.

<p><span class="font8">(15) We understand that at one time you bought time on many radio stations blit that </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OCTOBER 2, 1240 </span><span class="font8">you do not do so now. Is this because any group forced commercial stations to keep you off?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer: It seems passing strange that a big public newspaper should ask such a question. It is well known that for more than ten years I used over 240 radio stations every week. It is well known that more than two million people protested against the efforts of the Hierarchy trying to put me off the air. This Petition, signed by two and one-half million people, was presented to Congress. In 1937 I voluntarily withdrew from national broadcasting for the reason as stated in my speech delivered at that time and published. I was not put off the air by the Catholic organization.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">(16) When did you adopt the name “Jehovah’s witnesses”, and what were you called before then?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer: Jehovah’s witnesses have been on earth as an organization for more than 5,000 years. (See Isaiah 43:10-12; Hebrews 11th chapter; John 18:37.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All true Christians are Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">(17) How many members in Germany have been imprisoned or executed for refusing to acknowledge the supremacy of the Nazi state ?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer: More than 6,000 imprisoned by Nazi-Catholic action, and many of them shot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Answers to your questions 18 to 22 inclusive contained in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font8"> above mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">(23) Doreceipts from the books copyrighted in your name go to you or to the Society?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Answer : Books are copyrighted in my name and the copyright transferred to the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, the only consideration being that the publications be put in the hands of the people at the least possible cost. I do not receive any royalty whatsoever. All work of the organization of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is done in the interest of making known the truth. All the workers receive,their food and housing, with a nominal allowance of $10.00 per month for incidental expenses. All the income is voluntary contributions. The donations received for the books and booklets are less than the cost of'publication. The deficit is made up by voluntary contributions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In answer to your questions about the money of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, we own a small amount of property, which is mortgaged. We spend all the money we get to make known the truth of God’s Kingdom and to try to help the<sup>1</sup> people. There</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">is no individual who reaps a financial or pecuniary profit from the Society or its work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Referring to finances, why does the press not publish the truth concerning the material wealth of the Roman Catholic organization? At Vatican City there is stored more gold than in any other place on earth, and this has been extracted from the people by claims that prayers for the dead can help them, and by other wrongful means. Throughout the earth the Hierarchy own more property than any other ■ institution. This is particularly true with reference to America. The Hierarchy are supported in great luxury, the money being extracted from the poor upon wrong representation as to the ability of the clergy to intercede with Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Hierarchy have builded tremendous and expensive structures throughout the United States. They are a military organization. In their cellars or crypts are stored a ' great number of guns and ammunition ready to act against all opponents in due season, -their opponents being classed as those who publish the truth about them, and also all who stand for freedom in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Why not let the public press demand of Congress an investigation of the cellars and crypts of the Catholic cathedrals in the United States and prove to the public whether or not ' they have stored away a great amount of arms and ammunition to use against the government ? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Why not the Dies Committee go after the Hierarchy and the Nazis? If the Hierarchy deny that they have a large amount of guns and ammunition stored, then they should not object to being investigated. If they do vigorously deny it, that is the best reason why an investigation should be had. There are many persons in the United States who have worked in building these crypts or cellars, and others who have helped unload what appeared to be piano boxes, which were filled with rifles and are stored in these crypts. I am not interested in carrying out such an investigation, because my time and energy must be used to advertising God's Kingdom, the only means of blessing of humankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If the public press is so interested in getting at the facts, then institute a search and investigation</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> DISCLOSING WHO ARK . THE REAL </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">enemies of American institutions. The time will come in the very near future when the Lord himself will pull the shroud completely off those hiding behind the “refuge of lies”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">10</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">and disclose a great and hypocritical religious institution that has defamed His name and devoted its power to unrighteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Onee more let me say that the only means of escape from the terrible troubles of Armageddon, and the only place of safety and the means of life, is in God’s Kingdom. Note the declaration of the Lord in the prophecy of Zephaniah 2; 1-3 and Zephaniah 3:8,9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If you desire further information, call at the Society’s publication office, 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, and see Mr. N. H. Knorr. Our publications are open to all who desire information. We are not trying to get members. We are informing the people. We know from God’s Word what will be the result. The persecution by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy does not deter us in our efforts to make known the truth. The Hierarchy are doing everything that is within their power to prevent our organization from having a convention this year. Doubtless the press will ignore that, instead of standing for freedom of press and freedom of assembly and freedom of worship of all, which the Constitution guarantees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Respectfully submitted,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">P.S. Convention : Since dictating the above I have received a message from Columbus, Ohio, which shows further vicious Roman “Catholic Action”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Columbus had invited Jehovah’s witnesses to hold their annual convention there in July. In three previous years our conventions have been held there, greatly to the pleasure of Columbus. The invitation was accepted and a contract signed by the State Fair Association for the use of the Fair Grounds July 24-28. Business men, hotel managers, and the majority of the citizens, enthusiastically supported the coming of the convention there. From thirty to fifty thousand persons would attend, from every part of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hierarchy Action: Bishop Hartley, </span><span class="font8"><sup>c£</sup>Rev-ercnd Father” Murphy, the Knights of Columbus, and others of Columbus have brought pressure to bear on the Fair management to repudiate the contract for the use of the Fair Grounds. Their purpose, of course, is to prevent any speech concerning the Word of God, and to crush the only people in the United States that are standing firmly for the fundamental principles of the Constitution for free-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">consolation </span><span class="font8">dom of worship, freedom of speech, and freedom of press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Nazi-Hierarchy influence is so great in America that public assembly and freedom of speech and press can be shut down anywhere, even as Hague did it in New Jersey, and as Hitler and Mussolini have done all over Europe and are intending to do in the United States with the co-operation of the ROMAN CATHOLIC HIERARCHY.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Will the public press remain silent? I presume so! Next will be the complete control of the press and speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses are not complaining, but sounding the warning. Krom Divine Prophecy, recorded long ago in the Bible, we know what will be the result. The American people must awake to the great danger that noxy threatens. For further information about cancellation of convention, eall N. H. Knorr, Triangle 5-1474, Brooklyn. Because Jehovah’s witnesses are vigorously fighting for the principles of righteousness and the opportunity to inform the people of the great impending danger, the Nazi-Hierarchy crowd are trying to silence them. If the public press wishes to co-operate with them, that is its privilege.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Further Evidence</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Following up the above closing suggestion, we have obtained further information from the vice-president of the Watchtower, upon which the following is based:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The proposed Columbus assembly was advertised as the “THEOCRATIC Convention of Jehovah’s witnesses”. This is the first time in American history or world history that a “Theocratic” convention was ever projected. Jehovah is the great Theocrat, His promised Government by Christ Jesus the King is Theocratic, and this advertised convention is for the purpose of announcing more' intensively to all America that Theocratic Government for the blessing of all people of good will toward God. That very fact dissociates this convention and the conventibners from al] worldly things political and secular, and absolutely rules out, debars, and precludes all “fifth column&quot; connections and activities, which fifth column is worldly and political and bent on ruling the world in opposition to Jehovah’s Theocratic Government. Hence those who are back of all the opposition which is concertedly made against the holding of this Theocratic Convention at Columbus brand themselves as either the allies or tools of the “fifth column”,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">OCTOBER 8, 1940 </span><span class="font8">or even the “fifth column&quot; themselves, who try to throw off suspicion from themselves by falsely accusing innocent men and women who are a small minority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Who, then, is back of the effort to break up this Theocratic event at Columbus, Ohio? Judge Rutherford boldly names the Roman CatMlic Hierarchy, who must bring the United States under the control of the Vatican if they are to gain their objective of ruling the whole world, particularly “Christendom”, with the pope as the temporal and spiritual lord thereof. Bishop Hartley has not forgotten that the Watch Tower Society has sued him for $100,000 damages because he exercised his power and influence to cause Columbus radio station WBNS to break its contract to broadcast the speeches of Judge Rutherford. One of the priests under his hierarchical jurisdiction is the said “Father” Murphy. Sworn affidavits bear out that this priest visited the business manager of the Convention Bureau of the Columbus Chamber of Commerce during May, after learning that Jehovah’s witnesses would convene at the Fair Grounds, and he used every argument to try to discredit them so as to adversely influence the Chamber • of Commerce. He then used his influence upon the State Fair manager to instigate his cancellation of the contract for their use of the Grounds. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Catholic priesthood do not exercise the American spirit and show consideration for the will and desire &lt;!f the people. The hotel, newspaper, food supply, and othpr business men, and the common people, wanted the convention. But the Roman Catholic Hierarchy did not want the convention. To whom did the political arm of the state yield, to the people whom it is sworn to serve, or to Roman organized religion? Director Brown of the State’s Department of Agriculture and Manager Kinnan of the State Fair Association arbitrarily canceled the contract.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Brown and Kinnan offered as excuse for their action, not the real reason, Catholic Action, but the fear of “disturbances”. Granted that “disturbances” were feared, are there no State police in Ohio to call on for protection of orderly, peaceful Americans in the exer-eise of their right of assembly and of worship of Almighty God ? Does Governor Brieker use that kind of argument in the case of a strike of laborers against employers and forbid the strike? Fear of riot or disturbance does not empower any official to break contract and</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">U</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">debar Americans from the exercise of con st i' tutional rights and liberties. This has been affirmed by the unanimous decision of the United States Supreme Court, of May 20, 1940, in the ease of three of Jehovah's witnesses vs, the State of Connecticut.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All America was to be specially eonvenienced so as to be able to take advantage of this convention and to hear .fudge Rutherford’s public . speech on “Religion as a World Remedy—-The Evidence in Support Thereof”, July 28, More than thirty other cities on the American continent and the Hawaiian Islands were to be tied in by private land wires direct to the State Fair Grounds at Columbus, making it one simultaneous nation-wide assembly. It was so advertised. At once Catholic Action started working.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">El Paso, Texas. Here Jehovah’s witnesses contracted for free use of Liberty Hall. Why ' has now the County Commissioners Court revoked its order granting free use of the Hall ? Again it is a case of those busybodies in other men’s affairs, those deniers to others of their rights and liberties under federal and state constitutions. One Catholic priest, Schuler, bishop of El Paso, wrote to the County Commissioners Court to “express my abhorrence” of allowing Jehovah’s witnesses free use of Liberty Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Bishop Schuler does not understand what intolerance means. He speaks in condemnation of “the ignorant intolerance of Jehovah’s witnesses”. Outspoken, published criticism of one political party by another opposing political party, and a free and open condemnation of political policies of one'party by another, this is not intolerance; not here in America, not here to Americans who “can take it” and who have not sworn spiritual allegiance to a foreign potentate, who is head of a religious organization and also ruler of a temporal state, which spiritual allegiance is superior to and more obligatory than any civil or na- tional allegiance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Intolerance</span><span class="font8"> does not mean the exercise of the American right of free speech; it does not mean honest, sincere criticism which is based upon the Holy Bible and which is against the published beliefs, opinions and doctrines of other individuals, parties, and organizations, religious or otherwise. Intolerance in fact means the limiting, hindering and suppressing of the rights and liberties of individuals and organizations to freely express themselves differently from and in disagreement with and</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">12</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">in opposition to others as to belief and opinion. Jesus was not intolerant when He roundly denounced the religious priests and clergy.of His day as hypocrites, serpents, robbers of widows, sons of the Devil. The intolerant ones were the religious clergymen who had Jesus’ mouth silenced by murder. Intolerance is what Bishop Schuler and the Roman Catholic priesthood are practicing in this instant ease. Judge Rutherford has never suppressed them. In 1936 he proposed that there be a public hearing of the teachings of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy over a nation-wide radio network, through a radio debate, an elevated official of the Hierarchy to defend their teachings and Judge Rutherford to present the Bible , argument, he and his friends to bear half the expense of this radio hookup, to let all Americans hear both sides and decide for themselves what is truth. Over 2,600,000 signed a Petition demanding this debate, and in November, 1936, the Petition was presented at Washington, D.C. But the Roman Catholic Hierarchy of America have never responded. Jehovah’s witnesses have never tried to break up meetings of Catholics, as Catholics and American Legionnaires did recently in Texas and California and in other places in America. Jehovah’s witnesses have never tried to pre- . vent or interfere with meetings of Roman Catholics ot other religionists, either directly or indirectly or under cover. Their criticism has been voiced and circulated openly, publicly and aboveboard, and not by use of secret, undercover pressure upon the politicians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It would be well for the members of the El Paso posts of the American Legion and of the Veterans of Foreign Wars who joined Bishop Schuler in protesting to the County Commissioners Court to read Texas’ declaration of independence from Mexico. They would learn something as to what it means to be real Texans and Americans. Let them note this.:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The unanimous Declaration of Independence made by the delegates of the people of Texas in general convention assembled, March 2,1836, in its first paragraph condemns the Catholic government from which it broke loose and associates despotism .with “the priesthood-—both the eternal enemies of civil liberty, the ever-ready minions of power, and the usual instruments of tyrants”. In the third paragraph it speaks of “the combined despotism of the sword and the priesthood”. In its twelfth paragraph. it says of that Catholic government: “It denies us the right of wor-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">consolation </span><span class="font8">shipping the Allmighty according to the dictates of our own conscience ; by the support of a national religion calculated to promote the temporal interest of its human functionaries rather than the glory of the true and living God.” Thus the Texans that signed that Declaration were witnesses of Jehovah, who is that “true and living God”. If those Texas signers were alive here today they would show the Department of Justice and the FBI where the “fifth column” are located and W<sup>F</sup>ho they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pueblo, Colorado. Here the Elks Lodge, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, and the American Legion have protested to the City Council against granting the City Auditorium for the Theocratic Convention. One member of a committee of five, just appointed by the local American Legion post to investigate “fifth column” and un-American activities, told the Watchtower representative that there are two factions in the Legion there; one faction, the better element, believes Jehovah’s witnesses are all right; the other element is controlled by the Catholic Hierarchy. That, he said, is the element that is trying to prevent Jehovah’s witnesses’ convention there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All this helps to make clear who is stirring up the mob violence against Jehovah’s witnesses, numerous cases of which are regularly reported in the news. This occasioned a protest by the United States Solicitor General, Francis Biddle, Sunday night, June 16. Speaking over a network of the National Broadcasting System, he pledged the Department of Justice to sec to it that the rights of free speech, worship and assembly were protected. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy must gnash their teeth with chagrin at his exoneration of Jehovah’s people, when the Solicitor General said; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Jehovah’s witnesses have been repeatedly set upon and beaten. They had committed no crime; but the mob adjudged they had, and meted out mob punishment. The Attorney General has ordered an immediate investigation of these outrages. There is no cause for mass hysteria, no justification for mob violence.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Honest, order-loving Americans of good will are grateful for these timely words, and will refuse to lend themselves to any religious incitement to mob violence and anarchy directed against Jehovah’s witnesses and in opposition to The Theocratic Government. ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; &nbsp;&nbsp;:</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Monessen Wants More</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">M</span><span class="font8">ONESSEN, Pa., already infamous for its mistreatment of Jehovah’s witnesses (see </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden</span><span class="font8"> Ape No. 452), has not had enough attention. It wants more. The school board met and solemnly and unanimously decided that little children who revere God more than any earthly power must violate their consciences by saluting the flag and that if they fail to do so they are to be turned over to the police. The intent is to make them submissive, like the little Italian Balilla under Mussolini or the Hitler Youth under the Maniac of Berchtesgaden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Monessen board distinguished itself on the same occasion by passing a resolution that all employees of the city must be residents of the city, and then, within a few<sup>r</sup> minutes, appointed a sehool physician who was </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font8"> a resident of the city. Monessen is eager to prove to the world that it always has been inconsistent, is inconsistent now, and intends to be inconsistent -forever. Its “forever” will end at Armageddon, and is at the door.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Concerning the jailing of women and children in Texas because they believe as do Jehovah’s witnesses, the Dallas </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Journal of</span><span class="font8"> June .4 said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When we were at war, we jailed conscientious objectors who wouldn’t respond to the draft with an oath to fight for their country. But we did not extend the action to women and children who thought as did those men who wouldn’t fight. Those citizens who do violence to or threaten violence to these groups of religious zealots are themselves the ones who violate the constitution and the law. There is no law against speaking against war. There is no law compelling a salute to the flag— which is no idol, but a symbol of democracy. There is no law against putting religious belief above all else. There is in Germany and Russia, but not here. Moreover, saluting the flag will not make a patriot out of a religious zealot. Putting his women and children in jail will not make him want to fight</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">13</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">for his country. In our stand for patriotism, loyalty to our country and its principles, we are inconsistent and actually lawbreakers if we hold people without warrant and compel action which the law does not demand. Surely you can’t salute the flag with one hand and slap down a citizen who disagrees with you with the other,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Speaking of Jehovah’s witnesses, the St-Louis </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Star-Times</span><span class="font8"> comments 4m the fact that they have been harried, mobbed and terrorized from Texas to Maine without effective protection by law, and wants to know:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Have freedom of assembly and freedom of the press been canceled out, so that public officials can doubt their duty to defend such a minority in the exercise of peaceful activities t</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It ia too bad for Monessen that the St. Louis </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Star-Times</span><span class="font8"> is not published there, so that a few of the inhabitants might get the correct idea of what it is that makes an American.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Herald Tribune</span><span class="font8"> of June 13 harked back to the better and nobler days of its early history when it said that because of their flag decision (that little folks must place the country first and God second—not stated in just those words, but meaning just that to the &quot;common people)—</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We have the “liberal” members of the Supreme Court to thank—at least in part-—for the religious riots which have been breaking out in Maine. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If the Supreme Court did not see that their decision on flag saluting would have the effect of starting riots against Jehovah’s witnesses all over the country, then they did not have the discernment of the vioiousness of religionists which every one of Jehovah's witnesses has been made to clearly understand. It is that decision that made the Monessen school board so brutal and hypocritical.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>What About Lawless Police?</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">The question has yet to be settled as to what is to be done in America about police who break both the laws of God and the laws of the land. Iowa City, Iowa, has such police. In violation both of the Supreme law of Jehovah God and of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, they arrested and fingerprinted Christian men and women under a null and void ordinance. If the matter is pushed, these police can be fined and imprisoned for their activities against Jehovah’s witnesses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the Bridgeport </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Post,</span><span class="font8"> June 15, H. J. Wiley, apparently an old-style, hardheaded, down-East Yankee, writes comically that the ■ decision of the Supreme Court has put every American’s soul under the supervision of the State, and that now, since there is no law on the subject, “any group of fanatics in public office can make you salute” and “can make you stand on your head if they want to”. He then gets down to brass tacks with this common-sense statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In spite of the Supreme Court decision it appears that this compulsory flag-saluting business is unconstitutional. A study of the Constitution seems to indicate that it was designed for the express purpose of protecting the liberty of the individual to think for himself, work for himself and bargain for himself in the exchange of goods and labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the new patriotism of the flag-salut-ers gets under full headway this man will probably find himself in a concentration camp along with Jehovah's witnesses, and wouldn’t be such bad company, even at that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Chicago </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span><span class="font8"> showed considerable courage in its statement that— &nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Roosevelt has created a court which resolves doubts against the citizen and for the coercive state. It is a Supreme Court which believes that the bureaucrats are almost always right and the individual is almost always wrong. That kind of court can be called socialist, but it should never be called liberal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ This statement, be it noted, was made with reference to the decision on the flag salute, in the Gobitis case, which decision at once put all Jehovah's witnesses on the spot at the hands of Vatican and other religious fanatics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The police of Tillamook, Oregon, seem to have taken their stand with the lawless. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Oregon Journal</span><span class="font8"> mentions the gathering “quietly at 2: 30 p.m.” of a mob of 50 persons that without a shadow of right or legality ordered four of Jehovah’s witnesses, two men, a woman and a girl, out of town. It would have been everyway as lawful (more so, in fact) if the witnesses had stood their ground and ordered the unlawful mob to leave town. Of course, that was impractical and the witnesses had to yield temporarily. But one wonders what Tillamook does for police. Do they receive salaries! and if so, for what ? Why stomach lawless and indifferent police that allow or encourage “quic’t” mobs to act lawlessly?</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">One woman said that the American Legion had run members of the group out of town about a week ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A woman resident said that she had phoned the police and had been told that “the Legipn and others are out rounding them up”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These are two sentences from the “Special to the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times”,</span><span class="font8"> dated at Litchfield, June 16. They speak for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Emporia (Kans.) </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Gazette, </span><span class="font8">June 17, calls for shame on the mobsters at Litchfield that by their lawlessness did much more to trample the flag in the dirt than they could otherwise possibly have done. “For the flag, first, last and always, stands for laws and not for mobs.” The St. Louis </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Star-Times</span><span class="font8"> of same date said that “Litchfield’s action was shameless and un-American&quot;. The women, the Legion and the priests that pulled off the Litchfield stunt had better take note.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the beating up of Jehovah’s witnesses 15 men were taken away from police in front of the jail itself, says the St. Louis </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Globe-Democrat,</span><span class="font8"> and four of them suffered broken ribs and one a broken nose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Rawlins, Wyoming, is desirous to appear in the same category as Litchfield, Sodom, Gomorrah, 'Chorazin and Bethsaida. The Associated Press states that on June 18 two of Jehovah’s witnesses (the AP dispatch does not use that term, but, in order to encourage further mob violence, uses the derisive and contemptuous term “religious sect leaders”) were beaten and their automobile and trailer were tipped over and burned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Belleville, Illinois, Mayor George Rem-snider in some manner confused himself with the Deity and stated that as long as he remained chief executive of the city he would never'permit Jehovah’s witnesses to operate within the city again. It thus becomes an issue between Mayor Remsnider and the Creator, with the result not at all in doubt.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">In Germany everybody has to salute the flag, because Hitler wants it that way. Jeho--gjah’s witnesses refuse to do it and are all in concentration camps—except such as have been shot, beheaded or tortured to death. There must be a good many Hitlerites at</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Jefferson, Ohio. In that city three innocent bearers of the Kingdom message were attacked on Saturday night, June 15. The Jefferson </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette</span><span class="font8"> of June 18 had an editorial on the subject, entitled “An Appeal to Reason”, but it was a milk-and-water evasion, instead of a manly stand for law and order. No names were mentioned, nor were Uehovah’s witnesses named as such, but they w<sup>F</sup>ere the ones that suffered. Such blind writing accomplishes nothing whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A writer in the Fort Lauderdale (Fla.) </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News,</span><span class="font8"> June 18, 194Q, goes after these new-style patriots in the following picturesque language:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They engage from coast to coast in mob violence, arson, theft and blood letting. Then they salute the flag!!! Why should the government for which the flag stands be thus insulted with impunity f Why prepare billions against Hitler’s coming' while supinely allowing and advertising the work of these mobs and traitors who are scrapping the Bill of Rights and throwing our own Democracy out of the window?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Kansas City </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Journal,</span><span class="font8"> June 18, has a real editor. Referring to the arrest of 23 American citizens there for telling the truth about religion, it said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The first amendment to the Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion. Although they are accused of violating an ordinance on sidewalk banners, those under arrest ere being persecuted for their religious beliefs. It is easy enough to salute the flag. Many who enthusiastically salute it would be too cowardly to defend it in battle. The test of true patriotism is not the observance of forms, but the adherence to the principles for which the flag stands. The police exhibited slight regard for those principles in making the arrests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">However, un-American as were the Kansas City police, they were not down to the level of citizens of Roseburg, Oregon, who repeatedly rotten-egged the’Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s witnesses in that city, and for no reason; none whatever, except perhaps that some horse-collared gent in black skirts told them to do it, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Near Lassellsville, New York, William Hibbard, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, driving a sound-ear, was stopped by several earloads of men bent on destruction of the car and its contents. Some started to pull him out of the ear into the ditch, while others hit the ear with stones. Hibbard then stepped on the gas and started to seek police protection from the patriotic, murderous flag-saluters. Arriving at St. Johnsville, New York, he was arrested by the officer of whom he sought protection; charged with speeding, and fined. When the mob arrived he was arrested again; charge, reckless driving. All this is now strictly regular and is the ideal America which the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and the American Legion have in mind. Fine business!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Baek to Rawlins, Wyoming, where more of the new patriotism was in evidence. Three men and one woman, all Jehovah’s witnesses, were jailed because they had been attacked by rioters. None of the rioters were arrested; they never are. It would be so un-American, you know. Backing up their menfolk, women of the town mobbed two women, slapped them, lacerated them, broke their teeth, tore their clothing to shreds, and pulled their hair, after breaking in a door. Then the mob burned another car and trailer ; and so love of country and flag was proved, Vatican style.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How love of country can be turned into hatred was shown by a letter by F. E.

<p><span class="font8">Directly due to the compulsory flag-salute ruling, the riot, at Rockville, Md., could be said to be almost on the Supreme Court’s doorstep. Rockville is only sixteen miles away from the building in which the court meets. In this instance, two police came in and told Jehovah’s witnesses they were about to be attacked and then the police went down stairs and guided 50 men and boys to their job of smashing up the room and its furniture, at the cost of the landlord. See the accompanying picture of the work of the now ‘&quot;patriots”, and of one of the “patriots” himself.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">The police-supervised mob at Rockville did a good job, and that it, had full police approval seems evident from the fact that it took place within a hundred yards of the Montgomery County police headquarters. The officers that announced that the riot would shortly be pulled off were L. B. Thompson and Charles Peters. Scrgt. Guy Jones was a few minutes late at the display of “patriotism”, but arrived just after the Thompson-Peters mob had smashed down the door into the hall. Of course, none of the mob were arrested at the time. They never are. But two of Jehovah’s witnesses were taken in “protective custody”, which is a polite method of arrest. They, were booked as “no charge”. It is not unlawful, as yet, to worship God within sixteen miles of the Supreme Court building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Washington </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Past,</span><span class="font8"> which is itself compromised by its kowtowing to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and its connection with the columnist Harlan Miller, had the honesty and courage to say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The similarity between the attitude of the Montgomery County police and those of Nazi Germany is all too striking. It was the custom in the Third Reich for custodians of the law to look on half approvingly while youthful gangsters destroyed the fundamentals of liberty under the specious pretext of patriotism-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The chief of police of Rockville, Charles AI. Orme, was at his home five miles away when the riot took place, but showed no enthusiasm ■ about coming and stopping it. He had made the statement to one of Jehovah's witnesses, “We will break these meetings up every time they get started.” Oddly enough, this evil statement appeared in the Washington </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Star </span><span class="font8">under the headline “Orme Informed Sect Members of Peril, Affidavit Says”, and was used by the six clergymen of Rockville, who appeared in Orme’s behalf, as grounds for his </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">retention</span><span class="font8"> in the job he has now lost. It looks as if this business of encouraging riots close to AVashington had its disadvantages, for ten of the rioters are now awaiting trial.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">This is the lynching spirit flaunting the national colors and therefore all the more deadly. If the Jehovians are to be mobbed for their religious convictions about secular symbols, who is to protect the Society of Friends for their doctrinal objection to service in the nation’s armed forces! Who, in shorty is to keep maniacal patriots from introducing into the United States the obscene orgies of the Third Reich!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Back to Rawlins, Wyoming, yet once again. The new “patriotism” there was not sated with all the other outrages, including burning of two automobiles and two trailers, but when a third automobile and trailer attempted to leave town the highly intelligent sheriff took the owner to a cell and impounded the car and trailer. Meantime, at last reports, he was deep in the Bible literature of Jehovah’s witnesses. Here is hoping he may learn something before it is too late. How silly it all is that a man’s books to the extent of more than 300,-000,000 copies could be circulated and then some sheriff in Wyoming would lock himself and other people up until he could figure out what it is all about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Parco, Wyoming, is a suburb of Rawlins, seven miles away. While the sheriff of the county was busy studying Judge Rutherford’s books the citizens of this community, on June 22, tarred and feathered one of Jehovah’s witnesses, A. V. Hyder, of Oklahoma, after badly cutting and bruising him and burning his literature. ■ Full particulars as to just what special son of the Devil was at the bottom of all these outrages in Rawlins and Parco is awaited with interest. Without a doubt he has the title &quot;Reverend Father” before his name. Information is awaited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">June 21, at Steubenville, Ohio, 15 of Jehovah's witnesses, women as well as men, were stoned for circulating a petition to the governor of Ohio to stand by a contract. Thus the new &quot;patriotism&quot; spreads. Hitler could hardly • have anything to boat it, A woman who tried to stir up strife against the circulators of the petition at Uniontown, Pa., was so far gone mentally that she said the picture on the advertisement of the convention resembled Hitler. It was actually a picture of Judge Rutherford, and he looks about as much like Hitler as George AVashington looked like Charlie Chaplin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Petition workers at Altoona, Pa.' were taken to police headquarters, where they were questioned by a Catholic sergeant; the ease was referred to the mayor, and he ordered them released and had them driven back to where </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">consolation</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">they stopped work. Not all public officials are led around by the nose by the religionists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Wellsburg, W. Va., Mayor McGlumphy said be planned to confer with Judge O’Brien as to what could be done to keep Jehovah’s witnesses out of the city. With a couple of good old names like that they ought not to have any trouble thinking up something. And if they get stuck for an excuse they can always eall on Vatican City, or any place down the line to the local priest. Of course, McGlumphy is not concerned about little things like the law. Doesn't everybody know that mayors make all the laws of the cities in which they live? Congress, you know, is just a band of clerks, grouped together at Washington to have a good time, and the Constitution of the United States and that of West Virginia are a couple of good jokes between the MeGlum-phys and the O’Briens.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>George Washington’s Patriotism .</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">In the Atlanta </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Journal</span><span class="font8"> W. D, Wells draws attention to the fact that George Washington’s patriotism consisted in shooting at the British flag, not saluting it, and he wants to know if George was patriotic, and if not, why not. He should not mention anything like that. It will cause people to think, and people do not like to think.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Auburndale, Fla., the “Reverend&quot; J. I-Wherry, pastor of the First Presbyterian church, ap pea red before the city council in support of a measure intended to ke'ep Jehovah’s witnesses out of the city. He stated that the witnesses had been in town circulating a petition involving the governor of the state, which was not true, and that it was red propaganda, which is a lie. But none of Jehovah’s witnesses think anything of it when a clergyman lies about them. If a man will lie like the Devil about Almighty God himself, surely he ought to be able to lie to his heart’s content about His witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How the newspapers can mix things so that the public cannot rely upon anything they may say was disclosed by a skit in the Sunbury (Pa.) </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Item.</span><span class="font8"> There the circulation of the petition to the governor of Ohio to stand by his contract was reported as a petition &quot;for release of members held under the federal laws&quot;, and “the activities were reported to local American Legion members&quot;, who had as much interest in the subject and as much right to interfere as the man in the moon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OCTOBER 2, 1940</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Newton, Texas, the chief anarchist of the community, Sheriff Ebb Burgess, released two Of Jehovah’s witnesses so that they could be beaten by a mob, which did as the sheriff desired, and the sheriff then destroyed their two phonographs and 30 of their Kingdom records. He had just as much right to do this as he would have had to go to Austin and burn the house of the governor of Texas in the middle of the night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Mooresville, Ind,, a mob of what were styled “war veterans&quot; kept 47 of Jehovah’s witnesses in Odd Fellows’ hall all night under threats of violence unless they stultify their consciences by saluting the flag. State police rescued the 'witnesses. During the evening, while the new “patriots&quot; outside were throwing articles at the windows, an eight-year-old girl was cut by broken glass. We must have the new “patriotism”, you know, no matter what happens to the little folks. This new patriotism is so like George Washington’s, isn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">By the time this is ready for the printer there will be hundreds more of cases of the religionists and the American Legion and other of the new patriots against those who love God and revere His word. Maybe some of them will go as far as the religionists at Irene, S. Dak., who fired four slugs at Howard Logsdon and his wife on July 7, The Associated Press “patriotically” suggested that Logsdon or some of his friends had fired the bullets themselves. Seems likely that they would ruin their car and risk being killed for such a cause, doesn’t it? Logsdon was at the Detroit convention and was interviewed by this writer. One of the bullets which came through the back of his car, and between him and his wife, fell to the floor of the car, and Logsdon had it with him. If you were going to fire a bullet between yourself and your wife, and make it come through the back of your car, and fall at your feet, you could not do it unless you were one of the new-style Associated Press-Roman Catholic Hierarchy-Twentieth Century patriots that feel they must make the world totalitarian right away or the Third Term and all else is lost I Seems that the latter part of that sentence is taken from something Judge Rutherford said at the Detroit convention. Anyway, what he said made a hit. The “locusts” are in the fight of eternity, and know it well. Praise God for such a courageous leader as Christ the King, and one so obedient to Him as Judge Rutherford.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">When Government Is Boss</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ When government is boss fear falls like a blanket over the people. No one dares do anything he thinks a bureaucrat might frown upon. The brains of Russia are today going into retirement because of fear. Everybody waits for orders from above. No one ventures along new lines. With the dead hand of bureaucracy the Revolution is strangling its own children. If in the factory a machine or assembly line breaks down, the foreman knows that he may be charged with deliberate sabotage, with Siberia or the firing squad as the penalty. After a Russian train wreck, it is hard to tell whether more get killed in the wreck or after it. Some time ago, before the recent blood purges, thirty-five employees of the Commissariat for Agriculture, many of them experts in foods, were shot without trial. Their blunder was that they failed to guess right. Under sueh conditions, the worker takes no chances. He plays safe. He makes no experiments. Engineers and inventors and executives refuse to go ahead until plans are approved by the “party” seci'ctary, who probably knows little or nothing about the plan he approves. It is a grim game of passing the buck—-to Moscow. The result is industrial chaos.—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Jefferson, The Forgotten Man,</span><span class="font8"> by Samuel B. Pettengill, page 68.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hitler’s Pal Close Enough</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ In -the Bering strait Big Diomede island belongs to Russia, and Little Diomede island, a mile away, belbngs to the United States. Just about the time Russia got done licking its chops over Einland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland and Rumania, it opened a Soviet Arctic station on Big Diomede island. That brings Hitler’s pal as close to the United States as is conducive to the peace of mind of Americans, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Russian Purchases</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ If you were asked to explain why it is that the United States sent more, very much more gasoline to Soviet Russia after the latter country made its attack on Finland than it did before, you might, if quick at thinking, say that one of the reasons was that the United States could lend more money to Finland so it could put up a better fight against the Russian menace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Totalitarian Foolishness</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Totalitarian foolishness, i.e., the desire to satiate dictators, is pretty well illustrated in Russia where children, a long list, were arrested and kept in jail eight months by certain officials so that the officials could have the reputation at Moscow of being extra bright and extra patriotic. One boy ten years of age, by the usual process of all-night questioning, and suggested answers, was made to say that he had been a plotter against the Soviet Republic since he was of the age of seven years. The three men that formed these cruel plots against mere children were given prison sentences of five to ten years; and got off easy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Russian Troops Afraid in the Dark</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ An interesting sidelight on the Finnish-Russian war was provided by the pro-Russian writer, Walter Duran ty, who brought out that the Finns, being Individualists, and accustomed to working in the woods in the dark of the Arctic winter, and being on their own soil, had a great advantage over the Russians, who are collectivists and are frightened at traveling in the dark and among the trees and in a strange land. The Finns were overwhelmed by sheer numbers, but the winter of 1939-1940 will long be remembered for the surprising fight they put up against forces outnumbering them 20 to 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">‘White Ghosts with Daggers’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ If you were naturally a little afraid of ghosts anyway, and were in a strange country, fighting to destroy the liberties of a brave people, and you had to travel in the dark of an Arctic night, and everything was heavily covered w<sup>r</sup>ith snow, and somebody clothed in white might come suddenly put of the night and stab you with a razor-sharp dagger, you would feel just like many a Russian soldier in Finland felt in the first days of the Russian invasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Pack Ice Drifts with the Wind</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ The 1,400-mile trip of the Russian scientists from the North Pole to a point off the coast of Greenland proved that ice floes drift with the wind and that the currents of water near the surface are determined by the wind, and not by undersea causes as was previously supposed to be the case.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>Spain</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">Azana or Roosevelt?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Let’s seeI Was it Azana or Roosevelt that said) “We must look ahead and see the kind of lives our children would have to lead if a large part of the rest of the world were compelled to worship the “God” imposed by a military ruler, or were forbidden to worship God at all; if the rest of the world were forbidden to read*and hear the faets—the daily news of their own and others’ nations—if they were deprived of the truth that makes men free,” Well, it was Roosevelt, but it might have been Azana, Spain has what 'Roosevelt envisioned but did nothing to prevent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Released from a Spanish Prison ‘ ♦ Released from a Spanish prison in April, 1940, James Cameron, a Vancouver, B.C., fisherman, member of the International Brigade, stated that when he left Spain there were still thousands of men, women and children crowded into prisons built to hold fewer hundreds; shootings and garrotings were constantly taking place; prisoners were sometimes beaten to death; many had no place to sleep but on the prison floors; the prisoners were constantly interrogated by agents of the German Gestapo, thus showing that the conspiracy against liberty is world-wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dare Not Let the People Learn</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Helped into the Spanish saddle by the pope, the Moors, Mussolini and Hitler, Franco the Butcher dares not let the people of Spain learn anything; and his masters, the archbishops, are of the same mind. Hence, the bulletin of April, 1940, that shipments of books, newspapers or periodicals will<sup>1</sup> not be permitted unless the addressees have first obtained permission for their importation from the Spanish authorities. Wrappers of newspapers and of packages containing printed matter must each be endorsed to show that permission has been obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Left Off the Ciphers</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Prior to their expulsion from Spain in 1932 the Jesuits owned something like a quarter of the entire country, A dispatch from Madrid, dated January 27, 1940, published in the New York recorded the fact and said, “The Jesuits regained control today of all their schools, convents and other institutions, worth $30,000,00, , . . ” This is the first time anybody ever saw $30,000,000 or $300,000,000 </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OCTOBER 2, 1940 </span><span class="font8">listed in any such way, but if it is all right with the Associated Press that sent the dispatch and knows the faets, and with the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times, </span><span class="font8">which also knows the facts, and with the proofreaders and editors who also know the faets, why should anybody object to one more coldblooded swindle of the great American sucker?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Tuberculosis in Spain &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Three years of dreadful civil war in Spain, while the Hierarchy was making its successful effort to get back on the necks of the common people, has resulted in a great increase in tuberculosis. Always poor and insufficiently fed, and many of them living in caves and hovels, the lot of the common people throughout the dominance of the heartless religionists was most wretched. The “civil war”, with its attendant destruction of homes and hospitals, has now made that lot even worse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Franco Shows What He Is</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ When the insurrection first broke out in Spain against the Spanish Republic, there was one occasion when several thousand supporters of Franco, including Ramon Serrano Suner, present Minister of the Interior, fled for safety to the embassies of various Spanishspeaking countries having representatives in . Madrid, and the right of asylum was given to them, in accordance with general international practice. But when seventeen professional men of recognized standing in the Spanish Republic fled to the Chile embassy on the entrance of Franco into the city, Franco wanted to drag them out and murder them. All South American countries protested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">1,000 Shootings a Month</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ In ten months after the war, it was estimated, 40,000 executions had taken place in Madrid, but by the end of that time they were down to 1,000 a month, i.e., about 30 to 35 per day. The prisoners are shot at the Eastern Cemetery at dawn, and by the lorry load, sometimes as many as four lorry loads in a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Ten Months After the War</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Ten months after the Spanish Republic had been completely destroyed by the combined treachery of Spain, Germany, Britain and the United States, there were still 500,000 men and women in prison, besides the 1,200,000 already in their graves. Franco the Butcher has nothing akin to mercy in his make-up.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Central America, Mexico, West Indies</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">Congratulations to Santo Domingo</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Congratulations to Santo Domingo on opening her doors to take in 37 Jewish refugees from Central Europe. Ten were women, one was a boy of fourteen months who smiled his way past the customs officials, and the others were young men who hope to make a living by farming. These people have been guaranteed—</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">full opportunity to continue their lives and occupations, free from molestation, discrimination or persecution, with full freedom of religion and religious ceremonials [which latter will do them more harm than good], with equality of opportunities and civil, legal and economic rights inherent to human [creatures].</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The above are the advance guard of 500 or more families to follow into the land where , now rest the bones of Christopher Columbus. There are about 2,500 Spanish immigrants in Santo Domingo at present. The total population of the Dominican Republic is 1,544,549, and its area is but 19,332 square miles, or about the size of New Hampshire and Vermont, The two latter states have a total population of 824,904 and an area of 18,155 square miles. So here is a country twice as thickly settled as the New England states and which yet finds room to take in the homeless and find a place for them. Maybe the blacks have kinder hearts than the whites. Maybe there is no &quot;maybe” about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Enthusiastic About Honduras</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Americans who feel there is no land left to pioneer should just come down through here. Honduras is almost a miniature United States in the diversity of its character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It has isolated interior valleys so fertile you can throw out a kernel of corn and it grows into two crops a year. It has endless rieh pasture lands in the mountains, but few cattle or sheep are there to disturb the silence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It has vast forests of timber that men have never set foot in. It has rivers rieh in placer gold and large hard-rock mines of silver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It has fruits, deserts, volcanoes, hot weather, cold weather, earthquakes, tobacco and hurricanes. If it wanted to write a magazine all about itself it could out-superlative California.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And yet Honduras is hardly scratched. It seems to me about as rich and in about the same state of development as our own West in the days of the ’49 gold rush. The population is scant and the land is waiting. Everything lies ahead. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Honduras has 962,000 people. More thau half of them are pure Indian. A great many have never seen a motor truck. A half-century of progress has utterly passed them by, and they have leaped right from the bull- cart to the airplane and the radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The No. 1 thing in Honduras’ program of development is the building of roads. That’s a good dull idea and won’t make any tingles go up your back. But if you were here you’d see how much it means. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It means that those incredibly rich valleys, idle since time began, can thrive with grain and wealth; for there’ll be a way to get it out to market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It means that those endless pastures and cedar-wooded ridges of the mountains can swarm with cattle and sheep; for there’ll be trucks to haul them but.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And it means that the peons of the backwoods and the residents of the small towns can come into touch with the world, with ideas, with new things—it means cutting a window in a dark room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All we hear about at home is the much publicized Pan American Highway, But interior roads are just as important to these countries. And Honduras is building them. —Ernie Pyle, in New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">World-Telegram.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Lots of Oil at Tampico</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ It takes lots of oil and gasoline to fly airplanes, but they have plenty of it at Tampico, Mexico. And just suppose that Tampico should sometime fall into the hands of Germans, Italians, Spanish, Japanese and Russians, all of them working together for the triumph of their totalitarian idea. What could they do with the oil? They could do aplenty. Tampico is only hours by air away from the Canal Zone, and only 2| hours by air from St. Louis, Kansas City and Omaha.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Catholic Mexico</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ In Catholic Mexico no church may own or administer property in its own name; no church may engage in education besides that directly connected with the pulpit and within church edifices; religious orders are forbidden ; and no clergyman may wear a clerical collar in public.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Judiciary</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">Totalitarian FCC</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Radio broadcasting, which is supposed to have equal rights with the press, since the Constitution guarantees to all the right of free speech anti free press, is headed for the ash heap if a recent incident is any criterion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It came about when the Federal Communications Commission ordered one of the leading television companies to stop marketing its wares. Just where the commission gets this authority is not evident, but the chairman of the commission, aroused by the storm of disapproval which greeted the commission’s ruling, demanded, and got, time on the national networks to offer a defense of the commission’s arbitrary action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The radio broadcasters, which have to have their licenses renewed every six months, were fearful of saying no, so they canceled thousands of dollars’ worth of air time to permit the chairman to air his views.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The incident does illustrate forcefully the extent to which totalitarian ideas have become imbedded in the minds of those who control governmental commissions and agencies in Washington. This incident might have been expected to occur in Germany or Russia, not in the United States.—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Jersey Journal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hoover Let Down, and Why</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Did you think the Hierarchy would be soft and easy with the man responsible for the arrest of those seventeen Coughlin Christian Fronters in Brooklyn? You don’t know the Hierarchy. They don’t intend to have Coughlin’s men embarrassed. Even while their trial was still in progress in Brooklyn, Edgar Hoover, the man responsible for getting them locked up, was relieved of the possibility of making any more such arrests. On this point </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Daily News,</span><span class="font8"> New York, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Detroit arrests by the FBI of a group of 17 men and women for alleged violation of laws in connection with foreign enlistments, and the ‘plot to overthrow the government’ announced by Hoover after his probe of the Christian Front in New York City, were specifically mentioned today as among the reasons which compelled the White House and Justice Department to create new machinery to handle neutrality cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This precaution on the part of the Hierarchy was a wise one. Next thing you know some officer of the law might start investigating church basements.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Protection of Loan Sharks</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">♦ Labor,</span><span class="font8"> Washington (D. C.) newspaper, claims that in many states loan sharks prey on one-fourth the families in the state and get away with it because they are heavy advertisers and therefore the publishers are blind. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Labor</span><span class="font8"> cites one case where a loan shark took in $1,053 in nine years on a loan of $20, obtained by the borrower to purchase medicine for a sick wife. It appears that the legislatures of the various states arc as afraid of the loan sharks as they arc of the well-known Public Enemy No. 1. And it may be the same crowd, at that. Well, thank God, the whole crowd of contaminators of the atmosphere will be destroyed at Armageddon and even their memory will be held in utter contempt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">No Sympathy for Liars</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ No honest citizen, doing his best to comply with the laws of God and man, can have anything but contempt for a man who twice obtained passports under another name than his own and later lied when he applied under his own name and stated that he had had no previous passports. And these remarks would apply in full measure to a man who presumed to run for the office of president of the United States on the Communist ticket, if he did these things, as is now claimed with respect to Earl Browder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Can You Figure It Out?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Regarding former Judge Martin T. Manton, crookedest judge on the bench in 300 years, see if you can figure out this defense, made by Manton’s attorney:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A judge cannot influence, obstruct or impede his own “administration of justice”. He might defraud the Government in acting with deceit, craft or trickery, but a judge can no more commit an obstruction of justice than a contempt of his own court. He cannot conspire to do so as to his own administration. He could not complete the object of that conspiracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Manton’s Bagman Gets Nine Months</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Judge Manton’s bagman, William J. Fallon, got a nine-month sentence for helping the fitmous Papal Knight of St. Gregory the Great in his job of peddling justice. He was already serving a term for commercial bribery, and the Federal Court permitted three months of his sentence to run concurrently with his punishment for bribery.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Selecting the Correct Word</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ The interesting question of the right collective noun shows that the English, language has a wide variety of terms, each with a different shade of meaning, and while the Greeks may have the edge on the English when it comes to the variety and exactness of words, English has a wealth of material for those who find pleasure in striving for correctness of expression, The following list, partly suggested by Kenneth P. Wood, shows how wide is the range:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A covey of partridges, a nide of pheasants, a wisp of snipe, a flight of swallows, a muster of peacocks, a siege of herons, a building of rooks, a brood of grouse, a plump of wild fowl, a stapd of plovers, a watch of nightingales, a clattering of choughs, a flock of geese, a bunch of cattle, a bevy of quails, a east of hawks, a trip of dotterel, a swarm of bees, a school of porpoises, a pod of whales, a shoal of herrings, a herd of elephants, a skulk of foxes, a pack of wolves, a drove of oxen, a sounder of wild swine, a troop of acrobats, a pride of lions, a sleuth of bears, a gang of elk, a litter of puppies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then, there are a posse of men, a crowd of carriages, a host of people, a flood of callers, a deluge of tourists, a horde of nomads, a-tribe of Indians, a crew of building mechanics, a knot of sailors, a squad of police, a band of brothers, a regiment of soldiers, a group of persons, a elump of bacteria, a set of merchants. [A what of clergymen, priests, pastors, ministers, fathers, prelates, deans, curates, chaplains, vicars, revivalists, rectors, preachers, patriarchs, bishops?]</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From the Rector to the “Locust”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ Madam: I have been too busy to do so before, but I now write to say how annoyed I am that you have the effrontery—I feel that is not a whit too strong a word to use, after your behavior. After forty years’ hard work in one’s parish to have an irresponsible stranger coming here and seeking to turn away one’s people from the faith of their fathers, is a wrong which one is certainly not justified in taking lying down. T can but thank God that you have not succeeded except in tiie case of those Taney lot [a family of ten Jonadabs now active in the service], and of course they are ignorant people and you have traded on that ignorance; therefore there is to some et-tent excuse for them. Of course their ingratitude towards myself is beneath contempt, after the years in which I befriended them, and I can never forget it. With regard to those children, it is a pitiable ease. They were amongst my most regular children at Sunday school, in the choir, etc., and now they run wild on Sunday and treat me as though they had never seen me. I don’t blame them, poor children, for I was so fond of them, but I blame you for such scandalous behavior. You may take your literature back, i.e., </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Neutrality </span><span class="font8">booklet, and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace,</span><span class="font8"> and I strongly advise you not to send me any ever again.—J.

<p><span class="font8">The Fight Against War</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ The students’ fight against war took on some curious aspects. At Cazenovia, near Syracuse, the students came.into classes with heads and arms bandaged and walking on crutches and canes. On the campus of the University of Chicago there were 200 white crosses lining the walks and on each cross was the question, “Will your name be there?” At the end of each walk was a sign reading, “The Yanks are not coming.” At New York University many adopted the Trumbo Peace Pledge which reads as follows: “We are Americans ; we are not humble servants of the allpowerful government; we are the people ; we are the sovereign citizens of the United States of America ; we are the government; we do not beg for peace like slaves; we do not plead for it like serfs; we demand it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Posers from Leicester</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">♦ There were ten thousand barefooted natives on an island. A philanthropist offered to supply them all with boots free of charge, but a certain proportion of the natives were onelegged and half of the remainder declined the offer. How many boots would be required? The answer is found in the sixteenth and seventeenth words of Leviticus 26: 8, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Ajt.V. </span><span class="font8">It takes a little time to see this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A man who owned twenty-five blue socks and twenty-five brown socks went upstairs to fetch a pair, but the electric light failed, leaving him in darkness. What is the minimum number of socks he had to bring down stairs to be certain of having a pair of the same color? The answer is found in the eighth word of Genesis 5:23.—F. R.

<h5><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Winds That Blow</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">S</span><span class="font8">OME of the winds mentioned in the Bible are winds that the Creator caused to blow; some of them are due to what are called natural causes; at least one of them and probably several were stirred up by “the prince of the power of the air”, that is, the Devil,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the time came to pour out the seventh plague upon Egypt, “[Jehovah] sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and [Jehovah] famed hail upon the land of Egypt. So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a. nation.”—Exodus 9:23,24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the time for the eighth plague arrived, “Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and Jehovah brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.”—Exodus 10:13,14, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Pharaoh feigned repentance after the eighth plague, “[Jehovah] turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.”—Exodus 10:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Israelites in the wilderness wanted quails, and they got them. “And there went forth-a wind from [Jehovah], and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day’s journey on this side, and as it were a day’s journey on the other side, round about the camp, flying about two cubits above the face of the earth.”—Numbers 11: 31, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Variorum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the Israelites crossed the Red sea, and Pharaoh and his hosts were drowned, Moses sang to Jehovah: “Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.”—Exodus 15:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">David says of Jehovah, “He was seen upon the wings of the wind.”—2 Samuel 22:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Elijah prayed for rain, “and it eame to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with .clouds and wind, and there was a great rain.”—1 Kings 18:45,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the vision granted to Elijah at Horeb: &quot;[Jehovah] passed by, and a great and strong </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OCTOBER 2, 1940 </span><span class="font8">wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before [Jehovah]; but [Jehovah] was not in the wind.” (1 Kings 19:11) In this instance the winds did Jehovah’s will; they were His servants, so to speak, making pictures for later days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the account of the death of Job’s sons and daughters, as recorded in the first chapter of the book bearing that name, it is after Satan challenged Job’s integrity, and after “Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power”, that “there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four comers of the house, and it fell upon the young men” and killed all. (Job 1:11,12,19, A.h’.I’.) That wind was evidently caused by Satan, Jehovah not interfering, but letting him go the limit in carrying out, as fully as he could, his wicked challenge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the other hand, the quieting of the earth by tire south wind is ascribed by Elihu to Jehovah. (Job 37:17) The psalmist says, “He did fly upon the wings of the wind.” (Psalm 18:10) The breaking of the ships of Tar-shish (the Devil’s commercial giants) with an east wind is ascribed to Him. (Psalm 48:7) He is accredited with walking “upon the wings .of the wind”.—Psalm 104:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Whatsoever [Jehovah] pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places. He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.” (Psalm 135: 6,7) “He eaus-eth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.” (Psalm 147:18) “Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his word.” —Psalm 148: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.” (Jeremiah 10:13) “The wind shall eat up all thy pastors.” (Jeremiah 22:22) (“Thus saith [Jehovah], Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, aiid against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me, a destroying wind.”—Jeremiah 51:1.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>In Jonah’s Day</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">In Jonah’s day both winds there mentioned are accredited to Jehovah; first, “[Jehovah] sent out a great wind into the sea, and there</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">was a mighty tempest” (Jonah 1:4), and at the conclusion of the story of his experiences, “it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind” (Jonah 4: 8) that removed the gourd under which he had been sheltered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is not expressly stated that the Devil caused the great storm on the lake of Galilee, which storm Jesus quieted, but it is fairly presuified from the statement that “he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm”. (Mark 4: 36-39) The presumption would be that' this storm which so frightened the experienced sailors and fishermen was intended by the Devil to drown Jesus while He was asleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The shipwreck of Paul and his companions, recorded at length in Acts 27, seems to have been the natural consequences of a winter storm common to the region of the Adriatic; called Euroelydon then; the common term now is Levanter; also called a bora, borina or boraccia, depending upon its violence. The cold wind blows from the mountainous interior toward the warmer coastal region, where it arrives as a relatively cold wind, despite some heating in its descent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Americans are well acquainted with blizzards, but so are Europeans, and, as a matter of fact, it was in Europe that the term originated. So a “wet norther” is a blinding snowstorm, accompanied by a high cold wind in the northern Rocky mountain region, or it is a blizzard dear across America and northern Europe. When it gets to the steppes of central Asia it is called a buran, and in northern Siberia and Alaska it is a purga.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A foehn is a warm, dry southerly wind descending into the valleys north of the Alps; a sirpceo is a hot southerly wind blowing from' the African coast to Italy, Sicily and Spain. It is generally moist and sultry in Italy, but dry and dusty in southern Italy, Sicily and Spain. The mistral, which blows down off the Alps upon the Mediterranean coasts of France, is the counterpart of the bora which comes off the Julian Alps down upon the Adriatic. At first it comes in violent gusts, making navigation of small craft dangerous ; afterwards it becomes more moderate, but remains strong.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>African, Asian and Australian Winds</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">The simoom, or khamsin, is a hot, dry wind from the Sahara desert which prevails in Egypt for about fifty days before the vernal equinox. This wind raises great clouds of dust in Africa and Arabia and is very exhausting to those exposed to it. It finds its counterpart in the dust storms of southeastern Colorado, southwestern Kansas and the Texas panhandle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The harmattan is a dry wind off the west coast of Africa, blowing from the interior during December, January and February, and hence closely allied to the simoom, or khamsin. It brings clouds of dust, makes the atmosphere densely hazy, withers vegetation and parches the human skin, but the intensely hot days alternate with cool nights. The willy-willy is a heavy gale on the northwest coast of Australia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The bad-isad-o-bist-roz, or “wind of 120 days”, which blows from the first of June to the last of September on the borderland between Persia and Afghanistan is claimed to be the world’s most trying wind: it blows with such violence and such persistence. But a Sahara dust storm that piles up dust 2,500 miles from where it started has some claims to eminence in that direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A cyclone in the China Sea area is always called a typhoon; if it occurs in the Philippine Islands it is called a bagnio; if it takes place in the West Indies it is called a hurricane, from a word that means “evil spirit”. Such winds (choose your own name) usually have a diameter of 50 to 900 miles, fnove with a velocity of 20 to 30 miles an hour, and are characterized by winds rotating counterclockwise at speeds up to 130 or more miles per hour. One of these storms in the Philippines brought 46 inches of water in 24 hours. A famous road to the summer capital was washed out, but a second storm came along and washed away the debris, actually repairing, to some extent, the great damage caused by the first. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Central Asia has some terribly cold winds; though, when it comes to measurements, Mount Washington, in New Hampshire, supplied a record of 231 miles per hour, which not even Siberia has so far reported. Nevertheless, in the past, large towns in Asia were buried deep in sand within a few hours. But not long ago some papers published pictures of an American dust pile, brought by a storm, barn high. A dust storm in northern Idaho is called a palouser; there the dust storms are accompanied by rain, smearing windows with red mud. The farmers grin secretly, however; for the mud deposited is very fertile soil.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>Tornadoes and Waterspouts</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">Tornadoes and waterspouts are entirely different from cyclones. A tornado is a storm along a path seldom more than a few hundred yards in width and of twenty to thirty miles in length. The tornado is accompanied by a funnel-shaped cloud around which the winds revolve in a direction opposite to the hands of a clock. Tornadoes sometimes rise and fall, which accounts for whole sections unscathed along a path of demolished buildings and uprooted trees. In the twenty-two years ending with 1938 the United States reported 3,092 tornadoes, with a total loss of life amounting to 5,836, and property losses of $262,185,895,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The winds which accompany tornadoes are too violent to be measured, and the barometric pressure falls so rapidly that wooden structures are often lifted and burst open by the air confined within. In the United States a common name for the tornado is “twister”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A whirlwind and a waterspout are one and the same thing. First is a funnel-shaped column of air, with a circular and upward spiral motion around a vertical or, inclined axis, which at the same time has a progressive motion over the surface of the earth. Over the sea the whirling, funnel-shaped cloud, first observed as a pendant of a storm-cloud above, seems to grow downward, tapering, toward the water surface, which is violently agitated, and finally (when the spout is fully developed) appears to be drawn up to meet the cloud from above. This appearance is deceptive, as the bulk of the water carried along by the whirling spout is condensed from the atmosphere and, even when the spout is formed over a salt-water surface, is found to be fresh. Waterspouts usually occur in the tropics but.have occurred in New York harbor in recent years. With all due respect to this information, gleaned from usually reliable sources, it yet remains to explain how, on occasion, fishes have been rained on the land. How come the fishes aloft?</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>Squalls, Chinooks, Hail</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">A Bermuda squall is a. sudden, violent squall of the western North Atlantic; a line squall is a squall presenting a long broadside front but of little depth; a white squall is a small whirlwind, usually in the tropics, coming on suddenly with little warning, and with no cloud but a small white patch above the storm center.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A ehinook is a warm, dry wind that descends the eastern slopes of the Rocky mountains in western Canada and northwestern United States, causing such a rapid disappearance of the snow that it is called, colloquially, a “snow-eater”. The Swiss have a similar wind which they call the &quot;Schneefresser”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hailstones consist of alternate concentric layers of ice and snow which are formed while the stone is sustained in the air by gyratory ascending currents; at length they get too heavy to be sustained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Cyclones may cover hundreds or even thousands of square miles and may occur at any season. The circulatory motion is in the direction of the hands of the clock in the southern hemisphere and in the opposite direction in the northern. A cyclone is not necessarily stormy, though generally attended by cloudy weather, with rain or snow. Of 441 cyclones studied in the Philippines from 1880 to 1900 inclusive, not one occurred in February. In a cyclone the winds turn inward. There are cyclones in the sun. Sometimes there are secondary, subsidiary or satellite cyclones . which form on the outskirts of the primary cyclone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is now generally held that the ancient custom of firing broadsides at waterspouts or hailstorms served no purpose. These storms come and go suddenly. By the time they are fired at and disappear they would have disappeared anyway. European vine-growers still do considerable of this expensive and futile firing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Inasmuch as tornadoes (traveling whirlwinds) usually move toward the northeast, motorists in the path are advised to drive north or south to escape being caught. On one occasion three tornadoes, only a few minutes apart, struck Charleston, S.C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A good old-fashioned thunderstorm is nothing to be dreaded. It rolls along over the landscape like a huge barrel. The raindrops which are blown upward in the revolving of the barrel may and often do turn into hail, because they ascend so high that they freeze. There is no such thing as a cloudburst. What seems like a cloudburst is where these up-rushing streams of raindrops are caught in a downrush and both streams fall as one. Raindrops seldom fall faster than 25 feet per second.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hurricanes have been known to raise waters twenty feet vertically at places on the Atlantic coast.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">British Comment</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By J. He-m&amp;ry (London)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Air Raids</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">• At the time of this writing the threatened and purposed invasion of Britian has not happened. Hitler’s published time-table stated that he would be in London by the 15th of August. Apparently when the date was fixed he expected that a sudden attack would succeed almost as rapidly as his occupation of Denmark and the Netherlands did; for it is said he anticipated being in London to take control five days after the invasion was started. Evidently something has gone awry with that plan. Britain is left guessing as to'what his reasons are—for there is no great show of such preparation for his yet severest test of battle as would be necessary for his scheme to succeed. In the meantime the Nazi bombers are increasing in activity, and damage to property and destruction of life, as well as casualties which injure and maim, increase. Also aircraft attacks on ships in convoy are more numerous and more severe. But even in the narrow waters of the English Channel the Nazis have not prevented the passage of the convoys, and the port of London is still an open port and is carrying on its great business. The interval, from the truce Germany made with France, on the virtual capitulation of France, has been used by Britain to set a Home Guard of about a million and a half of men into military order for the defense of the land against invasion whether by sea or by air. This, so it is reported, is an annoyance to Hitler—he has already spoken of them as murderers—his soldiers, whether landing by para-, chutes or planes, or by boats, should be opposed only by soldiers, “according to international law.” So says this gangster stickler for the proper observance of law and order, and morality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The falling away of France from the mutual agreement with Britain to fight for the freedom from Nazi oppression in Europe undoubtedly greatly al tered the course of the war, and there arc many who think that Germany will push Italy, and aid Mussolini in an attack on British power in the Near East with the purpose of getting control of the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. At the same time, as passing events indicate, Spain will be brought under the Nazi control with the aid of the pro-Nazis of Franco’s government, now as nearly proNazi as it is, under the domination of the pope of Rome. If that scheme should succeed it can readily be seen that Hitler would be in a much stronger position in his attempt on Britain’s reduction from world power than he is at present. If this is his scheme it is to be expected that this land will be constantly subjected to daily and nightly air raids, probably much intensified, to attacks on shipping with the expectation of preventing both food and armament supplies from entering it, and in the hope that the nerve and morale of the people will be broken down by the time he is fully ready for the onslaught.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He who is instructed in the purposes of God in the fulfillment of the prophecies He caused to be written concerning these days, knows that the nations are now entered into the time when God said He would bring them into judgment, immediately preceding the full establishment of His kingdom on earth under the rule of Christ. Such an instructed one knows that until that set time should come Jehovah, the Most High, the Creator, has not interrupted the arrangement which at the first gave Lucifer, a “morning star”, the overlordship of the earth, and which “office” allowed him to offer to Jesus the glory of all the kingdoms of the world if He would worship him, and gave the apostle Paul the reason for speaking of him, now also known as the Devil, and Satan, as “the god of this world”. That this arrangement was timed by the Most High, and that ‘the set time is come’, is the message of the Scriptures now spread abroad in all the earth, according to the purpose of God, by faithful men and women who, having received the truth, are by it serving God and their fellow men, and are known as “Jehovah’s witnesses”. Those who know anything of God must realize that He would not make so great a change in His arrangements of the ‘times and seasons’ which affect the whole earth without giving notice and warning. The first advent of Jesus may be said to be an illustration of the second in this matter. When the covenant arrangement made with the Jews had run its course, full warning and notice was given of the change by the appearance of John the Baptist as herald of Christ and of the change, and, too, of the judgment into which the nation was about to enter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He who has heeded the. things declared by God through His faithful witnesses knows that the great upheaval in the earth at this time is something more than war between the nations. The sudden changes in the settled conditions of Europe which have thrown up three men out of a class which could never be expected to rule and guide great nations, are one of the surprises of this day, and that these men, partly working together and partly in opposition, and necessarily each suspicious and watchful of the others, should have thrown the whole world into upheaval and distress, is something which is more than a puzzle, both to those who pay no attention to the Word of God and to the great religions and their subjects and adherents. The two ambitious schemers, and the third, who watches to see wdiat can be grabbed through the scheming, are undoubtedly the agents of the Devil, who, having been thrown out of his “office”, is by their schemes and ambitions, and by the more subtle but even more deadly workings of the already world-wide totalitarian Papal Hierarchy, determined to withstand God and Christ in the full establishment of His kingdom. Whether then Hitler’s threatened invasion of Britain will be attempted now or later does not rest with him, nor with the Devil, the instigator of his actions: to be, or not to be must be according to the Divine purpose in the gathering of all the nations to judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Waiting Time</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">• The lull in the storm of war has been favorable to Britain in that the nation has had more time to arrange for its defense; but alsd because for the time being the people have been saved from the distress which an invasion would bring whether successfully repulsed or become involved in battle. But it gives the opportunity of carrying on the witness to the purposes of God with a freedom which could not continue if transport, and other facilities were hindered or even almost stopped. There are many thousands of persons of good will toward God and their fellow men in this land who have not yet learned of the immediate purpose of God, having been misled into the belief that the kingdom of heaven can come only through the acceptance of the religion of the churches, and that the only kingdom of heaven that affects them and the peoples is this kingdom which the clergy and persons say they represent, and which the Roman</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OCTOBER 2, 1940</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hierarchy claims as its prerogative, and which it schemes to get wholly under its control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">• Jehovah’s witnesses have been put into the news lately, owing partly to unlawful interferences with their meetings, but, more prominently, by reason of some altogether gratuitous, unwarranted remarks made about them and the International Bible Students Association, with which they are affiliated. At the Manchester Tribunal, set to consider the applications for registration as conscientious objectors, Judge C. J. Frankland, who is temporarily substituting for the regular chairman, showed annoyance and anger as he “tried” the eases of a few members of Jehovah’s witnesses. The law of the land made provision for freedom from military service when it enacted the Conscription Bill last September, and the applicants for registration had as much right to make their application for registration as he had to judge on it. Carried away with a sense of his own position, and perhaps what he judged to be his patriotism, and annoyed because he could not shake the applicants from the apparent sincerity of their conscientious objection, he let himself say, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font8"> w-ant to say publicly, with all the force I possess, that there is very great doubt in my mind about the bona tides of this organization and the people, it employs.” In two cases he grudgingly admitted the applicants were genuine in their beliefs; in another he refused to admit it. Judge Frankland shut his eyes to the fact that Jehovah’s witnesses are seeking to carry the message of the kingdom of God and its salvation to the people, and allowed himself to believe that the only purpose is to make money for someone, and when informed by the applicants that they each placed a few books a week in the hands of the people he foolishly said he had no doubt that a good share of the millions of pounds now stored in America was held by the Society which supplies the literature explaining the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Judge Frankland’s unwarranted remarks were not confined to Jehovah’s witnesses. When a member of the Peace Pledge Union was before him he spoke of the originator of the Union, the late “reverend canon” Sheppard, as “that old neurotic”, and in this he has given offense to many who knew that honest man. Already letters to the newspapers indicate the strong, feelings which Judge</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">29</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Frankland’s remarks have aroused. His anger and his readiness to express it discounts what he has to say: no one with a grain of sense will pay attention to the nonsensical remark about the accumulation of a hoard of gold got by placing a few books in the hands of the people. Judge Frankland wishes to appear as a just judge, as is evident from his words in granting the Tribunal’s consent to enter some on the register of the conscientious, though he could not agree with their conscience, and against the action of employers who put from employment those whom the Tribunal registers as such. He said all should keep the law as established. It seems to have passed from his mind that the same thing applies to a judge also. If he had paused to enquire about the Society he could have learned that it has been represented in Britain for upward of fifty years, about all the length of his life, and has no other object than to tell the people of the good news of the kingdom of heaven and to lead them to the knowledge and the righteousness of that kingdom, but that now, because of the evil days, and the end of the age, its message is urgent and must be given to the people, according to the command of the Lord himself. Judge Frankland seems in the way of getting the unhappy notoriety which Judge Richardson of Newcastle got by his unwarranted remarks at that Tribunal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Food</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">• Contrary to the reports of food shortage in Britain, which according to reports are broadcast by German propaganda, there is no one suffering because the land is short of sufficient food. It is, of course, the case that foods are rationed, and it is apparent that both what supplies are at hand and those which are confidently expected to be received from over seas must be carefully watched; and, too, that the wastage which always occurs in the countries which are accustomed to abundant supplies must be stopped. The abundance of general supplies hitherto enjoyed is to be curtailed, both in articles of clothing and in general household supplies. Britain will learn that there is a great difference between what has been considered ordinarily necessary for needs and what is actually so; and surely this will be to advantage. Although the weather has not been such as to cause the land to produce the best crops, there is a good average, and much of the grain is already cut and harvested. The farmers are complaining that the prices fixed by the Ministry of Food are too low, especially so in the case of potatoes. At a Lancashire farmers’ Union meeting it was said that cabbage and cauliflower had to be sold, if sold they could be, “at giving-away” prices, and a suggestion is sent to the general Union to see if the Ministry of Food will put restrictions on the sale of canned vegetables while the fresh are plentiful. This gives an illustration of the difficulties of the Ministry and serves as an example of what could be if the whole land were placed as under a general housekeeping arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Religion a Racket</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">• The London </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Express</span><span class="font8"> spreads itself to tell of this “Conchie Sect” which calls religion “a racket”. A reporter went to a service meeting and in an otherwise harmless account tells of the proceedings. He has nothing ill to say, though his report would leave the impression that only sales of books was considered. This newspaper distinguished itself some years ago after one of Judge Rutherford’s ipeetings at the Royal Albert Hall. In-tendinf to do an injury, it did a good thing; for it gave long extracts from the speech, and a prominence which would have cost many hundreds of pounds if the publishing had to be paid for. So now; for two to three millions of readers will see the heavy heading that Jehovah’s witnesses declare religion is a racket.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Knock, Instead of Lourdes</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">• Now that France is under enemy control, the great pilgrimages from England to Lourdes cannot be “run”. Now the Roman Catholics are working up a shrine in Knock, in Eire; for not only must the business be kept up, but the poor of the flock must have something set before them. Lourdes has been a very profitable affair for the Roman Catholic church, and perhaps they will be able to convince these dupes that their saint Mary win work some similar miracles for the poor in Ireland, now that they cannot get to her shrine in Lburdes.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Dogs</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">• There are nearly 3,000,000 dogs in Britain, about 2,700,000 for which a yearly license is paid as tax, the others being farm and sheep dogs, and any under six months old. Some agitation is raised about the food supply of this large number. Of course, the dog-lovers declare that their pets and companions do not eat the food which should feed the people. Perhaps not—and perhaps much otherwise!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font8">♦ The League of Nations made history in the close of 1939 when, in the same week, Italy’s withdrawal went into effect and Russia was expelled for doing in Finland what Japan did in Manchuria ten years ago. After the League patted Japan on the cheek for its aggression in China, and was rebuked for it by Litvinoff, the Russian secretary of state, and after all the members of the League refused to even consider Russia’s proposal that all nations completely disarm, it is an odd happening that Russia .becomes one of the moat unprincipled aggressors in history and is expelled for following closely Japan’s example. The League followed up the expulsion by dismissing its Russian undersecretary-general, Vladimir So-koline, from his $13,G00-a-year job. Five of the Seven Dangers of the World are now out of the League.</span></p>

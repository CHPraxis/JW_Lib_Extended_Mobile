<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">THE </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of American Churches</span><span class="font5"> states that a total church membership of 64,000,000 in the United States consists of 38,000,000 Protestants, 22,000,000 Roman</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Yes)</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Catholics, and 4,000,000 Jews. It thus appears that of the approximately 130,000,000 people in the country less than one-half are interested in what the religious systems have to offer. This is not surprising when one considers what the churches hand out to those who pay out hard-earned coin to support them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After twenty years of hard work the joint conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, the Methodist Episcopal Church South and the Methodist Protestant Church united as one body, at Kansas City, Missouri, and will hereafter be known as the Methodist Church. The new church starts out with 7,856,000 members, making it truly a Great Big Flock. Just a question here. Will the new church relight the old-time hell-fires, once an essential part of Methodism? The answer is, No! The clergy know there is no truth in the doe-trine, and the worst of it, or the best of it, is that the people know it, too. The assets of the business are set at $650,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At a get-together convention of various kinds of Methodists, at Long Beach, California, Bishop William C. Martin made the re. mark that unless something significant should come of the Methodist unification the public would be disappointed, and, in his judgment, so would God be. The god who would be disappointed would, of course, be “the god of this world”, who is the Devil; for the Methodist churches, all of them, whether they know it </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font5">not, exist for the one great object of doing V'-dishonor to God's name and thus doing the will of the Devil, whom they unwittingly \ serve. The very suggestion that God would be - &quot;disappointed” shows that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Judge Rutherford invited the big guns of the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America to defend themselves publicly over the radio on the charge that they serve the Devil and not Jehovah God, the Creator. So far they did not perk up enough courage to say a word, even though eight of the biggest of them were sent personal invitations through the mails. Now two of their trusted employees or associates arc accused of having embezzled something over $8,000 in two years, in hanging on to donations instead of forking them over to the racket itself. That seems to suggest it is best to be religious the regular way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “Right Reverend” Hayward Sellers . Ablewhite, Episcopal bishop of Northern Michigan, is embarrassed because he cannot just remember what has become of some $90,000 of the diocese’s funds. Inquisitive persons photographed some of his checks payable to Tony De Quarto’s night club, the Royal Follies Night Club, Harry’s New York Bar and other similar places where Abie the Bishop was known as a good spender, and then it came out that one of his dearest friends had been a guest in a Chicago jail when the bishop first met him, and that he had induced the bishop to take a flier in the street with the usual result. In a little while now the bishop may have to go to work, and he will be in luck if he can find any farmer that will want him to keep his cattle.—-Zechariah 13: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Lave of Money</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The foregoing incidents suggest that the love of money is a factor in the clergy business. The following items give further proof. These are just picked at random from current happenings, but suffice to show the trend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is thought, generally, doubtless by religionists, that the United States Senate needs to be prayed for. One would think that the clergy would be glad to do this; and they are —for a consideration. It appears that the Senate needed only four prayers during the 1939 legislative session. Chaplain Zebamey T. Phillips went to the prayer mat for. the Senate that many times for his regular salary of $1,680. That is $420 per prayer, which seems rather high. There is no record that the annual stipend was refused in view of the limited service rendered. Now, however, the official praymaster will have to go to the mat every day the Senate meets, and not just occasionally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Akron, Ohio, members of a colored congregation came in contact with the truth and then asked their pastor why they should support him. For answer he lost his temper and said, in substance, “I never did work, and I’ze. not going to start in now, regardless of what you-folks says or thinks.” That was a bad slip, for his members then told him, “Parson, from now on you is getting no mo’ support from us.” If the clergyman carries out his threat he may have to stop eating. .But that might be a help to Akron chickens.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19400221_files/g_E_19400221-3.png" alt="" style="width:43pt;height:47pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Grape Nuts”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At evangelistic meetings of the Pentecostal outfit in St. Joseph, Missouri, on every other night the hell-fire-screech er passed out in the congregation slips of paper with names of different foods on them. All in the congregation were “privileged” to take one and the next night bring that food for the use of the preacher. One lady got a slip marked “Grape Nuts”. That food being relatively high, and the lady not feeling that she could afford the expense, she obtained grape nut flakes instead and took them to the meeting. The next succeeding night a personal slip was handed to her reading “Grape nuts, not grape nut flakes”. But the lady could not see she was being taken for a ride, and still loves the Devil’s religion and hates the truth as much as ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The religious racket in Scotland is worked through the Church of Scotland. The farmers are compelled to pay a stipend or teind (tithe) for the support of this institution, whether they -wish to do so or not. Recently the stipend in some districts was increased and farmers have to pay the new assessments or go to law and pay the assessments and a lawyer in the bargain. And what do the clergy, many of them, dish out for their subjects? Note the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sneering at the Scriptures, the “Reverend”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">T. </span><span class="font5">Vernon, in an address in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">HyndUnd, </span><span class="font5">Glasgow, Parish church, is reported </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to have </span><span class="font5">said that “there was something </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">encouraging </span><span class="font5">about the belief that man was the descendant of a large, hairy and athletic ape swinging from tree to tree, rather than the offspring of ' the dull and uninteresting couple, Adam and Eve, who lived in the garden of Eden”. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As the first couple left the hands of the A Creator He pronounced them “very good”, V and if they had not sinned they would be in ; the garden to this day and the earth would be fast approaching its promised perfect condition. Adam and Eve were sufficiently interesting that they became the ancestors of the “Reverend” T. Vernon. This particular item is not mentioned to their credit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fact that a so-called “clergyman” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">call </span><span class="font5">make statements such as the foregoing </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">still hold on to his ecclesiastical meal-ticket condemns the whole religious outfit. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Vernon </span><span class="font5">is only a sample of a host of clergymen dealing out equally edifying opinions, and the rest </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">them co-operate with these in keeping the system in working order so as not to lose </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">out on </span><span class="font5">the money end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Under the Alb”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Meanwhile the clergy seek to cover their </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ac</span><span class="font5">tivities with an outward appearance of sanctimoniousness. They have a distinct preference for holy garments, generally of the type which in the common walks of life are reserved </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font5">women.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A British subscriber sends in a clipping entitled “Vicar Will Turn Out Trousered Women”, and wants to know why the vicar himself wears skirts. There is a manifest connection between this clerical leaning and the prophet’s statement at Jeremiah 2:34, “In thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents.” Undoubtedly ecclesiastical “Christendom” is guilty of the blood of many millions that have died in wars and other conflicts, practically all of which have been backed by the skirted fraternity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sometimes the proclivity to appear in garb that distinguishes them from real men leads the clergy into odd directions. Here is an example.- The Scriptures forbid a man to put on a woman’s garment (Deuteronomy 22: 5), but nothing in the nature of a command from the Lord is allowed to interfere with religion; not in New England. And so the “Reverend” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">J. </span><span class="font5">Sterling Ward, pastor of the Lakeside Methodist Episcopal church, and fourteen other men dressed as women and paraded back and forth across a stage in Lynn, trying to win prizes in a beauty contest. Three women were the judges, but they fell down on their job and decided that not one of them was fit to receive a reward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One might say that this was bad enough, J but the following is even worse, and one almost / feels inclined to apologize for mentioning it. But the story is included as one of the exhibits in the case. “Reverend” Joe Jeffers has k' a church where one doesn’t have to wear any clothes. At least he and his wfife didn’t when company called. Everything was going along fine, including champagne, when one of the male guests gave a signal, the doors were burst in, and the first thing he knew the “Reverend” Jeffers had been photographed w i t h nothing on except what he was bo in with, and his wife the same, and the next T thing he knew he was ’ arrested for maintaining a religious establishment, or something like that. This was in Los Angeles.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sermons and Their Source-Materials</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The religionists like to convey the idea that there is some relation between steeples and marriage, though there is none whatever. Apparently trying to drum up a</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">little marriage business on the side, a Baptist church at Lakeland, Florida, had a. scries of six sermons on the subject. Some of the titles were “Seventeen and in Love”, “Will lie Qualify as a Husband ?” “Will She Qualify as A Wife?” “Love on Twenty Dollars a Week,” and “The Challenge of the Cradle”._The minister of the church, having not the least interest in the Bible, hut a lot in raking in shekels, . ’probably thought he would get at least a few ■ dollars out of his racket in this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Collcgcside Congregational church of '' Nashville, Tennessee, was greatly uplifted when a dancer by the name of Ted, Shawn danced the doxology and preached on an opening prayer, dancing the Twenty-third Psalm, dancing a sermon, dancing hymns, and dancing the benediction. Some of the men in the congregation pined for a woman dancer rather than a man, but as most of the congregation were women the show as a whole was well received. You might as well laugh. Nobody is looking, and it wouldn’t make any difference if anyone wer e.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the funny sheets shows a dominie in his study getting ready to prepare his Sunday talk. As his wife turns and looks at him he flips a coin in the air saying, “Heads I give them hell-fire and damnation ; tails I preach brotherly love.” The hell-fire business is a lie from beginning to end, and if the world is really in for another general war you will soon see almost all the preachers insisting that brotherly love means murdering your brother on the field of battle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the Philadelphia Baptist temple 72 persons, beginning at</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">3 a.m., and ending at 10:10 p.rn., read the Bible from Matthew’ 1:1 to Revelation 22: 21. Thus it was once again demonstrated that the book can be read in about nineteen hours and that the religionists can be expected to do the fool thing every time. Certainly no one remained to hear the entire reading, and if anyone did he got no more out of it than the others who heard only a part. They were not there to learn anything. It was merely a religious performance, and worthless, to say the least of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Religious Monkeyshines</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Once a year, in January, the religion of the Orthodox-Old Catholic Church in America makes it necessary for one of their bishops to bless the waters of the world, in Greek, and then cast a gilded cross into the waters of New York harbor, when, if anybody has the nerve, and is sufficiently foolish, somebody dives for the cross and brings it up. The bishop has a cord attached to it, so all the diver has to do is to follow the cord. The young man who recovers the cross gets his name in the paper. It is all perfectly foolish, perfectly absurd, but is religious from the word go, and many apparently intelligent people besides President Roosevelt seem to think that what the people need is more religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Something new in the religious business is that Episcopalians are taking an interest in the relic racket. At St. Thomas Protestant Episcopal church, New York city, what was alleged to be the holy grail (the cup shared by the Irord and the apostles at the Last Supper) was on exhibition. The police were requested to pay special attention to its protection, as it is rated as worth $300,000. It was shown only at certain hours. This is a grand preparation for the rush back to the arms of Rome, where such exhibitions are all the rage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Blaming God for everything, and denying absolutely the Scripture teaching that the only hope for mankind is in a resurrection from the dead, the “Reverend Doctor” Harry Emerson Fofcdiek, in a discourse on human immortality, is reported as saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We Americans have flagrantly wasted the natural resources of our continent. We blame ourselves for that and for wasting human resources, being'spendthrift and prodigal in our social disorder with the personalities of people. But if death ends everything, then of all wasters of human resources God is the worst. He forever produces people and throws them away half finished; he creates capacities He never uses.—In New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The ‘‘Reverend Doctor” Harry Emerson Fosdick is pastor of the Riverside Presbyterian church, New York. He issued a statement that when Pacelli was made pope he (Harry) found himself echoing the cry of the Roman crowd, “Habemus Papam” (“We have a Pope”). That will be a big help to the “Reverend” Harry when he gets ready to make the shift to the choice which is in his heart. He can point back to that statement and say to Pacelli and the others, “You see, I was with you right along, but I had to wait for a good chance to break away.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">On the Death of the Pope</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the death of Pope Pius XI, the archbishop of Canterbury, for the first time in four hundred years, publicly notified an official body of the church of England of that event, lauded the dead pope to the skies, and called upon the Church Assembly of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">which ' </span><span class="font5">he is the head to rise and pray for him. This request of an archbishop of Canterbury </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font5">prayers be offered for the repose of the soul of a dead pope of Rome is one of. the strangest bits of news of this strange time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The official teaching of the Presbyterian Church is as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">There is no other head of the Church but the Lord Jesus Christ, and the claim of the Pope of Rome to be the vicar of Christ, and the head of the Church universal, is without warrant in the Scripture or in fact: and a usurpation dishonoring to the Lord. Jesus Christ.—Presbyterian Confession of Faith, chapter 27, section 8,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Dallas, Texas, on the death of Pope Pius XI, Dr. Charles W. Welch, of Louisville, moderator of the Presbyterian Church, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">U.S.A., </span><span class="font5">said (in New York. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">World-Telegram} ; &nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Consider these two statements carefully and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">see </span><span class="font5">if you can figure out why these 2,000,000 Presbyterians have all this sorrow, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">why </span><span class="font5">there should be such great and indescribable </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">loss </span><span class="font5">over the death of one who falsely claimed j to be the vicar of Christ, the head of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">uni- • </span><span class="font5">versal Church. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Southern Baptists are not quite </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ready . </span><span class="font5">to go along with the Episcopalians and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Pres-</span><span class="font5">by ter ia ns—not just yet. The Southern </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Dap-</span><span class="font5">tist Convention, meeting at Oklahoma City, passed resolutions deploring President Roo^e-velt’s act in sending British ambassador Joseph Kennedy to the pope’s coronation and also rebuked Congress for adjourning </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">on ac- , </span><span class="font5">count of the death of Paeelli’s predecessor. It had the courage and the manhood to object to the use of United States troops at the funeral of Cardinal Hayes. Three of the committee were United States senators, all democrats, and they wanted it distinctly understood that they are against the extension of the Social Security act to employees of religious agencieS and to bills pending in Congress to appropriate funds for sectarian schools. The pronouncement said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We oppose the establishing of diplomatic relations with any ecclesiastical body, the recognition j in the Congress of the existence of any ecclesias- ' tical potentate, the extension of special courtesies by our government to any ecclesiastical official </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font5">auch, and the employment of any of the branches held to honor any ecclesiastical leader.—In </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times Star. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Habemus Mariam!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Any person familiar with the Scriptures knows that there is just one mediator between God and man. Mary had a most honorable 3^ place in bringing into the world the one who /• always addressed her as “Woman”, asked her 7 the question “What have I to do with thee ?” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">said explicitly that ^whosoever doeth the h will of my Father in heaven, the same is my brother and sister and mother”. (John 2: 3, 4; 19:26; Matthew 12:46-50) But Mary would never have claimed for herself the role of mediator or intercessor manufactured for her by religionists. Hitherto the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has had a monopoly of mariolatry, but it is spreading to Protestant churches, especially such High Church Episcopalian churches as chance to be under Jesuit influence. On February 5, 1939, one of the Protestant churches in the' Pittsburgh district had a vesper musical service at 4; 30 p.m., and went to the trouble to print the words of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Ave </span><span class="font5">Maria which follows, and which words are unscrlptural and a dishonor to God:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ave Maria mighty, yet lowly, Pure and most holy, Hear from Thy starry throne our prayer: Though faithless friends may grieve us, Wealth and fortune leave us, Grant to our grief and to our pain Thy tender care, Saneta Maria! When we </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font5">tearful, When we are fearful, Give to us thine </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">aid, </span><span class="font5">To us thine aid, Thine aid of prayer! Ave </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Maria! </span><span class="font5">Mother of the desolate! Guide of the unfortunate ! Hear from Thy starry throne our prayer: If sorrow will await us, Tyrants vex and hate us, Teach us Thine own most patient part to bear! Sancta Maria! When we are sighing, When </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font5">are dying, Give to us Thine aid, To us Thine aid, Thine aid of prayer!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. You may' honestly believe the Scriptures, written by holy men of old, who spake as they were moved by the holy spirit. If that is your stand you will believe the apostle’s statement: । We have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin: as it is written: There is none righteous, no, not one.—Romans 3: 9,10. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">R'S| </span><span class="font5">Or, if you do not wish to believe the Scriptures, written by the power of God,* you might wish to believe i<sup>nste</sup>&amp;d ^<sup>le wor(</sup>ls of “Reverend Doctor” Burke Culpepper, evan? gelist, lately working for the First Methodist church of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Cul-</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">' pepper </span><span class="font5">takes no stock in such writers as David, the psalmist, or Paul, the apostle to the Gen-</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FBBRUARY 21, 1940 </span><span class="font5">tiles. He takes more stock in the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Using a strictly Roman Catholic doctrine and expression, and not at all a Scriptural one,'he described the virgin Mary as “Mary, the Immaculate”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Name of the Lord</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An anonymous deity, for some reason, seems to suit the Devil’s purpose. The name of Jehovah was deleted from the Hebrew Scriptures on the pretext that it .was too sacred to pronounce. For almost two thousand years it was kept in the background. At the time of the Reformation the name was again given place in God’s own Word. It appears in such passages as Exodus 6: 3, Psalm 83:18, Isaiah 12: 2 and 26: 4, and Exodus 17:15. It is, further, a part of such common Scriptural names as Jehoshua (Joshua),<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark33">1</a></sup><sup></sup> Jehoiada,<sup>2</sup> Jehoiakim,<sup>3</sup> Jehona-dab,* Jonathan (Jehonathan),<sup>3</sup> Jehoshaphat’ and others. To eliminate the name from the Scriptures altogether it would be necessary' almost to obliterate them; something which the religionists are, as a matter of fact, not averse to doing. While the name appears infrequently in the Common (King James) Version of the Bible, it occurs more than 6,000 times in the original Scriptures, and is likewise used in the American Standard or Revised Version of the Bible, of which every Bible student should have a copy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While lauding the pope and Mary, as noted foregoing, religionists despise the name of Jehovah, which they are responsible for pushing into a corner. They should have published the name of the Lord, instead of obscuring it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The efforts of the Devil to dishonor the Creator progress in every' land. In New Haven, the dean of the Yale University Divinity School, Luther A. Weigle, announced that the name which the Creator gave himself, and which appears over 6,000 times in the Scriptures, will not appear in a revision of the Bible on which he and others are working, “because 'Jehovah’ is not a functioning religious term.” In other words, modern religion has now gone to the extreme length of denying to the Creator the right to even mention His own name. What better proof could anybody desire that religion is the work of the DeviH</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">*Z </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">AM THAT I AM”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In saying that the name “Jehovah” is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font5">a functioning religious term, the clergy stray from the truth, as might be expected. It is, on the contrary, a fact that the name is found in many well-known songs. The versification of the 100th Psalm is an example:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Before Jehovah’s awful throne, Ye nations, bow with sacred joy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This song was sung by Commodore Perry’s sailors when he made his first visit to Japan, and greatly impressed the crowds along the water front of Uraga.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is true, however, that the clergy, and particularly the modernist higher critics, have sought to discourage the use of the name of Jehovah, referring to him slightingly as the tribal God of the Jews, when they should know, and do know very well, that Abraham, the faithful patriarch, spoke of Jehovah as the Judge -of all the earth. These clergymen have further sought to discourage the use of the improved American Standard translation of the Scriptures, not only because it reveals the name of Jehovah wherever it was used in the Hebrew originals, but also because it completely exposes the “hell-fire” error, by showing that “hell” refers to the grave. This error is dear to the clerical mind, and useful in the business of hoodwinking the credulous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Take note how frequently, in the common version of the Bible, occurs the expression, “The name of the Lord,” and reflect how mean&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ingless the words would be if the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lord had not revealed himself by a name. Note that (in Exodus 3) Moses specifically inquires as to God’s name, and his inquiry is answered as Jehovah reveals himself as “I AM THAT I AM”, in verse 14, and identifies that (in verse 15) with “Jehovah”, of which it is a variation.—See American Standard (Revised) Version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In view of the overwhelming Scriptural testimony to the fact that the name Jehovah is of the greatest importance, it is with no patience that one hears the “wise” quibblings and sophistries of those who pretend to teach the Word of God while undermining faith in it. Such quibblers object that “Je-ho'vah” is not the way the Jews pronounced the name. And what of that, indeed? Neither is the English pronunciation of “Jesus” theirs, nor yet that of any other term or word or name in the Scriptures! “Jehovah” is a modern equivalent for “Y H W H”, and comes closer to being a suitable rendering of it than any of the substitutes offered by these same faithdestroying, time-serving, money-loving hypocrites whose prototypes the Lord Jesus so scathingly denounced and excoriated as recorded in Matthew 23 (a chapter which every religionist should read often).</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">He knows, or could know, that Jesus Christ constantly referred to Jehovah God as His Father, and quoted the words of His Father as authority for His own statements. Illustrations (A.R.V.) follow:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Hear, 0 Israel: Jehovah our God is one Jehovah.”—Deuteronomy 6:4. Compare Mark 12:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Thou shalt love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy' might.”—Deuteronomy 6:5. Compare Matthaw 22: 37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God; and him shalt thou serve, and shalt swear by his name. Ye shall not go after other gods.”—Deuteronomy 6:13,14. Compare Matthew 4:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Ye shall not tempt Jehovah your God.”—Deuteronomy 6:16. Compare Matthew </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4</span><span class="font5">: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Jehovah saith unto my lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy foot-stool,”—Psalm 110:1. Compare Matthew 22:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me; be- T cause Jehovah hath anointed me to preach good. <sup>r </sup>tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the cap- <sup>4 </sup>fives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the year of Jehovah’s favor.”—Isaiah 61:1, 2. Compare Luke 4:18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the face of these scriptures, and of the fact that the name of Jehovah appears in the original Hebrew more than 6,000 times in the _ Holy Scriptures, this man with so many selfglorifying titles published a “sermon” under the title “Jehovah, the Little Tribal God”, in which he said, in part,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The American Revised Version is marred by the introduction of the modern, manufactured, meaningless and entirely foolish word 'Jehovah’ as the name of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now turn to Exodus 6:2, 3 and see for yourself that the great Creator states that Jehovah is His own personal name, and see what an appalling fool a man can be.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">At Geelong, Australia, a schoolboy, at the suggestion of his teacher, asked his father if he had ever read any of Judge Rutherford’s books. The father said he would . like to make a bonfire of all Judge Rutherford’s books. Two weeks later his house burned &quot;■&quot;k to the ground, completely consuming a library ./• worth $1000. ITe is a clergyman of the Church ■ of England. (Says Australian </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.) </span><span class="font5">, Was this merely coincident?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Bishop C. Bromley Oxnam, Omaha, addressing the Pastors’ Union in Detroit, seems to sense the truth about racketeering in religion when, in speaking of some of his brethren in the ministry, he said of them :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some of these men think they are ministers, but in truth they are nothing but supersalesmen, back-si appers and politicians gone religious. They are actually promoters, not ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Religion versus Christianity</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. Ralph H. hong, executive director of the National Lutheran Council, in an address in Toledo, said, “The world does not need more religion, there’s too much religion now; but it needs more Christianity.” He thinks the “Christians today could turn the world upside down just as the apostles did after the death of Christ, if they had sufficient sincerity”, 'p That is true, too. lie must have been talking '* to one of Jehovah’s witnesses.

<p><span class="font5">“Reverend” M. D. Lowen. Baptist, of Brockport, New York, stirred things up at a convention of Baptist ministers at Albany. He could see, and stated it plainly, that there cannot be two bosses in “Christendom”, and that with both church and state seeking everwidening powers over the individual, there are bound to be constantly more cases where the individual will bd called upon to decide whether to obey God or man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Referring to the change in the New York State constitution permitting the use of publicschool buses to transport children to sectarian schools, he thought this an unnecessary and undesirable link between the state and the * church, and that it might be “the first stage y <sup>?</sup>'of a courtship which may lead to an unhappy marriage at a later date”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">He also condemned the New Jersey law against Jehovah’s witnesses, which practically places every witness in the criminal class for teaching what the Bible has to say on worshiping images and things, and demanded the repeal of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Reverend” Lowen has manifestly been feeding on the truth. Let it be hoped that he may continue to grow strong in the Lord and the power of His might and come into the full liberty of the light now shining.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Memories of Happy Days</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">S</span><span class="font5">Roy Goodrich writes to Orien W. Fifer, editor of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The, Christian Advocate,</span><span class="font5"> published by the Methodist Book Concern, at 420 Plum street, Cincinnati, Ohio. Fifer makes his living, in part, by lying about Jehovah’s witnesses and quoting Roman Catholic papers to back him up in his false statements. Goodrich reminds him of the happy days of their youth, when they were members of the same “church”, and of some of the holy brethren they knew: the choir leader who paid a $500 fine for selling whisky at his drug store; the Sundayschool teacher who shot his wife’s fleeing doctor and afterwards fled town because of lying with his own daughter; and the man mighty in prayer who gypped an old widow of all her property. And then there was the anonymous letter-writer, and the willing workers that never did a tap of work, and the seminary where both were . taught that, their grandfathers were monkeys, the Bible vvas full of mistakes, the instructors were inspired in the same way as the writers of the Bible, and where the graduates did not know whether or not there is a personal God. Two paragraphs from Goodrich’s letter follow:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fundamentally, your digest errs in adopting the usual Catholic dictum that Jehovah’s witnesses are a sect or cult, espousing the doctrines of one Rutherford, who anathematizes religion, governments, Christianity,—and what not? This dictum is not only false, but has not changed essentially since it sent Jesus to the [tree] ; Stephen to stoning by bigots; Arius to banishment; John TIuss to the flames; and countless thousands to the concentration camps of the Madman’s Third and Catholic Reich. No Christian could be more “popular” with the religious </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">status qua</span><span class="font5"> than was Jesus. It is of Bible record that Paul the apostle was stigmatized as the rabble-rousing ringleader of an unwanted seditious “sect”. (Acts 24:5) Unwittingly, Catholic Action, which you quote with approbation, honors Judge Rutherford with that identical false charge us recorded in The Acts. All witnesses of Jehovah share this honorable reproach; but they are neither a rabble nor rousers, neither a “sect” nor seditious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus was accused of being a young upstart less than fifty years old, of doubtful birth and of no education; of being a deceiver, propagandizing the people with His own personal subversive opinions; and, at the last, of sedition against Caesar and of blasphemy against God! Today, the witness of Jehovah is doing the same work and getting the same pay as did his once crucified Leader. Under identical accusation, he cannot improve upon the answer which Jesus made to His critics, to wit: “My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself,” (John 7:16,17) If such doctrines of Jehovah, and such divine answer by His witness, shock the religious susceptibilities of parochial school graduates (or “Wesleyan” graduates), and arouse their ire to persecution heat, then the witness cannot assume responsibility. Such are fighting against God himself, as Gamaliel once admitted behind closed doors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The &quot;Best&quot; People!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The old story that ‘where religion thrives, i.e., where the churches are, there exist the beat social conditions’ has now been thoroughly exposed. As might have been expected, it is a tale woven out of whole cloth, a fib, a fabrication. In a three-year survey of American cities, Dr. Edward L. Thorndike, of Teachers College, Columbia University, has found that preachers (he wisely refrains from mentioning the priests) and church members are most numerous where “general goodness of life for good people” is at low ebb. That means that the more preachers and churches, the lower down the people. He asks, “What are the churches doing with their prestige and power if they are neither helping the health and education and recreation of a community nor improving its personal qualities of its residents ?” Next time somebody asks you how you would like to live in a city without churches, show him this item.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following may contribute something toward an explanation of the situation. It is, at any rate, an interesting bit of information. Says Jerome Davis, in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Harper’s Magazine:</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19400221_files/g_E_19400221-8.png" alt="" style="width:45pt;height:48pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">In cities and towns of five thousand or over, control of the church is now largely in the hands of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">favored </span><span class="font5">economic classes, Approximately </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">three-</span><span class="font5">fourths of the chairmen of the boaxda-belong to the business groups or are subservient </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">them. Thus there exists an interlocking control of the church by the same capitalistic intereats which control business. The churches themselves-A are huge commercial enterprises. The total value jt of church property in New York is more than ) $282,000,000. This does not include taxable prop- £ erty, such as real estate, stocks, bonds, and cash * awaiting a “profitable” use. The investments of &quot;&nbsp;“ the church represented by its endowments and surplus funds run up into hundreds of millions of dollars. The church organization thus has a tremendous stake in the profit system. The annuity fund for Congregational ministers alone has large sums invested with 54 railroads, 9 governmental agencies, 2 industrial corporations, and 43 public utilities. In addition, it has stock in the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, in the General Electric Company, and in vast real estate holdings. A single institution, Trinity Church in New York eity, has real estate valued at' $16,000,000. It has an annual income from investments alone of nearly $2,000,000. It is said that the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">aging </span><span class="font5">Trinity Church steeple has' come to lean some eighteen inches in the direction of Wall Street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Church welfare is bound up financially with the welfare of capitalism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The nations (and the churches) do not want God. They want the pope and Mary, and prayers for the dead. Of course, this last innovation must be introduced very carefully; for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Prot</span><span class="font5">estants are still a little wary about “Purgatory” and its proprietors of the clerical tribe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is not known just what organizations go to make up the Protestant National Christian Council of China, but it is known that the Presbyterian Church is in co-operation with it. The Council recently issued a prayer for the dead which reads as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let us pray for the departed. Almighty God, hear us when we call upon thee for all those who have passed into the unseen world. Grant that all that is good in them may be expanded and ripened; all that is evil and um Christ like may be eradicated and all misconceptions of truth may be swept away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The National Christian Council should </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">take </span><span class="font5">a 1 ittle time off to study the Scriptures, of which Jesus said, ‘Thy Word is the truth.’ If they would do that, one of the passages they would run across that would help them to see how much chance the dead have to be expanded and ripened would be the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The dead know not any thing.—Ecclesiastes 9:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “Reverend” Paul Harris, of Auglaize county, Ohio, should shame himself. When all the rest of the “Protestant” clergy were guests of the rector of Holy Rosary Catholic church, St. Mary’s, he had to be out of town, but every other Protestant clergyman in the city was there, at “a dinner, the pleasing mem</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">pries </span><span class="font5">of which will linger long, and add a ...,-phapter to the religious jife of the city”. One </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">can </span><span class="font5">imagine the clergy who attended that feast as making a big fusd over Roman Catholic encroachments on American liberties. That is, he can if his imagination is big enough, but he would surely have to have a big one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Shades of Martin .Luther! Two miles from Ossining, New York, a prominent Catholic, Major Edward Bowes, donated his estate to the Lutheran Church for use as a retreat. Lutheranism, and all Protestantism, is in retreat, sure enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Archbishop Derwyn T. Owen, primate of the Church of England in Canada, has written to the Canadian prime minister assuring him the clergy are back o^ him, just as in 1914, and willing to take as many jobs as chaplains as they can get.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&gt; Four students for the ministry went to f Hyde Park, New York, to find out why the <sup>&lt;f</sup>Reverend” Frank R. Wilson had prayed in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">presence of President Roosevelt that King George might “vanquish and overcome all his ' enemies”. They learned that the dominie was thinking only of the king’s spiritual enemies when he-made the prayer, and not of Adolf Hitler; so everything was all right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “dogs” are beginning to bark for war. “Reverend Doctor” J. Frank Norris, of Fargo, Texas, and of Detroit, Michigan, in an interview in Shanghai, China, said, “I shall return to the United States as soon as I can to make <sup>1 </sup>a tour and to go on the radio in an effort to rouse the people of America to the necessity of going to war against Germany.” In due time he will have lots of company among the clergy, whose first loyalty is to the governments of this present evil world, and to the god of this world, the prince of darkness, Satan,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In an address at Washington, Pennsylvania, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">' &lt;&nbsp;the </span><span class="font5">“Reverend” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">C. </span><span class="font5">S. Thomas, Presbyterian </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">j </span><span class="font5">pastor, from Hickory, Pennsylvania, said, in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We used to have wooden churches and granite preachers, and now in mapy instances we have granite churches and wooden preachers. We are deceiving ourselves when we say man-made schemes can rule the world. We are a nation of Biblerejecting, machine-worshiping pagans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of similar import is the statement of &quot;Reverend” Dr. Frank M. Sheldon, Congregational pastor of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, who said to the Federated Church Women of his city:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The United States is not a Christian country. Not even the church is Christian-—it doesn’t dare to be. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So, occasionally some preacher who has not yet got clear of the sinking religious wreck begins to sense that not all is well. The foregoing are examples, and as a conclusion to this brief survey of the state of religion, and particularly effete Protestantism, the following ■ observation regarding the state of “Christendom” is quoted from the' pen of “Rev.” William H. Rogers, of the First Baptist church of New York city:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They tremble at the rim of an inferno to which they have resigned themselves as inevitable. Economic collapse threatens on every hand. All the governments have mortgaged unborn generations to eare for present needs. In the midst of abundance, poverty has multiplied. Fear of the future haunts every land. These conditions are portents of the end-time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The apostasy and worldliness of the organised church have greatly increased. Religious Babylon has adopted the methods of the world and the tricks of the Devil to run the church. Places of worship have been turned into dens of gambling and temples of thievery. People have become lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There has been an increasing intensity of national, religious and class hatred. A civilization which can give truth to such shameful persecutions which have marked the passing year is not worth preserving, “Where is God?” Just where the nations have left Him—-ignored or forgotten!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While here and there a dissenting voice is heard, the clergy of both Catholic and Protestant denominations are drawing closer together, as has been shown. They are building their own kingdom, unwilling to recognize the Theocracy or to abide by its righteous rules. Their efforts will but serve to land both them and their supporters in the ditch. And when Armageddon has cleared the world of these opponents of righteousness a better world will arise, to the vindication of the name of the eternal Jehovah, whom they have despised.</span></p><img src="g_E_19400221_files/g_E_19400221-9.png" alt="" style="width:199pt;height:74pt;">
<h6><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Czechoslovakia Under the Nazis</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">♦ When, last September, the suppression of Czechoslovakia by Hitler became a reality I immediately set out from Prague, where I had been working, to pay a visit to my parents, in order to arrange certain family matters, and to bring back clothing and various indispensable articles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I paid the cost of the entire journey, but the train came to a stop about twenty-five miles from home; so I had to finish the rest of the journey on foot. After walking for seven hours I suddenly found myself, about ten o’clock at night, in the middle of the Czech front-line troops. The sentries pointed their weapons at me, and ordered me to approach slowly. They then examined my papers, and allowed me to pass inside the barbed wire. Half an hour later I arrived in sight of my native village, near which I found an independent body of Sudeten Germans, consisting of armed civilians wearing badges. They commanded me to halt and give the password. I gave my name and stood motionless. The two sentries with fixed bayonets assured themselves by the light of their lanterns that- my papers were in order and that 1 originally hailed from that locality. One of them said to me, “You have been lucky to get as far as here alive. All the week firing lias been going on, and there have been a number of killed and 'wounded. We are now going to take you to the commander’s quarters.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I almost thought myself dreaming wdicn </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">found they w<sup>r</sup>ere leading me to the house of the parish priest. “Ah,” said I to myself, “here is yet a further proof that the Roman Catholic clergy are meddling with politics and supporting the rebellion.” (According to the Munich agreement my native country came under the dominion of the German Reich on the 6th October 1938, but German troops w-ere in occupation ten days before that date. The Czechs, desirous of avoiding new conflicts, did not offer any effective opposition to that anticipated occupation.) “But,” I reflected again, “perhaps the priest has been compelled to put his house at the disposal of the insurgents.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, I soon recognized my error when I saw the said ecclesiastic in the midst of the commandant’s quarters, issuing orders and transmitting information by radio. If only all Catholics could hjive seen that disgraceful spectacle of a traitor at work, their eyes would perhaps have been opened.. If I had not per- L sonally witnessed these things I would never ’ have believed that such close collusion ex- ! isted between the clergy and the Third Reich. A.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As soon as 1 entered the room I was ordered to give the German salute “Heil Hitler”. The usual “Good morning” and “God bless you” are considered anti-Nazi salutations, and are therefore condemned. But in spite of several punches in the face and. kicks in the back, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">could not bring myself to pronounce the blasphemous salute. I tried to show them that salvation eould come only from God and Christ Jesus, as set forth in Acts 4: 12 and Revelation 7: 12, but my words were wasted. While </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font5">was being searched the sergeant major forcibly struck me on the head with four notebooks and a bunch of keys found in my pockets. “What did the keys mean?” he shouted at me. 1 bent my head forward just in time to av6id receiving full in the face a necklace of glass beads, which I had intended as a gift for my young sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two booklets, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Warning,</span><span class="font5"> by Judge Rather- </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">y </span><span class="font5">ford, and a copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and an- \ other of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> were confiscated. One of j' the searchers said, “T know' those books. A f man came to my house offering them. 1 took ' him for an unemployed beggar, and offered him some small change. The fellow<sup>7</sup> refused it, saying he was circulating the publications, not for money, but in obedience to God. So I threw the Lord’s messenger out.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Commander Schnitter came, he first questioned my persecutors, and then delivered himself of the following speech.:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Young man, I know those books. I have read a number of passages in them, and I must say they contain many flue things. But they are for us, and not for you. What </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">you</span><span class="font5"> want is plenty of hard work, which will not leave you a minute for thought, but in the evening will send you exhausted to bed, so that you will be glad to go to sleep.

<p><span class="font5">At two o’clock in the morning ! was taken to be locked up in the town prison. However, as it happened, the warden knew me well, being one of our tenants. For this reason I was merely detained, and not locked up after all. I handed over to my acquaintance some money for my father with a request to inform him of my presence there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the morning I had to face a volley of insults from the municipal council. Some of the mildest of these were “Salve of the Jews!” “Traitor!” “Czech spy!” After this I was again conducted to the parish priest’s house. Towards midday my father and younger '^&quot;''brothers and sisters had permission to visit ,'me and bid me farewell. I was then taken in an *’ automobile to the general commander at Jauernig, where I was onee again cross-examined, This was done by five civilians, and took place in a large hall. The officer commanding was an engineer. This examination again furnished me with the opportunity to say that the only Higher Powers are God and His Son, Jesus Christ, and that apart from them there is no salvation for anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the Germans ironically asked me, “What would you do if I proceeded to kill you with a revolver bullet?” I replied, “I have no fear of that. You can kill me only if God permits it, and if He allows me to be slain, He will raise me up in His own due time, and for that act of murder, the greatest of all crimes, He will punish you severely.” The Nazi was filled with rage and shouted, “It’s always your God. If I drag you by your feet onto the railway line and leave you there, Will your God help you then ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All at once </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> change occurred. The commanding officer entered and said, “It is probable that you will return to your native village:” Things began to alter. I was given a meal consisting of an excellent omelette, and then again I had to set out.

<p><span class="font5">major, who had at first been like a raving madman, was suddenly transformed. He tried to convince me of the greatness of Germany, spoke of the possibility of my working in the Third Reich for a good wage, and then once more became threatening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you now choose to throw in your lot with the Czechs, you will be expelled by them as a German. Over there, too, the unemployed are more num er -ous than ever. And if you afterwards return to this district you will be looked upon as a spy and a traitor, and you know what fate is reserved for them. Now go to your home, and come at midday tomorrow, and tell me what you decide to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following day I presented myself at the appointed time. “Well, have you made your decision? You are remaining at home, are you not?” asked <sub>;</sub>the officer. “No,” I replied, “I live at Prague. I have work there, and I am returning to it. Kindly give me a passport, so that I may have no trouble with the troops.” My questioner became furious, hurled a flood of insults at me, and finally said, “You will have no passport. I don’t give my signature for the Bolsheviks of Prague. Get back there if you can.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Well, to conclude my story. I did get back. I feared that I should be shot in the back when I passed through the cordon of sentries, and knowing how often this had happened to my Christian brethren in Germany, I expected no better treatment. I had a narrow escape, but my God, in whom I trust, delivered me from the net of the fowler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Two of Jehovah’s witnesses in the district have already been taken away to Germany, and nothing has been heard of them since. Their relatives are persuaded they are dead.

Thereupon Jehovah’s witnesses went all over town playing the record ‘Why the Clergy Oppose the Truth’, with the result that many stated that they were all done with the brand of hypocrisy the evangelist had been dealing out; that he has no Christianity and that they had had the evidence with their owm ears.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Baptism with Fire and Water</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">D</span><span class="font5">USING the World War, when the newly trained soldiers were led into their first active encounter with the enemy on the firing line and came through it alive, it was said to be their “baptism of fire”. This expression was plainly a counterfeit application of the words of John the Baptist, to wit: “He [Christ] that cometh after me is mightier than I, ... he shall baptize you with the holy [spirit], and with fire.” (Matthew 3:11,12) The “fire” baptism evidently refers prophetically to the fire of the battle of Armageddon, which baptism oi' immersion will be the destruction of all of the Devil’s organization, and protection to those who find refuge in Jehovah’s organization. That “fire” will be a time of tribulation such as the world has never known ; and never again will it occur, because it will completely destroy the wicked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">John came baptizing with water. Later Christ Jesus sent His disciples forth with the commission to teach the people and to baptize them. (Matthew 28: 19, 20) It is the duty of every one who is a witness for Jehovah God to teach his fellow .creatures the truth, which includes the privilege of baptism, which baptism is administered in the name of Jehovah and Christ Jesus and of the holy spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When John the Baptist came as the representative of the Lord he commanded the Israelites to repent of their sins against their law covenant with Jehovah God and to be baptized. (Matthew 3:1-11) Those who did repent and were baptized testified thereby that they had changed their course of action and that they would rio longer be guided by their own selfishness and would gladly obey the will of God. Those who had not violated . the covenant, but had been faithful to God, had no need to be baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">W Baptism, therefore, symbolically and out-'• wardly testifies to an agreement to do God’s * will. If a man believes on the Lord Jesus</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christ as his Savior, is it necessary for him to ' then be baptized in water? Yes; and when you understand the purpose of baptism you will readily agree. When Jesus reached the age of thirty years He met John at the river Jordan and requested John to baptize Him in the water. John at first declined, because he did not understand the purpose. Jesus replied to him: “Thus it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then John baptized Him. The baptism of Jesus in the water was an outward testimony that Tie had agreed to do the will of God, Jesus said: <sup>£</sup>Lo, I come to do thy will, 0 God.’ &quot;My meat is to do the will of Him that sent me.’ (Psalm 40:7,8; John 4:34) When Jesus came up out of the water, a voice from heaven was heard saying, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” Thus God expressed His approval of the act of obedience on the part of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ does not mean merely a mental conclusion that Jesus is the Son of God and Savior of the . world. It means much more than that. It means that the person agrees to be governed by the will of God and not by the will of another. Belief, therefore, includes the act of consecrating oneself to God, which means an agreement to do the will of God, thus exercising faith. In that manner the person is justified, and, being justified, he has access into God’s favor. ( Romans 5:1) In order to continue to receive the favor of God he must continue to do the will of God. He having agreed to do God’s will, the proper thing for him then is to declare, confess and witness that he has so agreed ; and this he does by submitting himself to be immersed in water. The real baptism is the consecration or agreement to do God’s will, and the water baptism is the outward confession in the presence of witnesses. Baptism is therefore a proper step for every person who has given himself to God through Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Is baptism, then, required of everyone who is in a covenant to do the will of God? Yes, because baptism or immersion in -water is a symbol outwardly testifying that the person thus immersed has surrendered his selfish will to do God’s will. To such God provides protection. Immersion, in symbol, says: T have put myself entirely under the command of Almighty God, and by ITis grace I will do His will.’ It is to such that God furnishes His protection and guidance. When the Israelites left Egypt under the command of Moses, all of them agreed thereby to obey Moses as God’s representative; and Moses w'as a type of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Christ. They followed Moses across the dry bed of </span><span class="font5">the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Red </span><span class="font5">sea, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">made </span><span class="font5">possible by </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s </span><span class="font5">miracle. The cloud of the Lord’s presence was above them, arid on either side the separated waters of the Red sea. They were thus hidden or immersed &quot;in the cloud and the sea. “Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea.” (1 Corinthians 10; 1, 2) Then the apostle adds: “Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death; that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.” (Romans 6:3,4) As the Israelites were hidden, shielded and protected by reason of their baptism into Moses, even so those who are baptized into the death </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">Christ are hid with him; as it is written; “For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.” (Colossians 3: 3, 4) The members of “the church, which is his body”, “the body of Christ,” must therefore be “baptized into his death”, which baptism is entirely separate and distinct from water immersion and has nothing to do with water immersion. (Romans 6; 3-5) Such also receive the baptism with the holy spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Does that mean that every person who is baptized in water is baptized into Christ’s death? No; because only those are baptized into Christ’s death who are accepted by Jehovah as a part or member of the <sup>&lt;r</sup>body of Christ&quot;, begotten of the spirit of God, and called to be members of the royal capital organization of Jehovah God. Concerning such it is written, at 2 Timothy 2; 11,12; Tf we be </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">dead </span><span class="font5">with Him, we shall also live with Him; if we suffer with Him, we shall reign with </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Him.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">There are many persons who believe on the ■ Lord Jesus Christ but who are not called to a </span><span class="font5">place in the heavenly kingdom </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of God, yet </span><span class="font5">love God and desire to serve </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Him. </span><span class="font5">All </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">such as </span><span class="font5">have agreed </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">do God’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">will give evidence of </span><span class="font5">such agreement by performing the symbol </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">water baptism. Then, having agreed to do the will of God, such persons must study </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">His </span><span class="font5">Word and thereby grow in knowledge and an </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'-y </span><span class="font5">understanding of His will. In this manner one V takes his stand on the side of God and Christ . and continues to maintain his integrity to- ■% ward Jehovah. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Who may administer baptism to another? . $ Are the services of a religious clergyman </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">re- • </span><span class="font5">quired? The services of a clergyman are not required. Any man who has consecrated him- <sup>1 </sup>self to do God’s will may act as administrator in baptizing another. Is it necessary for that administrator to use any form of words at the time of baptizing another ? No; it is not necessary for him to use any words whatsoever. It is proper before administering water baptism to say to those who are about to be baptized words to this effect; “You have confessed that you were born sinners, and you have </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ex* . </span><span class="font5">ercised faith in God and in Christ, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">at-</span><span class="font5">your request </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">will baptize you </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font5">the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">au</span><span class="font5">thority of God and Christ Jesus exercised in ’ the spirit of the Lord,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who will form the “great multitude”, the Jonadabs, will not die as human creatures Jr and be resurrected as spirit creatures. (Revelation 7:9,10) They are not called to the heavenly calling, and therefore are not a part of the kingdom of heaven. They find life eter- .' nal on the earth under The Theocracy, the King and the Kingdom. They are therefore not baptized into the death of Christ. Should those who claim to be Jonadabs be baptized in water? Yes, if they have consecrated themselves to do God’s will. By that means they declare that they have taken their stand on the side of Jehovah God and His Theocratic Government.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“Old man,” said a fellow pilgrim near, “you arc wasting your strength with building here; your journey will end with the ending day; you never again will pass this way; you’ve crossed the chasm deep and wide; why build you this bridge at eveningtide ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The builder lifted his old gray head; “Good friend, in the path I’ve come,” he said, “there followeth after me today a youth whose feet must pass this way. This chasm that’s been as naught to me to that fair-haired youth may a pitfall be; he, too, must cross in the twilight dim. Good friend, I’m building this bridge for him.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Maybe you would like a look at the high-minded financiers and patriots as they were brought to view by historians after the World War was all over. Tf the soldiers had known about it they would have punctured them first of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Germany had based all her calculations on a swiftly conducted war and an early victory. At the outset she had a supply of war stocks which could scarcely have carried her through a year of warfare on two fronts. The Allies, therefore, could have brought the Kaiser to his knees before the end of 1915, by instituting an economic blockade. But that would have meant giving up the choicest profits of the war: the contraband commerce. Throughout the first three years of the war the Reich received an uninterrupted stream of supplies through Holland, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries, especially cotton, without which she could not have continued to tight for a day. This went-on until America angrily protested that England, Germany's chief adversary, was crowding her out of the European market. German capitalism had not neglected its opportunities either; right up to the beginning of 1917, the Krupp ■works of Essen shipped a quarter of a million tons of steel a month through Switzerland to the Comite des Gorges in France. In addition to payment in gold, one of the conditions in this deal was that French aviation was to refrain from, bombarding the iron-ore mines, the blast furnaces and the rolling mills of the Longwy district which had been occupied by Germany early in the war. Ships loaded with nickel from New Caledonia, destined for Germany, seized by French destroyers in open sea and brought to port at Brest and Cherbourg and there declared prizes of war by the maritime court, were ordered released by the French government and reached Bremen safely.

In other words, many thousands of owners of little homes in Cleveland are not able to pay their taxes. They still have Profs over their heads, but are liable to lose them at any time. Taxes have to be paid, and here is a $1,000,000 bet that these poor people that cannot pay will lose their homes and that others will get their properties who will pay back the $1,000,000 borrowed, and the inter-, est on the loan.

A super-patriot high-pressure flag-waver did considerable shouting at the marchers, all to no avail. Then he preceded them to a small square, waving a large flag so vigorously that he nearly fell down, as the flag was of quite some size.

<p><span class="font5">The San Francisco </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font5"> said wisely and kindly, “What folly it is to imagine that the flag is honored by a salute extorted from an unwilling person, no matter what the reason for unwillingness!” and then, referring to a specific case where a conscientious little girl was forced to give up her education, the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font5"> went on to say, “Condemning her to ignorance is a measure to impress her with the blessings of Americanism.

They stayed here, slept between white sheets, and ate white man’s food—a bullet-proof proposition.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the Fort Myers (Fla.) </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">News-Press</span><span class="font5"> Jesse M.

<p><span class="font5">Referring to the unmanly way in which some Florida newspapers prostrated </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">them-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">selves before a foolish flag-salute ruling of the Supreme Court of that state, the Tallahassee (Fla.) </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Democrat</span><span class="font5"> said,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">' We tremble for the supposedly inalienable rights of American citizens under $ueh Faseistic interpretations of the bill of rights. And we view with shame the low estate to which Florida journalism has fallen, at least in some quarters, that the traditional and constitutionally authorized guardians of freedom of the press and, through that, all freedom have accepted with complacency and even with approval a judicial attack on the citadels of Americanism, democracy and liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Nazi form of flag salute has been in use at the Roosevelt Public School at River Edge, New Jersey. The only difference was that the stars and stripes were used instead of the swastika; but that is a mere detail which coiild be overcome as soon as the'eoun-try has been seized by the totalitarian gangsters. This got under the hide of the River Edge teachers, and of themselves they changed the form of the salute, so as to make it a little less like that demanded by Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A WPA worker who could not afford to lose her job risked it rather than salute. She said of her relations to her fellow workers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I was surprised at the favorable attitude of the ' other employees at the stand I took, and it gave me a better chance to witness to them. A Catholic lady who had called me a radical a few days before, and said she did not like my God for being so unfair as to let only 144,000 go to heaven, was frightened on my behalf; she told me to pray, to think again, and to talk to the elders of my church; and yet she agreed that I was right and that it was a violation of God’s law. She said, “But you and your family are facing starvation I” A week later she and thirteen others were laid off. I am still working.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That there is something wrong with the flag-salute test of good citizenship or honest Americanism is suspected by a large number of wide-awake and alert editors. The following is an example of editorials dealing with the subject:</span></p>

Yet in Germany there are underground movements against Hitler about the accomplishments of which we hear daily. No fewer than 23 persons have been beheaded within the month for spying or military sabotage. Something nearer 23,000 have been sent to prison for distributing anti-Nazi literature or listening to shortwave anti-Nazi broadeasts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every one of them, when a street parade passes, salutes the Nazi flag. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Russia every man, woman and child salutes the Soviet red flag. He also pays the most servile verbal obeisance to Joseph Stalin.

<p><span class="font5">■ There are those among our native 100-percenters in America who believe a forced salute to’ the flag i£ a guarantor of loyalty by tbe saluter.

<p><span class="font5">MMMM God or Old Glory—Which comes first! Some may say the flag. It’s what you believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The longer wo live tbe less respect we have for rules and regulations. Down at Fort Myers four children are dismissed from public school because they refused to salute the American flag. Impulsively, and with a sneering reaction to isms, you may say: '</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“That’s right. There’s no reason why every student should not daily swear allegiance to Old Glory. After all, she’s our flag.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These Fort Myers children, however, have a very good reason why. Turn to your Bible, they say. Read in Deuteronomy:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Thou shalt have none other gods before me. Thoirshalt not make thee any graven image, or any </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONSOLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You may further proclaim, in defense of our educational rules and regulations:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’ &quot;Oh, those people are erackpots, We can’t write </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>1</sup> laws </span><span class="font5">for those who think in such a narrow, con</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">fined </span><span class="font5">conception.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <sub>t</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">; But, who knows who is a crackpot in this day and time? To define one as such to ehd an argument is bigoted, weak, and displays a lack of per-eeption, an inability to think things out. Let’s see if the anti-saluters are actually crackpots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We read that item in the paper and telephoned Mr. Carl Hanton, who runs the newspaper down there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;What about these children who were kicked out </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">school?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“They are members of Jehovah’s witnesses. They come from good American stock. The father of one fought in the Spanish-American war; the brother of another is in a CCC camp, graduated from local schools, before students were required to salute the flag, with highest honors. The father of another was lieutenant of police here for years. They’re good people—there’s nothing wrong with them, except they interpret a salute to the Sag as ' setting up an image higher than they would set up</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. These people, then, are conscientious objectors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ The U. S. Government, which has seen more of ' them than the educational or legislative systems Of Florida, takes them in their stride. Uncle Sam didn’t ask the father to raise his hand to the flag —it only wanted him to go to Cuba and shoot the Spaniards to pieces or get himself shot open running up San Juan Hill. Unde Sam, when it inducted a brother of one of the students into CCC, didn’t make a fuss when that young man told his superior he would not salute the flag at retreat.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Florida didn’t shoot its flag objectors.

<p><span class="font5">♦ The “Reverend Father” Thomas F. O’Donnell, of Jersey City, arguing for the teaching of religion in the public schools, stated that in a certain eastern college the freshmen showed a lack of knowledge of the Teh Commandments. That is quite conceivable. Indeed, as recently shown in these columns, the Roman Catholic Church omits the second commandment (“Thou shall not bow down thyself to any graven image,” etc.) altogether, and splits the “Thou shalt not covet” commandment into two parts, to dodge around the fact that God gave; ten commandments and not nine. Inasmuch as religion alone is responsible for this insult to Almighty God, it is easy to see what would happen if all students in all schools should come under the influence of these birds in long skirts. After a while the only commandment the students would know anything about would be one made up for the occasion and reading, substantially. “Thou shalt bow down thyself to the boys in skirts and to nobody else.”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>The Vatican Goes Garbage-Can</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">♦ A Kingdom electric flasher sign advertising the good book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font5"> brilliantly shines forth its message from one of the large windows on our front porch. It stands for The Tiieocbacy of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus in a neighborhood that is largely Catholic but which, of course, claims to serve God. A few days ago, however, whim we were all at service meeting, advantage was taken of the blackout and the contents of our garbage can were emptied on the side of the porch where our electric flasher serves when we are at home; and, this not quite satisfying the appetites of the undercover men, they put a dead rabbit under the doormat and then picked up mud and smeared it over the windows around the flasher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On arriving home and opening the door to our enclosed porch we immediately smelled Catholic Action! That same old smell and action, the answering of facts with garbage and mud, either literal or otherwise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A few days later, on a back-call, the above was related to a, person of good will.

So, at least one * good result from the emptying of the “Vatican” on our front porch. The dead rabbit indicates that all religion is just what it is— superstition; and the mud is what the common people get in their eyes when they listen to religion.

<p><span class="font5">♦ In view of th9 fact that adequate police protection was flatly refused Jehovah’s witnesses when Judge Rutherford spoke at Madison Square Garden on the all-important subject of “Government anil Peace”, one 'wonders just why there were 300 police on hand to preserve order when Earl Browder, one-time candidate for president on the Communist ticket, lectured there to raise funds for his ; defense on the charge of obtaining American passports fraudulently. When Judge Rutherford spoke the meeting was free, and there were no collections. When Browder spoke tickets were 35e to $1.00 each. Judge Ruther- ‘ ford showed that man’s only hope is in The , -Theocracy.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of His Own ♦ It </span><span class="font5">is well known that Hitler does not mind murdering his best friends, if he is jealous of them. That is the real reason why the courageous General von Fritsch was shot in the back while with the German army, in Poland. Hitler was afraid von Fritseh would become the head of a new and decent Germany. Only a few weeks after the bumping off of the man who had been commander-inch ief of the German army, the eighth attempt was made to assassinate Hitler, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">the old beer hall at Munich, but he escaped unscathed to continue his work of deviltry.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Murders in Concentration Camps</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Murders in German concentration camps are not to be considered as out of the regular routine. There is plenty of evidence that, from Hitler down, every Nazi feels at liberty to murder whomever he pleases. But in the early part of October there was a special murderfest in the concentration camps, the admitted object being to get rid of inconvenient personalities, terrorize survivors and make room for fresh victims. In this the Nazis are only following the example set by the Inquisition, &quot;blessed” by numerous popes.</span></p>

It consists of the worship of nature and ancestors. <sup>z</sup> Tt is directed to some eight million gods, at the head of which is Amaterasu Omikami, a female, the sun goddess, the great ancestor of the Japanese imperial house, to which belongs the present emperor, a direct descendant in unbroken line through about 2,000 years. Other gods are of the sea, rivers, wind, fire, mountains, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The people devoted to Shinto worship also well-known warriors and loyal servants of the imperial house. To accomplish spread of Shinto, a shrine was recently established at Los Angeles, California, dedicated to a Japanese god and also to George Washington and to Abraham Lincoln, the object being to introduce the worship of these great American personages in the same manner that Japanese warriors are worshiped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ceremony, Each shrine has a different ceremony, according to its locality. All usually celebrate the national holidays. All shrines also celebrate the rice harvest festival, held at the harvest time. Festival constitutes an expression of gratitude of the people to the gods for the abundant harvest of rice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The people go to the shrines, bow down before the image of the particular god or goddess therein enshrined, and pray before the image. Music accompanies performance of this rite. Instruments consist of drums, gongs and flutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Probably the most famous shrine is Ise Shrine, at Ise, on a small island in the southern part of Japan. Every time an emperor ascends the throne or when any important personage is elevated to a position in the official government his first duty is to go to Ise Shrine to express thanks.—Contributed by editorial department of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Japanese American.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ An odd feature of the Japanese-Chinese war is the rapid industrial development of interior China, brought about by the flight of first one industry after another to keep it from falling into the hands of the Japanese.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ The Chinese Red Cross medical units supplement the medieal staff of many of these. In these hospitals there are 300,000 beds, but most of them take more wounded than there is room for. It is usual for a hospital with 500 &quot;A beds to take 800 or more. How many wounded ’ there are, we do not know in exact figures, A but the figure surely reaches the half-million mark. The Japanese consider it a part of their civilizing work in China to destroy hospitals, Red Cross ambulances, and Army Medical Service ambulances and trucks. On October 19 ' they bombed the 122nd hospital at Chungyang (north of Changsha), killing 200 wounded there, and a ffcw days later bombed the 38th ’ Army hospital. In that week they machine-gunned and destroyed three Red Cross ambulances with the Red Cross on their roofs, six feet across. The}<sup>7</sup>' bombed and machine-gunned six Army Medical Service ambulances and trucks. To them a Red Cross sign is nothing but a target.

<p><span class="font5">♦ The people of the United States believe in advertising their wares, and so it came about that when the c!ty of Changsha was wrecked by Japanese bombs, and one was dropped near the Yale-in-China hospital, but failed to explode, the finders saw, cast in its surface, the stirring news, “Made in Erie, Pa.” In .this instance the finders were stirred, not with pride, but with shame, for it chanced that they were Americans, and in sympathy with the Chinese people,</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ Shanghai, with 200,000 destitute war refugees within its boundaries, and with other hundreds of thousands of war refugees who have money of their own, or have employment, is undergoing an artificial wave of prosperity. Great numbers of new homes and office buildings are going up, yet real wages have declined and hundreds of armed criminals are arrested every month. Outside of the foreign, concessions there are known to exist twenty open gambling dens, eighteen opium hongs, and many houses of prostitution paying tribute to the Japanese-created reformed government of the new China. Once Japan is in full control of China, the people of Shanghai expect to see all the foreign concessions returned to the new China and the prosperity-wave will be ended.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark95"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark96"></a>Japan So Sorry Britain Objects</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">♦ Japan has long been looking for an excuse to put the screws on Britain and other powers holding concessions in China. The excuse has been found in four Chinese who took refuge in Tientsin. Japan is saying, in no uncertain terms, that from now on she will look after the little matters that have heretofore engaged the attention of British, French and other foreign interests in China. It is an interesting game of chess, wherein the various diplomatic, commercial and other moves are for a considerable stake. The British gave up the four Chinese, but appear to have gained but little in so doing. The Japanese continued to surround the concession with electrified barbed wire and sentries and interfered with the . taking of food into the area. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">♦ To protect their widely scattered interests the British cannot afford to court Russian favor at the expense of Japanese disfavor, nor can they make a deal with Japan (to win her away from the Rome-Berlin axis) without considering what such a move would do to her relations with China and the United States. A Shanghai businessman, asked about the probable outcome of the Sino-Japanese conflict, remarked, “it looks now as though the British would win it.” The British are anxious to keep the friendship of both Japan and Russia; Japan as an enemy would endanger their Australasian possessions. British policy haa been to keep on good terms both with China and with Japan during the conflict.</span></p><img src="g_E_19400221_files/g_E_19400221-27.png" alt="" style="width:64pt;height:73pt;">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">British Comment</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By J. H emery (London)</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark99"></a>The Current Scene</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">• At </span><span class="font5">the time of writing signs are appearing that the freedom from bombs which almost the whole country has had all the time since the declaration of war is about to be broken into. It is to be expected; for the strange ways the war has taken must come to an end either in , the peace which the pope has been trying to bring about or in the dread destruction which is the accepted manner of conducting national conflicts in these very civilized and advanced days of human progress. A little while ago almost every person seen in the streets and lanes carried a gas mask, in the hand or slung over the shoulder, but of late it could be said that the practice has dropped; the mask carrier is rather the exception to the general road user. That the dugouts, the hiding holes from aerial bombs, have not had to be used during the- winter months is one of the things for which folk are thankful; for the rains and the bitter cold of many of the past days have rendered these places danger spots, perhaps as dangerous to general health as they were— and are—expected to be life-saving. Government representatives are again warning the people against apathy; but let there come the first phase of that terror which Goering has threatened shall be, and there would be the same sudden rush for the gas mask as was seen when first the fear laid hold of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is a mighty task the Government has in hand: it has taken the care of the millions of the people in these islands. No doubt many things have been muddled, and no doubt there has been much unfair criticism of its doings. Criticism was to be expected, and certainly both its policies and its executives have been open to criticism. Some of its exactions have been relaxed; but it set up, or allowed subordinates to set up many irksome regulations, and bureaucratic Hitlers were rising like weeds in springtime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the minor tragedies of the ■war is the very great destruction of sea birds all around the coast. The free use of oil by ships using that means of motive power had begun</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">to take its toll on the birds; but the destruction of the ships by mines and bombs all round ' the coast of Britain has caused the sea to be much more heavily laden with oil, and the birds have got their wings clogged with it, and perish, unable to feed themselves or to fly. Another effect of the war is noted. In some parts of England there is a great increase of ’ wood pigeons, and they are doing great dam- \ age to the farmers. A bird watcher reporting <sup>k</sup>' on his observations remarks that in the crop ~?<sub>v </sub>of one pigeon there were counted over 1,400 &nbsp;&nbsp;■'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">grains of wheat. It is thought the birds have been scared from their usual feeding groiinds on the continent by the gunfire; but probably the great cold experienced there caused them to seek the milder weather of England. ‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another of the minor troubles of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Gov</span><span class="font5">ernment, though by no means a small affair, is the return to the towns of the children evacuated and planted in the country towns and villages. All the plans made for the schooling of the children are askew, and there are hundreds of thousands of children without the usual educational facilities, so necessary for their help. Undoubtedly the Roman Catholic priests have done much to bring .about dissatisfaction, and some of them have been troublesome agitators wanting to get the children into their care; for the children are the hope of the -Catholic cause. They have not a great hope of converting England to Roman Catholicism, ' though they keep asking their god to do this ’ great thing for them. They report for the year &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;„</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">just passed 11,049 conversions of hitherto &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“misguided” persons to the “true, faith”, and ’’ are thankful for what they can get. At the <sup>1 </sup>same time they continually bemoan the fact ’ that so many called Catholics do not practice their religion—they do not go to mass and they do not pay their money to the priests for his services. In Scotland they report an increase of the Catholic population of 49 persons, a figure which seems to indicate that the urge of the church for larger families is not having much effect in the north country.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark100"></a>Blind Leaders of the Blind</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">• Despite all that Jesus said about His return, to complete tbe work He had begun, and to bring into judgment all those who pro- </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">qt </span><span class="font5">fessed to be His followers, and for the judgment of the nations, the leaders of religion . persist in putting the return into yet far-off .5 ages, or in trying to make out that He did not -say the things recorded as His speech. His</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">words as recorded in the thirteenth chapter of Mark’s gospel, and in the twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew and the twenty-first of Luke, are put in question. Matthew and Luke are said to have; copied from Mark and to have enlarged on their own account, and the authenticity of Mark is questioned. All very eon-x venient for those who know the words smite •a. them, and bring them into condemnation as * false witnesses. The two chief features of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">-records of Jesus’ ministry given to us in the , four Gospels are, the facts of His works and &lt;&nbsp;sayings in the limits of Galilee, Judea and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Samaria, and what He told of His return, when all things connected with the witness of His faithful disciples in their task of “wit-■ nessing” to the ends of the earth should be brought into judgment. He said to His disciples when He was on the point of leaving them, till such time as He should come again, “Ye shall be witnesses unto me . . . unto the uttermost part of the earth”. (see Acts . 1:8,11). This witness is certainly not limited to the faet that He had come, and had died in order to provide a way of salvation from the guilt and power of sin. The foremost thought in the minds of His disciples as they walked with Him to Bethany was about the kingdom which He had spoken of so much and so continuously. When Jesus said to them, “Ye shall ‘ be baptized with the holy spirit, not many v days hence,” they said, “Wilt thou at this time . restore the kingdom ... Jesus, told them they should understand what He meant when He had said He was going away till the time &gt;. should come for His kingdom to be established in power in the earth (see Matthew 14-20), and all other things necessary for their work as apostles, when the holy spirit had come on them. On the appointed day the spirit came on them; they understood, saw that there must bp a time for His witness to go to the ends of the earth; but there is nothing clearer in all that is recorded of their work and in their writings than that they witnessed to the fact of the Lord’s return, and that through false teachers and a general apostasy there would be a world condition of religion and religionists such as existed amongst the Jews, and which He had faced, even unto death through His faithfulness in the commission given to % Him by His Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Religionists, misled willingly by false teach-</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span class="font5"> ers and ambitious men, have seized oh certain IL words picked out from the words of Jesus and His apostles, and have perverted them so as</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FEBRUARY 81, 1940 </span><span class="font5">to cause the multitudes of their followers and supporters to believe that the church organizations they have built up are the kingdom of God of which Jesus spoke, and quite frankly they do not believe that He wdll come again in the manner He said, nor until they have brought the world into belief in them and got it into subjection to their various religions. His words are a stumbling stone to them;-those which they cannot pervert in meaning, they try to convince themselves and others that He never spoke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For many years past it has been the good pleasure of God to enlighten men and women who would listen to the truth of the Scrip' lures that the time for the establishment of the Kingdom was at hand. As the time for its establishment drew on it has been His good pleasure to gather a company, true sheep of Christ, who should declare that God had set His King on His holy hill of Zion, and that the Kingdom is now established and is in operation. Jehovah’s witnesses have carried this message, to the blessing of thousands of persons of good will, and at the same time have given the warning of the eoming judgments to those who oppose the truth of His kingdom. All along the long line of the religious front, Roman Catholies at one end and Plymouth Brethren at the other, bitter and evil things have been spoken with the purpose of discrediting the honesty of these faithful disciples, and physical injury has been done to many of them, but the witness goes on and wiU continue until the Lord’s words have been fulfilled. He said, “This gospel </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">of the kingdom </span><span class="font5">shall be preached in al I the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall the end come.” —Matthew 24:14.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark101"></a>“Their Eyes They Have Closed”</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">So said Jesus of the clergy class of His day and in respect to His words. Also, He said “their ears are dull of hearing”, and this be* cause they had so acted towards the privilege of service they had for God and His people as to get their hearts set for their own advantage out bf their professed service for God. The sound of the truth does not reach their “hearing”; the physical facts in the state of “religion” even after nearly two thousand years of their operations amongst the people, and those terrible things which have come upon humanity, are not seen by them as having any relationship to the words of Jesus about His return and the time of judgment. The arch-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">29 </span><span class="font5">bishop of York, speaking of these matters, says, “I think that in. the 13th chapter of Mark, and in the chapters in Matthew and Luke, our Lord is stating permanent principles concerning the divine government of the world, with the imminent fall of Jerusalem as an illustration.” The bishop of Birmingham inclines to the opinion that these words are wrongly ascribed to Christ, and &quot;does not think that such teaching can be rightly applied to the present age”. Another “light”, of some authority, says, “I do not think that we are in any way committed to a belief in our Lord’s second advent in person in the sense in which the term would be commonly understood.” What he means is, of course, that he does not believe the Lord will come and disrupt the work of the churches and cast them off, saying, “I never knew you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because in the past some have thought that the great upheavals in the nations have been portents of the time of the second coming of the Lord, they try to persuade themselves and their followers that these things will never be, and thus they class themselves as the scoffers of these last days, those of whom Peter said, “Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.”—-2 Peter 3: 3-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Will They See? Will They Hear?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">• It is certain that as a class they will not. They have refused the light which God has caused to shine in their darkness, and they are inextricably bound up with the interests of the kingdoms. That they have lost their grip on the people, especially since the Great War, they have to admit. That religionist must fight religionist in a national death struggle is a fact which they know condemns them. In Germany the religionists, whether Roman Catholic or so-called “Protestant”, are “fighting Britain for the deliverance of the nation against aggression”, and profess to believe they are thus serving God. In Britain religionists are throwing their weight into the fight to “destroy the terrible thing which has drenched mid-Europe with blood, and threatens all Europe with the same terror”, and they verily believe they serve God in so doing. Politicians and their supporters are beginning to realize that the war now entered into will bring greater changes in the conduct of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">30</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">national interests of the countries involved than those which resulted from the last world war; but </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">leaders of religion fear </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">even </span><span class="font5">worse things for themselves: they see ‘the kingdom. of heaven’ (as they name their church systems) swallowed up in the destnic-tive storm. These things, coming up like a darkening cloud, will drive them together for. , . self-preservation, and, as the Scriptures show, they will ultimately be found in a union supporting the kingdoms in opposition to the “ kingdom which God is now fully establishing : under Christ according to the Scriptures. ■</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark102"></a>Pity the Poor Bishops</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">• After all, the bishops have their domestic troubles. The late bishop of London, who was always in the limelight, told every now and again that though he received £10,000 a year salary he was nevertheless a poor man. His palace and his expenses cost him more than he received .for his services. There is no reason for thinking other than that he told the truth. All the same, there are multitudes of folk who would not at all mind being poor in the same ■ conditions. Now the bishop of Ely, whose remuneration is £4,000 a year, says he would welcome a chance of sacrificing £1,000 a year if he could move out of his palace. He would go into a six-room house, he says. At that, he . should be able to do fairly well; for his rental would still leave him a good margin for his bishop’s expenses. The bishop may not vacate his palace; nor may be “let” any part of it. He is in the case with his palace as he is with his theology: he is bound hand and. ■ foot with both. Ely palace has 54 rooms, mostly closed; those in use for the eight servants, three gardeners and a chauffeur at the service of the bishop and his palace and grounds.</span></p>

The same V, gentleman also states that on one occasion he I ’was detailed to guard the life of a priest at Lamont, Illinois, because his parish had \ threatened to kill him after mass.

<p><span class="font1">1940 YEARBOOK </span><span class="font7">of Jehovah’s witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font5">HE THEOCRACY is the hope of man. There is no other hope. For this hope and the publication thereof Jehovah’s witnesses stand accused before all the nations of the earth. They welcome the opportunity and the privilege of standing in this position, by the grace of God, therefore following in the footsteps of his beloved Son, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year just closed Jehovah’s witnesses have put forth their earnest endeavors to make known the name of the Great Theocrat and the Theocratic Government, of which Christ Jesus is the King. Anointed to be the King at the age of thirty, and more than nineteen centuries ago, he was enthroned as King in 1914 A.D., and since then has been specifically directing the witness work in the earth. All the nations of the earth are against the Theocracy. Some nations are more tolerant than others, but there is not one nation on the earth the ruling powers of which show Jehovah’s witnesses any special favor. That world-wide opposition, instead of discouraging Jehovah’s witnesses and causing them to cease their efforts, has the very opposite effect, of increasing their zeal for the great government of righteousness. Those who are in a covenant with Almighty God to do his will know that bitter opposition from worldly powers is now just what is to be expected. To his faithful followers Christ Jesus the King says: “And ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.” (Matt. 24: 9) This declaration of the Lord is proved by all the physical facts that have come to pass in recent years. Those words of Jesus make clear the reason for such hatred on the part of the ruling elements of the nations of earth. That hatred</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">is not because Jehovah’s witnesses and &quot;companions” are bad or that they do anything to interfere with the property or personal rights of the people, or that they are doing anything against the general welfare of the people; but that hatred is because his witnesses and companions boldly and fearlessly proclaim the name of Jehovah God and his King, Christ Jesus. The Lord Jesus was hated and persecuted when he was on the earth. He suffered because he was righteous, because he was his Father’s representative and proclaimed the name of Jehovah God and of his coming kingdom. The witnesses for the King now on the earth, and who are therefore enjoying a like privilege of announcing Jehovah’s name, are also privileged to fill up some of the sufferings Christ Jesus left behind for the benefit of those who should be associated with him in his righteous government. Says the apostle: &quot;Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the church.”—Col. 1: 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No religious institution nor any of the members thereof suffers as did Christ Jesus and for the same reason. No religious system or institution nor the members thereof proclaim the name of Jehovah, the great Theockat and announce his Theocratic Government by Christ the King. As to The Theocracy, the religious institutions are either silently or openly in opposition ; therefore they do not and cannot suffer for righteousness’ sake and the proclamation of the name of Jehovah God. There appears, however, to be a large number of persons held within the religious systems because they have been ignorant of the truth, and which persons have a desire for righteousness; and it is to such honest and sincere persons of good will toward God that Jehovah’s witnesses and companions are now rendering aid and comfort, that such people may learn the right way, know that Jehovah is the Almighty and the great Theocrat, and that his King, Christ Jesus, is the Redeemer and the One who administers life everlasting to those who obey the laws of the Almighty God. It is the time for the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and this witness must he given just before that complete vindication. God has so ordained it, and so it shall be.—Ex. 9:16.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark2"></a>UNSELFISH</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The work in which Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions, the Lord’s “other sheep”, are engaged is done not for any selfish reason, and certainly not for any pecuniary gain or worldly honor that might come to them. Their work is done at the command of the Almighty God; and because they love him and rejoice in the opportunity to obey his commandments they engage willingly in said work, regardless of opposition. They know that God is love, therefore wholly unselfish, and that everything he does is unselfishly done. They know that God is the fountain of life and that to him belongs salvation, and their great desire is for his salvation and full approval. Jehovah’s witnesses are not carrying on a campaign to gain members to their ranks. They are not propagandists. They are not a sect or denomination. They are a company of men and women who have individually taken their stand on the side of the Lord and who jointly go forward in obedience to his commandment to publish the Theocratic Government and to make known to the sincere people of earth God’s gracious provision for man’s salvation. When they have obeyed the Lord’s commandment to tell the truth as long as the door of opportunity is left open, their responsibility ends, because as soon as the witness work is completed God will exercise his unlimited power in the vindication of his name. Then he will assign to his faithful servants other work to do. As they now go forward in publishing The Theocracy it is for those who hear the message to elect to either serve God and live or reject the message, remain where they are, and suffer eternal death. The witnesses of Jehovah, having faithfully performed their commission and duty, will then rest content as to whatever may be the result. They ask no favors of men, but ask only to be given a respectful hearing as the representatives of the Lord. They know that the will of God shall be accomplished, and with that they are wholly content.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark4"></a>REPROACHES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Few persons understand just why this company of Christian people called “Jehovah’s witnesses” are diligent in their efforts to obey the commandments of Almighty God. Likewise few persons understand just why Jehovah’s witnesses should be so greatly reproached by religionists. That some of open mind may be enabled to understand the true reason, the Scriptural evidence is here submitted. The religious opponents and those who represent them in any and all capacities attempt to belittle the efforts of Jehovah’s witnesses and to class them as a sect of religionists, dub them as fanatics, and wholly misrepresent the work they are undertaking. Let those who desire to know the truth consider carefully what follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God, “whose name alone is JEHOVAH,” is the Creator of heaven and earth. (Ps. 83:18) To him belong heaven and earth and the fullness thereof. (Ps. 24:1) He created the earth and then made man the perfect creature to inhabit the earth and to fill the earth with a righteous offspring. (Isa. 45:12,18; Gen. 1: 28; 2: 7) God created Lucifer and assigned him to the position of overseer or overlord of earth’s creation. It was the solemn duty of Lucifer to work in harmony with the Creator and honor Jehovah’s name, but that he did not. Lucifer coveted the place and the honor which all creation gave to the great Creator, and he set about to turn all creatures against the great Creator. He is therefore designated in the Scriptures as the covetous one. (Jer. 51:13) It is written in the Scriptures that Lucifer said in his heart, that is, to himself: “For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north; I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High&quot;—Isa. 14:13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lucifer concluded that he could accomplish his unholy and unrighteous purpose and desire for honor and praise by protesting against Jehovah God's manner of carrying forward his purpose. Protest, therefore, was a slander against the name of the Most High. He set about to poison the mind of the perfect man against God, and for this reason he resorted to lies that the great name and word of the Almighty God might be reproached and defamed. Lucifer expected that his action against God would work out to his own advancement and elevation. He therefore lied to the first man and woman and induced them to disobey God’s law and to bring upon themselves death. (Gen. 3:1-5; 2:17; 3:16,17) Because of his wrongful act in yielding obedience to the great enemy Lucifer Adam was sentenced to death, driven from Eden into the unfinished earth, degraded and cursed and subjected to a lingering death. Adam was unable to carry out the divine command to multiply and fill the earth with a righteous people, and his inability was due to his own wrongful act. All his offspring inherited death, and therefore it is written: “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.”—Rom. 5:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Following the rebellion and opposition to God by Lucifer the name of that wicked one was changed, and from that' time onward to this day he has been known by the four names, to wit, Satan, Serpent, Dragon, and Devil. (Rev. 20:1,2) Lucifer’s making the attempt to exalt himself and exalting himself brought about his downfall, and God debased him and brought him low, and ever since Satan is the complete expression of wickedness, and in due time shall suffer complete destruction. Of that wicked one it is written: “Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit. They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms; that made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners? All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory, every one in his own house. But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under feet. Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people; the seed of evil doers shall never be renowned.”—Isa. 14:15-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Further describing the Devil it is written in God’s Record, the Bible: “Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so; thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee. By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned; therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God; and I will destroy thee, 0 covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty; thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness; I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee. Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffic; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee; and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth, in the sight of all them that behold thee. All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee; thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more.”—Ezek. 28:14-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By way of a parenthetical statement here, it will be noted that, in all the years that have gone by, men who have desired to exalt themselves to a high position to make for themselves a reputation that they might receive the praise of others have followed Satan’s lead by protesting against that which is right and resorting to acts of wickedness, thereby hoping to accomplish their own selfish purpose. In every instance, also, it will be noted, as the Scriptures and the facts are examined, that he who attempts to exalt himself at the expense of others is certain to be debased by the great One who promotes or puts down creatures. Few men have learned this unchangeable rule set forth in the Scriptures. Those who have appreciated the meaning of such rule have delighted themselves in Jehovah God and rejoiced to exalt his name. Such persons have appreciated the words written in the Scriptures, to wit: “For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south: but God is the judge; he putteth down one, and setteth up another.” —Ps. 75: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The prophet then puts in the mouth of those who love righteousness these words: “But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.”—Ps. 75: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The faithful remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses now on earth and their companions, the Jonadabs, know that every good and perfect thing comes from Jehovah God, and they delight to do his will, and consequently they look forward with hope and rejoicing in the salvation that he will bring to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Turning back now to the rebellion in Eden, be it noted that the Devil had succeeded in causing the death of the man Adam, God’s perfect creature, and then the Devil, filled with pride and malicious hatred, further defied the Almighty God by declaring that he, the Devil, could cause any and all men to curse God to his face and that no man would remain true and faithful to Jehovah God and therefore God was not the supreme one. (Job 2:5) That raised the question of who is all-powerful, Satan the Devil or Jehovah God. All creation would look on and see what would be the results, and this creation included the angelic host of heaven. That all creation might in due time know that Jehovah God is the Almighty One and that Satan is the chief one of the wicked, Jehovah God accepted the challenge of the Devil and permitted him to put forth his best endeavors to prove his wicked challenge. Although Satan had been sentenced to death Jehovah God delayed the execution of that sentence of death until such time as the Devil might have full and fair opportunity to demonstrate the fallacy of his challenge. For this reason God said to the Devil, addressing him under the symbol of an earthly ruler, to wit: “But for this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.”—Ex. 9:16, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This emphatic declaration of the Almighty God proves that in God’s due time his own name shall be proclaimed throughout all the earth and that this must be done immediately preceding the time when Jehovah God would exercise or demonstrate his unlimited power against Satan and all his cohorts. It also follows from that declaration of Jehovah that everyone who faithfully proclaims the name of the great Theocrat and his King and government would be a target against which Satan would launch his great opposition and that in this Satan would be joined by all of his wicked hosts. All the facts prove that this conclusion is correct even as the prophetic Scriptures have pointed out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Following the rebellion of Satan Jehovah God announced his purpose to produce a royal seed, that is, a great governing power, which would act under Jehovah’s command and would destroy Satan and all his power. In symbolic phrase the Almighty God said to Satan: “And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.” Gen. 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “woman” mentioned here is a symbol under which is foretold God’s universal organization that would bring forth the “seed” that would accomplish his purpose, and the seed of- that universal organization is the great and mighty King of the Theocratic Government, which shall rule the world in righteousness. That seed, the King of The Theocracy, is Christ Jesus. (Isa. 54:1-13; Gal. 4: 26-29) A long period of time then elapsed during which the Devil continued to debauch humankind and to bring reproach after reproach upon the name of the Most High. Then God sent to earth his beloved Son Jesus to be a witness to the truth concerning Jehovah’s name and his purpose. (John 18:37) Jesus proved himself faithful to Jehovah and justly received the title “The Faithful and True Witness” (Rev. 1:5; 3:14; 19:11) Every one who is a faithful follower of Christ Jesus, and who is therefore a Christian, must be a witness to the name of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark6"></a>THEOCRACY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The great TheocRaT is Jehovah God, the Almighty One. The Theocracy is the government of Jehovah God, which shall rule the World in righteousness to the praise and honor of Jehovah’s name and which shall fully vindicate his name. The King of that great Theocracy, or the one ruling directly under the command of the great Theocrat, is Christ Jesus. For his own name’s sake Jehovah God sent Jesus to earth. The primary purpose of the coming of Jesus was to vindicate Jehovah’s name, and it is by and through the Kingdom or Theocratic Government that such vindication shall be accomplished. The secondary purpose of the coming of Christ Jesus to the earth and the laying down of his life was that the ransom or purchase price might be provided to redeem and deliver men who would devote themselves entirely to God and his Theocratic Government. (Matt. 20:28; John 3:16; Rom. 6:23) Jesus came in the name of bis Father. His Father’s name was put upon him, and all that reproached Jehovah also hated Christ Jesus for his name’s sake. And even to this day all who faithfully represent the Lord Jesus are hated for his name’s sake, and w’hieh hatred against them is manifested in the worst manner by hypocritical religionists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Theocracy is “the kingdom of heaven” because it is the government of Jehovah God operated from heaven by his duly appointed representative, Christ Jesus the King. At the time of his baptism at the Jordan Jesus was anointed by Jehovah as King. (Matt. 3:16) Then Jesus began his work of bearing witness to the name of Jehovah God. His very first discourse, and each one thereafter, magnified Jehovah’s name. The first time he spoke to others, following his anointing, he said: “The kingdom of heaven is at hand.” (Matt. 4:17) That was literally true for the reason that Jesus, the King, was then and there speaking to those who heard him. For three and one-half years thereafter Jesus went about amongst the people visiting them from house to house in the towns and villages, telling them the truth concerning his Father, Jehovah God, and of his kingdom. At all times he emphasized the paramount importance of the kingdom, which is The Theocracy, and he specifically commanded his followers to always pray to Jehovah God: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven.”—Matt. 6:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus made known to his followers that others should be associated with him in his kingdom and all of these must meet a specific test. (Luke 22: 28-30) He told his followers that all who would be associated with him must be witnesses to Jehovah’s name and to his great government. (Matt. 28:19; Luke 12:32) A condition precedent to being in the kingdom with Christ Jesus was then announced, that they must suffer with him the reproaches that had fallen upon him, and which reproaches would come by reason of his name and the name of his Father. Jesus was “the faithful and true witness” of Jehovah God and maintained that faithfulness at all times while enduring all manner of opposition, even submitting to an ignominious death as if he was a sinner. He made himself of no reputation. He did not seek honor at the hands of men. He never at any time attempted to exalt himself. In the eyes of the ruling element of the world he “had a bad character”, although he was the only true and perfect character that has ever walked this earth. His faithfulness to God in the performance of his assigned duty merited and brought to him God’s approval, and concerning him it is written: “But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name; that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.” (Phil. 2: 7-11) “Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.”—Heb. 5: 8, 9.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>HIS FAITHFULNESS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Faithfulness of the Lord Jesus even unto death proved that Satan is a liar and that Jehovah God is true and the Almighty One. God permitted the lifeblood of Christ Jesus to be poured out upon the earth and accepted the same as the purchase price for sinful men who repent, believe, and then faithfully obey and serve Jehovah God. Jehovah God then raised Jesus out of death. Jesus died as a man; he was raised from death as the immortal spirit creature. His resurrection was complete proof of the supremacy of the Almighty God and was Jesus’ reward for faithfulness. The death and resurrection of Christ Jesus make it possible for men who have been born in sin and shapen in iniquity to meet the requirements that the Lord has placed before them and to be delivered from sin and become servants of Jehovah God and receive from him through Christ Jesus the eternal blessing of life everlasting. These mighty, undeniable truths Christians know, and they delight to be permitted to be in a class with Christ Jesus as witnesses to the name of the Most High.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>OPPOSITION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In opposition to God, and to further reproach the name of Jehovah, the Devil tried to bring about the death of the babe Jesus, but failed. (Matt. 2:12-17) From the very hour when Jesus was anointed to be the King the Devil tried to destroy Jesus. (Matt. 4:1-11) This the Devil did in his endeavor to carry out his wicked challenge to Jehovah and to further reproach the name of the Most High. During the three and one-half years that Jesus went about doing good, preaching and teaching the people of and concerning the kingdom of Jehovah, the Devil constantly reproached him and tried to kill him. Because of his love and zeal for doing the will of Jehovah his Father, Jesus literally suffered and constantly bore reproach at the hands of the Devil and his agents for the sake of His Father’s name. It is therefore written concerning Jesus: “I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother’s children. For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.”—Ps. 69: 8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the beginning of his earthly work God gave to Jesus twelve men as his disciples and companions who should walk with him, be taught by him, and under his direction teach and comfort others. All of that number except one stood the test of persecution and proved faithful to God and to their Leader. That one exception was Judas Iscariot, who, because of his selfishness, fell away to the Devil and is designated in the Scriptures as a traitor, “the son of perdition,” and is used as a type foretelling a larger class of persons who become unfaithful and betray those who are faithful to God and Christ Jesus, and who constitute the composite body known as “the man of sin”, “the son of perdition,” and which includes the unfaithful clergy and those more specifically mentioned as the “evil servant” class. The eleven faithful disciples of the Lord continued as long as they were on earth to preach Christ Jesus, the King, and to exalt the name of Jehovah and his great Theocratic Government. They at all times stressed the paramount importance of The Theocracy, and for their faithfulness they likewise were reproached and maligned by the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There was a man known as Saul of Tarsus, a lawyer of high repute amongst men, a zealot in the practice of “the Jews’ religion”, and a persecutor of the followers of Christ Jesus. He being sincere in his work, which the Lord knew, in due time the Lord opened his understanding to the truth. He then repented, turned about completely, and became a true follower and servant of Jesus Christ, and his name was changed from Saul to Paul, and the Lord Jesus Christ made him a special apostle and servant to the nations of earth aside from the Jews. This faithful apostle, a true, loyal and faithful Christian, wrote much of the Scriptures thereafter under the inspiration of the spirit of God. He was greatly persecuted by religionists, and in the face of all this persecution he said: ‘Through Jesus Christ we have access by faith unto the grace of God, and we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God; and not only so, but we glory in tribulations also, knowing that tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope, and hope maketh not ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy spirit, which is given to us.’ (Rom. 5:1-5) Again he wrote to his fellow Christians that they must not be pleasers of themselves, but should seek always to please God: “For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.” (Rom. 15:3) Frequently he was arrested and haled before the courts for preaching the gospel without first obtaining a permit from some earthly power, and that same devilish rule still exists in all nations in the land today called “Christendom”, where constituted earthly authorities attempt by law to prohibit Christians from preaching the gospel without first obtaining a permit from a police officer.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>DEFAMERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">All persons who have indulged in the reproach of Jehovah God, of Christ Jesus, and of the followers of Christ Jesus known as Jehovah’s witnesses, have been labeled by the Scriptures and have labeled themselves as the children or offspring of the Devil. It is certain that Satan has selected the means of bringing reproach upon Jehovah God and his servants that would best serve the Devil’s purpose. Following the flood Satan adopted religion as the means of thus reproaching God. He formed religious organizations and has ever since used religion as the chief means of reproaching God’s holy name. Satan first laid hold upon Nimrod and made of him a cruel slayer of beasts and of men; by which means Nimrod became famous amongst other men and was given the name and title of the mighty Nimrod ‘^before [that is, superior to] the Lord”. (Gen. 10: 9) Nimrod then set up a political organization with himself as dictator. He carried on wars of conquest against others. He put all the people in a state of fear of himself and his associates and Jed them into the Devil’s trap and caused them to indulge in the worship of himself and other devils. (Prov. 29:25) Satan, by means of religion, began to turn men away from and against the Almighty God, and religion has ever been his means of reproaching God’s holy name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Nimrod died he was held up before the people as a great one who had been exalted to heaven, and the people were induced to worship the name of that wicked one. Thus the Devil not only organized but has perpetuated religion and has used it to carry out his wicked challenge to God and to defame His holy name. It has been his most successful means of deceiving honest people. As other nations were formed following the organization of Babylon they too were induced to adopt and practice some kind of Devil worship or religion. To bring forth the “seed” and set up his typical theocratic government, to the end that some might be kept in the right and righteous way at the coming of the great King, Jehovah organized the faithful descendants of his friend Abraham into a nation, which nation is designated in the Scriptures as Israel. He also used that nation to make prophetic pictures or dramas foretelling his purpose of setting up the Theocratic Government. The nation of Israel was in fact a typical theocracy, organized to safeguard that people from the wicked influence of the Devil religion. God commanded them that they should have nothing to do with those people or nations that practiced Devil worship. He assigned the Israelites to the land of Palestine. He gave to that people his law covenant and commanded that they should be diligent to obey his law and be ready to serve him. He sent that people into the land of Palestine to take possession of it and to drive out the Devil worshipers who opposed the theocratic government and reproached Jehovah’s name. Therefore God said to his faithful people that not only should they have nothing to do with religion, but they should destroy those who practiced religion and who wrongfully held possession of their God-given lands: “And thou shalt consume all the people which the Lord thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them; neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.” “The graven images of their gods shall ye bum with fire; thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein; for it is an abomination to the Lord thy God.” (Deut. 7:16, 25) God thus warned the Israelites that religion would ensnare them. (Judg. 2: 2, 3) The Israelites fell under the influence of the Devil and adopted the Devil religion and therefore turned to the worshiping of idols and images, and merited and received punishment at Jehovah’s hand: “They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the Lord commanded them: but were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. And they served their idols; which were a snare unto them. Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils.”—Ps. 106: 34-37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Because the Israelites adopted and practiced religion God cast them away from him. When the Lord Jesus came to the Israelites he found the leaders among them, called “Pharisees”, and who constituted the clergy of that time, teaching the people religion and religious practices based upon the traditions or teachings of men. Jesus reproached them for it and told them that they had made God’s law of none effect and had fallen away to the Devil: “Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying, Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? ... Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.”—Matt. 15:1-3, 7-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those religious leaders, the Pharisees, were the chief persecutors of Jesus, and the reproachers of Jehovah’s name. Although they claimed to be servants of God they were in fact the offspring of the Devil, because they had forsaken the commandments of God and adopted and practiced Devil worship. They were constantly reproaching the name of Jehovah God. Therefore Jesus said to them: “If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham. But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God; this did not Abraham. Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God. Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me; for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.”—John 8:39-44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On another occasion Jesus told those same religious leaders that they were hypocrites .and a generation of vipers, bent upon doing injury to everyone who was seeking to honor and serve Jehovah God. “But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men; for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men’s bones, and of all uneleanness. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous. Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets. Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers. Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers! how can ye escape the damnation of [gehenna] Matt. 23:13, 25, 27, 29, 31-33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mark this emphatically, that it was the religious men that reproached the name of God and Christ Jesus and that caused Jesus to be charged with all manner of wrongdoing and to be prosecuted and convicted of high treason and crucified as if he was a wicked creature. It was the religious clergy that tried to keep the people in ignorance of the fact that God had raised Jesus out of death, and they attempted to accomplish the same by bribing men with money and inducing them to commit perjury concerning the resurrection of the Lord. Why did they persecute Jesus and attempt to keep the people in ignorance of the truth concerning him? Because they were the dupes of Satan and did the bidding of Satan; in order that Satan might carry out his wicked challenge to Jehovah God and continue to reproach God’s holy name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>MARTYRS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Devil saw to it that all the faithful prophets of God who prophesied concerning the coming Theocracy were cruelly persecuted. They suffered all manner of punishment, and many of them were foully murdered. In every instance the Devil used the religionists to accomplish his wicked work. At the eleventh chapter of Hebrews, written under inspiration of the holy spirit, Paul describes some of these faithful men. He had once been a religionist and now, having become a true Christian, could fully appreciate the condition and circumstances surrounding those faithful men about whom he wrote: “They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword; they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; (of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth. And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise; God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.” —- Heb. 11:37-40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those faithful men are held forth in the Scriptures as examples of faith and faithfulness to Jehovah God and to his Theocratic Government. “Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us.”— Heb. 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The word “witnesses” used in this text is the same as the word rendered “martyrs”. Those faithful men by their very lifeblood bore testimony to the name of the Most High. Setting them forth as examples, the Scriptures record, for the benefit of others who have followed as witnesses of the Lord, these words, to wit: “Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who, for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.”—Heb. 12: 2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Religionists persecuted Jesus because he proclaimed the name and kingdom of Jehovah. Knowing that they would do likewise to all of Jehovah’s witnesses, Jesus gave warning that they would have to suffer like reproach, and this warning is couched in these words of the Master: “If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.” (John 15:18-20) ■That prophetic utterance of Christ Jesus has been carried out and fulfilled against all those who have been faithful in publishing the name of the Great Theocrat and his Theocratic Government and King. Among those faithful ones was the first martyr following the crucifixion of Jesus. It was that man Stephen, whom the religionists caused to be charged with the cvime of sedition. They had him arrested and brought into court. They bribed witnesses to testify falsely against Stephen, and when he stood before the court, and spoke in his own behalf and, above all, to the name of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, the religionists rushed upon him and put him to death. —Acts 6:9-15; 7:54-60.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Saul of Tarsus, then a religionist, stood by and saw Stephen die because of his faithfulness to God. When he became a Christian that vision doubtless was often before his mind, and when Paul suffered for righteousness he delighted to be in the class in which Stephen was found as the follower of Jesus Christ. All the faithful apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ not only suffered reproach but were persecuted by religionists to the very end. Saul of Tarsus persecuted many of the followers of Christ Jesus. When he learned the truth of and concerning the Theocratic Government he immediately abandoned religion, became a Christian, and thereafter strongly contrasted religion and Christianity. He was a living witness to the name of Jehovah God, and he died as a witness to the name of the Most High. At Galatians 1:1-16, in the ninth chapter of The Acts of the Apostles, and in the twentysixth chapter of The Acts of the Apostles, Paul the Christian shows the complete opposition of religion to Christianity. Persecuted from one place to another, when he stood before others in Athens he plainly pointed out to them that religion is demonism. (Acts 17:22, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott)</span><span class="font5"> These facts are mentioned here for the purpose of calling to the attention of others of good will that the persecution of Jehovah's witnesses, the opposition to their witness work, is all due to the Devil and his cohorts and is indulged in for the purpose of carrying out Satan’s wicked challenge to Jehovah God, to prevent, if possible, the setting up of his great Theocracy, and the vindication of God’s holy name.—Ps. 83:4.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>HIS COMING KINGDOM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus specifically instructed his disciples that he must go away and that in God’s due time he would come again and assume his high office as King of the Theocratic Government: “Let not your heart be troubled; ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.”—John 14:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He also warned his followers that the religionists would continue to persecute them, that they must expect this and firmly withstand the reproaches and persecution. “These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended. They shall put you out of the synagogues; yea, the time eometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that be doeth God service. And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.” John 16:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">His disciples inquired as to how they would know of the time of the coming of Christ Jesus and his kingdom, and he gave them evidence, which is prophetic, and which prophetic testimony began to have its fulfillment in A.D. 1914, marking the end of the uninterrupted rule of Satan in this world and the beginning of the reign of Christ Jesus the King. —Matt. 24:3-46.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>“CHRISTIAN RELIGION”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Satan always resorts to lies and fraud to accomplish his purpose. He turned the nation of Israel away from their covenant with God by means of religion. After the death of the apostles religious organizations came into being, and that first religious organization soon labeled itself as “the Christian religion” Other religious systems have done likewise. That one strong, mighty organization of religion is also called “The Roman Catholic Church” and is ruled by a few men designated “The Roman Catholic Hierarchy of Authority”. The work of those dictatorial religionists is carried on under the name of “Catholic Action”, which is another name for all kinds of fraud, chicanery, hypocrisy and political manipulation against the common welfare. That organization has blasphemed the name of Almighty God and the name of Christ Jesus as no other organization that ever existed. Holding itself out, and its leaders, as the representative of God and Christ, that organization at all times has been against the Theocratic Government of Jehovah God by Christ Jesus; not only against it, but claiming that men shall rule the world as the vicegerent of Christ, thus not only reproaching God’s name but denying his announced purpose of establishing the great Theocratic Government by Christ the King. To deceive the people, the Roman Catholic organization claims that God established his church upon the apostle Peter and that Peter was the first pope, and that other men have succeeded him as pope since. This blasphemous statement Peter himself emphatically denies, pointing out that the church of God is built upon Christ Jesus, the Chief Corner Stone, and that all the faithful members thereof are designated as stones in that building. “Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings, as newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby; if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious. To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious, ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded. Unto you therefore which believe he is precious; but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the comer, and a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient; whereunto also they were appointed: but ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God; which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.”—1 Pet. 2:1-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is not one scintilla of evidence that supports the claim that Peter was a pope or that there has been </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> successor of Peter or that any pope that ever existed represented Jehovah God and His kingdom. By means of fraud and deception the Roman Catholic organization has brought the greatest reproach upon the name of Jehovah and his Theocratic Government. Honest and sincere people have been led to believe that the pope represents Christ and that the Catholic organization is God’s church, and thus the Devil has caused the blasphemy of God’s name, and greater reproach to be heaped upon God’s name than by any other means that he has employed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Deceptive doctrines have been promulgated and are still taught by the Roman Catholic organization that lead the people into the Devil’s snare. Among such doctrines is that of “purgatory”. The Catholic organization claims that the dead are conscious in “purgatory”, suffering bodily pain and mental anguish, and that, by means of the prayers of priests on earth, such punishment may be shortened, and that if friends of the dead will contribute money for such so-called “prayers” the same will result to the benefit of the dead. Nothing could be farther removed from the truth than that, because the Scriptures uniformly declare that “the dead know not any thing”, that they are unconscious, out of existence, waiting for the resurrection. By this fraudulent means of “purgatory” millions of money have been wrongfully extracted from the poor to build up the gigantic political organization that has oppressed the peoples of the various nations and reproached and defamed God’s holy name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Catholic organization through its Hierarchy leads the people directly into Satan’s trap, causing them to violate God’s specific command concerning images and the worship of the Devil. There never has been any other organization on earth that has deceived so many people and turned so many away from God and the Theocratic Government as that of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And now let this be noted: The Catholic organization of authority, the Hierarchy, constitute the chief persecutors of all Christians now on the earth. Acting under the direction of the head of that organization, persecution against Jehovah’s witnesses is viciously and wickedly carried on in every country on the earth. Faithful men and women are cruelly persecuted, beaten, imprisoned, and some of them killed, because they publish the name of Jehovah and his Theocratic Government. It is that religious organization that has induced the legislative bodies to enact laws for the specific purpose of punishing the witnesses for Jehovah’s Theocratic Government. That cruel religious organization has installed its representatives in all the municipal, political parts of the governments of earth. They enact ordinances or laws which forbid the preaching of the gospel of the Kingdom by going from house to house as did Jesus and his apostles, making this possible only upon condition that the ones who thus publish the gospel first obtain a permit from a police officer. They well know that any real Christian would not apply to any human authority for a permit to do what Almighty God has commanded them to do. Furthermore, they well know that if application were made for such a permit the police officer would deny it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Roman Catholic religious organization claims that that organization is in a covenant with hell, and frequently uses the expression, “The gates of hell shall not prevail against us.” By that they convince themselves that they are there to rule the world, and frequently say, “Catholic schemes never fail.” But note what Jehovah God has caused to be written about that Devil-made, religious organization. He has permitted them to go on in their wickedness, but makes it certain that in his due time he will avenge his people, vindicate his name, and completely wipe out that devilish religious organization. “Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us; for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves; therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion [Jehovah’s kingdom, The Theocracy, with Christ Jesus the Chief Corner Stone (1 Pet. 2:3-9)] for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation; he that believeth shall not make haste. Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place. And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge’ shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.”—Isa. 28:15-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses, by the grace of God, have proclaimed his message of truth, which message of truth exposes the fallacy of religious claims and shows religion to be of the Devil. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy have long advocated religion amongst the governments, in the schools and elsewhere, until they have induced great political rulers to say, <sup>fr</sup>What we need is more religion.” They have induced the big commercial institutions to say that “we must have more religion or else our government will fail”. But now mark the sudden change.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During the year that has just passed Jehovah’s witnesses, by a wide proclamation of the truth, have advertised to the world that religion is a snare and a racket, and that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy of Authority are the chief ones who set the snares and are the principal racketeers. Jehovah’s witnesses have not made this publication without authority, but have cited the Scriptures that prove beyond a doubt that religion originates with the Devil and is the Devil’s chief instrument. In order now to deceive the people further, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy suddenly changed their tactics. Consequently the public press throughout the earth for September, 1939, at the request of Pope Pius XII, announced “a nation-wide drive to enlist the aid of every American Catholic in a crusade for ‘Christianity<sup>5</sup>”. Such is a further defamation of the name of God and Christ. Jehovah God has never authorized any creature or organization under the sun to launch or carry on a nation-wide drive and a crusade for Christianity. On the contrary, God places his truth before the people in contrast to Satan’s wickedness and permits all to intelligently choose. Those who wish to remain in the Devil’s organization are not driven out; as it is written that those who believe and serve God shall live, and those who do not believe and serve God abide in death.—John 3:35,36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Amongst other things, that announcement for a world-wide Catholic drive says: “Christianity is definitely on the defensive today.” That statement above quoted is absolutely foreign to the truth. Exactly the contrary is true. Christianity today is proclaiming to the world that the Kingdom, The Theocracy, is here, and that the only means of relief, deliverance and salvation for the people is by and through the Theocratic Government of Jehovah God. Christianity warns the people that within a short time Jehovah God, by Christ Jesus, will completely destroy all the governments and systems of this world, including the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Christianity never has to be on the defensive. Christ fights no defensive battles. He will lead in the great battle of Armageddon shortly, which will wipe out the enemy and completely vindicate Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The aforementioned “drive” is in fact a part of “Catholic Action”, the purpose of which is to obtain money from the people and to further draw the people into the enemy’s hand that the American nation may be completely dominated and ruled by a dictator, even as almost all of Europe is now ruled. That one of the purposes of the drive is to get money to further put the people in jeopardy and to advance Catholic Action to grab control of America, note the following, which is quoted from that same announcement made at the request of the pope, to wit: “Formerly generous European countries can no longer contribute funds, which have been cut from 50 to 85 per cent in some cases. As the Holy Father has said, the hope of the missions is in America now. This country’s Catholicism was the gift of Europe, and now is the time to pay the debt.. .. Every wage-earning American Catholic can afford one dollar to become a member of this Society for a year. Those who are more interested can acquire life membership or a family enrollment in a special membership. That is little enough to do on behalf of those men and women who are risking their lives daily in battle zones and in leper hospitals to defend and extend the cause of Christianity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mark how this will help them out. It is claimed that there are in excess of thirty million Catholics in America. One dollar from each one for a year’s membership would be a snug sum, and a life membership or a group membership would run into many, many millions. For what purpose ? To enable Catholic Action to grab absolute control of the American government and rule it by a dictator, just as Nimrod did when Babylon was founded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mark this further quotation from the above: “This country’s Catholicism was the gift of Europe”; not a gift of Christ. If Catholicism were Christian it would be for The Theocracy. Instead it is a broken-down aristocracy of dictatorial demagogues, thugs, and gangsters of Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mark furthermore that the above-quoted Catholic-announced drive says: 'This is little enough to be done in behalf of those who are defending Christianity by engaging in wars in Europe.’ In other words, Hitler the gangster is fighting the fight of Christianity. Nothing was ever farther from the truth than that statement, as every honest man knows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No more evidence should be required than that above from the Catholic organization, to prove that that and like religious systems and organizations are against the great Theocratic Government. The Theocracy will rest ■upon the shoulders of Christ Jesus. His is a government of righteousness, and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy of Authority will have nothing to do with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses have no fight with human creatures, and certainly not because such creatures are Catholic. Their fight is against the devilish doctrines that have so long been used to deceive the people and to defame God’s holy name and to turn them into the Devil’s snare. Jehovah’s witnesses have ho fight against any person because of what he believes or has been taught. The mission of Jehovah’s witnesses is to publish the truth of God’s Word of and concerning the Great Theocrat and the King. It is the truth that enrages the Devil and his emissaries and causes them to fight against Jehovah’s witnesses. In support of this statement that it is the Devil and his emissaries that are fighting against Jehovah’s witnesses, mark the following: “For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.”—Eph. 6:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christ and his followers are against the demons; Christianity is against demonism, and for the Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. Religion is the worship and service of the Devil and his associate demons. Mark the words of the Scriptures bearing upon this point: “And Paul standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: ‘Athenians, I perceive that in all things you are extremely devoted to the worship of demons.’ ”—Acts 17: 22, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Religion is the chief means that puts fear into the minds of the people and leads them into the Devil’s snare. “Hell” and “purgatory” and indescribable suffering are held up before the ignorant people, and they are induced to hasten into the snare of the Devil, and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is the chief instrument used in that devilish work. “The fear of man bringeth a snare; but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe.” (Prov. 29:25) “Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men.” —Isa. 29:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Truly then, as stated, “religion is a snare and a racket,” employed wrongfully to ensnare the people and collect money from them under false representations.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>THE TRUTH NECESSARY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The word of Almighty God is set forth in the Bible, and that is the only safe guide for man. “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” (Ps. 119:105) “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.”—2 Tim. 3:16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah's witnesses are not campaigning to get joiners to any thing or any organization. They are not commissioned to do such a work. Their work is purely to publish the truth, that men may know the right way to go. As followers of Christ Jesus they must publish the truth, and do so. (John 18:37) From the time that Jesus was on the earth in the flesh until now there have been a few persons who have searched the Scriptures that they might learn the truth, and such have looked forward to and hoped for the coming of Christ Jesus, as he promised. Such persons have always been unpopular with religionists and have always been the object of persecution at the hands of religionists. In spite of such persecution and misrepresentation these faithful Christians have pursued their faithful endeavors to learn the truth and to make that known to others. It would not be reasonable to expect them to be in any other class than that class of ones persecuted as Jesus and the apostles were persecuted.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>SOCIETY ORGANIZED</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">About the year 1872 (A.D.) a few Christian persons met together in a little town in Pennsylvania to consider the Scriptures relative to the coming of Christ Jesus and his kingdom. Out of that meeting grew the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">organization afterwards incorporated and chartered for the dissemination of Bible truth. To hold title to property, both personal and real, that they might use the same for the support and onward movement of proclaiming the message of truth, that little body of Christians, in the year 1884 (A.D.), organized a corporation under the name of Zion’s Watchtower Society. Later the corporate name was changed to Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. That organization was incorporated under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania. To further aid the work of these Christian people, the Peoples Pulpit Association, a corporation, was created and organized under the membership corporation law of the State of New York and duly came into existence in the year 1908. Later the name of that corporation was changed and now is the Watchtow'er Bible and Tract Society, Incorporated, of New York. In the year 1914 a corporation, under the name and title of International Bible Students Association, was created and organized under the laws of Great Britain. The purposes of these three corporate bodies are exactly the same. They are similar to three living persons working together in different parts of the earth. The purpose announced in their charters respectively is, to wit: “The dissemination of Bible truths by means of publication, in printed form, and other lawful means.” Such corporations are merely the instruments or tools of Jehovah’s witnesses, that is, men and women who act harmoniously as God’s servants and carry on his work of witnessing to the truth in various parts of the earth. Such corporations are charitable and benevolent, because the people who use the same are moved by love, or unselfishness, in their devotion to God and his Theocratic Government to carry on such work; and because to know the truth of and concerning the great Theocratic Government is absolutely essential to the peoples of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The organization of Jehovah’s witnesses using the corporations above named is known under the generic term “The Society”, that is to say, a company of persons who have but one objective and that to do the will of Almighty God. The authority or ordination or commission of Jehovah’s witnesses is given to them exclusively by Jehovah God and through Christ Jesus, the King of The Theocracy. That ordination or commission of authority was first conferred upon Christ Jesus, and through him extends to all his true followers, and to which the following commission applies, to wit: “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn.”—Isa. 61:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The commandment given to those followers of Christ Jesus is contained in the Scriptures specifically at Isaiah 43: 9-12, Isaiah 62:1, 2, and other like scriptures. “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” (Matt. 24:14) As Christ Jesus is “the faithful and true witness” of Jehovah God, so all who are the true followers of Christ Jesus in faithfully giving testimony to the Great Theocracy, to the name of Jehovah God and to his kingdom are Scripturally labeled and designated “Jehovah’s witnesses”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures and the extraneous evidence brought about by the Lord shows that the year of 1914 (A.D.) marked the time of the second coming of Christ Jesus the King. In that year he was enthroned by Jehovah and sent forth to rule while the enemy Satan is still operating in the earth. Psalm 110 announces that from the ascension into heaven of Christ Jesus the King he must wait until God’s due time for him to begin his reign. The end of that waiting came in 1914, and then Christ Jesus was sent forth in fulfillment of the prophecy, to wit: “The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion; rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” (Ps. 110:2) Then all willing followers of Christ Jesus must be ready to obey his commandments, and that is what Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions are doing. Prior to the coming of the Lord Jesus to his temple in 1918 the Lord carried on what is known in the Scriptures as the work of ‘preparing the way before Jehovah’. Within that period of time many persons abandoned religion and sought to learn and obey the truth of God’s Word. Referring to Christ Jesus, his Messenger, Jehovah says: “Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me; and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in; behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts.”—Mal. 3:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That coming of Christ Jesus, the Messenger and Judge of the world, took place in the year 1918. It was then that he began to test and judge those who have made a covenant to do the will of Almighty God. There was a great testing and sifting that then took place, and out of which came the faithful ones as distinguished from the unfaithful. Those who passed the test were brought into the temple, that is, God’s capital organization called “Zion” and of which Christ Jesus is the Head. Those thus approved were approved for a purpose, as stated in the Scriptures, to wit: “That they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.” (Mal. 3:3) That offering unto God in righteousness is the proclamation of the message of the Kingdom. (Heb. 13:15) Those thus passing that test constitute the class mentioned by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 24, to wit: “Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season ? Blessed is that servant, whom his lord, when he cometh, shall find so doing. Verily I say unto you, that he shall make him ruler over all his goods.”—Matt. 24: 45-47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The word “goods”, as used in the foregoing text, means the Kingdom interests of the Theocratic Government, and those who are diligent in offering unto God an offering in righteousness are designated the ‘faithful and wise servants’ of the Lord who, in obedience to his commandments, look well to “his goods” or Kingdom interests by proclaiming his name and his kingdom. This coming of Christ Jesus to his kingdom is good news, or “gospel”, and all who desire that kingdom and who love righteousness desire to obey his commandments in publishing the Kingdom. To such this command is given: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.”—Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Furthermore Jehovah says to such: “Ye are my witnesses . . . that I am God.” (Isa. 43:10-12) To such Christians God gives a “new name”, to wit, “Jehovah’s witnesses,” and commissions them to tell the truth to the people of and concerning his Theocratic Government. Such persons are Christians because they follow exactly in the footsteps of Christ Jesus to be witnesses to Jehovah’s name. (1 Pet. 2: 21) They must obey the commandments of the Lord, to wit, to proclaim his name throughout the earth, to announce his kingdom. (Ex. 9:16) This they must do immediately preceding Armageddon. Because they publish the name of Jehovah and of his Theocratic Government of peace and righteousness they are the special targets of the Devil and his agents and are therefore cruelly persecuted. Mark now what this little company of Christians, Jehovah’s witnesses, have done and are doing, and observe how their course of action has brought upon them persecution from religionists, and that such has resulted exactly in fulfillment of the prophecies of God written long ago.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>THEIR WORK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The faithful followers of Christ Jesus do not engage in the work of service for any selfish reason. They do it because they love Jehovah and delight to do His will. In the year 1918 there came upon the consecrated followers of Christ Jesus a great test. Their work was stopped by reason of the World War and opposition to the kingdom of Jehovah, and many of the faithful servants were imprisoned upon the false charge of opposing the war. This was to be expected because such had been the experience of faithful men from the early days. Nehemiah, and almost all the prophets and Jesus himself, had suffered under like false charges. The restraint put upon Jehovah’s witnesses by the governments came to an end when the war ended, and in 1919 they were released and began a reorganization of the work they must do. It was in the year 1922 that the Lord poured out his spirit upon all the faithful ones following in his footsteps, and thereby they were enlightened and were instructed. They understood from that time forward more clearly than ever before the work that must be done. In the year 1925, the Lord having revealed to his people the great issue to be determined, they saw that the vindication of Jehovah’s name is the paramount question for decision and that he had commissioned the faithful followers of Christ Jesus to proclaim his name throughout the earth and to make known to those who have a hearing ear that his government by Christ Jesus is the means of accomplishing his purpose. Under the Lord’s direction they went forth in this work for the sake of Jehovah’s name, and the work of witnessing to the people has increased with each succeeding year. It is not a work of men, but it is God’s “work, his strange work”, in which he permits his witnesses to have a part. (Isa. 28:21) This “strange work” means the exposing to the eyes of the people the fallacy and duplicity of religion practiced in the name of God, and making known to the people the true meaning of Christianity that they might understand God’s name and purpose. When the “strange work” ends, then will follow what is described in the Scriptures as God’s “act, his strange act”, meaning his act by Christ Jesus, bringing about the destruction of religion and religious institutions and all other parts of Satan’s organization on earth. When it can be understood that the work of Jehovah’s witnesses is not destructive, but is a warning and a notice to the people of what God is doing and is about to do, such notice and warning furnishes them an opportunity to take the right course. In obedience to the divine command these faithful witnesses of the Lord must continue to ‘preach this gospel of the Kingdom to all the world as a witness before the end comes’. (Matt. 24:14) In doing this they are engaging in their work that Almighty God declared must be done, and which declaration he made in answer to Satan’s wicked challenge, saying: ‘For this cause have I permitted thee to remain, that my name may be declared throughout all the earth, and that I might show thee my power.’ The privilege, therefore, is great for faithful Christians to declare to the nations of earth the name of Jehovah God and of his great theocratic government by Christ Jesus, which shall bring to the earth righteousness and everlasting peace.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>MEANS OF PREACHING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">“To preaeh” means “to proclaim or publish”. All of Jehovah’s witnesses are publishers of the message of Jehovah making known his name and his government. Such publication is done by word of mouth, by distribution of the printed message, by the reproduction of recorded speech by means of electrical transcription and phonographs, and by the radio, all of which brings to the attention of the people that we are in a transition period, the passing away of the old and the coming in of the new. The latter, by God’s grace, is under the supervision of his mighty King, which brings the desire of every honest person. The message of the Kingdom during the past year has been carried foward by the means above stated, and in printed form has been published in seventyeight languages and widely distributed throughout the earth. It may therefore now be truly said that the name of Jehovah God has been declared throughout the earth or at least that declaration has reached almost all the peoples of earth in one form or the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The radio is not the invention of man, but it is the product of the wisdom of Almighty God. Man has harnessed up that power and used it for selfish purposes, but for more than ten years the message of the kingdom of God has been widely proclaimed by means of radio. Only the Almighty God could make it possible for a man to speak in one part of the earth and his voice to be transmitted around the earth. Few realize that such proceeds from the Almighty, and therefore few give honor to His name. No doubt God has caused the radio to be used just as much as he desired it, and when it seemed due time for the restriction of the use of the radio, that has been accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While there has been a greater increased opposition to the Kingdom message during the fiscal year past, and in many of the countries it has practically been completed, a great amount of work has been done during the year. The report for the year preceding shows that at the close of the fiscal year ending September 30, 1938, there had been placed in the hands of the people books containing exclusively an explanation of the Scriptures publishing the name of Jehovah and his kingdom, to the number of 279,025,056. During that year the message was proclaimed by the use of more than 30,000 transcription machines and phonographs, in addition to the radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the close of the fiscal year ending September 30, 1939, the reports show that books have been placed in the hands of the people throughout the earth to the number of 30,459,935, and this brings the grand total of distribution of the Kingdom message, sinee the year of 1920 to the present time, to, to wit, 309, 484, 991. During the fiscal year phonographs and transcription machines used by the witnesses in the field for the reproduction and publication of the Kingdom message have been used to the number of 38,771. At these assemblies the total number of persons that have been present and have listened to the spoken message of the Kingdom repeated by means of electrical transcription are, to wit, 19,100,667. The witnesses in the field have made back-calls on persons interested, and who desire to engage further in the study, to the number of 1,856,382. In view of the comparatively small number of witnesses, the work accomplished during the year in the face of such great opposition is truly the Lord’s doing and is marvelous in our eyes. (Ps. 118:23) Compared with the population of earth the number of Jehovah’s witnesses is small, but the number of these witnesses during the year has greatly increased. The “other sheep” of the Lord, known as Jonadabs and which shall form the “great multitude” (Rev. 7:9, 10), have been coming to a knowledge of the truth, and these quickly enter the service and increase the army of “locusts” that go forth in the name of the Almighty God and his King. Those who have heard and appreciate the message have seen their privilege of joining the army of the Lord in proclaiming his name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>NEARING THE END</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It will be observed from this report for the year 1939 that many countries that have heretofore reported as making progress in the work are omitted. This omission is not due to any lack of zeal on the part of the Lord’s witnesses, but due to the fact that Satan’s organization has crushed their work. Of course, this could not have been done except by the Lord’s permission, and the fact that he is permitting the enemy to exercise such powerful influence is clear proof that the witness work, commanded to be done, is near an end and therefore Armageddon is close at hand. Satan, knowing that his time is short, has increased, and continues to increase, the woes upon the peoples of the earth. Those who have the hearing ear and desire to learn the truth see and appreciate the fact that the end of Satan’s power is near and therefore they hasten to take their position on the side of the great Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Totalitarian or dictatorial power now rules many nations of the earth, and this arbitrary power is rapidly encroaching upon all the nations of the earth. These selfish, arbitrary dictators are supported by the religious organizations, and particularly by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. All the totalitarian nations, and the religious leaders, and particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, bitterly oppose the Theocratic Government. Moved by the spirit of Satan, they have hated and continue to hate and openly show their hatred against God and against his King by persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses. Thus they are fighting against God. By their laws enacted by the various legislative bodies they have framed much mischief, and have employed such mischievous laws to hinder the witness work by arresting and imprisoning many of Jehovah’s witnesses upon false charges and by seizing their literature, and confiscating and destroying it, which literature tells of God’s gracious provision for mankind. It clearly appears that the forces of the Devil are surrounding and closing in on the publishers of Jehovah’s name and kingdom. This is exactly what Christians have expected would come to pass; and as it comes to pass, the opposition and persecution increase, and their faith and confidence and complete trust in Jehovah increase. It is impossible for the opponents, acting under the Devil’s direction, to stop the work of Almighty God and his witnesses until God’s own due time to permit them to do so. This interval of witnessing affords opportunity for Satan and his earthly agents, as well as the invisible ones, to do their very worst against Jehovah and his King. Thus the opponents of the Kingdom on earth will be given full opportunity to identify themselves and show exactly where they stand. These opponents the Lord Jesus designates as “goats”, which he declares shall go away into everlasting destruction. It is to be expected that within a short time great religious leaders of the earth, together with the principal of their flocks, will proclaim this message: “Peace and safety.” This will be accomplished only when they have thought that Jehovah’s witnesses have been put entirely to silence. Note now what the Scriptures say about this matter: “For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.” (1 Thess. 5:3) In this connection the Lord encourages the faithful followers of Christ Jesus, directing his epistle to say to them: “But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day; we are not of the night, nor of darkness.”—1 Thess. 5:4, 5.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>AMERICA (U.S.)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Gradually the Lord has instructed his faithful people as to the meaning of the Theocratic Government. Now they °ee clearly that Jehovah God, the Almighty, is the Theocrat, and that Christ Jesus is his King and Ruler of the world, who is acting under the command of the Almighty God; that Christ Jesus has been enthroned as King; and that he is the One that is directing the work, according to God’s will, that is now going on in the earth concerning the ■witness for the Kingdom. As Timothy and Titus were the representatives of the Lord, acting under the immediate instruction of the apostle Paul, so they foreshadowed the anointed ones now on the earth acting under the immediate command of the Lord Jesus Christ, and which anointed ones are otherwise designated as “The Society”. The earthly part of the Lord’s organization is not a man’s organization, but must be carried on by men under the direction and command of Christ the King. During the fiscal year earnest and studied efforts have been made to strengthen the organization on earth by assigning to positions of service the more mature ones who are wholly devoted to the Theocratic Government. Without doubt the Lord has blessed this effort, as the results show. To be sure, some thus appointed have shown their weakness by attempting to exalt themselves, thinking more highly of themselves than they should think; but such have been quickly removed and others assigned to service in their place. This is to be expected in the light of what Jesus has foretold, to wit: “The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; and shall cast them into a furnace of fire; there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.”—Matt. 13:41, 42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When such have been gathered out from the Lord’s organization no one who is truly devoted to the King shows any sorrow, because God has commanded that they shall not sorrow. The faithful know that the Lord does all things right and that no one can be removed from God’s organization except by the power of the Lord.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>CONVENTIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">For the purpose of making known the name and kingdom of Jehovah, as he has commanded, a general convention was arranged for the year 1939., New York city was the point of origin of the convention program and activities. The convention held in New York was connected by wire and wireless equipment with many other points in the United States, Canada, Great Britain and Australia; and the people, assembled at all these points, simultaneously heard the address given at these conventions. In addition thereto many radio stations broadcast the addresses delivered in New York. The first and second days of the convention were devoted to Bible instruction and field activities. On the third day the principal feature was the public assembly at Madison Square Garden, New York city. Approximately 12,000 persons consecrated and devoted to God and his kingdom attended the convention and took part in the work of advertising the public meeting. They came in contact with much opposition and many threats while thus advertising the meeting. They learned of the bitter opposition to the convention, which opposition was made manifest by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy-Nazi combine. Repeatedly threats were made by such opponents that they would break up the convention, and particularly the public meeting at Madison Square Garden. The facts show that the conspiracy thus formed by the Nazi-Hierarchy was devoted not only to the United States but to other parts of the earth and the conspirators acted together in opposition to the advertising of the Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The subject of the public address delivered at Madison Square Garden on June 25 was “Government and Peace”. All persons who have a desire to see the Theocratic Government in operation and everlasting peace given to mankind would be glad to hear the message on that occasion. Satan and all of his supporters would bitterly oppose. This was proved by what actually did take place. More than 18,000 persons were assembled lawfully at Madison Square Garden to praise and worship Jehovah God. These were eager to hear the program. The public address began promptly at 4 p. m., and within ten minutes thereafter about 500 deluded Roman Catholics and Nazis, led by several Catholic priests, entered the Garden and found seats immediately back of the speaker’s platform. When the speech had proceeded about twenty minutes those opposers, without any cause or excuse, set up a terrific howl, wildly crying out such expressions as “Heil, Hitler 1” “Viva, Franco!” “Kill that damn Rutherford!” thus clearly showing that they had come to the Garden for no good purpose, but that they were there wickedly bent on doing wrong and to disturb and break up a lawful assembly of Christian people. Only such persons as are under the control of Satan and the demons would care to participate in the disturbance of that meeting at Madison Square Garden. Acting under the direction of Satan and other demons, that radical element sought, not only to disturb, but to break up the meeting, and they indulged in all manner of vile language, vituperative expressions, threats, cursings and yells, and assaulted many of the ushers who attempted to quell the disturbance. They did not succeed in breaking up the meeting, but the speech was delivered in its entirety and fully and completely recorded. Similar disturbances were made by a like element in many parts of the United States, Canada, Great Britain, and Australia, but the Lord saw to it that the message was heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy are the ones on earth who arranged and carried out the conspiracy to break up the lawful assemblies as above mentioned, and thus attempted to prevent the people from learning about the great Theocratic Government of peace. This of itself is conclusive proof that the Hierarchy is made up of men who are under the command of the Devil, and their action is in clear fulfillment of the prophetic words uttered by Jesus, to wit, that the religionists persecuted him and that they would likewise persecute all those who faithfully followed in his footsteps in obedience to the commandment of the great THEOCRAT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The convention at Madison Square Garden, together with the other like conventions simultaneously held in other parts of the earth, brought sharply to the attention of millions of people that the Theocratic Government of Jehovah God, by Christ Jesus, is the only hope of peace, righteousness and life for humankind. They learned that all opponents to that Theocratic Government are under the control of Satan. The result is that many honest and sincere persons, those who have been under the control of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in times past, have now abandoned that wicked organization and have taken their stand firmly on the side of the Almighty God and Christ his King. Such sincere persons clearly see now that Jehovah’s witnesses are not against any person because that person is a Catholic, Protestant, Jew or agnostic, but that the work of Jehovah’s witnesses is confined entirely to informing all who desire to hear the truth concerning The Theocracy and to bringing comfort to all who mourn because of the unrighteousness in the earth and who have a desire to see righteousness established on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The effort of the Devil and his agents put forth to break up those conventions not only failed, but enabled many persons to see their privilege of turning quickly to God and the King and serving the Theocratic Government. They see that Jehovah’s witnesses are really their friends because they bring to them the message concerning Jehovah and his King that points them to the way of everlasting life, peace and joy. The detailed account of the aforementioned convention has been published in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger, </span><span class="font5">and it is not necessary to here repeat the same.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>“EVIL SERVANT”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Judas Iscariot, the unfaithful disciple who betrayed Jesus Christ to death, was a type of “the man of sin”, “the son of perdition,” which wicked class in the antitype is made up of the religious leaders and other opponents of The Theocracy. The Scriptures disclose that such class is designated by the Lord Jesus as “that evil servant”, which “evil servant” forms a part of “the man of sin”, “the son of perdition.” That “evil servant” class is composed of those who have received some enlightenment concerning Jehovah’s purpose and have professed to be consecrated to God, and who then manifest that they think more highly of self than they should think and become offended at the manner in which the Lord carries forward his work on earth and manifest their lawlessness by opposing the faithful workers who advertise the King and kingdom as commanded by the Scriptures. Such persons are religionists in fact and have quickly joined their efforts with the leaders of other religious organizations in opposition to God and his King. They pretend to be Christians, but are in fact the children of the Devil. During the year some of these have made themselves known, and their acts speak in proof thereof. They quickly go into blindness and lead others into blindness, and these are the ones whom the Lord declares that he gathers out by means of his angels and who show their bitter opposition to him and his servants: “And shall cast them into a furnace of fire; there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.”—Matt. 13: 42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A sample of those who are of the “evil servant” class, and what they say, is indicated by the following quotation from a letter written by one of them, to wit: “Our class has withdrawn from the Society, and we now study the Bible alone. We do not see the Theocracy, nor do we see any evidence of the presence of the Lord or the resurection of the faithful saints, and we see no evidence that the Lord is gathering the great multitude.” The only conclusion concerning such is that they have gone blind because they have been cast into “outer darkness” and have become opponents of The Theocracy; hence they bitterly oppose the Kingdom publishers. Such opponents ‘wail and gnash their teeth’ against those who are for the Theocratic Government. The faithful expect that such opponents would show themselves, and it is to be expected that they will continue to do so until the “strange act” of Jehovah is performed. The acts of such opponents do not at all discourage those who are fully devoted to Jehovah and his King. Being informed that the fight of the anointed is against the Devil and his host of demons, the faithful servants of Jehovah God and Christ continue to go forward clothed with the armor of the Lord, fighting for “this gospel of the kingdom”.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>PUBLISHING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The work done at the Brooklyn headquarters of the Society is here briefly reviewed, and will be of real interest to those who are devoted to the Great Theocrat.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>OFFICE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The executive or administration offices of the Society are situated at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York. The publishing office and factory are situated at 117 Adams St., Brooklyn. The Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, that is, the Pennsylvania Corporation; and the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Incorporated, the New York corporation; and the International Bible Students Association, the British corporation, are all managed and directed by the administration office at 124 Columbia Heights. The appointments of various places in the Theocratic organization on earth are made from the administration office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All manuscript for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> books and booklets is prepared at the administration office, and then delivered to the publication office. The major portion of the manuscript for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> is prepared at the Adam’s Street office, while some of it is prepared at the administration office. The general administrative work is done at 124 Columbia Heights, where also is carried on a voluminous correspondence. Each and every one in the organization is a servant of the Lord, and their work is done unto the Lord, and not for the pleasure of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every thirty days each and every branch office in operation on the earth, and also the publication office at Adams Street, Brooklyn, make report in writing to the president of the Society, setting forth in detail the work accomplished during the month. At the end of the fiscal year all branch offices and also the Adams Street office submit to the president in writing a report covering the activities of the Society during the year. From these reports the president obtains the data for the annual report published each year in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work is strenuous, but not laborious. Constant vigilance and activity must be maintained, but there is no work amongst men that brings like satisfaction as does the work in the Theocratic Organization. It is a work of genuine joy. When one finds real joy in his work the performance of assigned duty is not burdensome. Looking after those things which pertain to the Theocracy is stimulating and joyful. The real joy is derived from the fact that the Lord’s servants know they will have part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. The workers fully appreciate the statement of the faithful servant of God who was sent to rebuild Jerusalem and who said for the encouragement of his assistants: “The joy of the Lord is your strength.”—Neh. 8:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Strangers who visit the factory, and visitors who see each one attending closely to his duties, marvel at the zeal and earnestness with which the work is done. Often such visitors inquire: “How can you get persons to work like that?” They are told in answer that “all the persons you see at work here engage in that work voluntarily and for the love of it; they are wholly devoted to the Theocratic Government of Jehovah by Christ Jesus; they have an abiding place and ample necessities, and they are joyfully serving the Theocratic Government, always having in mind that Jehovah’s government by Christ Jesus will completely vindicate His name and bring lasting blessings to all persons who obey the Lord”. To all such workers money is good only to further the Kingdom interests. They have no desire for anything except what meets their necessities, and their future hopes and prospects are all centered in the Theocratic Government, where money will be of no value whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The inquiring one then asks: “Where does the money eome from to carry on this work?” and the answer is, “All from voluntary contributions made by persons throughout the earth who love Jehovah God, and who delight to know that his kingdom will bring the desired blessings of the human race.” The truth is that no one can appreciate the work and the workers who is not cons'ecrated to do the will of God. So long has the world been under the dominating and withering control of the Devil that selfishness has become the moving cause for everything in the world. Exactly contrary thereto, unselfishness, or love, is the moving cause for the diligence of the workers in the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The treasurer receives and receipts for all money contributions. That office pays out all money, upon voucher properly drawn, but which shows that it is for the furtherance of the Kingdom interests. No money can be taken from the treasurer’s office without such proper voucher. For the past few years the detailed statement of the money received and paid out has not been published, for the obvious reason that the enemy would use these facts to further hinder, if possible, the work of the Society. The books of account in the treasurer’s office are open to any supporter of the Society who desires to examine the same, but they are not open to the enemy, who w<sup>r</sup>ork against the Lord and his kingdom. A like rule Jehovah God established with the keepers of the temple at Jerusalem, and we are now diligently endeavoring to follow the Lord’s rule, knowing that it is right. At the end of almost every fiscal year it is found that the publication of the Kingdom message has required more money than has been contributed for the same, and then such deficit is made up by further voluntary contributions made by those who really love God and his kingdom and who have a little earthly substance. It is the Lord’s work, and it is carried on in the most economical manner. No person in the organization receives any personal or pecuniary gain from the publication or activities of the Society. Each one receives a nominal sum for expenses. The enemy often charges that millions are made in the sale of books by the Society; but such charge is entirely false. The books are placed in the hands of the people at the least possible cost, and then given to people who are not able to contribute anything for them. The books and other literature arc not “sold”, but contributions are accepted only to be used to further the interest of like publications. The cost of publication always exceeds the amount of money that is contributed therefor. Were it not for the voluntary contributions made by persons who love the Theocratic Government, the work could not be carried on by human creatures, unless the Lord made some other provision. Without doubt the Lord makes the provision for carrying on the work by putting in the mind of those persons who love him, to make contributions of their substance to further the work. To be sure, God could do it without any human activities, but it pleases him to allow men the opportunity of making contributions and thus showing their love and zeal for his kingdom. It is one means of aiding them in maintaining their integrity toward God. Seeing that the work is not that of human invention, but that it is God’s work, we may be sure that he will provide all necessary means to prosecute that work until the very end.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>FARM AND GARDENS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society has and maintains a farm and gardens for the sole purpose of producing the necessary food for the workers of the Society and to provide the same at the least possible expense. During the year the food supply has been ample for the workers at headquarters, and upon which they have fed. It is good food, plain and wholesome, and for which as well as all other things we give thanks to our God.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>PUBLISHING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The printing, manufacturing and distribution of books and other literature is done and carried on from the Adams Street office and factory. During the year it has been necessary to increase the number of workers there and for the workers to put in all possible time in order to supply the demand for books and literature, which have been distributed by the field workers and for the benefit of those people who hunger and thirst for righteousness. Work in the factory and office is done five days every week except during vacation, and often six full days, with night shifts, during an emergency period. When possible, on Saturday afternoons the workers and the members of the Bethel family engage in the field service; likewise on Sundays the members of the family at Bethel and the workers at the factory and office go from house to house and by means of the phonograph and literature publish or preach “this gospel of the kingdom”. It is a busy family, and a joyful one. All there appreciate their privilege of being a part of the Lord’s organization and having to do with the advancement of the Theocratic rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the report of the office and factory servant at Adams Street made to the administration office at the end of this fiscal year the following is taken, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Year's Report for 1939</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The year 1939 was filled with expressions of thanksgiving and real joy on the part of all of us here at Bethel because we have enjoyed and do enjoy privileges of service that could not be compared with any tiling else in the world. Jehovah’s provisions have been abundant; his work plentiful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Production</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Due to the demand on the part of the publishers for literature, it has been necessary to operate the printing plant at 117 Adams Street many more hours than the regular daily schedule. In addition to this regular schedule the brethren returned to their machines and work in the office 38 evenings during the year and 13 Saturday afternoons. To keep up with the demand the press room and other departments were operated on a second shift for a period of 5 days. It was also advisable to keep a small force in the factory and office during the regular vacation, so that the work would not get too far behind during this period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mention is here made of a few reasons for the increased work. During the year we made 2,105,914 more booklets than the previous year. The big item, however, was the tremendous increase in the printing, mailing and office work on the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> magazine. Instead of handling 1,609,200 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers, </span><span class="font4">as was done in 1938, the factory handled 4,441,550 copies, an increase over the previous year of 2,832,350. While the number of bound books did not equal that of last year, the printing required nearly 300 tons more paper than that used on the previous year’s production.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The Society’s publications are printed in 88 languages. During the year publications made in this factory were in 43 different languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To manufacture, the work of the year required 2,343 tons of paper, 94 tons of chip board for covers, and nearly 170,000 yards of cloth. These three items alone are equal to 125 carloads of material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society purchased raw materials for the making of ink, paint and other supplies, and during the year 35,282 pounds of ink were manufactured, 522 gallons of paint, 100 pounds of putty, 63 barrels of paste, and 9,054 pounds of glue. This year the Society began making its own gelatin rollers that are used on the presses, thus entailing another substantial saving to the Society. All of these materials are manufactured within the plant and then used in the production of literature or the maintenance of the Society’s buildings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">New Machinery</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The president of the Society has always tried to make the working conditions at the factory as pleasant as possible, which is all done in the interests of the Kingdom work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Early in the fiscal year new Holophane lighting fixtures were installed in the office. These are the latest scientifically designed lighting fixtures, and although we use the same amount of wattage in the fixture, a very decided improvement in the lighting arrangement of the office was enjoyed by all working there. Two new storage compartments were also built in the office, consolidating all office supplies and reference books, which greatly added to the efficiency of the office, and allowed more space for the expansion of the circulation department, which was required in view of the increase of subscriptions for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> Other office equipment was obtained, such as a new mimeograph, additional adding machine, new typewriters, and dictaphones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To increase the efficiency in the factory a heavy-duty drill was provided for the machine shop as well as a Delta drill press for the carpenter shop used in the manufacture of phonographs. In order to unify the production in the press room, the oldest press the Society had was sold and an order was placed with a press manufacturer for a two-color high-speed magazine, book and booklet press. This new high-speed press is being installed in the factory during the month of October, 1939.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the benefit of the family workers the president of the Society made provision for the purchase of two new Plymouth station wagons which are used regularly in the field service week-ends and evenings. These station wagons, being convertible into light delivery trucks, are used by the Society daily in delivery of small shipments locally to the units of Greater New York city They have proved to be a great saving to the Society in handling freight, in addition to being a real convenience and pleasure to the brethren as an aid in their field service work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Shipments</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The greatest volume of printed matter ever to be shipped from the Brooklyn plant went forward this year. Of the three main items dispatched, booklets took first place, magazines second and books third, as to quantities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The orders for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font4"> the new book of the year, have greatly exceeded the initial orders for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies,</span><span class="font4"> which was released two years ago. In the first twelve months after the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> book was released there were shipped out 1,836,207 copies, but in the first three months the shipments of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation </span><span class="font4">reached the total of 1,008,127. At the close of the fiscal year the unfilled orders for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> were equal to several hundred thousand. Unfilled domestic orders were about fifteen days behind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The shipment of bound books was greater than the factory production. The same is true of booklets. The grand total of books and booklets shipped equaled 28,717,995. The shipments of books, Bibles and booklets compared with those of 1938 are interesting.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">There were four new publications released during the year, the bound book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font4"> and booklets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts, Fascism or Freedom,</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace.</span><span class="font4"> The release of these three new booklets greatly increased the shipments of booklets for the year because of the publishers in the field concentrating on these together with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation. Face the Facts</span><span class="font4"> in English and foreign languages reached an excellent high mark of 11J million copies shipped out in one year; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom, </span><span class="font4">over 8J million copies; and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace,</span><span class="font4"> 2,190,604 copies being prepared for the &quot;Theocracy” Testimony Period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The books </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font4"> enjoyed a very good distribution during the year, their combined shipping total being over half a million.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of the total amount of literature shipped out 3,100,821 books and booklets were printed in foreign languages. The remaining 25,617,174 shipped oul were in the English language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Shipments of Sound Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Production of the phonographs was not equal to the demand in the field for this instrument of reproducing the Kingdom message. During the year 9,860 phonographs were, dispatched, but as the year closed we were holding orders for 1,178 machines. It is hoped that in the next few months we shall be able to catch up on these orders and all additional orders. The Brooklyn factory has shipped out 34,075 phonographs since we began manufacturing them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There were 25 complete sound-car equipments shipped out to various parts of the world. The greater witness being given by phonograph, this instrument is taking the lead in the reproduction of the Kingdom message. The phonograph can be had with three discs of the lectures on a contribution of $10, which covers the cost of the portable phonograph and the records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Recordings</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thousands of sound machines, phonographs, transcription machines and sound-car equipments in the field are keeping in use daily hundreds of thousands of discs. The phonograph record distribution for the fiscal year 1939 reached a new high. There were shipped out 310,001 discs, or 620,002 recordings. These were double-faced discs having a 4J-minute lecture on each side. Of this grand total of phonograph discs shipped out 13,297 are recordings in foreign languages, and 1,909 quartet records. The balance of 294,795 contained the. voice of the president.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There were 66 new 4-J-minute records made available during the past year. The numbers and titles of these recordings are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">P-153 Miracles P-154 Instruction</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">P-155 to P-166 Pace the Facts; an exact reproduction of the lecture originally given in Royal Albert Hall, London.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The following recordings were also simultaneously recorded at the time of delivering same before packed-out auditoriums:</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">P-167 tc P-178</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">P-179 to P-190</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Victory</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Snare and Racket (studio recording) Government and Peace</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Shipping of these recorded speeches began in 1931, and since then there has been a great increase in their use. From 1931 to 1936 the 16-inch recordings were used, primarily on the radio and the sound-cars. Up to the present time their use has demanded a shipmen, of 64,598 discs. Since 1934, up to and including 1939, the 4A-minute reproductions of the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom message, covering literally hundreds of Bible subjects, have reached a distribution of 816,468 double-faced discs. This is indeed an astonishing figure. It has been a splendid means in the hands 'of the Lord’s people in the proclamation of his truths. The very fact that so many of these discs have been used in advancing the Kingdom interests speaks of the Lord’s blessing upon this method. These speeches can be heard in 18 different languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Publication</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The witness work in the United States has enjoyed the rich blessing of the Lord. The past year exceeds everything heretofore, as to the witness given concerning the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom and as to the publishers ’ working together in unity, effectively and with much greater efficiency. Since the Lord has made so clear the importance of the Theocracy and our responsibility to Jehovah in making proclamation of that </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">kin</span><span class="font4">gdom, and since Jehovah has shown to his people that “for brass I will bring gold, and ... I will also make . . . thine exactors righteousness”, the greatest witness of all time has been given in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The anointed and their companions now realize that there are three things they can do. They can be publishers for the Kingdom; they can put in hours in the field service and thus prove their integrity; and they can make back-calls among the people of good will whom they meet in the regular witness work. An individual cannot determine the number of bound books, booklets or subscriptions that he will place with the people, nor can he determine how many people will listen to his phonograph, but he can determine whether or not he will be a publisher, put in hours, and make back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> has greatly aided those wanting to be a witness to the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom in the suggestion of 60 hours a month as a reasonable amount of time to put in in the Kingdom work. The tremendous increase in hours can be attributed to the publishers’ having a real appreciation of this fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The detailed report of the United States bears out the statement that those people of good will want to be publishers and are putting in many hours, proving their integrity, and making wonderful strides in the back-call service. The report follows.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The most outstanding figure in the report is the 35,466 publishers who have been in the field each month, on the average, throughout the year. This is nearly 10,000 more publishers than engaged in the field in 1938. The great multitude are coming into the Lord’s provision for safety, which is proved by the fact that more than 40,000 publishers are now engaging in the field work regularly, and reached a peak, in the month of August, of 41,902.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These publishers have engaged in regular witnessing from door to door, back-calls, information marches, use of sound equipment, to the extent of 9,114,336 hours, which is almost three million additional hours put in in the field more than last year. The average of hours per publisher is much higher than in previous years, which shows that the workers for the Kingdom are striving to attain the 60-hour quota suggested through the Lord’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The publishers, always being desirous of aiding the people in the proper course to take, leave literature with the people whenever possible, and, because of the increase in number of publishers and the greater number of hours devoted in the field, a larger amount of literature was distributed. In 1939 there were 1,542,591 bound books placed and 13,626,653 booklets distributed; making a grand total of 15,169,244 pieces of literature placed in the United States. This in itself is a wonderful testimony to the name of Jehovah. Additionally throughout this country magazines, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font4"> were distributed to the total number of 6,740,000 copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sound equipment has played a wonderful part in the advancement of the Kingdom interests, and a mighty sound has gone forth. This added feature of the &quot;strange work” Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions are doing showed marvelous results in that 13,054,407 persons have heard some of the lectures. The sound equipment, along with the series of records provided through the Theocratic Government, makes it now possible for everyone to arrange for back-calls, and this feature of the work shows the greatest increase of all the reports sent in to the Society. In 1938, 289,489 back-calls were made, whereas this year 1,285,327 back-calls were made; showing an increase of nearly one million back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All of the work of Jehovah’s witnesses has had a very telling effect, particularly on the religious element of the Devil’s organization. It has made them take every measure to try to stop this work, within and without the law, but the &quot;locusts” continue to clear away what little varnish is left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The outstanding testimony period of the year was the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign. The publishers of the Kingdom responded in this campaign with great zeal and enthusiasm. Everyone appreciated the need of having </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> coming to the homes of the people of good will regularly; for it is this that brings the food convenient for them. This testimony period was so important that it continued for five months. In the United States alone over 93,000 new subscriptions were obtained, in addition to more than 5,660,000 books and booklets’ being distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This campaign beginning in January also started the initial distribution of the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts,</span><span class="font4"> which ran into the millions placed in the hands of the people. As the campaign continued into the month of April, another booklet was added to it, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom,</span><span class="font4"> which added more fuel to the fire already scorching the Devil’s organization. These two new booklets ’ coming out during the year along with the very important </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign made it possible for this year to be that of the greatest booklet distribution ever enjoyed in the United States. Nearly 39,000 different publishers moved forward in response to this call to action. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign, followed up with the back-call work, aided greatly in getting more publishers into the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> is always carried by the publishers and offered to the people, and its distribution did not slow down until the new book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> came out, and from then on </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> has taken the lead. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Sal cation</span><span class="font4"> was released at the worldwide convention in June, and there is not a question of doubt that the lectures &quot;Government and Peace” and &quot;Victory”, and the release of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font4"> brought clearly before the mind of everyone attending the convention the absolute need of being a publisher. Immediately following the June convention the report for July showed a new high peak in publishers for the year, followed by August, which reached another new high of nearly 42,000 engaging in the field work in the United States. It has been impossible up to the present time to keep the publishers in the field supplied with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font4"> because the publishers’ great desire is to see that everyone gets it and reads it. Their success in the field in the distribution of this book has been greater than the capacity of the factory up to the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Efficient organization is essential, and the Theocratic Government has done much in the way of organizing the field during the past year. Those seeking life know that they must support the Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To the end that greater unity and more efficient work might be accomplished, all the instructions of the Society were carried out in detail. The United States was divided into 6 regions and 153 zones. The brethren handling this work followed the Organization Instructions, and the work has prospered. At the close of the year 1938 there were 1,786 company organizations; today there are organized throughout the country 2,425.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The regional servants traveled 99,627 miles, at an expense to the Society of $1,491.94, whereas the zone servants traveled 2,049,584 miles, the expense to the Society being $32,340.16. The regional and zone servants have given counsel and aid to the other servants in the companies visited as well as the publishers, and have shown these publishers the effectiveness of carrying on the witness work as outlined in the Organization Instructions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Due to the better organization in the field the territory has been more thoroughly covered in the populated areas. Many pioneers and special pioneers were used in the zone servant and regional servant work, and some of the pioneers were made company servants so that the work might progress in that vicinity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">. While there were over 2,000 pioneers in the field, there are many parts of the country, rurals and small towns, that were not reached during the year. There is a great need for more pioneers to assist in the development of rural territory and aid those people of good will in the various sections of the country to organize themselves into companies. Pioneers are assisting in this. The companies having become larger and many new ones added to the list, they have absorbed a lot of additional territory, but there is still plenty of territory all over the United States for pioneers to carry forward the Kingdom interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Organization Instructions as amended, recently sent out to all companies and pioneers, show how closely pioneers and companies must work together in advancing the Kingdom interests. Publishers in the field today have one thing in mind, that is, the vindication of Jehovah’s name. The publishers of the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom know that Jehovah through his Son, Christ Jesus, is gathering the great multitude, and great is their joy today to see that multitude coming into the organization, taking a stand and joining in the proclamation of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many people of good will also write direct to the Society for additional literature, and during the year 39,440 bound books and 48,662 booklets were shipped direct to these persons, the grand total being 88,102. For those persons who are known to be newly interested a back-call slip is made out and sent to the nearest company, and this person is called on with the records and assisted in every way possible to get a better knowledge of the truth. The millions of handbills that are left throughout the country, along with other advertising, bring in a good response.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are other countries that come under the supervision of the Brooklyn office, and reports received show that a good witness has been given during the past year. There are 19 countries, such as the countries of Central America, islands of the West Indies, and other countries not large enough to support a branch, that make these reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The summary of the activity of these 19 outlying countries shows there were 314 publishers in the field, 52 of whom were pioneers. These brethren put in 110,527 hours and placed 15,937 bound books and 134,381 booklets. Total literature placed, 150,318, as well as 670 new subscriptions for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Good use was made of the phonograph records in foreign languages as well as English, and these publishers had 273,412 attendance. The back-calls have shown a marked increase over previous years. There were made 9,724 back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These 19 countries are put into groups in the following reports, such as West Indies, Central America, Panama, etc., setting out their activity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">In the face of much opposition from the Catholic and Orthodox clergy in Egypt this year, by the Lord’s grace the work has almost doubled, and from evidence at hand it seems that the work will continue to increase there. Just recently quite a number have symbolized their consecration. The clergy have used the press against the Kingdom service, which has resulted only in further advertising the King and the Kingdom, and caused the faithful to increase their zeal. A spirit of unity prevails now, since some of the “evil servant” class have been gathered out by the Lord.</span></p>

As the year was coming to a close a group of Greek brethren were enrolled at Istanbul. There is an active company organization at Akkar, as well as Tripoli and Lebanon, and much work is accomplished by pioneers in both Lebanon and Syria. Some young men are taking hold of the work in Lebanon, and the work promises to grow there. Cyprus has been completely covered five times by the pioneers since the work started there, and they are starting over it again.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The Kingdom service suffers in some South American countries for want of publishers. There have been company organizations in various parts of the continent, but no reports were received during the year from many of these, only 7 company publishers reporting. And so the little work done by these barely scratches the surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The two pioneer sisters continue to do the bulk of the witness work in Colombia, and they do this under extreme difficulties; but realizing that &quot;the joy of Jehovah” is their strength, they press on and, as a result, are recipients of his blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yes, the call is for more laborers in this part of tlie field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethel Home</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Due to the increased work at Bethel it has been necessary to bring in more brethren; therefore the field report shows an increase in publishers. The only way the Bethel family can</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">have an increase in publishers is by having more working at the factory or home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This year there was an average of 191 publishers in the field each month, compared with last year’s 180. The report which follows shows that many more hours were put in the field than last year, an increase of over 6,000 hours. The family is very active in back-calls, reaching a new peak of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font4"> the year. Many of the brethren at Bethel act as unit servants and assistant servants in the New York company, and some of them have been appointed as regional and zone servants, which occupies their week-ends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While the total number of pieces of literature placed is less than the previous year, this in no wise indicates that less work has been done, because more hours were spent in the factory in extra time and in field service than in any previous year, all done in the interests of God’s kingdom. The field report of the Bethel family for the year is set out below.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">For many years past the Boman Catholic Hierarchy, through their official newspapers, have been informing their people that &quot;Judge Butherford is no longer on the air’’, that &quot;Judge Butherford has been barred from all radio stations ’ ’. Of course, these have been malicious lies on their part, trying to show their people what power they possess in this country. In spite of all the boycott and coercive methods which the Hierarchy and their religious allies have used to &quot;keep Judge Butherford off the air ’ ’, the Lord, through the Theocratic Government, sees to it that when an important message is to be broadcast worldwide it is sent out over the airway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Such an occasion occurred on October 2, when the lecture &quot;Fascism or Freedom’’ was delivered by the president of the Society at Mecca Temple, New York city. 58 radio stations, throughout the United States, were tied in a network that covered the entire country, and there were large auditoriums equipped with public-address systems in New Orleans, Columbus, Seattle, also Toronto and Ottawa in Canada, in which this lecture was heard. This lecture showed to the American people where the Hierarchy stand in regard to Fascism, and this expose made the Hierarchy gnash their teeth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Again, on June 25, an even larger network of stations was arranged, the total being 70 stations tied together, throughout the United States, bringing to the people the now famous lecture &quot;Government and Peace’’. This was sent forth direct from Madison Square Garden on the occasion of a world-wide convention of Jehovah’s witnesses. The network not only tied in 70 radio stations which broadcast the truth, but also tied in 28 convention halls, which were packed to overflowing, which halls were located in all parts of the world. The shortwave which carried the message overseas was heard in numerous countries, and the report of this far-flung message was very encouraging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Catholics, being unsuccessful in “barring Rutherford from the air”, are now working through the National Association of Broadcasters, which association is comprised of representatives from all radio stations in the United States. They have recently made theii own code as to what shall go on the air. In effect it states, “Under no circumstances will compensation be accepted by the station or network for time consumed by a spokesman on a controversial public issue. ’ ’ The committee also called attention to the religious section of the code which states, “Radio, which reaches men of all creeds and races simultaneously, may not be used to convey attacks upon another’s race or religion. Rather, it should be the purpose of the religious broadcast to promote the spiritual harmony and understanding of mankind.” The newspaper account reporting on this association’s activities states that among the names often mentioned in the conference being held was that of Judge Rutherford. The National Association of Broadcasters, however, are not able to control all the radio stations. During the entire year there were several stations throughout .the country, particularly WBBR in Brooklyn, that continued to carry regularly all of the 5-minute lectures and 15-minute transcription lectures recorded.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">While the radio has done much good to awaken the people to the true conditions in the world, personal visits made by Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions in the homes of the people of good will have accomplished even more. While the Hierarchy and National Association of Broadcasters are putting forth every effort to stop the Kingdom message and to keep Brother Rutherford off the air, the Lord through his Theocratic Government, long before these efforts become successful, arranges for even a wider witness by means of the phonograph. These sharp, clear-cut truths which the Lord would have the people of good will to hear, to aid them in taking their stand, are now brought into their own homes in the regular door-to-door witnessing, and particularly by means of back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">More than 7,000 sets of each of the records containing the full text of ' ‘ Face the Facts ”, “ Fill the Earth, ” “ Fascism or Freedom,” have been distributed throughout the Englishspeaking world for the making of these personal visits. Following up closely on these come the lectures ‘ ‘ Victory ’ ’ and ‘ ‘ Government and Peace”, and more than 7,500 sets of these have already been shipped out, and they are still being ordered by the publishers in the held. 30,000 discs containing the short talk “Snare and Backet’’ have been manufactured, all of which have been sent out and are used regularly on sound machines. The “locusts’’ go through the cities clearing away the veneer and showing the people the way to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the United States alone there were 1,285,327 of these personal visits made upon the people during the past year. Knowing that over 800,000 dises containing a 44-minute speech on each side are in the hands of the publishers throughout the world, we can appreciate more fully the great work that is being accomplished by Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions calling at the homes of the people and comforting those that mourn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Use of Records</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The phonograph record containing the 4|-minute lecture has been a wonderful aid to the publisher in the field. Years ago the publisher had to do all the talking. Some of them had difficulty with their voice or an impediment in their speech, or may have been nervous in approaching the people, but now with the phonograph short talks have been prepared by the president of the Society such as the record “Enemies”, which introduces the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> in just 4J minutes. Other records show the importance of reading </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower;</span><span class="font4"> still others show why the people should read </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.</span><span class="font4"> All of these short talks are to the point, stated in a very clear voice and a convincing argument. While the speaker on the record brings this information to millions of people in a year, the publishers are relieved of this strain of talking from door to door, which drains their vitality, and so the users of the phonograph have found they can put in more hours because someone else does the speaking for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The phonograph has been more fully appreciated in the last few years, and its use is becoming more effective as time goes on. This can be seen in the fact that 13,327,819 persons have listened to these records. The phonograph has done more than any other one thing in aiding the people of good will to get a knowledge of the truth and take a stand for the Kingdom. It has also aided the people of good will in becoming publishers, because it removes that timidity due to not knowing what to say at the door, but lets the phonograph say it. More than 22,000 phonographs are in use in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The special pioneer work was announced at the Columbus convention in September, 1937, and that work has continued now for two years with good results. When the special pioneer work began the company publishers were not convinced of the value of making back-calls and the regular daily use of the phonograph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">About 200 specially chosen pioneers throughout the country took upon themselves the responsibility of really putting to use the phonograph. They were sent into the large cities where companies were organized, and there it was proved, without question ot doubt, that the phonograph had an important place in the proclamation of the Kingdom. In the past two years, because the publishers of the Kingdom became phonograph-minded, more than 20,000 phonographs had to be manufactured at the Brooklyn plant, and then we were unable to keep up with the demand. During the .past year the special pioneer group has been increased to 300 at one time, but the average for the year shows there were 256 special pioneers engaging in the work regularly each month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the year these special pioneers made 516,982 setups. They had an attendance of over one million persons who heard the lectures, and these few brethren made 124,206 back-calls. The special pioneer work as originally outlined at the Columbus convention has accomplished its purpose in that all publishers now throughout the world know that the phonograph is a great aid in advancing the Kingdom interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To aid these special pioneers during the past year to accomplish the work they set out to do, the Society assisted them to the extent of $41,123.98.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The special pioneer work now takes on other duties. Those who are listed by the Society as special pioneers will now assist the zone servants where assigned throughout the country. Their principal work from now on will be to assist the zone servant in the organization of new companies, and in those companies that are slow in moving ahead with the Kingdom interests the Society is appointing a special pioneer as its company servant, so that the work may progress at a greater pace. These special pioneers devote all their time in the Kingdom service and will be a real aid to the publishers throughout the country at the points where they are assigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Books</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren in the field take great pleasure in the distribution of new books as Jehovah brings them forth through his organization. In the past year there were four new publications. In the order of release they were, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts, Fascism or Freedom, Salvation,</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The new booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font4"> was released with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign beginning with January, and up to the present time has been translated in 24 languages, and the printing orders at Brooklyn have reached 12,040,076 copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Beginning with April, which was also part of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtoiver </span><span class="font4">Campaign, the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font4"> was added to the literature to be distributed, and during the year 9,162,859 copies had been printed, in nine different languages. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font4"> booklet, containing the fiery lecture which scorched the religionists, had its release toward the end of the fiscal year. While only a few million copies have been printed to date, this booklet will undoubtedly pass the ten million mark soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The release of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> brought a thrill to all the publishers of the Kingdom. They were indeed delighted when they learned that this publication was “a textbook for the Jonadabs”. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> was released at the world-wide convention in June and, since that time, has had an unusual distribution. The demand on the part of the witnesses has been so great that the factory at Brooklyn has been unable to keep up with the orders. Supplies consigned to branches have run out, and company organizations and pioneers have run short, even though the production is running a quarter of a million every month and more than one million copies have already been dispatched. It is believed that the distribution of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> book will exceed all other bound books when it is compared, year for year, with the release of other books prior to its time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Each year the Society publishes a Yearbook, and the 1939 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Year Booh of Jehovah’s witnesses</span><span class="font4"> was released late in December. This publication always brings much joy to its readers. A larger edition was necessary this year than in previous years, the printing being 40,420.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">World-wide Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions assembled in convention throughout the world June 23, 24, 25, 1939. At 28 cities throughout the English-speaking world the Lord’s people came together primarily to give a witness for the Kingdom and to receive instruction, comfort and aid from the Lord’s Word, which they all did. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Friday, the first day of the convention, was primarily devoted to the field service, calling on the people in all the cities with the Kingdom literature, and the carrying forward of information marches advertising the public lecture “ Government and Peace”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The key city of the world-wide convention was New York city. The first assembly that tied together all the cities by direct wire was the one Saturday afternoon, at which time the president of the Society addressed this’ vast assembly of over 33,000 Christians on the subject “Victory”. Not only did those assembled at these convention points hear this most inspiring and blessed talk brought to us from the Lord’s Word, but hundreds and even thousands of others picked up the shortwave broadcast that took the message to the conventions in Australia, London and Honolulu. The doom of religion was clearly seen, and the work of the <sup>1</sup> ‘ locusts ’ ’ was greatly appreciated. While the talk, ‘ ‘ Victory, ’ ’ was enthusiastically received, the brethren throughout the world had a thrill they never expected. The president of the Society, near the close of his lecture, introduced the new book, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font4"> at the convention hall in New York city, and this book was simultaneously released in every convention city throughout the world. Reports were received that the brethren were simply amazed that the new book should be released in England, Honolulu, Canada, and all parts of the United States, </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">imm</span><span class="font4">ediately after the close of Brother Rutherford’s talk, “Victory.” It surely was a victory for the Lord’s people, because after that speech they went out into the field work advertising “Government and Peace” and many new publishers entered the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The following day, Sunday, there were 2,218 persons immersed throughout the world at these various assemblies, which is another indication of the Lord’s bringing together the great multitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The climax of the convention came Sunday afternoon at 4 o ’clock, at which time the Madison Square Garden was packed out by those who desired to hear “Government and Peace”. A large radio chain was arranged to carry the message to all parts of the United States, and the auditoriums at all convention cities had been packed out, the visible audience being well over 75,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The religionists, being opposed to free speech, were not able to take the hard, cutting truths as set forth in the Bible, and made an attempt to break up that meeting; and so it was that Catholic Action sent into Madison Square Garden a large group evidently with instructions to use gangster methods to break up the assembly of Christian people. The Lord’s people were prepared to handle those who caused the disturbance, and did. When this group began to boo, hiss, curse, utter threats, and yell “Heil Hitler!” “Viva Pranco!” the ushers, who were of the Lord’s people, began to remove these disturbers. Brother Rutherford never once hesitated in the delivery of his speech, but the Lord gave him power and strength to make his delivery that did set fear in the heart of the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Within fifteen </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font4">utes after the disturbance arose these gangsters were entirely squelched and put out, and the lecture continued to a magnificent finish. The 20,000 people who packed out the Garden were with Brother Rutherford. The applause that arose and the ayes of response to the declaration shook the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">very</span><span class="font4"> rafters of Madison Square Garden. “Government and Peace” was the most stirring lecture to the Lord’s people, and certainly was a trimming to the Devil’s organization. They are still scorched under the heat of that message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the time of the delivery of “Government and Peace” it was simultaneously recorded, and “Government and Peace” is now being sent forth into all parts of the world to small assemblies. The religionists did not know that all their gangster methods would be recorded simultaneously with the lecture, and it gives it a most effective background. Now that it is delivered in small halls to smaller gatherings throughout the world, it really shows to the people of good will the wickedness of that devilish crowd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At numerous places Catholic Action continually tries to break up assemblies where “Government and Peace” is advertised, because they know where “Government and Peace” is advertised they will be exposed to the public in their true light. What started at Madison Square Garden Sunday afternoon, June 25, was just the beginning of a tremendous witness that is now reaching to the ends of the earth. The Lord’s people did not sit back and let these gangsters walk over them in Madison Square Garden, but they took the proper action in putting them out, which was entirely Scriptural and in harmony with the Lord’s Word. It was the greatest convention of all times for Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions, and an occasion never to be forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What occurred at that convention now makes up the greatest part of the witness work today, namely, the distribution of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> and the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace;</span><span class="font4"> and the recorded messages, “Victory” and “Government and Peace”, are heard by thousands upon thousands of persons weekly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While the convention came to a close in New York city Sunday evening, the work of that convention was not done. Within a few days after the convention ended </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> No. 4 was released for public distribution throughout New York city. The headlines of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> were—“Attempt to Wreck Garden Assembly. The Pacts. ’ ’ An open letter by J. P. Rutherford to Mayor La Guardia of New York city was reprinted therein and this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> was distributed far and wide among millions of people residing in the city. One million copies of . </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> were placed in the hands of the people within five days. Numerous were the comments of appreciation on the part of the public. The work of distributing </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News </span><span class="font4">was done in such a hurry that the religionists on the street selling their wares were amazed and dumfounded. The response on the part of the people of good will of New York city has been very gratifying since the convention. The great shower of blessings which fell upon the Lord’s people during this world-wide convention will never be forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">International Campaigns</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Certain periods had formerly been set aside each year at which time a complete report was received from all the publishers throughout the world through the various branches. These periods ran for nine days in October and April. During the past year, however, a change was made to extend the testimony periods from nine days to one month and even longer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The first month-long international campaign was in October, 1938, at which time the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Warning</span><span class="font4"> was offered world-wide for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The most important campaign of the year was the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">Campaign, which ran over a period of four months, beginning in January and ending with the month of April. All branches throughout the world sent in a complete report of the work done for this period, which was truly gratifying and shows what a wonderful witness can be given in such a short period of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In these four months of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign 67,229 publishers were in the field, the largest number ever engaging in the field service at any one time and so reporting. Throughout the world during this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">W atchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign 121,073 new subscriptions were obtained for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> The detailed report of both international campaigns follows.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Opposition</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the past year, in more than half of the states of the United States there were arrests made of Jehovah’s witnesses because they were preaching the gospel of the Kingdom. The enemy has been trying to frame mischief by law, and in so doing has tried to block, encircle, and even destroy the good work which Jehovah’s witnesses have been doing in this land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is an ever-increasing attempt on the part of the Devil’s organization to stop the advance of the Kingdom. This is shown in the fact that more than 600 individual arrests have been brought to the attention of the legal desk as compared with last year’s 471.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to aid the publishers in properly defending themselves when taken in by the &quot;strong-arm squad’’, the Society lias published a 16-page booklet entitled &quot;Advice for Kingdom Publishers’’. This booklet should be carefully studied by all publishers, so that they may give proper witness before the magistrates and see to it that proper record is made regarding the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The legal desk reports that during the last year the courts in the land have arrested the brethren under many charges. Some of the charges made against our brethren were: vagrancy, trespassing, annoying people, offending people, disorderly conduct, peddling ■without a license, canvassing without a permit, soliciting on Sunday, soliciting &quot;business’’ without a permit, soliciting donations without a permit, selling without a license, &quot;parading’’ without a permit, causing a crowd to congregate, inciting to riot, disturbing the peace, breach of the peace, distributing circulars (or pamphlets) without a permit, distributing &quot;Fascist” literature, distributing offensive literature, assault and battery, felonious assault, simple assault, distributing obscene literature, violating “blue laws’’ of Mississippi, violating “anti-Nazi’’ law of New Jersey, attacking the Roman Catholic religion, “habitual offenders’’ (for refusing to salute a flag and recite a pledge of allegiance to worldly governments)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In addition to the many arrests reported to the Society, there were undoubtedly hundreds of our brethren taken to the courts and released of which no report was sent in. Many of the cases that come before magistrates are railroaded through. Many appeals have been taken in the various cases throughout the country where adverse decisions have been made against the brethren on the part of the court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“Consolation&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The purpose of the magazine </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> is to aid persons of good will to gei a quick vision of the world situation as the same is related to the Theocratic Government. In these times of peril one who thinks may quickly get a vision of the world situation by reading </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> and from its pages learning that all of creation aside from real Christians are against the Theocratic Government and have fallen victims to the wicked one. They are deceived, of course. Amongst them there are, no doubt, some who would like to be in a better situation and understand more about God’s purpose, and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> magazine is attempting to help them along these lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year this magazine has been published in the English and six other languages and has had a wide distribution in the United States, Canada, Australia, South Africa, and other English-speaking countries. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> carries no advertisements. It is not its purpose to make money, and all money received for subscriptions is quickly absorbed and expended in the publication of the message relating to the Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Conclusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Being in constant touch with the brethren in the factory and office, I hear their many expressions of appreciation of being here at Bethel. The provisions that have been made for all of us are numerous. Not only do we have the best place in the world to work, plenty of light, clean factory, effective machinery, but at the home the provision in the way of food, material and spiritual, has been of the very best.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>BRITAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The work of The Theocracy has progressed in the British Isles during the fiscal year. In the year previous the British people had a clear warning that the Boman Catholic Hierarchy, acting together with Fascists and Nazis, would make a strenuous effort to control all the nations and rule them by arbitrary dictators. Many persons believed it then, but within the last few months many others have been thoroughly convinced. This is further evidence that the conclusion of Satan’s organization on earth is near and that within a brief space of time the Great Theocrat, by Christ Jesus, will eliminate every part of Satan’s organization from the earth. Then will follow the blessings to the survivors, which all lovers of righteousness have desired to see come to earth. From that time onward forever the will of God shall be done on earth as it is in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, assisted by other Fascists, have manifested great opposition to the British work far more than ever, but that opposition has only stimulated the devotees of The Theocracy to push the work with greater zeal. Two years ago little or no progress was being made. A change of the servants was made in 1938, and the remaining part of that year the work increased. As an illustration, the pioneers in 1937 were unable to find sufficient territory in the British Isles, according to the report of the one then in charge of the office, and for this reason a number of pioneers were sent to France. It was thought that Britain could not support more than 100 pioneers; there would not be sufficient territory. During the fiscal year just now ended the report shows 429 pioneers active in the field, with a greatly increased number of company workers. During the year phonograph and sound machines reproducing this gospel of the Kingdom, to the number of 4,837, have been in use. The sound attendance, that is, the people who attended these sound reproductions, totaled 1,515,747. Back-calls were made on the interested to the number of 175,942. There were placed in the hands of the people by the field publishers books and booklets to the number of 6,185,979. The total number of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscribers for the year was 11,445, and copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> distributed totaled 681,704; copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> distributed,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">508,197. For the month of September, the last month of the fiscal year, there were actually in the field 511 pioneers in the service, and on the last day of the year there were enrolled, ready for service, 593 pioneers, and the number is still increasing. Public meetings have been held in the British Isles to the number of 5,695, with a total attendance of 227,617. Information marches were had to the number of 2,623. Almost every town, city and village in the British Isles was visited. This brought forth the opposition of the enemy, and there were sixty-six cases of violent assaults made upon Jehovah's witnesses and attempts by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy to break up public meetings. Those who love the Theocratic Government will read with keen interest more details of the work in Britain taken from the report of the local servant in charge at 34 Craven Terrace, London, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To Jehovah, the Great Theoerat, and his King, Christ Jesus, we render thanks and praise for the privilege of advancing a portion of “his strange work’’. The record of the “strange work’’ in Britain during the year 1939 has been one of great devastation to the pastures of entrenched religionists by the division of His great army of “locusts’’ stationed in this land for duty. The continual unfolding of his purposes through the columns of the beautiful newly designed </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> and especially the two series, “Drama of Vindication’’ and “Doom of Religion’’, have enabled Jehovah’s people here to increase in strength, courage and zeal for the Theocracy and to endure the Kingdom warfare. Living in the days of ‘ ‘ the latter rain ’ ’, our floors indeed have been overflowing with wheat and the vats overflowing with new wine and oil. (Joel 2: 24) Prosperity and expansion oi the Kingdom interests have grandly continued in spite of growing opposition and much tribulation amongst the people. The forward movement of the “strange work” has gained momentum, and hundreds more have taken their stand and joined in the work. Although the eyes of the world have been anxiously focused on Britain, she, like the other nations, has been sorely perplexed; yet this land has experienced during the past several months an intense demonstration for Jehovah’s Theocracy, the greatest it has known, to set a definite lead to all those who love righteousness. The honest ones are getting their eyes opened, forsaking religion, which is a curse, and are fleeing to the “cities of refuge”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Rushing Toward Armageddon</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Following is a brief log of the rushing course of events during 1939, which reveals Jehovah’s maneuvering and protection of his people as promised in the year’s text, “But they shall not prevail against thee.’’ (Jer. 1: 19) Prior to the beginning of the fiscal year 1939 the religionists in Britain had remained hidden in their centuries-old holes, but by ‘ ‘ turning on the heat ’ ’ they were forced out into the open and exposed to all righteous people as a gang of racketeers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To give a complete picture we must begin with Judge Rutherford’s great lecture entitled “Face the Facts’’, given at the Royal Albert Hall, London, on September 11, 1938, where he thoroughly exposed the Catholic-Fascist move for world domination. This released a storm of opposition which resulted in a continual fight for the next twelve months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Immediately following this event the September international crisis quickly developed leading to the Munich agreement. This crisis gave Britain a real shock and brought a grip of fear over the people. They had not faced the facts as previously warned by Judge Rutherford. During these critical days the new zone organization of Jehovah’s witnesses under the Theocratic arrangement was put into operation throughout the country, thus laying a further basis for offensive attack on Jehovah’s enemies. By October 1 one </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">mil</span><span class="font4">lion copies of the new booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Warning</span><span class="font4"> were in the hands of the brethren, and they moved forward as one man during the “Jehovah’s Battle’’ period of October 1 to 31. The public, in their unsettled state, eagerly accepted this latest message from the Lord, and many took their stand accordingly. This vast number of booklets was distributed in ten weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On October 14 the London </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald</span><span class="font4"> launched out into the open for the first time and published a libelous attack on Judge Rutherford and his Royal Albert Hall relay of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">‘ ‘ Face </span><span class="font4">the Facts’’ lecture. The Society’s solicitors were immediately advised to proceed against the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald</span><span class="font4"> for libel and instructed to sue them at the proper moment for £20,000. The issue was sorely pressed by the Society’s solicitors, and after several weeks the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald</span><span class="font4"> wished to have it settled out of court and agreed to publish a retraction to the satisfaction of the Society’s solicitors. This was published by them on November 25, but was such a humiliating incident that the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Herald </span><span class="font4">ever since has been out to even the score but has failed because the days of the Hierarchy’s end are at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On November 18 a special witness was given to members of the House of Lords and members of the House of Commons and other government officials. They were each sent a letter drawing their attention to the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts,</span><span class="font4"> a copy of which was enclosed, and its references to “The Aliens Restriction (Blasphemy) Act 1938’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The next step in the war was begun in December, when a nation-wide campaign was carried out for nine months thereafter, conducting public meetings with the recorded lectures “Face the Facts’'. “Fascism or Freedom,” “Violence,” and “Warning”. During the nine months 5,695 public meetings were held in cinemas, public halls, schools, Kingdom halls, etc., covering almost every city, town and village in Britain. The total attendance at these meetings was 227,617, of which 187,606 were strangers. To advertise these meetings, more than three million folders were distributed amongst the people and 2,623 information marches organized in which long lines of faithful brethren marched displaying their Kingdom banners. This public meeting campaign further enraged the religionists and was a “siege” they won't forget for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On January 1 the great five-month </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign began, during the first part of which three million </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font4"> booklets were distributed in the British field. This, together with the distribution of the new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font4"> and gaining subscriptions for the same, proved to be a mighty onslaught. Also, as a result of Brother Rutherford’s special letter, all the company brethren redoubled their efforts with a try to make the sixty hours a month in the King’s service. During this campaign the counterattack of the enemy was launched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Shortly after January 11 a special witness was given to all officials, Catholic leaders, and the press throughout the country, as to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald</span><span class="font4"> exposure. They were all served with copies of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font4"> booklet, copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation </span><span class="font4">No. 504, which carried the exposure, and a copy of the special leaflet entitled </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Catholic Herald</span><span class="font4"> Anxious to Gag Judge Rutherford”. Fifty thousand copies of this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> as well as two million copies of this leaflet were quickly distributed throughout the country. The religionists continued to howl.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By February the pressure on the Hierarchy was so great that they retaliated with a nation-wide campaign of violence and assault upon Jehovah’s witnesses. This was accompanied by bitter and vicious press attacks week after week in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald</span><span class="font4"> and the Catholic </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Universe,</span><span class="font4"> in which they subtly encouraged further acts of violence upon Jehovah’s servants. The first assault occurred at Clydebank on February 7, and other incidents quickly followed in other parts of Scotland as well as in Wales and England and Northern Ireland. This campaign of violence resulted in 66 cases of assaults, 3 mob riots, and 12 attempts to break up public meetings. AU this opposition was instigated by local priests and carried out by local Catholic Action groups. Ten of these cases were prosecuted and the offenders properly punished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was also in February that “pavement witnessing” began as authorized by Brother Rutherford. Brethren, individuaUy or in groups, wearing large posters advertising the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts </span><span class="font4">booklet, stood on the pavements in the busy thoroughfares on Saturday evenings or other market days and placed booklets with the people on the regular contributions. Thousands of booklets were placed with the people in this manner, and the witness was given to many people who in the ordinary house-to-house work are never met. Farmers and others coming into towns to do their shopping on Saturdays were given a good opportunity to get Kingdom information as well. Many appointments for back-calls and subscriptions were taken in this way. The people felt free to come and talk to the brethren about the matter. This form of witnessing has proved to be very effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In April the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font4"> booklet was released to the public, of which eventually two million copies were placed. About this time a public statement was issued to the people in Scotland in a special leaflet entitled “Nazi Tactics in Clydebank”. A quarter million of these leaflets were effectively distributed by the Scottish publishers. A special campaign was carried out in Clydebank with this leaflet, and further violence occurred. On April 2, at the public meeting in Oldham where the “Fascism or Freedom” lecture was given, Aiderman Shannon, the former mayor of Oldham, took it upon himself to lead a group of Catholic-Fascists in making three attempts to break up this meeting. The police were called and put Shannon and his gang out of the hall in spite of Shannon’s threat to the police constable for taking such action against such an “important individual” as himself. A special campaign was put on in Oldham and the surrounding territory a few weeks later to inform the people of this Catholic-Fascist attempt. Four hundred thousand leaflets on this matter, entitled “Catholic-Fascist Action in Oldham—Catholic Priests Encourage Attempt to Break Up Bible Meeting”, were thoroughly distributed and caused a great stir in the Lancashire and Yorkshire districts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In May a priest, McDonagh, brought pressure to bear on several hall and cinema managers in South Wales to break their contracts with Jehovah’s witnesses. This priest had practically established a censorship in the Ebbw Vale, and the Abersyehan brethren were shut out of their halls. McDonagh tried to pass the blame onto the local police, who got on his trail and made him squirm. All the brethren in this Welsh zone got together for a special campaign and placed 50,000 leaflets exposing this high-handed business of the Catholics. Priest Witty of Hebburn-on-Tyne tried the same thing and was met by a further campaign and exposure by Jehovah’s witnesses. Wherever they lifted their head in the country, the “locusts” went after them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On June 7, after four months of hesitancy on the part of the Scottish judiciary, the two Clydebank trials were conducted. The first case was that of Jehovah’s witnesses against Patrick MeGrory, the ringleader of a gang of four Catholic roughs who beat up and knocked senseless one of Jehovah’s witnesses. This ruffian was found guilty and punished, and this four months after he committed the act. The second case was that of Clydebank priests Duffin and McEwen against four of Jehovah’s witnesses, who were charged by the priests with disturbing the peace in Clydebank by doing their ordinary witness work. </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Tn</span><span class="font4"> the trial the facts were brought out that it was the priests themselves who organized the mob against Jehovah’s witnesses and thus caused the breach of the peace and that Jehovah’s witnesses had nothing to do with inciting the mob who attacked them. This was a wonderful public witness, as the priests were put to shame and humiliated by their own speech and inconsistent testimony by their witnesses, who, needless to say, were loyal children of the “church”. The brethren themselves gave a splendid testimony in court. The judge acquitted the four brethren and found they were doing a proper and good work. Thus on this day two more victories were granted to Jehovah’s servants, and the dupes of the enemy exposed and put to shame. The Hierarchy saw to it that these trials were given no publicity, either in their own press or in the secular press. The brethren in Scotland rejoiced over this victory, and they have seen to it that the people have been informed about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the weeks prior to June 23-25 extensive preparations were made to organize ten conventions in Britain to be tied in with the great convention at New York city. These conventions were held at Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, Hull, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester, and Newcastle. Five thousand brethren joined in the sessions on Saturday night, hearing every word of Brother Rutherford’s “Victory” lecture. It was grand, and the best overseas reception at every point. On Sunday 24,000 persons gathered at the largest halls located in the above cities to hear the “Government and Peace” lecture from Madison Square Garden, New York. The British audiences were thrilled with this speech, and heard every word in a perfect transoceanic broadcast. Jehovah’ hand was marvelously displayed in bringing through perfect broadcasting. Three million folders, scores of information marches, and thousands of posters and placards were used in the biggest advertising campaign yet for a convention. On Satuiday, June 24, the I.R.A. (the Irish Republican Army, a Catholic terrorist movement which had been carrying out a campaign of bombing throughout Britain for the past several months) phoned an “official” threat to the London offices of the Society, saying they would take action if the London-Belfast circuit were not canceled for Judge Rutherford’s overseas lectures. This information was immediately given to Scotland Yard, and the halls in both Belfast and London were closely guarded by police and detectives. Quickly following the Saturday evening session of the convention five bombs exploded in the center of London near to the Kingsway Hall, where Jehovah’s people had been meeting. This was their worst bomb outrage, causing much property damage and injuring many persons; however, their dirty work did not touch a hair of Jehovah’s people. This was the third threat received from these maniacs signing themselves as the I.K.A., in the course of four months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On July 7 the second witness to members of Parliament, to the press and to public officials throughout the land was given. They were sent a special letter drawing their attention to the Catholic-Fascists' move for power in this country. They were also supplied with a copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom,</span><span class="font4"> copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> No. 516, containing the article called “Fascism in Britain”, and a copy of the leaflet entitled “Catholic-Fascist Menace in Britain”. After the leaders had been served, a hundred thousand copies of this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> and two million of these leaflets were placed throughout the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In view of the Compulsory Military Training Act which came into force in June many of the younger brethren had to make their stand as “conscientious objectors”. Several of the brethren had to appear before the military tribunals during August and were privileged there to give a good witness to the Kingdom. These young brethren used the name “Jehovah” so many times in their stand that even the judges were using the word. In each case the tribunals awarded the brethren exemption from military service and granted them freedom to carry on their work as heretofore. Our brethren and their uncompromising stand made a contrast to the various religionists who also made appeals for exemption, but they got mixed up in their scriptures. In one instance the national press gave wide publicity to a brother’s case. As a result of this publicity, he now and then receives a caller commending him for his stand, and, of course, this gives the brother a further opportunity to talk about the Kingdom. In one instance a clergyman commended him for his bold stand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By the time August 1 came around, the begi</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">nnin</span><span class="font4">g of the “Divine Mandate ’ ’ period, the field was ripe for the new book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> and its good news. The brethren were overjoyed to receive this new book at the convention in June, and now were eager to take it to the people. It is undoubtedly the finest book we have ever had, and so clearly marks out the course for a righteous person to take to receive Jehovah’s protection. 95,000 copies of this beautiful new book were sent to this country, and 50,000 of them were placed during the ‘ ‘ Divine Mandate ’ ’ period, and the remainder during September. This book has received the largest initial distribution of any bound book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Near the end of August the international situation began to deteriorate quickly, and on Sunday, September 3, this country declared a state of war, and a state of national emergency, existing henceforth. Most of the brethren were in the field on the Sunday morning when this solemn announcement was made. People were upset, many of the women weeping, so that witnessing during those historic hours was an experience never to be forgotten. There was no wild demonstration of patriotism or shouting, but an unhappy acceptance of what seemed to be the inevitable. An air raid signal of warning followed fifteen minutes after the war announcement, and there was a rush to take to cover. Soon, however, Jehovah’s servants carried on calmly with their errand of comfort and consolation. Most of the people received them kindly, and many </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> books were appropriately placed. Since the beginning of the war strict blackout obtains every night. This greatly inconveniences the meetings, back-calls, and evening drives of service. In spite of the many emergency regulations, restrictions and the other difficulties of “rationing”, etc., the “strange work” has been going right on. The first month of the war, September, was the second largest month of the year for bound book placements. The brethren gave a splendid demonstration of their determination to press forward the witness work, come what may. People are accepting literature now more readily than ever before. People are getting fed up with religion, which is again busy blessing the conflict. Yet the Catholic Press writes on September 15: “Jehovah’s witnesses again. . . . What can we do against calumny? . . . The Church has been attacked ... at a time like this. ’ ’ They evidently expected the war would entrap Jehovah’s witnesses by silencing them and give the priests a rest from the pestiferous “locusts”. But not so—yet. Jehovah’s witnesses and their message are now more effective and powerful than ever before, and the religionists are in for a continual exposure until the Lord says it is enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And now as, with the close of September, the fiscal year has ended, we are faced with an embargo on imports of records, bound books and booklets from the Brooklyn factory. The Devil and his organization are trying their best to cut off the food supply to the great multitude and have taken advantage of the totalitarian state of emergency that now exists in this land. If he can’t stop the work one way he tries another. Thus ends a twelve months’ panorama view of the “strange work” as it has progressed in Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Report</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The field report for 1939 is the largest on record. A total of 6,185,979 books and booklets were placed in the field. This is an increase of 1,877,269 pieces over last year’s report. It is interesting to note that the 1939 report shows about three times the literature output during 1937. There has been an increase in the monthly average number of publishers of 1,344. It has been a real joy to see so many new ones coming into the work and having a regular share. The peak of publishers for the year was 6,861. There has been a splendid increase in field time, the actual increase being 574,922 hours over last year’s report. The new subscriptions for the year were 11,445, most of which were taken during the five-month </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">Campaign. This is an increase of 3,496 new subscriptions. The sound attendance shows a decrease of 233,399. This may be due to the intense publie-meeting program which was undertaken this year: last year pitch work was featured by the sound-cars. A large portion of the sound attendance is made by the phonographs, and especially through the doorstep method of its use. The back-calls for the year more than doubled last year’s total. This is good to see, and shows that a real effort is being made to help the “other sheep’’ to take their stand. There is an increase of over a thousand phonographs in use during 1939, and 12 more transcription machines, thus bringing the total of sound machines up to 4,827. A great work has been done with the magazines, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font4"> A total of 1,189,894 copies were distributed during the year, including both the individual distribution by mail to subscribers and the bulk distribution. This is almost three times the output of the previous year. The Memorial report for 1939 is, attendance, 8,349; and partakers. 4,548. The report' for 1938 was, attendance, 6,366; and partakers, 4,853. You will note there has been an increase in the numbers attending the Memorial, yet the number of partakers shows a decrease. In addition to the above field work twelve million leaflets were distributed. If this figure is added to the large number of books, booklets and magazines distributed, a grand total of 19,375,873 is shown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Branch Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The British branch has had its busiest year in each of its departments, office, sound machine factory, printing, and stockroom. Increased activity required larger quarters, and accordingly the president arranged for two thousand more square feet of factory space rebuilt to our requirements alongside our present printing room. These new premises have been thoroughly equipped with modern apparatus. The sound machine department has been moved into these new quarters, as well as the magazine mailing department. Occupation began in February, and certainly was timely and fitted in exactly with our increased production at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The printing department turned out 13,911,857 items during 1939, consisting of office forms, leaflets and advertising signs. The year previous the production was 6,806,284; so you can see the work here more than doubled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The stock department had a very busy time. 17,867 cartons of literature were received from the Brooklyn factory this year, to compare with 15,769 cartons in the year previous. As to dispatch, 85,563 parcels were sent out during the year, to contrast with 42,057 parcels dispatched in 1938. So the work here doubled to keep up with the great demand from the publishers in the field. We shipped to the brethren in the field during the year 495,067 bound books and 6,847,765 booklets. The sound department made 1,058 new phonographs and 15 transcription machines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The office too had a full year of activity. The staff for the entire branch still remains the same as last year. Thus, to keep up with the increased demand for services required keener organization and working day and night during the busy seasons. In addition to co-operating with the Home Office of the Government in respect to the care of the several German refugee brethren, the office had to take up several matters with the Colonial Office of the Government pertaining to difficulties experienced by the local brethren in Fiji, Nigeria, Gold Coast, and Trinidad. During the first three months of the year the office sponsored a series of twenty-four Saturday evening meetings at the Hyde Park Forum. Questions and answers called forth interesting comment from the crowd, and the name &quot;Jehovah’s witnesses” was well advertised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Zone Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The British field has thirty zones and four regions, with the corresponding complement of thirty-four servants. Most of these servants are full-time workers for the Kingdom. The Society uses fifteen motorcars to further this service. For the year the 34 servants traveled a total of 207,480 miles to render aid and assistance to the companies and pioneers in the country. 140 zone assemblies were held during the year. This new organization according to the Theocratic arrangement has resulted in greater unity and zeal on the part of the whole organization. It is because of this compactness of the organization under the zone arrangement that it has been possible to do the large amount of Kingdom work as reported for this year. The work in Eire (Irish Free State) has been opened up again during the year. The work in Eire is done by seven faithful pioneers together with the zone servant, and they have been rendering good service in comforting the people of good will in that country. People of good will there also desire to take their stand for The Theocracy before it is too late, and every effort is being made to help them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethel Family</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are twenty-two members in the Bethel family. It has been their joy and satisfaction to witness the marvelous growth of the Kingdom activity during the past twelve months. They have not hesitated to spend their spare hours and energy to further turn out the equipment to keep the brethren in the field busy. At times it has almost been impossible to keep up with the demands from the field, but the brethren in the field have been patient and in due time have been served. Four members of the family serve as the four regional servants, and thus spend most of their week-ends with the brethren throughout the country. The family’s field report shows an increase over the previous year. 1,849 bound books and 25,888 booklets were placed. 6,370 hours were spent in the field service, 63 new subscriptions taken, sound attendance was 10,187, and 339 back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our aim this year was for 500 pioneers in the field. We are pleased to report that for September 511 pioneers reported active service. During the last fortnight of September fifty brethren have joined the pioneer ranks, bringing the list to date to 593. Our quota now is for one thousand of these full-time warriors. Last year we had an average of 242 pioneers. This year we had a monthly average of 429. This little band of faithful servants put out 159,656 bound books and 1,690,667 booklets for the year. They put out more bound books than the 5,874 average company publishers. The total of hours for the pioneers was 556,759, taking 3,828 new subscriptions and having a sound attendance of 389,889 and making 56,931 back-calls. Most of the pioneers are fully equipped with a phonograph and series recordings. During the year five pioneer homes have been set up in London, and one each in Bradford, Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, Glasgow, Sheffield, and Edinburgh. There are 124 pioneers serving in these twelve pioneer homes. These pioneers concentrate in building up new interest in each of these large centers. They are doing a splendid work. There are many requests for the establishment of several more of these homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">London Company</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The London company with its 1,200 company and pioneer publishers, put out 1,041,996 books and booklets during the year; and this in the largest city in the earth. This is the first time the million mark has been made. New publishers are coming forward from all sections of the city. During the year it was necessary to add five new units to the London company, making a total now of 14 units, each with a fine Kingdom hall from which to radiate their Kingdom activity. To finance so many Kingdom halls and five pioneer homes it was found advisable to set up a corporation recognized by the government. This was done, and the company is known as “London Company of Kingdom Witnesses”. The government objected to the word “Jehovah” which was originally submitted instead of “Kingdom” in the name. During the year almost all the larger companies in Britain have followed London’s example in procuring large, modern, new Kingdom halls from which to conduct their Kingdom work. Such is necessary for general advancement. Since the Society purchased its large 220-acre Kingdom farm in Essex last spring, a truckload of produce has been coming to London each week before service-meeting night and makes deliveries to each of the Kingdom halls in the city. This arrangement has kept the brethren fully supplied with produce, and is now of great assistance to the brethren during the emergency. The Society has also assisted twenty-five German brethren to find refuge in this country. Most of these are cared for in London and some on Kingdom farms. Twelve of these serve as pioneers in the London pioneer homes. These German brethren greatly rejoice to have such further share in the proclamation of The Theocracy. Negotiations were in progress for ten more to come over, but the war has now made this impossible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Building Program</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The year 1939 was marked for its Kingdom building program. In addition to the general reorganization under the new Theocratic zone arrangement, many of the larger companies moved into new and desirable Kingdom halls. Several new companies were organized and set up. New service units were added to London, Birmingham, Liverpool and Glasgow. Three hundred more pioneers entered the field. Twelve pioneer homes were put into operation. The 220-acre Kingdom farm was purchased and set going. Nearly a thousand new Jonadabs entered the work. Combining the full-time servants at Bethel, those on Kingdom farms and the pioneers, there are now more than 630 full-time workers for The Theocracy. Jehovah’s Theocratic Government is in operation and is on the increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The nations are now in the &quot;valley of decision”, and the zero hour has struck. The time for our deliverance is near. All the faithful brethren in Britain realize their position and are now ready to stand firm in their allegiance and devotion to The Theocracy. The course of our faithful brethren in Germany during the past six years of their persecution at the hands of the Nazi demons has blazed the trail which we may now be called upon to follow. If this is the Lord’s will, we rejoice to have such further share in demonstrating our love for Jehovah to the full vindication of his name under the leadership of our King Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>AFRICA (South, Central, and East)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Because South Africa is so far removed from America the fiscal year there ends August 31. The report, therefore, includes the year up to the date last mentioned. The same spirit that actuates God’s people in one part of the earth controls them in every part. All of the remnant and the “other sheep” of Jehovah are now seeing and more keenly appreciating the great Theocracy. The strong contrast between the nations and governments of this earth and the Theocratic Government continues to increase in clarity. Those who are on the side of the Theocracy have every reason to rejoice, while they observe the sorrow and sadness that weigh upon the peoples of earth who give their allegiance to Satan’s organization. They see an ever-increasing joy oh the part of those who have taken their stand on the side of Jehovah’s kingdom. They appreciate that this is the time that God foretold when his name must be proclaimed throughout the earth, and that just preceding the final conflict at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The publishers of God’s kingdom in South Africa have had their share of persecution during the year. The opposition to their work has not dampened their zeal in the slightest, but rather increased their earnest devotion to the Theocratic Government. The proclamation of the Kingdom message by the enthusiastic publishers in that part of the earth exceeded that of the year previous. There were placed in the hands of the people during the fiscal year books and booklets to the total number of 509,026. The field workers devoted 1,042,078 hours to this service. The publishers in the field totaled 3,179 persons. They put to use phonographs to the number of 337; transcription machines, 13; and sound-ears, 12. These machines reproducing public speech were heard by 396,839 persons. Back-calls were made to the number of 28,325.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s local representative at Cape Town, South Africa, in his report to the main office, sets out the following, which we are pleased to quote herein:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brother Rutherford’s letter of January 1, 1939, and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> article entitled “Kingdom Activities” coupled with the application of the instructions issued by Jehovah’s Theocratic Government twelve months ago, have resulted in a great forward move on the part of the Kingdom publishers in this part of the earth. The results achieved by the Lord’s grace during the past year far surpass anything previously accomplished. Opposition from the enemy forces has increased considerably, but Jehovah’s army of locusts, “as a strong people set in battle array,&quot; have climbed over the political and religious “walls” and “like men of war” have carried the fight into the enemy camp. The enemy has felt the “heat”, and their caterwauling has been heard from one end of the country to the other. The people of good will, on the other hand, have responded in greater number than ever before, and many of these have taken a definite stand on the Lord’s side and are now sharing in Kingdom activities. The distribution of literature from the office amounted to 82,540 volumes, and 550,908 booklets, or a total of 633,448 pieces, to compare with a total distribution the previous year of 533,943 books and booklets. These publications were in 25 different languages. Approximately 75 percent of the literature sent out was in European languages and 25 percent in Bantu and Asiatic. In addition we sent out 138 phonographs and 1,482 English discs, 102 in Afrikaans, and 438 in various African languages; a total of 2,022 discs, or 4,044 records, which represent an increase of 1,194 records over last year’s distribution. In all we have now distributed 458 phonographs and 14,680 records, all of which have been used to sound forth various aspects of the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The report for the house-to-house witness work in the various countries under the jurisdiction of the Cape Town office is submitted below. A comparison with the figures for the previous year reveals a healthy increase all along the line. A number of the pioneer and company publishers have exceeded the new quotas, and the others are putting forth their best endeavors to increase their time in the field service. One pioneer has exceeded 200 hours per month, and the best report from a company publisher reflects a total of 86 hours for the month. The number who attended the Memorial was 4,468, of whom 1,745 partook of the emblems. The peak of publishers was 4,025. The report follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Union of South Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to the latest census the population of South Africa consists now of two million Europeans and seven million Africans, and these are scattered over an area of 473,000 square miles. Practically all the European publishers in this part of the earth are resident in the Union, and that fact should be had in mind when considering the above report. In the Union the peak of publishers during the past year, attained in the April campaign, was 555, of whom 375 were Europeans. That represents an increase of 15 percent over the previous peak of 482.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and other special campaigns were entered into with enthusiasm, and the Lord gave the increase. New subscriptions numbering 1,016 were obtained for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">during the four months’ campaign. We do not have </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> in Afrikaans, and accordingly the Afrikaans </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vertroosting </span><span class="font4">was used in the Afrikaans-speaking centers, and 813 new subscriptions were obtained, also 370 new subscriptions for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font4"> Our total number of new subscriptions from January to April was therefore 2,221. In the same period over 16,000 bound volumes and 113,000 booklets were placed. During the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">October campaign the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Warning</span><span class="font4"> had a wide distribution, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font4"> booklet, released on January 1, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom,</span><span class="font4"> released on April 1, have both gone out like wildfire, and approximately 150,000 copies were placed by the end of August.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The recordings of the lectures “Warning”, “Violence,” <sup>4</sup> ‘ Face the Facts, ” “ Fill the Earth, ” “ Fascism or Freedom, ’ ’ and “Safety” have been much used, and these records and the advertising done in connection therewith by information marches and in other ways have greatly roused the ire of the Hierarchy’s agents in this country. Several front-page and leader articles dealing with the ‘ ‘ Kutherf ord campaign in South Africa ’ ’ have appeared in the chief organs of the Catholic Press. Efforts have been made by the Catholic Federation to induce owners of public halls to refuse use of them to Jehovah’s witnesses, but thus far such owners have refused to be intimidated and have sent these political religionists about their business, and thus have upheld the principle of freedom of assembly. The following are typical squawks from the Catholic Press: “Judge Kutherford’s leaflets and booklets are flooding the country, and thousands are flocking to hear his recorded lectures describing the efforts of ■ fanatical Fascists and Nazi dictators, with the aid and co-operation of the Koman Catholic Hierarchy at Vatican City, to wreck continental Europe’.” This is followed by the suggestion that halls should be denied us. And again: “The agents of Judge Kutherford’s Bible &amp;&nbsp;Watch Tower Society are active everywhere. This Society recently held a meeting in the Ked Cross Hall in Johannesburg. When the nature of this meeting [the Biblical lecture entitled ‘Fascism or Freedom’] was brought to the notice of the Ked Cross officials by The Catholic Federation, they regretted the incident and gave an assurance that it would not occur again. ’ ’ The Ked Cross Hall was packed out on that occasion, and an enthusiastic audience gave rapt attention to the fearless proclamation of the truth, joining in the applause at the end and thereby manifesting approval of the Lord’s message directed against the Hierarchy and all other enemies of God’s kingdom who would, if thev could, prevent the people from hearing the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Early in the year the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Etches</span><span class="font4"> and several booklets were banned by the Minister of the Interior as being “objectionable”. Representations were made to have the ban removed. Attention was called to the fact that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font4"> and other publications had been before the highest court in the land, viz., the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, as a result of the Rhodesian case and that the court had ruled the literature to be not seditious. The Minister refused, however, to alter his decision, and no reason or explanation for his action was forthcoming either fiom the Board of Censors or from the Department or the Interior. According to the existing law (which according to all enlightened opinion is sadly in need of revision) the Minister’s decision is final and there is no appeal to the courts. It later came to light that the Minister’s action was the result ol a wicked conspiracy hatched out by clergymen of the German Lutheran Synod, who were foolish enough to publish the Minister’s reply to their representations to have the literature banned in their German magazine. The letters which passed between the Society and those responsible for the banning, and the fact that public officials in this country had yielded to this Nazi effort to suppress Bible truths, were set forth in the form of “A Protest”, and such Protest has had a country-wide distribution in English and Afrikaans. We are now informed that the Minister has ruled that the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom</span><span class="font4"> is not objectionable! It was one of the pamphlets previously declared “objectionable”, and no alteration has taken place in the booklet meantime! Surely this is persuasive evidence that there is nothing ‘ ‘ objectionable ’ ’ in the other publications either, and we hope the Minister will yet have the manliness to rescind his decision with regard to the others on the banned list and which decision we have good reason to believe was taken in the first instance without full personal investigation on his part. With the exception of the Nazi-Fascist-Roman Catholic Hierarchy bloc, which is out to take away the liberties of the people and to suppress the truth, the great majority of South Africans stand for freedom of worship and speech, and the only result of the banning has been to stimulate interest in the Society’s publications. Thus, as always, the enemy overreaches himself and Jehovah gives his people the victory</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another diabolical effort to misrepresent the Society and its work was for the religionists to release a story in the press about a sinister “Secret Society” distributing inflammatory pamphlets to the natives in the Mine Compounds. It was stated in the ‘ ‘ story ’ ’ that foreign natives prohibited from entering the Union were in charge of the movement. Replying to a question in Parliament about this “story”, the Minister of Justice replied that it was “suspected that literature of the Watchtower movement was being distributed in the Mine Compounds and that the police were making investigation”. The facts regarding the Society and its work were set forth in a letter to the Press and to the Minister, and the leading newspapers in the country were fair enough to publish such facts. The enemy’s ruse to induce governmental action against the Society was thus frustrated and went off like a damp squib.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For some time we have felt the need to have a magazine published in this country in Afrikaans, and with your permission arrangements were made to publish an Afrikaans edition of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font4"> The first issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vertroosting,</span><span class="font4"> which is published once per month, appeared in. January, and by the end of July 40,000 copies had been distributed, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vertroosting</span><span class="font4"> is performing a useful service, and we hope to greatly increase its distribution as the months go by.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The back-call work is another feature of the work which has greatly increased during the past year. We acting on instructions from head office, all subscribers for the journals were called on. Other interest has also been followed up, and the result is an increase in the number of those attending the meetings and sharing in the service. The zone servants have been diligent in their part of the work, and regular reports are now received from 115 centers, to compare with 80 a year ago. Service assemblies were arranged in various zones as usual. A well-advertised public meeting at which one of the latest recordings is put over is always the main feature of such assemblies. The publishers enter into these rallies with enthusiasm, and the publicity given to the message is such that there can be but few, if indeed any, who do not receive a personal invitation to attend the meeting. Information marches, coupled with booklet distribution and street witnessing in the early part of the evening, was a new feature introduced during the year which yielded excellent results. In all it has been by far the best year yet enjoyed in Kingdom service, and we give praise to Jehovah for the increase He has given. The full and detailed report for the Union is attached hereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Southern Rhodesia</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nowhere in these countries has the progress of the witness work been more remarkable than in Southern Rhodesia. Southern Rhodesia covers an area of 150,000 square miles. The population consists of approximately 55,000 Europeans and million Africans. During the year just ended the full benefit of the High Court decision in favor of the Society’s literature has been experienced. There are only some fifteen European publishers in the country, and consequently the greater part of the work is carried forward by native Africans. A zone servant has visited the various companies, and these are now better organized and the brethren have a clearer understanding- of Jehovah’s organization and their relationship thereto than heretofore. There has been an average of 473 publishers, who have spent 154,811 hours in the field work, placing 7,872 volumes and 25,657 booklets. More publishers have armed themselves with phonographs and the records in English and Cinyanja, and these instruments, in addition to the literature, have been greatly used in bringing enlightenment to many who previously had been held as prisoners in the religious organizations. The difference between Christianity and religion is something that the African is now beginning to appreciate, too. One of the outstanding features of the work during the past year was the arrival of the first booklet in Chishona. It has brought great joy to the Kingdom publishers and to thousands of others living in Mashonaland. <sup>1</sup> ‘ Certain bodies of the churches, ’ ’ still smarting from their discomfiture resulting from their failure to have the books prohibited under the Sedition Act, have not attempted any further organized opposition, and the Lord’s work has progressed in an orderly way, the Kingdom publishers going from strength to strength. As the detailed report submitted herewith indicates, there has been a splendid increase in every part of the work. Although the Government can find no occasion against Jehovah’s witnesses, they still persist in their attitude of refusing to permit them to open a depot in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Northern Rhodesia</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Northern .Rhodesia there are approximately 12,000 Europeans and 1J million Africans. These are spread over an area of 290,000 square miles. The railway which runs from Cape Town to the Congo traverses the country, but apart from the Copper Belt there are no branch lines, and other transport facilities are few and far between. Practically all the witness work is carried forward by native Africans. These are almost entirely numbered amongst “the poor of this world’’, and many are the difficulties and obstacles to be overcome. A few own bicycles, but with the vast majority it is a case of footslogging all the time. Yet these fellows are “rich in faith”, and with the zeal peculiar to those in the Lord’s organization they have pushed forward and carried the Kingdom message into all corners of their territory. The provision of literature in Cinyanja and Chiwemba and records in the former language have been greatly appreciated and have helped forward the witness work immensely. It is with pleasure that we can report a good increase. During the past year there has been a monthly average of 7 full-time workers and 1,191 company publishers, to compare with 939 last year. They have averaged 100 and 28 hours per month respectively, placing 334 volumes and 33,343 booklets. Back-calls numbered 3,657, and the sound attendance was 53,623. Phonographs in regular use now number 23. The brother in the depot at Lusaka reports as follows: “The past year has been marked by increased activity in almost every aspect of Kingdom service, and there have been many encouraging evidences of the Lord’s continued blessing upon the witness which has been given in the territory. There has been an increase of 71 percent in the booklets placed; 150 percent in the sound attendance, and 107 percent in the hours spent in field service. The now instructions regarding organization have been put into full operation where possible, and on the Copper Belt, the richest and most populated area, these instructions together with the visits of the zone servant and regional servant have resulted in a state of zeal and understanding not hitherto attained by the publishers in Northern Rhodesia. In the distant parts, off the line and main roads, close contact is much more difficult to attain and maintain, and our few pioneers and zone servants have to travel by cycle or walk many hundreds of miles to reach scattered companies of interested people who seldom have a capable servant to help them in an understanding of the divine purpose as revealed in the Society’s literature. The will to serve is seldom lacking, but the difficulty of obta</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">inin</span><span class="font4">g an accurate knowledge of the truth is a very real one. The zone servants have worked with the spirit of Jehu, and many publishers have manifested their appreciation by cooperating fully with them. In spite of this there is very much to be done amongst Jehovah’s witnesses and those who yet have to hear the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom message. The African’s life, hidden as he often is in a village far from the strife of political affairs, makes it difficult for him to comprehend the meaning of dictatorship and the outworking of political mac</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">hin</span><span class="font4">ations, but the Lord’s spirit is manifest and Jehovah’s witnesses rejoice in Zion’s unity and protection. The missions are feeling the effect of our attack on religion, and with the Roman Catholic Church in the van they do everything possible to prevent the message from reaching the ears of their ‘prisoners’, many of whom manifest very little understanding of the Scriptures, but who are struck with the directness and beauty of the gospel message when they hear it. The gramophones have done much good work in bringing to the people in a clear way the Bible talks in Cinyanja, and these have been greatly appreciated. The Devil has seen to it that for many years a form of salute has been accorded to native chiefs, and many of these men, who for the most part are very ignorant and proud, have imprisoned Jehovah’s witnesses because they have not conformed to this custom, although they are perfectly willing to give them a friendly greeting. Other chiefs, who have a tolerant viewpoint, appreciate the Kingdom work in their district, and a few chiefs are numbered amongst the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom witnesses. The work amongst Europeans has increased, and much more interest has been manifested than in the past; some have definitely identified themselves as being on the side of the Lord and are passing on the Kingdom message to others whom they meet, but the Rhodesian, as a rule, is neither religious nor interested deeply in the gospel message.” The detailed report is attached hereto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Nyasaland</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are only 2,000 Europeans and million Africans in Nyasaland. It is not so vast as either of the Rhodesias, being 48,000 square miles in area. Traveling facilities, however, are even fewer, and practically all the Kingdom publishers require to rely on shanks’ pony to get to their territory. Money is practically </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">non est,</span><span class="font4"> and a penny (two cents) means a whole lot to a native of Nyasaland. However, it should be had in mind that the majority of natives in that country grow their own food supplies and have little need of clothing, so the majority are, in some respects at least, much better off than the average unemployed European in any town in Europe or America. During the year a number of publishers left the country and went to the Rhodesias in search of employment. Their places have been taken by others met during the year, and the average number of publishers remains about the same. Conditions referred to above make the distribution of literature more difficult in Nyasaland than elsewhere. Although the publishers have averaged 27 hours per month in the field, their placements average only 3 volumes and 23 booklets for the entire year. However, if placements are few and far between there is no lack of enthusiasm, and they try to make up by a faithful use of the phonograph and records in Cinyanja. As the report indicates, there has been a big increase in that part of the work. The depot servant reports as follows: ‘ ‘ The religionists in this country endeavor to keep the people in fear of what will happen to them if they associate with Jehovah’s witnesses. They tell the people that shortly Jehovah’s witnesses are going to be stopped and put in gaol or killed and that all with them will Buffer a like fate. The Roman Catholic priests go one better by saying that if the country were under Roman rule the work would have been stopped long ago, and anyhow the pope will soon destroy the Society’s work and dump Rutherford and all of Jehovah’s witnesses into the middle of the sea. As ‘the sea is going to deliver up her dead’, that will not help him much. However, even if the simple and fearful take heed to these rumors, the people of sincerity and good will look upon them as a sign that Jehovah’s witnesses are really the true followers of the Lord. They see the missionaries come and live in peace and then retire, and remember that Jesus said that His followers would be hated and persecuted for his name’s sake. They hear of Jehovah’s witnesses, learn of the Kingdom message and of the opposition it brings, and promptly settle down to get a hold of things, and once they do get a hold not many let go. The gramophone is a thorn in the side of the religious bugs, but the Kingdom message is as a draught of cool and refreshing water to the truth-hungry. The machines are ever<sup>1 </sup>busy, and requests of the villagers to ‘come here’ never cease.” The detailed report is submitted herewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Portuguese East Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Portuguese East Africa is a Catholic country, and accordingly the people are kept in subjection to the Hierarchy. The work is carried forward under great difficulty. The average number of publishers has increased from 14 to 17. The hours of field service have gone up from 2,836 to 4,422, and 1,567 books and booklets were distributed during the year. There are 3 phonographs in use, and the sound attendance totaled 5,382.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">St. Helena</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Great poverty exists amongst the islanders, of whom there are now less than 4,000. The general standard of education is</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">low, and the work is difficult. The two phonographs have again been put to regular use throughout the year, and 813 persons listened to the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom message. Booklets placed numbered 161. There are two small companies on the island, comprising 11 publishers in all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethe! Family</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There has been considerable increase in the work at the office, and we found it necessary in March to bring in one of the young pioneers to lend a hand. Letters received numbered 9,254, an increase of 1,203 over last year. Letters dispatched numbered 10,002, and circulars </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Informants'),</span><span class="font4"> 9,308. New subscriptions totaled 3,317, to compare with 1,960 last year. The Afrikaans </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Vertroosting</span><span class="font4"> was launched in January, and 50,200 copies were printed in eight months. One of the Cape Town company publishers has come in for a few days each month and has given much useful assistance in the folding, collating and stitching of the magazine. The recent addition of an automatic cutter and a folder to our printing equipment will help out considerably with that part of the work. In addition, we have printed 150,000 copies of a 4-page Protest and 693,850 leaflets and pieces of office stationery. The dispatch desk sent out 3,546 cartons, 3,507 post packets, and 14,668 journals. These figures are all greatly in excess of anything done before. On our recording apparatus we made 976 twelve-inch records in Cinyanja, Sesuto, Zulu, and Xosa, and these have been used throughout the various countries under the care of this office. In addition to our indoor activities, we have again had a full share in the field work. There has been a monthly average of 7 publishers. During the first part of the year we averaged 21 hours each per month; since January the individual average has been 33 hours per month. The report and a comparison with last year’s figures follow:</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> in its new cover continues to be greatly appreciated. The new method of study has proved to be of real help. Brethren who have followed the suggestion to prepare the study in advance and write out questions for consideration have benefited most and have obtained a clear understanding of the prophecies. We give our grateful thanks to the Lord for it and for all the other bountiful provisions of his love which come so regularly from the headquarters of his organization on earth. The new book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> has been the crowning blessing of an eventful year. It is surely the most lucid presentation of the truth we have yet had. Armed with this new weapon, we will, by the Lord’s grace, be still more diligent in our efforts to reach the people of good will. The war clouds are banking up in Europe as this is written. &quot;Christendom’s” &quot;walls” are crumbling. It is more apparent than ever why the suggestion came in January to speed up. We appreciate your bold and courageous lead and your untiring efforts to honor Jehovah’s name. We send our love and assure you that the South African division of Jehovah’s army is keeping in step with their brethren throughout the earth. In the strength of the Lord we go forward, united in heart and mind, singing the praises of Jehovah, assured of His protection and determined to maintain our integrity until his name is vindicated.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>AFRICA (West)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The witness work directed from Lagos, Nigeria, embraces the territories of Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Gold Coast. The number of publishers in the field during the year has increased, and, together with the increased numbers, their zeal for the Theocratic Government has increased; and, in the face of many difficulties and much persecution by religionists, they have given a good witness by means of the books, booklets, and phonograph lectures. Some of the workers traveled long distances in carrying the message to isolated people. They encountered all manner of trials and persecution, but these they courageously met, by the Lord’s grace. Some of them were beaten and the literature was seized and thrown away by the religionists, but on the faithful witnesses went regardless of persecution. The Society’s representative at Lagos traveled more than two thousand miles in the provinces with the sound-car, proclaiming the message of the Kingdom by electrical transcription. The clergy have notified the people in advance to avoid the sound-ear, but this only increases the desire of the people to find out what it is all about, and so they listen to the message of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The message has spread during the year in the land of Yoruba. The recorded lectures’ being put out in that language has been greatly appreciated by the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The difficulties, especially in the Gold Coast, have increased during the year, and brethren who went through that country with the sound-ear make the following report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The inscription “</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom Message” on the loudspeaker, which was the first of its kind to be seen on the Gold Coast, angered the clergy, and they became terrified when they heard the broadcasting of Judge Rutherford’s lectures. They moved the authorities to be persecuting us, in that we were several times called by the police superintendents in both the Central and the Western Provinces and cautioned not to operate the sound-car. Seeing there was no law to prevent us from operating, we went on witnessing in other places, leaving the capital towns. In one instance the licensing officer at Takoradi, Western Province, threatened to cancel our ear license if he again saw the loudspeaker on our car, and we did all we could to prevent his seeing it. Those of good will showed great interest and appreciation of the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom message by sound-car, and in three months we placed over 100 bound books and over 20,000 booklets. At the bidding of Satan through his visible religious agents, the Gold Coast Government has now framed mischief by making a law (New Regulation No. 20 of 1939) under which no motor vehicle on the Gold Coast must be fitted with any loudspeaker without first getting a permit from the authority. The religionists have succeeded, too, in getting the authorities to close all ports against our literature, and circulars have been sent to all post offices to have a check on all our letters and parcels to ensure that no Watchtower publications come into the country. Now that the British. Empire is at war with Germany, the difficulty has increased. The literature that was shipped to us a few months ago was not allowed importation, and our application to have them re-exported was refused. Not long after the publications were destroyed an earthquake occurred, in which Accra, the place where our literature was ordered to be destroyed and burnt, suffered more than any other town on the Gold Coast, and many of the Government buildings were badly damaged. Amidst all opposition, we continue the witnessing, which had great effects on the religious leaders, who are becoming madder than before. We are confident of the fact that the Lord Jesus will surely execute all his enemies at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another way in which the witnessing is being done here, a way which the Lord himself has undoubtedly opened, is through the Press. A regular column is reserved daily for our articles headed “Face the Facts”. Reproductions of Brother Rutherford ’s writings are made, and these not only made the Hierarchy become mad, but also howling, as the Scriptures say they would do. Many through the Press have learnt the truth. In one case of the Hierarchy’s howling, the Ashanti editor of the Gold Coast </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Voice</span><span class="font4"> made reference to the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font4"> stating that Watchtower publications are meant to sting and that they do really sting. This reference in their own newspaper has served to advertise the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font4"> for many of the Catholic people thereafter asked for the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light,</span><span class="font4"> so that our stock here was exhausted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The distribution of the message of the Kingdom through the printed books and booklets has increased during the year, the number totaling 223,842. There have been 636 publishers in the field, who engaged in the service for 187,325 hours. They have used 113 phonographs and sound machines, to which 355,123 persons listened. Back-calls numbered 3,166. Withal, the work has increased. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> subscriptions have increased, 256 new subscriptions being added during the year. In view of the great amount of opposition and persecution, this witness during the year has brought great joy to those interested in the Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>ARGENTINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Although the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has great power and influence in Argentina, not yet have they been able to stop the onward march of the Kingdom message. It should be kept in mind at all times that Jehovah God, the Almighty, long ago said to Satan: TVIy name shall be declared throughout the earth.’ Therefore we must conclude that the Almighty is holding back Satan’s representatives on earth and preventing them from stopping the work until his name is proclaimed in such countries as Argentina. The publishers are few in number in that country, and it is not to be expected that they would accomplish so great a work. They are, however, making known the Theocracy throughout that dark country. During the year they placed in the hands of the people 184,218 books and booklets. The literature distributed in this country is chiefly in the Spanish language. It is quite evident that the Lord is gathering some of the Spanish people of that land into the fold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society's office directs the work from Buenos Aires and includes not only Argentina but also Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay. Forty-one phonographs and transcription machines have been used in these countries to reproduce the spoken message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Chile there are always some internal disturbances, but the 28 publishers in that country during the year placed in the hands of the people a total of 24,315 books and booklets, which is some increase over the year previous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Uruguay ten publishers placed 21,606 books and booklets. Eight of these publishers are pioneers, six of them refugees from Germany, who have rejoiced in the privilege of escaping from that sin-ridden government and finding a place where they can worship God without interference from the rulers. Most of the population is Catholic, but there are some who are sincere in their desire to serve the great Theocrat, and these are taking the message with joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Paraguay only a few publishers were engaged in the work, placing a total of 1,740 books and booklets, which is below that of last year. Climatic conditions are such that it is difficult for one from outside to go into the country and stay long at a time. The people are extremely poor. There are few roads and only one railroad line in the whole country. The people in their degraded condition are constantly preyed upon by those who carry on a religious racket.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">We are preparing for another year of fighting, if the Lord permits, and we pray to God for the final victory for His cause.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark74"></a>AUSTRALASIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The advertising of the Theocratic Government has progressed in Australasia during the fiscal year. The work is directed locally from Sydney, Australia, and includes the following countries:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Australia &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hong Kong</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Burma &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaya</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fiji &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Netherlands East Indies</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">French Indo-China New Zealand</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thailand (Siam)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The viciousness of Satan and his earthly crowd has been manifested in an unusual manner in the countries above mentioned during the year. The HierarchyFascist combine, representing Satan’s organization and being part of it, have resorted to every means within their power to stop the onward march of the advertising of the Theocratic Government. The results, however, show a complete failure. The opposition to the Kingdom message has increased the determination of the Kingdom publishers to push on with the Lord’s work regardless of all opposition, trusting fully in Jehovah and his King, Christ Jesus, to protect them and lead them on until the publishing work is finished and Armageddon has come. In practically every part of that field the witness work has increased in the face of ever-increasing opposition. It is therefore manifest that the Lord is permitting the Devil and his cohorts to put forth their very best endeavors, and at the same time he is increasing the proclamation of his name throughout that part of the earth and soon will bring on Armageddon, which will completely cut the enemy to pieces. There has been a large increase in the Watchtower literature publishing the Theocratic Government. During the fiscal year books and booklets to the total number of 1,331,288 have been placed in the hands of the people, and, in addition to this, a large amount of other literature bearing the like message has been received by the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The report filed by the Society’s local representative and servant at Sydney, Australia, so well covers the work in that part of the earth that the major portion of that report is set out below, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have just closed the most momentous year of activity in the history of the Australasian branch. Each of the twelve months has been packed with battles, in which the enemy showed increasing viciousness and put forward most strenuous efforts to stop the work, and, at the same time, each month has seen a rapidly growing number of persons of good will lining themselves up with the Theocratic Government and actively participating in the work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The highlights of the year were, undoubtedly, the world-wide conventions from London and New York, both of which were relayed to Australia, and the release of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font4"> the textbook for the Jonadabs. Brother Rutherford’s speeches and the new book gave the Kingdom publishers a real “kick” to fight on with even greater determination, giving no quarter, nor asking for any.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">General Report</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is a real joy to report the tremendous increase in the work during the year. The total number of books and booklets placed was 1,331,288, to compare with 919,244 last year. Additionally there were placed 236,261 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> and 28,270 of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> besides 7,201 subscriptions. Brother Rutherford’s letter of January 1, 1939, made the matter of hours devoted to the Lord in field service a responsibility clear and plain to every publisher. A diligent effort has been made to put in at least two hours each day, and the result has been an amazing increase in hours for the concluding six months of the year. Where the aggregate for last year was 379,586 hours, the figures show 481,937 for this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Particularly since January 1, the number of active publishers has shown a surprising increase of 48 percent over that of the previous year. It is now clearly seen that the Jonadabs coming into the organization do not need to wait for years until they accumulate a so-called ' ‘ thorough knowledge of the Scriptures ’ ’. They study </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> quickly see their privileges of service, and then lose no time in getting right into the field service. It is a source of great joy to see the zeal manifested by these new publishers as they join up with their brethren in the fight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pioneers: In response to the call for more full-time publishers an average of 183 pioneers have been witnessing in various parts of the territory during the year. There have been 271 pioneers on the list, 210 being in Australia, 35 in New Zealand, and 26 scattered throughout the islands and Far Eastern countries. These brethren have worked amidst great opposition on the part of the Catholic-Fascists. In one ease three pioneers, camped near Wangaratta, were thrown from their beds by a mob of Roman Catholic hooligans, and their Bibles, books and records burned. Legal action was taken and several of the perpetrators were convicted and fined. The honest people of the district have shown considerable interest in the truth since the incident.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Companies: Following the Organization Instructions, the territory has been divided into zones and each of the 124 companies is now visited regularly by a zone servant. The increased efficiency and greater effort now being put forward by the companies is ample evidence of the success of the new organization under the Theocratic Government. The companies, or units in cases of larger cities, have midweek meetings for every ten or so publishers and interested people. At each of these meetings a capable publisher acts as group servant and is the contact between the company servant and that particular meeting. This publisher makes it his job to personally check on the </span><span class="font4">stock requirements, territory and reports, etc., of those at his meeting and is responsible to pass on this information to the unit or company servant. This makes for real efficiency and thorough organization in the companies. The average number of company publishers and isolated servants reporting monthly was 1,357 for the first six months of the year, and increased to 2,008 for the latter six months. A peak was reached in May, when 2,367 reported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Back-Calls: These have played a prominent part in the year’s work, and this has no doubt accounted for the gratifying increase in number of publishers. A total of 35,968 back-calls were made, on which occasions the various series of recordings were played on phonographs and literature was presented. The following up of the door-to-door work by calling back on the interested persons has undoubtedly helped those of good will take their stand for the Kingdom more than any other method, and the publishers fully appreciate the importance of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Special efforts were made during the year to equip every witness with a phonograph and the latest discs. Each company operated, under the Society’s direction, what is termed the ’“Phonograph Club”. The club provides even the poorest publisher with a machine, and he then pays regularly into the club what he is able until the machine becomes his own property. The result is that of the total number of 2,983 individual publishers working, 2,236 are using the phonograph, or 75 percent. In addition to this individual equipment there are 146 portable transcription machines and 41 sound-cars in the field. Reports show that 577,859 listeners heard the recorded lectures during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sound work has so spiked the enemy’s guns that a frantic effort is being made to silence the machines. All over the country councils have adopted ordinances forbidding the use of soundcars. Many publishers have spent time in jail for taking the Kingdom message to the people by this means, but, much to the chagrin of the religionists, they continue undaunted. We have in mind that they got tired of jailing our brethren in New Jersey and will probably do the same here when they see we mean to go ahead. In the state of Queensland a law has been passed which empowers the police to seize a machine if the operator continues to broadcast after he has been warned to cease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society’s boat, the ' ‘ Lightbearer ’ ’, equipped with a powerful amplifier, has been active in the Sydney harbor. The judge’s voice travels for miles over the water, and a great deal of territory that could not be conveniently covered by road is taken care of in this manner. A smaller and faster sound-boat, the ‘‘Lightray”, is also doing excellent work on the rivers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A vigorous effort has been made to stop the sound-boats, but so far it has been unsuccessful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Advertising</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Without a doubt God’s organization operates the most successful and efficient advertising campaign on earth, and it is this persistent advertising that has done so much to annoy the “old lady’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have found that newspaper ads, screen slides and the like are expensive and most ineffective compared with our own information marches, leaflet distribution and sound-car announcements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the New York convention three hundred marchers went through the streets of Sydney and caused the greatest sensation in years. Pictures and write-ups appeared in the press and everybody was talking of it and the lecture, “Government and Peace,’’ being advertised. Pour of the brethren were arrested and thrown into jail, where they remained for five days. The magistrate later dismissed the case against them because of lack of evidence and the conflicting stories told by the police. One of those arrested is taking action for false arrest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A regular part of the information-march equipment is the cardboard megaphone. Each sixth marcher or so calls attention to the information on the sign by this means, and it has proved to be really effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In order to give as many persons as possible an opportunity to hear Brother Rutherford’s lectures “Face the Facts’’, “Fill the Earth, ’ ’ and ‘<sup>1</sup> Fascism or Freedom ’ ’, an extensive campaign was put into operation which involved the engagement of halls throughout the country and the thorough advertising of the meetings by every possible means at the disposal of the publishers. In the last two months prepaid contracts for at least seven halls have been canceled a few hours before the lecture, even though the meeting has been advertised for weeks beforehand. We are taking legal action in these cases to teach the Catholic-Fascists that Australia isn’t all theirs yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The city of Newcastle is the center of a vast coal-field and steel industry. Its population numbers a quarter of a million people. Early in May the servant of the local company made application for the city hall in which to present “Face the Facts” and paid over the money for the hire of the hall. An intensive advertising campaign was arranged and for three weeks leaflets were distributed, announcements made by soundcar and radio, and information marches conducted throughout the city. On the morning of the lecture unofficial notice was received that our engagement of the hall was canceled. No explanations were given and the notice was ignored. Advertising continued, and the civic fathers became desperate. At the scheduled time there were a thousand people gathered outside the hall, but' the lights were out and an unsigned notice on the doors announced that the meeting was off. The chairman climbed on the top of a sound-car and told the crowd what had happened and that the Catholic-Fascists were responsible. All but a few parochially trained hooligans vigorously applauded the remarks and unhesitatingly adopted a resolution protesting against the action of the mayor. A special leaflet setting forth the facts in very clear language was printed overnight and distributed to every home next day. A contingent of 100 publishers came by boat from Sydney to join in the fray and help with the work. Public opinion in Newcastle during the succeeding weeks showed clearly that the mayor’s action of suppression was not at all appreciated. Thousands of persons signed a petition to hear the lecture in the town hall. Later application was again made, this time for the lecture ‘ ‘ Fascism or Freedom ’ ’. The Council in considering the matter voted 18 to 2 in favor of our having it. A good crowd heard the lecture at the city hall, and although there were a number of hooligans sent there by the Catholic priests, they were too afraid to do anything. This was a real victory for the Lord’s army, and the Devil’s representatives have not recovered yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">New York Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren throughout Australia assembled in Sydney for a united convention to coincide with the New York convention. Application was made for the Sydney town hall, and it was refused. This action, as in the case when Brother Rutherford was here in person, resulted in plenty of newspaper publicity, and the subject was again the topic of conversation throughout the city. Sir Benjamin Fuller, one of the few lovers of freedom among the peers, read of the banning of the town hall and voluntarily offered to hire one of his theaters for the occasion. A real service convention was held there, and both of Brother Rutherford’s speeches, ' ‘ Victory ’ ’ and ‘ ‘ Government and Peace”, were received with remarkable clarity. Even though the public lecture came through at 6 o’clock on Monday morning, a good crowd assembled in the hall to hear it. Everyone was tense as Brother Rutherford announced: ‘‘The Catholics and the Nazis are trying to break up this meeting, but, by God’s grace, they cannot do it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">News of the new book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> was received with tumultuous applause from the conventioners, and the following cable was immediately dispatched:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘‘Two thousand non-loafers full of sting heard speech extraordinarily clear. Ship five thousand author’s, hundred thousand regular. Orders pouring in.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the close of our year, July 31, we are keenly looking forward to putting this book not only in every home in Australasia, but, if possible, in the hands of every person in the country, during the coming months. Our slogan is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">“Salvation</span><span class="font4"> for every home and everyone in the home”. The opposition both in New York and in Sydney roused the fighting spirit </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font4"> the brethren, and they went away from the convention determined to thrash the enemy all the way to Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“Consolation”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On November 30, 1938, we began to print the Australian edition of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font4"> In eight months the circulation has reached 15,000 copies per issue and is rapidly gaining ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Until the necessary machinery could be installed at Strathfield the Lord provided for the publishing of the magazine at Adelaide. The equipment, however, is now ready, and the factory at Strathfield is capable of turning out “more and better” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> magazines, as well as any other literature if it should be needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren throughout Australia and New Zealand responded enthusiastically to the call for funds to procure equipment, with the result that a big printing press, typesetting machine, and folding, binding and cutting machines are now running the first issue to be printed at Strathfield.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The privilege of having our own magazine is fully appreciated, and we are indeed grateful to Jehovah for this provision. The publishers are determined to make the fullest use of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> in the fight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“Watchtower” Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign began a most intensive effort in all branches of the service. More publishers, more hours and back-calls, and more new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> readers. During these four months 476,854 books and booklets were placed, almost equaling the placements for the previous six months. New subscriptions to the number of 4,244 were entered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was particularly during the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign that the publishers concentrated on Friday evening street witnessing. From the success of this work it is apparent that the blessing of the Lord has been upon it. This work has proved most effective in meeting people who live in hotels and boarding houses and are seldom met in the regular door-to-door work. Street witnessing has become a definite regular part of our field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In February a shipment of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies, Year Book, </span><span class="font4">and Calendars was held up by the Customs authorities, and we had considerable difficulty in obtaining them. Obviously acting on the advice of the religionists, they objected to the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies,</span><span class="font4"> and it looked for a while as though it would be banned. We made representation to the Government at Canberra and eventually were able to get the shipment without further bother. The Devil’s crowd are doing the’r utmost to prevent the Kingdom message from coming into the country, but they won’t get away with it without a fight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Kingdom Farms</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hard work on the part of the brethren operating the Society’s four Kingdom farms has made these a real credit to the organization. Many improvements were made during the year, with a result that production has been considerably increased and the values of the properties correspondingly enhanced. The farms are able to maintain the Kingdom families at Strathfield and other centers with much of their food supplies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Radio</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The persistent broadcasting of the Kingdom message by five courageous stations in Australia has given the Catholic-Fascists considerable pain. They have stooped low to force these stations off the air, but so far have been unsuccessful. Hundreds of letters testify that the honest people appreciate hearing the lectures by this means, and it has thus opened the way for the publishers when they cab at their doors. In Australia, where the homes are scattered over such a vast area, the radio continues to play a big part in advertising the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">New Zealand</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In. the early part of the service year the Labour Socialist government of New Zealand was returned to power by a substantial majority. Because of its humanitarian legislation in favor of the working classes, its many supporters frequently stated that it was their conception of God’s kingdom on earth. This caused many to turn away from the Kingdom message and fasten their hopes on a man-made government. Subsequent events, however, have shown their hopes to be misplaced. Financial difficulties now involve the government, so that it is impossible to send away even amounts of a few shillings to other countries without a special permit, which permit is likely to be refused unless good reasons are given in support of the application. As a result of these conditions the cost of living is steadily rising and the benefits of good wages and regular employment which the people hoped to enjoy are rapidly vanishing. Being disappointed at the non-fulfillment of the government’s promise of prosperity, many people are now beginning to realize that the Kingdom is the only place of safety. Importation of goods is also regulated and restricted by the Government. We are still able to send into the country what books and records are required by the publishers; so the Kingdom work is thus far not hampered by this measure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year 308 publishers placed 195,344 books and booklets with the people and made 3,066 back-calls in the Dominion. Last year 204 publishers placed 131,897 pieces of literature and made 460 back-calls. Total hours of field service have increased from 47,889 to 56,678.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Burma</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The work in Burma has progressed briskly since November, when a big convention was held in Kango on. Brother Rutherford's Australian lecture “Warning” was the feature drawing a crowd of 2,000 persons. Considerable interest was shown, and many of the audience passed in their names for back-calls. The report shows that four persons and 24 company publishers spent 4,762 hours in the field, placed 15,030 books and booklets, and made 396 back-calls. This is an increase over the previous year of 11,383 pieces of literature, 3,967 hours, and 378 back-calls. All other phases of the work have correspondingly increased. For the past few months there has been much trouble and disturbance throughout Burma. There were continual riots as a result of anti-British propaganda carried on amongst the native population there, and the people were demanding a dictator. This made the witness work rather difficult for a time, but the situation has calmed down considerably now. Also, because of the intensity with which the work has been carried on, there has been a good deal of opposition from the Catholic Hierarchy, who fear that their pastures are being spoiled, which is actually the case. Besides these obstacles there are five months of continual rain in Burma each year. In view of these factors it can be seen, on looking at the report, that the publishers have rendered a good account of themselves for the year just gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">French Indo-China</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One lone pioneer has valiantly kept the banner of the Theocratic Government flying in French Indo-China. Much of his time has necessarily been devoted to translation work, with the result that hours of field service and bound books placed are lower than last year. To offset this, however, two booklets have been printed in Annamese, the native tongue, and these have had a wide distribution. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Warning</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font4"> have been translated and are in the hands of the printers. Tonkin and Annam, two of the protectorates where the work was formerly prohibited, were opened for the Kingdom message during the year, as the present conditions are very uncertain in this country, owing to the activities of Japan. It is well known that the Japanese covet the country because of its riches and also because its acquisition would open the way to South China. The island of Hainan, right at the front door of French Indo-China, is already a Japanese possession. In spite of the heavy rains and the great heat encountered in this land, together with other difficulties, the year has closed with 677 hours spent in the service, and 435 books and 3,617 booklets being placed with the people. The “spade work” accomplished should make it possible to give a very thorough witness in this land in the new year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Hong Kong</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The island of Hong Kong received only a broken witness during the past year. A pioneer went there in February and witnessed until May, when he was transferred to Shanghai. Keen interest was displayed as a result of the work done, however, and there is a sufficient number of persons interested to form a live company. The reports show that 216 hours were spent in the service, during which time 238 books and 770 booklets were placed and 14 subscriptions taken. Nineteen back-calls were made. There is a fine field for work in Hong Kong, and it is anticipated that at least one worker will be proceeding there shortly to organize the work on a proper basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Malaya</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The extremely cosmopolitan population of Malaya presents such obstacles as cannot be avoided by any faithful witness in this territory. During the year the work for the most part has been carried on by two pioneers and the varied number of company publishers ranging from six at the beginning to sixteen at the end thereof. The number of pioneers in the field has now increased to four. Malaya has now had a thorough witness throughout, the pioneers having well covered the country territory while the local company, which is better organized than ever before, is taking care of the work in Singapore. Much organizing remains to be done, and we are grateful that a regional servant has now been provided. Hours spent in the field service and placements of literature are lower this year, but this is largely offset by the splendid increase in back-call work, there being an increase of 450 over last year. The number of subscriptions taken increased by 529. Our work is now much better known throughout the country, and greater interest has been shown as a result. For some time we have felt the great need of a publication to present to the native Malay population in their own language (Jawi). We are thankful that arrangements are now under way to have the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Protection</span><span class="font4"> booklet printed at Brooklyn, and we expect to do good work with it in the coming year. Apart from the fact of Jawi publications, the people of this land are now fairly well catered for, especially as we now have </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> in Chinese and a good range of publications in the Indian vernacular. Results of the work during the year are as follows: highest number' of publishers, 21; hours in field service, 6,722; books placed, 7,808; and booklets, 24,383. Attendance numbered 9,695 people, 531 back-calls were made, and 801 subscriptions taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Netherlands East Indies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The activities of God’s people in the Netherlands East Indies during the past year have produced results that far eclipse any records to date for that portion of our territory. In recent months the work has been better organized, and the office in Batavia is better able to co-operate more closely with the workers. The arrival of two experienced brethren from Holland towards the end of the year assisted greatly in this direction. The Dutch government is very careful not to ofEend the Fascist dictators, and as a result the officials in Java are keeping a vigilant watch on our activities, and care is taken that none of the banned publications are distributed. An example of such activities was experienced in connection with the Hollandish </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> sent from Berne office to subscribers in this territory. Many were never delivered, but were redirected back to Berne. It was later learned that the attorney general had issued instructions that our magazines were to be withheld for two months. This took place at a time when the Government also suspended several newspapers for publishing anti-Fascist views. There is, however, no shortage of literature in the languages spoken there, as can be seen from the fact that during July the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> was received in Chinese, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Armageddon</span><span class="font4"> in Malay, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font4"> in Hollandish. Thus the Devil’s attempts to stop the work in this section only serve to more fully expose the activities of his agents. Two powerful weapons now in the hands of the workers are the Malay </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation, </span><span class="font4">which began publication in January, and the Malay </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> published later. In six months 10,000 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> were printed and placed in the hands of the people. In addition there are now upward of 400 regular subscribers. In more than eight years now the work has been progressing steadily in Java and Sumatra. At the same time Celebes has been opened up, a native pioneer having been there for the latter part of the year. Many subscriptions have been obtained, and much interest found generally. The result of the year’s work is as follows: 24 publishers, 11,018 hours, 4,019 books, 39,042 booklets, 608 new subscriptions, 1,432 sound attendance, and 214 back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Thailand (Siam)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Work in Thailand, formerly known as Siam, was resumed in September last, when three pioneers proceeded there. As a result of their combined efforts the year just closed has been by far the best ever had in this country. One of the brethren left for other territory in November, and the two remaining carried on until the end of the year. Apart from the native population, the predominant people of Thailand are the Chinese, there being few Europeans. Until recently, however, the lack of suitable publications, together with the indifference of the natives because of their Buddhist religion, have made it somewhat difficult to give a good witness. Now, by the Lord’s grace, we have the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Protection</span><span class="font4"> to offer them in their own language, and for the past four months this booklet has been used with great effect by the workers. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts, Cure,</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Some and Happiness</span><span class="font4"> are also being translated. Bangkok, the capital, has received a good witness, being covered two years ago and now about completed again. The many tin </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font4">es, particularly in the southern districts, have also been visited, a number of the managers and clerks now being </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> subscribers. Considerable difficulty is experienced, however, on account of lack of roads, and consequently there are vast areas, particularly towards the north, where a witness has never been given. In spite of the great obstacles presented to the workers in this part of the territory, they have given a good account of themselves, having spent 3,151 hours in the service, during which 4,067 books and 14,592 booklets were placed. There were 71 back-calls made and 113 subscriptions taken; 181 people heard the phonograph lectures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FIJI</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The natives of Fiji are particularly teachable, and ready to learn of Jehovah’s provision for them. The ruling powers, however, are determined to keep these lovable people under the thumb, in order that they may better enslave them to their commercial and religious racket. For this reason the Government has openly connived with the religionists in an endeavor to keep the people in the dark as to God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In July, 1938, the Government issued an order ba</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">nni</span><span class="font4">ng certain of the Society’s literature and records. An explanation was called for. but the Government stated they were not prepared to state the reason for issue of these. In October ten eartons of banned literature were shipped to Fiji. These were held by the Customs “pending further investigations”; but the further investigations reached their culmination in the burning of the books. In the meantime, a faithful little band of warriors had done good work in circulating a petition and advertising the high-handed action of the Government. Cables were sent to the governor of Fiji and King George VI protesting against the Orders in Council and placing the blame where it belonged. The authorities have been most vicious in their efforts to “get” Jehovah’s witnesses. On March 29 of this year a new ordinance was passed stating that anyone in possession of any prohibited Watchtower publications must deliver same to the nearest police station or pay a fine of £50 in default, twelve months’ imprisonment, or both. The publishers have not been deterred one jot, but, trusting fully in the strength of the Lord, have vigorously pushed forward a campaign with the banned literature. The Lord has blessed their efforts, and thus far the Government has taken no action. On April 20 this year the Society by and through its representative in Fiji, took legal action against the Government of the Colony because of the unwarranted banning of the Kingdom message. Although the case was lost, for two hours a splendid witness was given to the authorities, and they now know exactly where they stand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A local newspaper was approached and given the opportunity of publishing the facts, but refused. The brethren thereupon made use of the duplicator to print a small magazine, which was distributed far and wide together with the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom.</span><span class="font4"> So great was the interest raised that people even came after the publishers on bicycles and in ears for more copies. It is reliably reported that the Government had two solicitors working on the leaflet for one whole afternoon in an effort to bring a case, but they failed to reach a decision. The co</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">mm</span><span class="font4">on people admit that the facts discussed in the leaflet are true, and this is causing the Government great discomfort. Repeated application to the authorities eventually brought fruit. On 6th July a consignment of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font4"> was released. The local representative of Watchtower writes: “It is indeed a great victory. Praise the Lord. It is tantamount to their saying, ‘For the love o’ Mike, let these fellows have their own way; they have caused us enough bother.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In June application was made for the Suva town hall for the lecture “Face the Facts’’, but this was turned down. An open letter was written the town clerk, and copies were freely distributed throughout the town. On August 1 the lecture was given in the Nausori town hall before a packed house. Although </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> has now been banned, the work marches on apace. At the present time the Fiji brethren are making their own recordings in the native dialect. The use of these will greatly advance the witness among the native population and will clearly demonstrate to the authorities that Jehovah has servants on earth who are willing to go ahead in defiance of every barrier Satan may raise against them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year 8 publishers worked 663 hours, placing a total of 2,762 pieces of literature, 109 magazines, and 6 subscriptions. 26 back-calls were made, and 4,485 people listened to the sound machines and phonographs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethel Family</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although the family at Strathfield office has been kept very busy, due to the increase of the organization, the year just past has been a record for activity in field service. The family has been thoroughly organized into seven groups, each with a group leader, and so the family operates as a mobile fighting force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An average of 72 publishers reported each month. These brethren spent 10,174 hours in the field, to compare with 4,965 hours in the field last year, and placed 29,065 books and booklets, an increase of 20,397. The family works mostly with the local company, but also takes full advantage of trips to the country areas. At present many regular studies among the interested people in outlying districts are being established.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every member of the family realizes the importance of field service and delights in spending as much time as possible in the field with their brethren of the pioneer and company ranks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Catholic Fascists are taking advantage of the war in their endeavor to stop the witness work in Australia. At the instance of this unholy crowd the government has enacted the War Precautions Act, empowering the military to suppress anything that in the judgment of the military may be considered -dangerous. Thus we see that the enemy is crowding in from every quarter. The enemy is now in “the valley”, and the “concision”, that is, the cutting to pieces, will take place shortly. (Joel 3:14) The Catholic-Fascist-Coughlinite methods employed at the Madison Square Garden are being used by that crowd all over the earth. For instance, in New South Wales, in the city of Singleton, while a transcription meeting in a hall, using the records “Fascism or Freedom”, was in progress, the hoodlums above mentioned used eggs with which to assault the audience, smashed windows, and also threw bricks which injured several people. About 500 of the Catholic Fascists were engaged in this riot. Jehovah’s witnesses in that country have now adopted the habit of carrying walking sticks, and this may somewhat deter the Coughlinites. The fact that the same methods that the Coughlinites have adopted in New York are adopted in other parts of the earth shows that the Catholics and Fascists are working together to destroy the liberties of the people and force the people under the rule of a dictator. This terrible condition cannot last long. The Kingdom is here, and God’s government of righteousness will wipe out the wicked and establish righteousness forever.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>BRAZIL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Throughout the land of Brazil the religious racketeers have erected many buildings which they call “churches” and from which places priests keep the people in darkness and collect from them their hard-earned money. The Hierarchy is very strong and very influential and exercises much power over the political or ruling element and makes it difficult for the Lord's people to carry on the work in that land. In the face of all such opposition there has been a decided increase in the publishing of the Theocratic Government in that land. In the year that is closed the publishers placed in the hands of the people in that land 163,092 books and booklets. There have been 114 publishers in the field, and they have devoted 45,454 hours to the work and have taken 283 new subscriptions for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> Those who have attended the reproduction of oral speech by sound instruments are, to wit, 279,582, and the publishers have made back-calls to the number of 1,363. Seventy-nine phonographs and transcription machines have been in operation. In addition to the above, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> copies to the number of 5,163, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> to the number of 12,423, have been distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The servant of the Lord, the Society's representative, makes report to this office, and the following is extracted from that report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the close of the busiest and most thrilling year, it is with profound joy and deep gratitude to Jehovah that this report of the activities for the past twelve months is forwarded to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Setting</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In a land where the Hierarchy has held unbroken sway for more than 400 years, where in every village stands one or more Catholic churches in the most prominent place, where the officials do the bidding of the priests, where the vast majority of the people are unlettered (a monument of shame to the influence of Rome), and where in recent months the establishment of a dictatorship has made it much easier to control and suppress the efforts of those reaching out for liberty, it is nothing short of a miracle of Jehovah that, by His abounding grace, the witness given in favor of His name in Brazil during the fiscal year just ended has been identical with that given in the rest of the world, a “strange work’’ indeed, and a glorious one. In spite of the ever-heightening opposition and difficulty, the increase in the witness given is cause for rejoicing. The amount of literature placed was more than that of the two previous years combined, although there was no material increase in the number of publishers until the past five months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is exceedingly difficult for a people so long bullied by the Hierarchy crowd to take a bold, uncompromising stand against the enemy combination. However, the handful of faithful ones, some Brazilians, some from other lands, have redoubled their energies, increasing their hours in the service, and have gone forward in the face of all odds, trusting in Him who promised that &quot;they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s Provision</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is true now as never before that Jehovah has ‘prepared a table before us in the presence of our enemies’. In the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> and in the speeches made at the conventions of Sydney, Seattle, London, and New York, engraved on discs and published in the booklets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Warning, Face the Facts, Fascism or Freedom,</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace,</span><span class="font4"> the Lord has plainly disclosed to his people the enemy and the fact that we are in the presence of that enemy. At the hands of His faithful servants, this food has been served to us, not only in English, but most of it in Portuguese too, and this, in turn, has been passed on quickly to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For our strengthening and encouragement and as a means to enable us to invite those of good will to ‘partake of the water of life freely’ we were provided during the year with the Portuguese discs, ‘‘Jehovah” and ‘‘Riches”, ‘‘Enemies” and ‘‘Where Are the Dead?” and the ‘‘Uncovered” series. Then came the booklets translated into Portuguese, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts, Warning, Fascism or Freedom,</span><span class="font4"> and to our great joy during the convention at Memorial time the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies, </span><span class="font4">which has enjoyed the same phenomenal distribution here as elsewhere, in the first fire months nearly three times as many as of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font4"> in the same length of time. The disc ‘‘Enemies” has given strong support to the presentation of the book. It has on occasions met and overcome the objections of angry officials, and the universal testimony of the publishers who are placing the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> is: ‘‘It was the ‘Enemies’ disc that placed the book.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign was a joy from the beginning to the end. Its prolongation until the end of May enabled us to place our complete supply of Portuguese </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font4"> in the hands of the people. How beautiful is the English </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> now in its colored covers! The Portuguese </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Torre de Vigia </span><span class="font4">has followed the lead in that it, too, has discarded the color of mourning and appears each month with a bright colored cover. At the beginning of the campaign about 150 copies of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Torre de Vigia</span><span class="font4"> were going out each month; at its close, 550. The arrival of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> in Portuguese the first week in April completed our equipment for the campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The London convention and the New York address, ‘‘Fascism or Freedom,” were ‘‘relayed” to us later in the discs, the accounts in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> and in the booklets, all of which made us realize that we, so far away, were nevertheless a part of the one organization. The account of these was passed on in the Portuguese </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolacao</span><span class="font4"> and in the translation of the booklets into Portuguese. It is a wonderful provision of Jehovah that the booklets are now published immediately in all the languages, enabling those of good will to receive the message, &quot;every man in his own tongue,” almost as soon as the message is spoken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The time of the New York assembly was one of great joy; for as about twenty of Jehovah’s witnesses in Sao Paulo’s Kingdom hall waited eagerly, some understanding English, some not, suddenly we heard clearly the name that all understood, &quot;Jehovah,” and from then on to the end of the defi to the present - day Goliath, adding our ‘ ‘ Aye ’ ’ to the resolution. Thanking Jehovah that he had ministered directly to us needy ones through his servant that day, we went forth strengthened for the further conflict.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Field Witness</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The average number of publishers of the Kingdom message during the entire year was 114, an increase from 103 over the year before. However, the average number during the last five months has been 145, and a peak of 162 was reached in May. At the same time the hours in the field increased 46 percent, from 31,153 to 45,454, indicating that those who are serving the interests of the Kingdom are devoting more and more time to this blessed service, and their joy is increasing in proportion. A number of company publishers are reporting more than 60 hours per month in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pioneers increased m number from an average of 12 in 1938 to about 20 in 1939, and the year closes with 24 in the field. While seme of the increase is due to the arrival of European brethren to help with the witness work here, there are also some Brazilians whu have taken advantage of their opportunity to enter this service, devoting their all to the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The article on &quot;Children” appearing in the April 15 and May 1, 1938, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> was published in the Portuguese edition in November and December, and since that time a good number of youngsters have been attending the studies and have become active in the field service. It is not unusual to find a whole family, father, mother and children, in the field together on Sunday morning and then together at the meeting the same night. One little girl of 12 has been engaged in the pioneer service for some months, working diligently, and the Lord abundantly blesses her efforts to place the Kingdom message in the hands of the people. A brother who teaches a school of 30 or 40 pupils is, with the parents’ consent, teaching </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God</span><span class="font4"> to his pupils, and both they and their parents are giving evidence of being people of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The number of phonographs being used has climbed from 48 in 1938 to 77 in 1939. Back-calling with the phonograph is now an established feature of the work, and is fast becoming the principal work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The increase in output of literature was gratifying, being more than that of the two previous years combined, 186,973 booklets and 9,340 bound books. While a large part of the increase was due to the wide distribution of the booklets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom,</span><span class="font4"> the output of bound books increased 39 percent, from 6,714 in 1938 to 9,340 in 1939.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The amount of correspondence has increased as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Eeceived &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1938 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,965 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2,027</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1939 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2,869 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2,153</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sound-car has continued its weekly programs, bringing the gracious Kingdom message to the ears of many thousands of people. Throughout another year, still the object of bitter hatred and attempted efforts to silence it on the part of the Hierarchy’s agents, it has not once failed, with the Lord’s help, to give its scheduled programs. On “All Soul’s Day”, called in Brazil “The Day of the Dead”, the car, with about half a dozen publishers, visited the cemeteries, gave appropriate lectures, “Where Are the Dead?” “Purgatory,” “Resurrection,” “Jehovah,” and “Riches”, to more than 43,000 hearers, and the publishers placed considerable literature, among which were more than 200 booklets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Where Are the Dead?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sao Paulo had an information march at the close of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign, announcing the “Face the Facts” lecture to be given in English the following night in the American School house. Failing to get a permit from the police for a “parade”, the seventy publishers, wearing placards, formed in small groups bearing banners with the customary wording, “Face the Facts,” “Religion Is a Snare and a Racket,” and “Serve God and Christ the King”, passed through all the busy downtown section, entering the stores, and placed several thousand booklets in addition to 10,000 announcement folders. They repeated the distribution the following day at the streetcar and omnibus terminals. 250 window cards were placed in prominent store windows. Some proprietors found that the cards attracted so much attention to their windows that they did not want to take them out after the lecture was over. Only the Nazi Germans refused to place the cards in their windows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The little company of Kingdom publishers in the leper colony at Pirapitingui requested and received permission to visit another colony at Santo Angelo in the State of Sao Paulo, where they spent several days calling upon the patients with the message of deliverance and distributing literature concerning the Kingdom. It is an inspiration to others to note the zeal of such afflicted ones, working under the greatest of handicaps, yet using their best endeavors to glorify the King of kings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Interference</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The enemy has done some howling as evidence that the witness has hurt. The most serious interference was in Rio Grande do Sul, where the work was almost paralyzed for about four months. A Catholic priest complained to the authorities that the little band of less than a dozen humble Polish and German farmers who were calling on their neighbors with the gracious news of God’s kingdom of righteousness, which exposes the crookedness of the clergy, were “endangering the Brazilian government, circulating seditious literature’’. Their literature was seized and sent to Porto Alegre for investigation, and every time the publishers started out in the service, their literature fell into the hands of the police immediately. From Porto Alegre an intercepted registered letter of instruction to the brethren from the Sao Paulo office as to how to proceed was sent to Sao Paulo with orders to “investigate” the activities of the Society and make a report. The officer of the Bureau of Investigations into whose hands the order came was visited by two Catholic priests who offered to bribe him to make an adverse report and close the Society. Being an honorable man who knew of the work, having heard the sound-car programs, he came directly to the branch office himself rather than trust any subordinate who might yield to bribes. A report was made stating properly the nature of our work and the further report that we were being persecuted by the priests. A formal protest was made, and the literature was requested returned. After some months’ delay the literature was returned, the delegado who had interfered </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">was removed,</span><span class="font4"> and the brethren have been given a written statement that no officer within the jurisdiction of the present delegado shall in any wise interfere with the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. Since this time the work is going ahead in Rio Grande do Sul, the people of good will are showing themselves, and the publishers are manifesting greater zeal and activity than ever before. Three of them are entering the pioneer service, and others are preparing to enter soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On a Sunday in December, while the sound-car was giving a program in Itaquera, a town near Sao Paulo, and a group of the Sao Paulo publishers witnessing in the town, the soundcar was seized and sent to Sao Paulo under guard and about half a dozen of the publishers were arrested, held for several hours and then sent in to the city. When we reached the Bureau of Investigation we were immediately released, treated to afternoon coffee, and the officers were rebuked for wasting the city’s money for gasoline to transport innocent people to jail. A formal protest against the action of the mayor of Itaquera was entered with the proper authorities, a copy of this was published in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Con-sola-cao,</span><span class="font4"> together with a write-up of the arrests, and another “locust attack” was made upon the town, this time with the sound-car and phonographs using the ‘ ‘ Enemies ’ ’ record, which had arrived in the meantime. The mayor, though raging and threatening, was unable to do anything. The town was thoroughly covered by the sound-car and copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolacao,</span><span class="font4"> much literature was placed, and the next week </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">the mayor lost his job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On August 26, closing the year, the Sao Paulo publishers, wearing appropriate placards and displaying the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom,</span><span class="font4"> stationed themselves at the streetcar and omnibus terminals, placing the booklet with the people who were waiting in line. In some places the publishers finished their work and -went home without any interference, but in one praca where the Catholic church had just staged a show, the secret police began arresting the publishers and stirring up the people against them. Some were released, but 20 were held in jail, some for 22 hours. The 17 men were in one cell without bed or chair, and not until midnight were straw mattresses provided. As two American citizens were among those arrested, the American consul was called upon, but nothing was accomplished until the services of a private lawyer were secured, when a release of all was effected within three hours without any police charge being brought. 2,000 booklets were seized and held, and, as a sequel, on the Tuesday of the week following I was arrested at the Society’s office and taken down to the Department of Political and Social Order. At that very hour I had an appointment with our lawyer. He was notified and appeared at the police headquarters before I got there. I was again released without a police charge, but the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font4"> booklets were ordered seized. Hurrying home with me, our lawyer arrived just as the inspectors found the booklets, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">and not one of them was touched.</span><span class="font4"> We were told not to dispatch any of these 50 cartons until this “misunderstanding” can be adjusted. Some police departments show a friendly attitude to the Kingdom work, but in one or two departments the Catholic clergy have hounded them and brought pressure to bear to find some means to stop the work. They are trying hard to brand the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font4"> as “political propaganda”, but have not succeeded so far.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is the interesting situation as the year closes and a new year opens, a serious time certainly, as it is all over the world, but the best time of all to serve the Great Theocrat and proclaim his name. In the midst of this interruption </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font4"> was received, and, in spite of all, with the Lord’s help, the Portuguese translation of the booklet went forward four days after its arrival, by the first air express. GoHath is due for some more hollering when this booklet is turned loose world-wide!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Continually do I thank Jehovah for the privilege that has been mine as one of Jehovah’s witnesses to work in Brazil for these past few years, where, although the fight has been unceasing, Jehovah has been true to his promise, and, in spite of the fact that the enemy has fought hard and is now fighting still harder, not in one instance have ‘ they prevailed against us ’, and Jehovah's name is reaching the ears of the “other sheep”. How happy we shall be when, by the Lord’s grace, we shall be able to offer them the life-giving message in the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation </span><span class="font4">in Portuguese! Our Father will richly reward you for your tender loving care for the Kingdom interests and those who are serving the Kingdom here. The workers in the office send you their love with mine, assuring you that, united with you, we are devoting all our powers to the service of the Theocratic Government, joyfully looking forward to the time soon at hand when the righteous reign of the Great Theoerat and his King shall triumph for ever. Happy is our lot!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark78"></a>DEMERARA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">At Georgetown, Demerara, Jehovah has a few witnesses who have been putting forth their endeavor during the year to proclaim the name of the Almighty and his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. They have placed in the hands of the people a total of 13,162 books, small and large, have worked in the field 8,456 hours, have added 54 new subscriptions, and have used 23 phonographs, for which the sound attendance numbered 19,608. The Society^ local servant says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are pleased to report that there has been an all-round increase in the work in British Guiana during 1939. There are now four companies organized for service, and it is evident that all the brethren realize that the time is short, and that the King’s business requires haste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The servant of the Goed Fortuin company, West Bank Demerara, writes: “Our portion this year has been one of great joy and prosperity in doing with our might what our hands found to do in connection with Jehovah’s ‘strange work’. We have been continually strengthened by the rich spiritual food coming from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> giving us a keener appreciation of the Kingdom. We fully realize that religion is a snare and a racket, and will soon be destroyed by the Lord at Armageddon. We are therefore determined, by his grace, to put forth more effort than ever before to lift high the banner of Jehovah, and say to those who will hear, ‘Come and drink of the water of life freely.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two brethren from the Grove company, East Bank Demerara, who paid a special visit to the upper reaches of that river in July, expressed their appreciation of the privilege on their return. During their visit they manifested the zeal which is peculiar to the Lord’s people everywhere, working all day with hardly a thought of meals, in order that they might meet the people of good will at a time convenient to the latter. The response to the message was very encouraging.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>CANADA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">During the fiscal year ending there has been a great increase in the enthusiasm in Canada for the Theocratic Government of Jehovah by Christ Jesus. The supporters of the Theocracy are few, of course, but there has been an increased number and greater activity in advertising the Theocratic Government. The publishers in the field increased more than one thousand during the year, and the activity on their part has shown a decided result in favor of the Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The gulf between the “sheep” and the “goats” has widened and continues to grow wider as those who are devoted to Jehovah take their stand on the side of the great Theoerat and King and proclaim his Word; and the members of Satan’s organization grow in bitterness toward the Theocracy. Persecution of real Christians has increased throughout Canada, and particularly in the province of Quebec, where many have been arrested and charged with the crimes of blasphemy and sedition. It is noticeable that the crime with which these faithful witnesses of Jehovah are charged is exactly the nature of the crime charged against the Lord Jesus Christ when he was on the earth. This is further corroborative proof that all the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses emanates from the Devil, who is the one that is opposing the Theocracy, and he uses religion and religionists as his chief instruments to oppose the Theocratic Government now. This should be expected. It has not at all discouraged the witnesses for the Kingdom, but, on the contrary, has encouraged them. It is further corroborative proof that God’s kingdom has begun to function and within a short time will completely clear out all opposition and establish righteousness on the earth. The work of the representatives of the Theocracy is to publish the name of Jehovah and his kingdom. They are therefore publishers of the good news that the Theocratic Government has come. During the year these publishers placed in the hands of the people books and booklets to the number of 1,300,785, which is an increase over that of the previous year. In doing this work sound machines with electrical transcriptions of recorded speech have been used to the number of 3,250. With these sound machines oral proclamation of Jehovah’s name and of his King and kingdom has been made, and the total attendance at such proclamation was 1,000,587 persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The opposers to the Theocracy have stopped the use of the radio throughout the land of Canada, but they cannot stop the phonograph and electrical transcription machines, which reach the people and hold the interest better than the radio can hold it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s representative in Canada has well covered the matter in his report, and we can do no better than to insert the following from that report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is with much joy and gratitude to the great Theocrat, Jehovah, that report is made to you concerning the activities of his servants in Canada during the year 1939. We give thanks that the army of the King, Christ Jesus, operating in Canada has had some share in the fighting along the war front, and that during the engagements victories have resulted to our King, and a great number of prisoners have been released from Satan’s organization and are now the servants of the new King, Christ Jesus. The Devil’s strongholds have been attacked continuously with the equipment provided. The great exposure that ‘ ‘ religion is a snare and a racket” has done much to awaken the prisoners, and the truth has been held aloft like a burning torch, showing the way to those in darkness to escape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We also express our appreciation for the food supplied from the great Provider, Jehovah, by his Son, through his Theocratic Government. This has strengthened us for the warfare. The revelation through </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> of the “Drama of Vindication”, showing the movements today of Jehovah’s people in the light of prophecy, gave us a vision of the warfare and our entrance into the land such as never could have been visualized, and now the more recent articles showing the “Doom of Religion”, making manifest the judgments of our King!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The greatest of all truth has now come to us regarding the Theocrat and the Theocracy. This is being appreciated more with every issue of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> During the past year, in particular, it has been clearly seen that only Jehovah’s will, expressed, through his Theocratic Government, must be performed, and that such government acts in exact harmony with the law of Jehovah. Without question, this great revelation and the appointments made throughout the land by the Theocratic Government, have done much to quicken the minds and bodies of the true servants to greater service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now that Canada is at war, the great value of the Theocratic Government in operation is seen. The brethren are giving thanks to the Lord as they note the signs of the times, and the fact that Jehovah is maneuvering the forces to Armageddon, and that now is our grand opportunity to carry His message warning “Christendom” of her impending doom and to herald salvation to the great multitude. As we review the past twelve months, the outstanding features of the year are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The inauguration and operation of the Theocratic Government ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The use of the two lectures ‘ ‘ Face the Facts ’ ’ and ‘ ‘ Fascism or Freedom ’ ’, together with these lectures in booklet form;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign of four months;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The participation in the international convention at Madison Square Garden, New ’Vork;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The release of the recorded lectures ‘ ‘ Government and Peace ’ ’ and “Victory”, together with the lectures in printed form now to hand, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The new book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font4"> and the record “Snare and Racket”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Output of Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year, over two million pieces of literature were sent to the publishers, made up of over 177,000 bound books (more than 72,000 of these being the first consignment of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation')</span><span class="font4"> and 2,018,000 booklets, and, in addition, 23,538 records were sent out, and practically 600 phonographs. There is a splendid increase in every figure over last year’s output, and we are now expecting a further consignment of records, phonographs and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Summary report for all field service done shows an increase in every activity except bound books. This is marvelous to us, because there has been much opposition to the work, and in many parts of the land much poverty. We well know that the great Theoerat gave the increase, adding his blessing; therefore we recognize his goodness and loving-kindness to us in this land as we have heralded forth the glad tidings of the Kingdom, sounded the warning to “Christendom”, and taken comfort and peace to the great multitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There has been a continual effort put forward to aid those of good will and the inactive to participate, also encourage the irregular publishers to take a more definite and regular share in the work. The blessing of the Lord is now seen in the fact that the average publishers reporting monthly for this year is 4,269, whereas last year’s figure was 3,113, a monthly average increase of 1,156. It is of interest to report that during the last three months of the fiscal year the number reporting in Canada was just over 5,000, which means an increase over the corresponding three months of the year previous of, at least, 1,900 each month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The new publishers are serving with enthusiasm and are working as long, and in many cases longer hours than some who have been in the truth a number of years. The hours in the field have increased by 50 percent, due chiefly to the Theocratic Government in operation, and your letter dated January 1, 1939, suggesting that all company publishers might devote 60 hours a month in field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The total placement of literature is higher than last year. This is chiefly on account of the high distribution of booklets. It is very evident that the people are taking their stand. While there are found those of good will who gladly invite us to call back, yet the majority are caught in the snare of religion and are set in their opposition to the Kingdom message. It is marvelous to behold the 'heap of stones’ in the middle of Jordan’s river and to know that they remain to this day; also that it is being added to daily. Now that the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> book is in our hands there will be a greater increase in bound books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> has kept this very important feature of our field service before the minds of all, and a great work has been accomplished amongst the interested people. Our back-calls have more than doubled, and a great number of model studies have been started as a result. This has been the best way to assist the newly interested to take their stand on Jehovah’s side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Attendance</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The sound attendance is higher. This is very good in view of the fact that during the year several cities and towns saw fit to refuse permission for Jehovah’s witnesses to operate their machines within their limits, hence curtailing much of the sound activity with the large P.T.M. The numerous phonographs, with the records, have done much to help build up this figure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">International Convention at New York</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When it was learned that other points in the United States were to be connected to New York, several companies in Canada made request that they might be linked in with this great convention, and your permission was received to hook in Toronto, Ontario; Montreal, Quebec; Winnipeg, Manitoba; Saskatoon, Saskatchewan; and Lethbridge, Alberta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bell Telephone Company owns the lines in Ontario and Quebec, and therefore arrangements for their services were made in precisely the same way as on three previous occasions. Until June 14 there was not the slightest suggestion that facilities would not be available, and hence halls were engaged in Toronto and Montreal. On June 14 we were suddenly and summarily advised over the telephone by one of the representatives of the Bell Telephone Company that their facilities were not available. No better explanation could be given. In view of the service supplied by this company on three previous occasions, the explanation given was obviously absurd. Every effort was made to cause the Bell Telephone Company to grant the use of their facilities, but all to no avail. The head office of the Bell Telephone Company is at Montreal, and their vice-president was interviewed there. He intimated that the refusal to provide service was the result of a revision of policy made some time ago, and it appeared clear from the discussion that pressure from the Roman Catholic Hierarchy had been brought to bear on the company, causing them to oppose the Theocracy and its operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Owing to this action by the Bell Telephone Company, it was impossible to have the lectures brought from the United States to the two provinces Ontario and Quebec, and hence the people of good will were deprived of the opportunity of hearing this vital message. Since the convention, steps have been taken to force the matter into the open, but so far we have not succeeded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the province of Alberta, refusal was made to carrying the lecture, and it was questionable whether it could be taken into Saskatchewan, but at the last minute the agreement was made to have the lecture taken from Winnipeg to Saskatoon, and from Saskatoon to the province of Alberta, in spite of the opposition raised by the government officials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hence, it is very clearly seen that the Bell Telephone Company has bowed the knee to the Hierarchy and must be numbered amongst the enemies to the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thousands of Canadian brethren attended the convention at New York, and there received abundant blessings from Jehovah, and were renewed in strength and granted a clear vision. They are determined at all costs to press forward in the fight against the enemies of the Lord, and engage the enemy on all fronts, that we might have some further part in the “strange work” which will lead to the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Because we were denied the privilege of broadcasting these lectures to the public in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, the brethren are the more determined to use the lectures, now that they are in record form, on every possible occasion. The effect of the opposition has been to cause the faithful to redouble their energies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">British Columbia Boat</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society operates a boat along the British Columbia coast line, and a tremendous amount of good is done by this means of witnessing. During the year 2,098 hours were devoted to the service, 532 hours spent in traveling, and 598 books, 1,553 booklets, and 38 subscriptions placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The number of pioneers enrolled a year ago was 247 and to date there are 395. During the month of July we reached our peak, and there were 408 enrolled. Over the twelve months the average number of pioneers reporting monthly has been 294, as against 210 the year previous. It is also a pleasure to report that very few of the pioneers are leaving the service for the winter season. Many who heretofore have stopped for the winter are attempting to carry on right through the wintertime. It is appreciated that the time is short and our work must be done speedily. The pioneers’ hours are much higher than any year previous, and compared with last year there has been an increase of 122,325 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Pioneer Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thirty brethren engaged in the special pioneer service and accomplished the work set out for them to do. Now, with the further organization, of pioneers being used in special work assisting in the zones, we know this will be a great help to many of the newly interested and also the larger companies. There has been a need for this kind of service, and we do thank the Lord that the provision has been made through his government for this service. Twenty-four brothers have so far been appointed to this special service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Testimony Periods</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Each Testimony period has been engaged in to the full by the brethren, and it is very evident that the arrangement made to set aside a month for a witness period is far better than the previous arrangement of one week. We look forward to great activity during the coming year if such Testimony periods are arranged by the Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Watchtower” Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the greatest joys that we experienced during the year was the four months’ </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign. The great honor and privilege granted to us of carrying </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> to the homes of the people was like unto carrying the food from the Greater-than-Joseph to those who were starving because of the famine in the land, and now, as then, we do indeed thank the great Provider for opening the way for this most precious magazine to be received in the homes of those who were not associated with Jehovah’s organization. The realization that over 100,000 more persons were going to receive food regularly</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">from Jehovah’s table inspired us here to move on in this greatest of campaigns as never before. We pray Jehovah that the time may come again when, in his graciousness and loving-kindness, a similar opportunity will be given to many more starving persons. We all know well that it would be impossible to prosecute the work of the Lord, and fight in this battle, were it not for the strength he supplies through the food granted, the vision concerning his organization and its activities, and hence we know that the only way others can join in the service and wave palm branches of victory is by receiving food from the hand of the great Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Western Provinces</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although great difficulty has been experienced in these provinces in carrying forward the work, on account of poverty due to drought, lack of transportation, and the very cold weather during the long winter season, yet the work has gone forward splendidly. Probably there is more interest shown here than in the other provinces throughout the Dominion. It is an inspiration to see the zeal of the publishers in carrying out their service. Long journeys have to be taken, many times by horse and buggy or sleigh, but they do it, and Jehovah’s blessing is certainly seen upon their service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Zone Servants</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year, seventeen zone servants have been doing splendid work in the zones. AU the zone servants have a clear vision of Jehovah’s Theocratic organization and are laboring well amongst their brethren to assist all to conform to Jehovah’s requirements, and are leading in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Salvation” and New Lectures</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For this further book we thank Jehovah. To date we have been able to use all the supplies the Brooklyn office could send. The output of this book will surpass aU others. In practically every company </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> studies are now in operation, and, in addition to the brethren attending, invitations are continuaUy being sent to the interested to attend, and every encouragement is given them to be present. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> is being brought to the attention of the people in all places. The book is surely helping the river flowing from the Temple to widen and get deeper. We say, ‘<sup>1</sup> There is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God”; and aU who study the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> join in the song of praise to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The new lectures, “Government and Peace” and “Victory”, were received and shipped immediately. The output from the Canadian office exceeded any other lectures we have yet had. Further supplies are now expected. Reports from the companies who have been putting on these lectures thus far indicate that more strangers are attending than any previous lectures given. Without doubt it is the time for this message to be heard. The faithful see the importance of getting these lectures heard immediately, knowing that the message is vital and the time is short; hence special effort is being made to reproduce them in halls and homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Information Marches</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These were held extensively throughout the country, and great was the joy and enthusiasm of those who participated. The marches did much to stir up the inactive and irregular publishers to see their privilege of participating in the Lord’s work. Much opposition from the religionists and police was received to the marches, but the work went on. Owing to the war conditions, advantage was being taken of existing by-laws and new war measures, and, owing to the jittery condition of the country, the marches have been dispensed with for the present. We look forward to the near future when there will be a reorganizing of the information marches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Opposition</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Greater opposition to the Kingdom work has been experienced during the past year than in any year previous. The enemy has made a desperate attempt to break up the work in certain parts of the land, particularly in the province of Quebec. It would appear that, were he able to break into and stop the work in that province, he would quickly attempt to make inroads in the ranks of the army in other parts of the Dominion, but the fact that the attack here has been met and our ground held has kept the enemy at bay. The enemy has tried in almost every way to stop the work through the “strong-arm squad’’ and the courts. The brethren have been charged with “disturbing the peace’’, “unlawful assembly,’’ “peddling without a license,’’ “distributing circulars without a permit,’’ ‘ ‘ defamatory libel, ’ ’ “ blasphemous libel, ” “ uttering seditious libel,’’ “seditious conspiracy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year, on the charge of “sedition” the courts were able to make only one conviction, and this was against two French brothers, tried before a French Catholic jury, a Catholic judge, and a Catholic crown prosecutor. It will be appreciated that the brethren did not stand a chance at all, even though they had the best counsel in the province of Quebec fighting on their behalf. These two brothers were sentenced to six months’ imprisonment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the time these two brothers were serving their sentence opportunity was taken to advertise the fact throughout the land. A letter was sent to all members of the Quebec Legislature, setting out the facts of the case, which, briefly, were: Two Christian men had been distributing a tract entitled ‘ ‘ The People’s Greatest Need”, printed in French in 1934, and they were ‘ ‘ found guilty ” of “ sedition ’ ’. It was obvious that there Was nothing seditious in the tract; it did call attention to the erroneous teachings of the Catholic church. We called upon the members to raise this case of injustice in the House. Nothing was done. Then we forwarded a copy of this letter, with a covering letter, to 14,000 businessmen, made up of industrialists, lawyers, doctors, etc., throughout Quebec province, acquainting them with this gross injustice. Next, we sent the information to all companies, inviting them to take the same to editors of newspapers and request publication. It was gratifying to note that a number of editors of papers did publish the letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Two other brothers were charged with &quot;defamatory libel”, later changed to &quot;blasphemy”. These were tried before Judge ■White, of Sherbrooke, Quebec. In addressing the jury Judge White said, &quot;These people believe these statements to be true; they have faith in these teachings, hence they have a right to promulgate them, and even if it does hurt some of us, that does not constitute blasphemy.” The jury brought in a verdict of &quot;Not guilty”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year, 41 cases have come before the courts in Canada, involving 115 brethren; and out of these, 50 brethren still await trial. Twenty-six of the brethren were charged with &quot;sedition” and three with &quot;blasphemous libel”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In addition to these charges, the Hierarchy’s agents have raided the homes of the brethren in Montreal, seized much literature and many phonographs, records, and even private papers. This is carried out under the infamous Padlock Law, which, so far, is operating only in the province of Quebec. Protests are made, and objections raised, but there is no redress. The Hierarchy runs the province, and they are in authority. Of late, the publishers have been stopped on the streets by the police and their phonographs and records taken away from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In spite of this opposition, the work in the province of Quebec makes increase. More publishers are taking part in the service, the majority of these coming from the Catholic church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For three months a sound-boat operated along the Quebec river, equipped with a powerful sound machine. The three brothers operating the boat were to work the villages and camps along the river with the literature, but there was hostility at every point. Word was passed from town to village along the whole river front. At Quebec city, where they landed to move some records and phonographs, the police seized everything that had been placed on the dock. At other places they were stoned, the ropes were cut, and at another place shots were fired at the boat from the shore. Although the witnessing by the brothers on the shore was practically nil, yet the newspapers advertised the work of the boat and the opposition it was getting. Hence, again, the Devil and his agents overreached themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethel Family</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Unity and peace prevail. Every member of the family is zealously and diligently performing the work assigned to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Great has been our joy throughout the past year in engaging in the work in the office and home. Much more work has been accomplished without a regular increase in the staff. Because the work has been exceptionally heavy at times it has been necessary to work inside during the evenings and many weekends instead of participating in the field service; but in spite of this, all have put forth a real effort to have a large share in the field service. Most of the brothers in the family hold some office in the field organization as it pertains to work outside the office. We are all grateful to the Lord and to you for the many provisions made for us in this home to aid us to accomplish the work set out for us to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now we look forward to another year of joyful service under the direction of the Theocratic Government. Thick darkness covers the earth. Distress and perplexity have increased in this country. The religionists are now rallying quickly to the standard raised by the Government, and hence they more openly identify themselves against the Theocracy. We well know that opposition must increase until all nations have shown themselves as against the Theocracy, and then Jehovah will fight. With full trust and confidence in Jehovah we will go forward, raising high the banner he has placed in our hands, and shout aloud, &quot;Victory, for our King, Christ Jesus, and salvation to the obedient 1 ’’ We are not afraid of the enemy, because Jehovah is with us, and &quot;they shall not prevail against [us]”. Hence, with calmness and with peace we go forward in the fight.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark81"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark82"></a>CENTRAL EUROPE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The publishers for the Theocracy will have in mind that for several years past the Lord’s work done by the Society in Central Europe has been operated and directed from the Central European office situated in Berne, Switzerland.

<p><span class="font5">Austria and Danzig)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hungary</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The enemy has rapidly closed in on the Lord’s people during the year. The witness work, as far as being openly and actively done, has been destroyed by the gangster Hitler and his cohorts, directed by the great adversary Satan, in Czechoslovakia, Germany, Poland, Luxemburg, Austria and Danzig. Still there has been some individual work done by faithful servants of Jehovah in these lands. The Society’s property has been seized in the countries of Austria, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, and many of the servants of the Lord have been driven out of the land. It is quite evident that the witness work is near an end in continental Europe, and this is further proof that Armageddon is near at hand. The brethren carrying on the witness work within the territory embraced in the Central European offices have been laboring under great difficulties. The Lord has sustained them, and their zeal and devotion to the Theocratic Government have been maintained, and they continue to rejoice in doing -with their might whatsoever their hands find to do. The Lord’s servant, the Society’s representative of the Central European office, makes report, and from his report the following is set forth:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Viewing the cavalcade of astounding events in Europe—the Devil’s chief workshop—during the past year, in which the monster-totalitarian states Italy, Germany and Russia have devoured and practically destroyed five European nations (Spain, Austria, Albania, Czechoslovakia and Poland), it gives me pleasure to review for the thirteenth time the onward march of the Lord’s kingdom despite the shaking-up of the Devil’s world. It is God’s time of shaking all things that can be shaken, in order that his kingdom, the Theocracy which can never be destroyed, may remain as the only hope of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While the French guns arg pounding away upon the “Siegfried line” not far from here and the neutral countries have mobilized their armies, including peaceful Switzerland, the Lord’s people in Europe are not disturbed, but rest joyfully in faith, knowing that the Lord of hosts is now maneuvering the armies to “the valley of Jehoshaphat”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The latest news-bulletins indicate that the suggestion of the Representative, John J. Alexander, a Protestant, made in Washington, to appoint the pope of Rome as the arbiter of peace and savior out of all religious and political troubles, may soon be realized. Anyway, the Italian government, as mediator between Germany and the Western Powers, is now offering a Roman peace, with the blessing of the Vatican.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, the Lord had shown his people as far back as 1935 that Fascism, Nazism and Communism belong together and would unite, as they have now, to apparently oppose the democracies, but in reality Jehovah’s kingdom or Theocracy; as set forth in the booklets, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government, Armageddon,</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Warning, </span><span class="font4">the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies,</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> 1935.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Never before have the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> explanations of the nearness of the doom of religion at the beginning of Armageddon been so real and so true as now, when the red army of Bolshevism is entering the gates of Europe and now standing at the very spot where a world revolution was held back at the end of the World War in 1919.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Again the unclean war-spirit is rampant in this part of the earth and the demons seize control. Satan, knowing that his time is short, moves his forces in rapid preparation for the final showdown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The reports from each battle-front are given separately by the respective Branch servants under the supervision of the Central European office at Berne, Switzerland, but the severeness of the battle and the cruelty of Catholic Action is shown in the following incomplete general statistics for Central Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Report of Legal Matters</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The enemy continued in his attempt to discourage Jehovah’s witnesses in their activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Legal matters have been compiled, as far as reports were received. No such report is on hand for Germany, Hungary, and Rumania. The severe persecution in those countries is therefore not expressed in the following figures, and reports from other countries are incomplete. The summary is as follows:</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark83"><span class="font4">Known cases of murder</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark84"><span class="font4">Known cases of ill-treatment</span></a></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark31"><span class="font4">Condemnations</span></a></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark92"><span class="font4">Interdictions</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark93"><span class="font4">Rectifications by the press</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font4">With all their subtle schemes and cunning wickedness the Hierarchy has not crushed the witness work in Europe. A few religionists and traitors have left our ranks, but Jonadabs have more than filled their places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the expense of the Society, a number of pioneer refugee brethren, who escaped the enemy’s hands, were sent to overseas countries and were thus able to continue in active service, as follows:</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark94"><span class="font4">To Australia &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 To the Dutch East Indies</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark95"><span class="font4">To China (Shanghai) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 To Brazil</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark96"><span class="font4">To Uruguay &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 To England</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are still 20 German pioneers in Switzerland, sojourning on the Society’s farms, and even a greater number in Holland and other European countries, who are very much restricted in their movements and must leave these countries as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With Brother Rutherford’s aid and the help of local brethren, a very suitable property with four houses, lumber, garden and good land for producing food, was bought in December, 1938. Both farms have prospered and are considered model farms by friendly communities. The mayor of the town where the larger farm is located even spoke and wrote words of kindness, inviting our brethren to find peace and rest in his community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this and in many other ways we have seen clearly the Lord’s hand over his little ones who trust in him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Despite war conditions and certain food restrictions, we are thankful in realizing that our Bethel family, which, including the refugee brethren on our farms, comprises 90 persons, has been taken care of by the Lord, both in regard to spiritual and in regard to material food, the latter being supplied by our farms.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Berne Bethel Family</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As you, Brother Rutherford, receive regularly my monthly reports, and since I had the special joy of reporting fully to you in person on the occasion of the grand convention at New York, I can merely repeat my expressions of deep gratitude for my much-enjoyed privileges of service in the King’s army; I also appreciate greatly having you as my friend in these days of real battle. Moreover, I enjoy working together with my true comrades, the members of the Berne Bethel family, who today by unanimous vote passed the following resolution suggested by Brother Zuercher:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“We, the entire Bethel family in Berne, with deep joy desire to express how grateful we are to have received an understanding of Jehovah’s Theocratic Government, and how happy we are for the privilege of giving here in this outpost of God’s visible organization on earth our sacrifice of praise in righteousness to the Lord. We all feel the need of confessing how much we love Brother Rutherford, inasmuch as we observe how faithfully he serves the Lord and how the Lord is blessing him with rich spiritual gifts, whereby we also are enabled to do our share in the work which the Lord has now commanded His anointed and the Jonadab brethren to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It is also a joy and a privilege for us to work together with Brother Harbeck, with whom we all see eye to eye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It is true that the enemy has tried to disturb the peace and the harmony by spreading slanders here and elsewhere against Brother Harbeck and other brethren who faithfully serve the Lord. However, the Lord said: ‘Touch not mine anointpd ’; and so the Lord has watched over us, that we are today </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font4"> family, more united than ever, faithfully performing our duties towards the Lord, the Society and the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Furthermore, we desire to express our appreciation for the opportunity of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study in the Bethel home, which is attended diligently and with joy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The following is the annual service report of the Berne Bethel family:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Publishers, 69; hours, 9,055; books, 2,157; booklets, 30,185; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> copies, 5,719; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> copies, 1,615; subscriptions, 165; Bibles, 27; phonographs, 40; setups, 3,880; listeners, 10,702; back-calls, 2,088.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While it is to be expected that the enemy may cause even greater difficulties and that the witness work in Europe may be accomplished before long, I wish to assure you that the Lord’s people, the remnant and the Jonadabs in Central Europe, will not relent in the battle, but will fight on until Hitler, the Hierarchy, and all of the Devil’s crowd have perished for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society’s interests were taken care of in Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland before the Hitler crowd marched in, and further precautionary measures are being taken in other countries where further difficulties are expected. Several of our faithful brethren in Germany and Austria were put to death by the enemy last month, and the scripture quoted on a post card received from Austria with the report of such faithfulness, I desire to use m closing this report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘ ‘ Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since the countries named hereinafter come under tlic direct supervision of the Central European office, we set out each country at this point separately:</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark97"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark98"></a>BELGIUM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In the land of Belgium the witness work has progressed during the year. There have been 134 company publishers in the field, together with 27 pioneers; sound equipment used, including phonographs and transcription machines, 51. The. attendance at these meetings for the reproduction of the recorded message has been 18,254. There has been a total number of back-calls of 2,406. The distribution of books and booklets totaled 222,217.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the report of the local servant of the Society the following is extracted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord has again abundantly blessed His work in Belgium. The difficulties with certain brethren which we reported last year have been entirely settled, so it is with great joy that we thank Jehovah for having fulfilled in this country also the words of the prophet Isaiah, namely: “I will appoint the oversight of thee to prosperity, and the setting of thy tasks to righteousness. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is chiefly in those companies which at first did not understand that Jehovah’s organization is a Theocracy that the greatest zeal in proclaiming the message is now manifested and which show the greatest increase in the number of publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the other hand, we see the enemy changing his tactics; he fears the unity which now exists among God’s people, and manifests an ever-increasing opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are glad to report that by the end of the fiscal year we had 31 pioneers. An interesting fact is that it is chiefly Belgian brethren who have recently left their companies to join the pioneer ranks. The number of companies is now 31, 3 of which are just now being organized. Of these companies 11 are French, 7 Dutch, 4 German, 7 Polish, and 2 Slovenian. Remarkable progress has been made by the Flemish (Dutchspeaking) companies. It seems that it won’t be long until the Flemish companies will be as numerous as the French-speaking companies in Belgium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There was a steady increase in the number of company publishers, from about 100 in the beginning of the year to 187 in the month of August, 1939, which is the peak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A numbei of isolated brethren have been visited by the zone servants and invited to attend the regional meetings. The result is that some of them now engage in the service work, which they had not done formerly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> dealing with the service campaign, “New Heavens,” had foreseen, the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font4"> went like wildfire and caused the Hierarchy to become very angry. During the month of May, with the help of the Lord, we distributed 26,609 booklets. We are convinced that the Hierarchy has had something to do with the events which have transpired since the 1st of September, and has been preparing this blow for some time.-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Fascism is making rapid progress in Belgium, especially since we have an entirely Catholic and Liberal Government. In the course of the year we organized five regional meetings, each of which was attended by more than 200 brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions generally appreciate their privilege and duty. Thus we have some companies where all who attend the meetings are publishers. 214 friends were present at the Memorial, 82 of whom partook of the emblems. During the last month of the fiscal year, i.e., August, we had 218 publishers. This shows that all who attended the Memorial are publishers of the Kingdom, and that each one appreciates his duty towards the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The press has often attacked our publications, in order to turn the people awaj from the message of the Kingdom, and they, being very Catholic, are easily influenced by our adversaries, and the more since they know absolutely nothing about the Holy Scriptures. We have, however, noticed with joy, seeing the increase of publishers and newly interested ones during the last few months, that the fodder provided by the Hierarchy'is not able to hold these, and that the “ locusts ’ ’ are devastating their pastures. When a publisher meets with difficulty in some place, which has happened quite frequently, we send a whole company of publishers to cover it completely with literature and back copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font4"> Thus we came down upon these places like swarms of locusts, which naturally provoked the Hierarchy to great anger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Twice we were in court, accused of selling without a license. However, the judge recognizing that our work was neither out of harmony with the Constitution, nor with the peddling laws, we were acquitted Each month some publishers were charged with selling without a license, and with ringing doorbells, but all these eases have been decided in our favor. The police office of our community is very often informed of these cases, so we gave a copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font4"> to the chief police commissioner, which he has read. We promised him the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crusade Against Christianity,</span><span class="font4"> and when we brought it to him his subordinate commissioner and other people were in the office. We were able to relate a few facts about present conditions. This was a few days ago. The commissioner then said among other things: “If all stood for your principles, war would be impossible.” Then turning to the others present, he said: ‘ ‘ Mr. M. of the Watchtower Society tells the pure truth, and these people know what is happening in the world. ’ ’ As he had read in the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">liiches</span><span class="font4"> that the war had been shortened in 1918, I remarked that the same symptoms could be perceived again. A revolution in Russia and Germany had brought that war to an end, and these tilings might happen again. He then said to me: “Don’t lose your time in calling for this book, for I shall be glad to return it to you myself.” This shows that many in influential positions see the truth, but do not manifest this openly, fearing for their positions in the world. We are certain, however, that the day will come when they will boldly take their stand on the side of Jehovah, his </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">g and his </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the other hand, we have had much difficulty recently in connection with out foreign brethren. One of them was taken back to Germany without our knowledge. We went to the police, where we were shown a voluminous file concerning our activity and were told that we were slanderers of religion and enemies of the State. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God,</span><span class="font4"> pages 253 and 254, was used as an argument against us. The Hierarchy misrepresents us and tries to make the authorities believe that we are enemies of the State. It denounces us as conscientious objectors, trying thus to hide the true reason for its anger. The voluminous file above mentioned, compiled against our Society, is to be submitted to the Government and shows that what is happening everywhere in the world, and especially in Europe, is the result of the Hierarchy’s work with the governments that do its bidding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Following the special powers given to the Army, some brethren have been ordered to stop their work, upon the pretext that our publications are seditious, etc. Near Ghent a priest struck a sister so violently that she fell to the ground. In another place a German brother was nearly strangled. All this upon the instigation of the Hierarchy. An ignorant mob had demanded the death of our Lord Jesus Christ, and again presentday events easily incite ignorant people against our foreign brethren. Recently it has frequently happened that while a village was being worked with the new booklets the “crows” were running through the place warning the people that Fascist propagandists were going from house to house. They should have told them who were the real Fascists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If Jehovah’s witnesses were pursuing selfish aims, they would not have the courage to carry on their work; but they do Jehovah’s “strange work”, which shall be followed by a tribulation such as the world has never known and which will lead up to Jehovah’s “strange act”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The butcher friend who took such a large number of the publications last year has continued in his work throughout this year and has distributed about 30 books and 300 booklets each month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Phonograph : The work with the phonograph has greatly increased in Belgium; each company has now one or more phonographs. As soon as we can get more Hollandish records, the phonograph work will increase. We have also had the pleasure of giving some lectures over the radio. However, the clergy brought pressure to bear upon the station manager, and the lectures were discontinued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The number of subscriptions for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> has considerably increased, especially the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">subscriptions, due to the special efforts made during the first months of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A new law calling for censorship of all publications imported into Belgium which may be injurious to the State and the Army, has just been promulgated. Seeing all these things, the members of the Brussels company have passed a resolution in which they express their determination to continue faithfully in proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom, come what may. A copy of this resolution has been handed to the zone servants with instructions to communicate it to the other companies.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark99"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark100"></a>BULGARIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">That small benighted land has a few publishers for the Theocratic Government, and they must work under a great handicap. The laws are so strenuous against activity without a legal organization that the work has been much retarded by reason thereof. Just recently the Society has been registered under the legal provisions of the country, and the few publishers are now pushing forward their work. The publishers are poor, have little support, and find it hard to get along, but are doing the best they can. Only three full-time pioneers are at work, and these came there from Germany, and now they are about to be excluded; and doubtless before this is published they will be excluded from the country. Repeatedly they have been arrested and ill-treated. Those who are natives of Bulgaria, because of their activities in behalf of the Theocratic Government, are denounced as Communists, and they too are in great difficulties, and are often arrested and imprisoned. In view of all this, they have done what they could during the year. The distribution for Bulgaria during the year has been, to wit, 10,175 books and booklets. They put in two thousand hours. They have been unable to use phonographs.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark101"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark102"></a>CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">After Hitlerism began to dominate Germany and the Society’s property there was seized by the gangster and thousands of books were destroyed under his order, an office was opened in Czechoslovakia, which is across the Elbe fiver from the German border. For a time the work progressed well. During the past year, however, the Nazis’ invading the country has destroyed the opportunity of organized witness work. In that part of the country where the Germans predominated much work had been done previously; but when the Nazis came in it was impossible to carry on further in an organized manner. Many of the brethren were beaten and thrown into prison. Some were sent over into Germany and put in concentration camps, among them old men, who are still in the concentration camps in Germany. The houses of Jehovah’s witnesses were searched in that country. The fearless were thankful for the opportunity to give the witness, and continue to do so. A lawyer’s secretary accosted German officers in the Gestapo (secret police) and inquired why there is so much persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses. In each instance the answer from such officers was this: “Jehovah’s witnesses are honest, upright men, but because the activity has been forbidden, the officials must act accordingly.” Thus it is seen that the gangster Hitler rides roughshod over everybody that worships God and does not worship him and his cohorts. In the face of this opposition the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Warning</span><span class="font5"> was distributed. Especially that part concerning the monstrosity was greatly enjoyed by those of good will. In March, 1939, Carpathian Russia was occupied by the Hungarians, resulting in 25 Hungarian and 12 Russian and Ukrainian companies’ being separated from the Prague office. At the time of the mobilization many of Jehovah’s witnesses w<sup>r</sup>ere drafted for military service. Their attitude against war afforded the opportunity for a splendid witness to the Kingdom. These men testified to the Theocratic Government before many officers, and the officers frequently replied that they appreciated their uncompromising attitude. In Carpathian Russia four of Jehovah’s witnesses refused to bear arms. The army prosecutor asked for the death sentence to be imposed. These faithful brethren defended themselves and gave a good witness, saying they were ready to bear the consequences, even the sentence of death, but the court would be fully responsible if they were shot. The judge pronounced no decision, the proceedings were stopped, and the brethren were released and were shortly thereafter discharged from military service. This shows that to refuse to fear men but to fear God and trust in him is the only course for anyone who is a Christian to take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All assemblies have been forbidden since September, 1938. For that reason Jehovah’s witnesses meet in small groups for studies and service meetings. They have distributed the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font5"> to the number of 50,000 copies in the Czech language and 5,000 in the Slovak. Subscriptions for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtoiver </span><span class="font5">increased more than 500 in a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The report from that country contains the following, which we here insert:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We had to expect that the Nazis would exercise more pressure upon Czechoslovakia and would therefore act more rigorously against the publishers. Soon after the Czechs had elected a president who was devoted to the Roman Hierarchy, the treason of Slovakia by Tiso and of Carpathian Russia by Volosin followed. Thereupon the whole of Czechoslovakia was occupied by the Nazis. When these marched into Prague on March 15, we received order from the Society to dismount all the printing machines and to ship them out of the country, also to take care of other necessary matters. We started this work at once, and in a fortnight the machines were on their way. We had received permission from the Czech authorities to export the machines without being compelled to go through the clearing law procedure. On March 30 the Gestapo appeared for the first time in the Prague office of the Society and a small quantity of German literature and German Bibles were confiscated. One brother who had been imprisoned for a year in Germany, for publishing the truth, was arrested. The Gestapo tried to arrest some other brethren of German nationality, but, by the grace of Jehovah, it was possible for them to flee, after they had finished their work for the office. The brethren of Czech nationality have not been molested, and it was said this was left for Czech officials. The Gestapo came six times to the office of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Czechs bear the yoke of the Nazis with bad grace, and their desire for deliverance is great. After the occupation of Bohemia and Moravia the brethren there resumed the work from house to house. The Nazis try to make certain parts of the country absolutely German, and there the publishers must work with more care; but in the sections populated by Czechspeaking people only the work is less hindered, because the Czech Fascist-party is not very strong. The Czech officials, who are not so thoroughly under the influence of the Nazis or the Roman Hierarchy, have no objection to the proclamation of Jehovah’s name and his kingdom. The brethren are hopeful, and still receive </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> in Czech, the “meat in due season” which gives them courage for the service of Jehovah. In Bohemia and Moravia other brethren were imprisoned by the Gestapo. Some have been released, but others are still held. Under these difficult conditions the “strange work” of Jehovah, however, still goes on in this country. In Slovakia the brethren encounter greater difficulty. Under instruction from the Roman Hierarchy, Tiso betrayed Slovakia to Germany and the “Hlinka-Garde” began its activity, this being the instrument of the Devil to hinder the work of the publishers, to beat and imprison them. Many homes of brethren were searched and literature confiscated. One brother there visits the companies and gives his reports. It is not possible for him to have personal contact with the brethren in Bohemia and Moravia, because the Nazis have isolated these sections. They also control the mail, so that the reports from the brethren cannot be written without restriction as formerly. Evidently the Gestapo has searched for more evidence to justify another attack upon God’s people, but Jehovah will shield the faithful ones as he has promised, so that they may maintain their integrity under these difficult conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is not possible to compare this year’s activities with those of the preceding year, because about 75 percent of the brethren are in provinces that now belong to Germany or Hungary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the fiscal year, 328 publishers distributed in 19,199 hours 4,947 books, 52,659 booklets, 8,935 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> copies, and 800 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> copies; and 17 pioneers, in 7,881 hours, 3,171 books, 20,981 booklets, 2,808 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> copies and 100 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> copies. Total, 27,080 hours, 8,118 books, 73,640 booklets, 12,643 copies of periodicals; or 94,631 pieces of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Phonograph Activity : 52 phonographs were in action. Compared with the preceding year, this is an increase. We had 6,207 sound-meetings and 20,704 listeners. The publishers have appreciated very much this new means given us by Jehovah to proclaim the message. One brother reports that he visited a “Labor Camp” with the phonograph, where he found many listeners willing to take literature to learn of the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Back-Calls: A total of 585 back-calls is reported by the publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Due to continuous activity of the Gestapo and the Hlinka-Garde many reports have not arrived or have been lost during recent months. It is certain that more literature was distributed and more phonograph lectures held, also more back-calls made than the report above shows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was possible for us to print literature for the brethren in Rumania and Poland. Some of these publications we sent by mail, but the larger part in another way, to avoid the censorship. Czechoslovakia’s bordering on these countries enabled us to thus be a help to these brethren, but now it is difficult to get anything into these countries.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark103"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark104"></a>DANZIG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The people of Danzig have been put in great fear and trepidation during the year by reason of the threatening attitude of the Nazis. Recently the Nazis have taken over that little country. It has been difficult to carry on any work at all there because of this opposition, but, in the face of all this, books and booklets have been placed in the hands of the people to the number of 1,894. There have been only 51 publishers in the field, only two phonographs in use, and almost all of the -work has been required to be done quietly. No information has been received from Danzig during the month of July or August or since. About twenty of Jehovah’s witnesses are confined in prisons and not permitted to partake of the Memorial. The stress upon the Lord’s people in that country has been severe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The report from the Central European office contains the following concerning Danzig:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The work in Danzig had been carried on in connection with the Society’s office in Poland. For the time being, there is complete devastation in these parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, the friends are strong in the Lord, even those who know the truth but a short time, as is to be seen from the letter of one of the Jonadabs in Danzig, in which, amongst other things, he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“You will understand that the few of us who have been left are depressed by these events. But we all know that we have pledged ourselves to obey Jehovah and must be ready for any sacrifice in behalf of the vindication of God’s holy name. Such determination is joyously expressed everywhere when friends meet one another.’’</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark105"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark106"></a>FRANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In France the Hierarchy has always been a great handicap to the honest people. From time to time they have been rebuffed, but, like their subtle father, they eome back in another way and interfere with the message of God's kingdom and thus keep the people in ignorance. Today France is under great stress because of the war. Necessarily this hinders the proclamation of the truth, although France has been much more liberal than some other countries. During the year the publishers placed in the hands of the people books and booklets to the number of 595,995. (This number does not inelude the Bibles and copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> that were distributed throughout the country.) This did not include the last month of the year, because the reports could not get in because of interference with the mails. However, it is noticed that even with eleven months’ activity in the field the work exceeded that of the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the report submitted by the Society’s servant at Paris the following points are extracted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Just as we were about to look over the work done during the year 1938-39 and rejoice over the many privileges of service given us by Jehovah, the war broke out. Jehovah’s witnesses, however, were not amazed or dismayed; quite on the contrary, all remained calm, knowing of and expecting the difficulties that would arise. Seeing the fulfillment of God’s prophecies which had been recorded thousands of years ago in the Bible, we raise our voice in thankfulness to the all-knowing God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We rejoice that during the past year we were able to proclaim the good news of the Kingdom and announce the end of all oppression on the earth. Many people of good will heard this warning and took their stand on the side of God. We were able to observe how the people identified themselves by their reaction when the message was presented to them; some were for it, and some against.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Approximately 900 publishers spent their spare time in the door-to-door witness work. This includes 60 pioneers, who devoted all their strength and time to the work foreshadowed by Jeremiah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On different occasions publishers were held up in their work under the pretext that they did not have a ‘ ‘ colporteur permit ’ ’. It is interesting to note that the different trials were all decided in our favor. Even in the police court of Lourdes, Mecca of all pilgrims in France, our case was dismissed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a matter of fact nothing is easier to prove than the fact that Jehovah’s witnesses do their work in full devotion to the Most High and that the course they are following is wholly unselfish. It is needless to say that the interference with the publishers’ work is always a result of instigation by the Catholic clergy or fanatic Catholics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">War conditions open the way for the government to put into operation many emergency decrees, which has been done, and necessarily these hinder the activity of the Lord’s people in the field. Liberty of speech and of press is now curtailed even in the liberty-loving country of France. During the year phonographs and sound machines to the number of 402 were put in use, and the attendance at these meetings was, to wit, 193,971, who heard the Kingdom message. Back-calls were made to the number of 8,739.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the local servant’s report the further facts are quoted;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The special monthly witnessing periods have been observed, but we must say that the special testimony weeks were more appreciated and better attended than the periods comprising the whole month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses are determined to honor his name upon every occasion and under all circumstances to maintain their integrity toward Jehovah. They were greatly encouraged by the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> articles, which are more and more appreciated, and we are pleased to state that during the past year we have heard neither murmur nor criticism, but, on the contrary, we have often heard brethren say of the latest article, “This is the best.’’ The articles on “The Drama of Vindication” were especially enjoyed. We thank Jehovah for this food, and we also thank his servant, Brother Rutherford, for the care he continually takes in the preparation of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In these perilous days which this evil world goes through before it disappears, we remain united with you in the blessed work which Jehovah the Almighty has entrusted to us. We rejoice in the establislrment of the new heavens and the new earth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark107"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark108"></a>GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s people throughout the earth will be anxious to learn about Germany. The witnesses to the name of the Most High have suffered in that country probably more than in any other place on earth in modern times. In the face of all the difficulties and persecutions many of Jehovah^ witnesses have continued in faithfulness to carry on the work under a great handicap. They long for the spiritual food which the Lord provides for those who are able to receive all of His publications, but they must receive </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> in a way different from that in which others may receive it in countries where it is not prohibited. Those who have access to the publications of the Society cannot fully appreciate the difficulties under which their brethren in Germany labor. In spite of all the persecution in that land, even to the death of some-because of their stand for the Theocracy, many have remained steadfast and true to Jehovah and his King. During the year they did what they could to distribute the booklets </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts </span><span class="font5">and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom.</span><span class="font5"> This is revealed in some manner by the following letter, a copy of which is here inserted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Rejoice with us in Jehovah and in the Lord, and in love and gratitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Life - giving food from the Lord’s table received as follows: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> August 1; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font4"> August 15; booklets, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Under the Lord’s protection we are working with you, holding death in contempt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The tyrants like Pharaoh harden their hearts more and more, and all are fearful, expecting war in spite of the solemn declarations of peace in the press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Oppression very hard, and the people are literally wailing. The youth is completely depraved, filled with the spirit of war. The clergy again advocate war, and all are madly preparing for it. High-mindedness and morbid ambitions are rampant. Intolerable burdens are laid upon all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Always faithfully with you, sending our very best love, . . . company of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The faithful ones in Germany do not fear men. They fear God and are determined to serve him. The people of Germany and Austria that are devoted to Jehovah, being now under the same dominant earthly rule, endeavor to communicate with each other and work together. The following is quoted from information received from Germany:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fury of the monster does not prevent the people of good will from taking their stand on Jehovah’s side, as soon as they learn the truth. A report from Austria says that about 100 Jonadabs have been baptized in that country within the last six months. Amongst them are some of 13 and 14 years of age. It is reported that an immersion took place in a concentration camp and that the friends in that camp are continually supplied with the food in due season.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From another German section 12 immersions have been reported for January, 1939, and 23 more for March, 1939.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In some places the friends continue to assemble for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Prisons and Concentration Camps</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the beginning of the year the number of brethren detained in the dungeons of the Gestapo or in prisons and concentration camps in Germany had been estimated at about 6,000, but it seems that about half of these were released shortly preceding Germany’s raid on Poland. Though this looks like a “conciliatory gesture’’ on the part of the enemy, it is not an indication of less hatred against God’s people, but shows rather that they have had increased trouble in maintaining their own existence and have had to let up some on the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses. Some of the brethren accepted the deliverance in order to resume the joyful proclamation of the Kingdom as soon as released, while others accepted it desiring deliverance for selfish reasons, and these, when out of confinement, proved to be spiritually lifeless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some months ago a brother lost his life while in the hands of the enemy. The cause of his death was given as ‘ ‘ apoplexy ’ ’. His wife is in a concentration camp and wrote a few lines about the death of her husband. Stamped on this letter was the following: “This woman under preventive arrest is still a stubborn Bible Student, refusing to renounce their false doctrines. For this reason she has been denied the privilege of exchanging letters permitted to others. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another brother was carrying some letters reporting ill-treatment of Jehovah’s witnesses, when he was arrested. The judge said these letters evidently stated the facts and there could be no doubt of their truthfulness. Nevertheless, the brother was sentenced to three and a half years in prison. The Berlin Gestapo went to the limits of cruelty to force confessions from him. The hearings, held generally at night, were carried through in a beastly manner. One night the Nazis beat him thrice into unconsciousness, then poured cold water over him to bring him to. The brother thinks the Gestapo mixed his food with drugs, making him irresponsible for statements made and of which he knew nothing when confronted with them later. Ono sister died in a concentration camp after six months of confinement in the dark hole, where she was put on bread and water, with a warm soup every fourth day only. Another sister died in the camp under similar circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some information gets through from Germany to Switzerland from time to time, and the Swiss office keeps the Brooklyn office advised. We quote from a recent report as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since the outbreak of the new war, little has been heard from Germany; so we do not know much of those recently set free. It was said that in ease of war these would again be arrested. Nor do we know of the trouble our brethren may be having in connection with military service. A few days ago Swiss newspapers carried the following dispatch from the ‘ ‘ German News Agency”: ‘‘On September 15, August Dieekmann, of Kinslaken, was shot because of refusal to do his duty as a soldier.” This man was one of Jehovah’s witnesses and company servant. A message on a post card from Austria, received on September 28, 1939, says: ‘‘Two of us departed from us this morning. ‘Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life. ” This seems to say that two brethren have been shot in that Austrian city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Austria</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Austria having been incorporated into Germany, the same conditions prevail there and the report for Germany applies also to Austria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At first it seemed as if the Nazi terror ag</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">ains</span><span class="font4">t our brethren would be less rigid in Austria. The brother in charge reported only a few isolated eases of arrests. More recent reports, however, state that more than 20 friends were arrested when the Memorial was celebrated this year, and that 60 others were arrested preceding that action. The reports being very incomplete, we think that many more have been taken to prisons or concentration camps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The faithfulness with which the brethren in Germany continue to do the work under the most adverse circumstances is indicated by the following extract from the report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NS-Rechts-spiegel</span><span class="font4"> (‘‘National Socialist Legal Mirror”), official organ of Nazi justice, gave some idea of the struggle our brethren are having in Germany, publishing a lengthy front-page article on ‘‘Bible Students Before the Special Court. —Religious Eccentrics or Enemies of the State?” Following are some excerpts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ . . . The adherents of the forbidden association tried also to maintain the association amongst them and to strengthen one another in the faith. Aside therefrom, they tried on every possible occasion to bring other fellow-citizens to their way of thinking. Very often the Earnest Bible Students, while shopping, out for a walk, sitting in the parks or standing in the street, address people who are strangers to them, engaging them at first in a discussion of present events, then gradually to their faith and forbidden doctrine. They deem it their duty as 'Witnesses of Jehovah’ to do so. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Just before Easter, 1939, a number of their adherents were arrested white celebrating the ‘Memorial’, so called. Criminal proceedings are pending against them in the Munich Special Court. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Punishment for illegal activity in behalf of the International Bible Students Association is very severe for the higher functionaries, because it is these who continue to preach disobedience to the State and its ordinances. The National Socialist State, having already cleared away a number of strong opposing groups, is about to press these, its enemies, very hard. The State knows their methods and is acting accordingly. There is no doubt that this immense danger to the maintenance of the Reich will be completely removed within a short time.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Besides throwing interesting light on the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany, this article contains the admission that, though the National Socialist State prevailed against “a number of strong opposing groups”, it did not prevail against Jehovah’s witnesses, in spite of most cruel persecution in the past six years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The persecution of the covenant people of God in ancient times did not compare with what is now going on in Grermany. One faithful witness to the Lord from Germany got this report to the outside:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah preserves the faithful ones. In no other country will the prophecies about the persecution and preservation of God’s people have had a more complete fulfillment than in Germany. In this part of the earth, Gog has invaded the land with all his hordes, seeking to destroy God’s people. It will hardly be possible to surpass the terror of Nazidom with all its cruelties and tortures exercised in the dungeons of the Gestapo and in concentration camps. The Lord has permitted his people here to be put to a test which is like the “seven times more” heated furnace of Nebuchadnezzar. Thanks to the Lord, however, his own people have accomplished marvels of faith, exalting Jehovah’s name as did Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the attack upon God’s people in this country, the “Gestapo” (Secret State Police) is the chief tool of Satan. Like the nephilim in the days of Noah, filling the earth with violence, the Gestapo is a cruel gang of men who are their own judges. Being executioners for the National Socialist Party, “they are the law,” and they are always out hunting victims; they resort to any means to reach their ends. A huge apparatus is at their disposal; their methods of extorting confessions from their victims include the following: Fraud, deceit, falsehood, threats, confiscation of property, the rubber cudgel or other solid objects, tight shackles, torture-stakes, chemical means for breaking will power and reason, sterilization, and foul murder. Thus we have been told that Bro. Karl Kirsch, of Bochum, was disfigured and slain with his own artificial leg. Such cruel treatment is accompanied with blasphemous language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The &quot;evil servant’ <sup>-</sup> class is at the disposal of the Gestapo, acting as spies and traitors like Judas, thus adding to the sufferings of God’s people. It is a well-known fact that many of the &quot;evil servant’’ class have accepted murderer’s wage from the Gestapo, and that some of them are holding high positions in the Gestapo. They pose as brethren or representatives of the Berne office, in order to catch the faithful ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Gestapo is even m possession of the latest issues of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> using them as a means of introduction to the friends. For this reason, God’s people now have their own way of delivering the spiritual food, counteracting this maneuver of the Gestapo. In some cases officials of the Gestapo posed as refugee brethren, in order to sneak into the .confidence of brethren in other parts of the country and prepare the ground for wholesale arrests. For the same false reason, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">studies are being held for Gestapo officials, instructing them in current issues to better beguile the simple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sometimes an officei of the Gestapo would say to arrested witnesses of Jehovah: &quot;Look at that pile of documents; these have been prepared because of your Jehovah who would not deliver you.” To the faithful ones, however, such remarks are only further evidence of the fact that there is now really an antitypical pile of stones at Gilgal. Regardless of how far the enemy may have advanced in the city of palms and choked up the water-springs, the Greater-than-Abraham is providing his people with food in due season.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thousands of families of the Lord’s people have been torn asunder. Many have been robbed of their children, who are to be brought up elsewhere in a National Socialist spirit. Most of these children, however, have been strengthened in their faith in Jehovah by such experiences. Thus a girl of 13 wrote home to her parents: &quot;I always remember the faithful men like Job, Daniel and others, taking them for an example, and I would rather die than become unfaithful to God.” A boy of eleven years was entrusted to Nazis whose own children were members of the Hitler youths. The boy having been brought up in the spirit of the Bible, the vast difference in the behavior of the children soon became evident. The father of this Nazi family now, instead of being harsh and severe with the boy of Jehovah’s witnesses, soon preferred him to his own children, being pleased with the good manners of the boy. As during the first presence of our Lord, it is true in these days that “out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Through the Lord’s provision, the brethren in Germany are supplied with the spiritual food, receiving it even new, while the nation is at war. The number of brethren who are glad and thankful to receive the spiritual food is estimated at more than 3,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While iniquity and violence abound, those who ‘sigh and cry for all the abominations that are being done in “Christendom’’ ’ are clearly manifesting themselves. These “other sheep ’ ’ receive gladly the message of the Kingdom at the hands of Jehovah’s witnesses, being supplied with literature which is still on hand in some secret places. Records of distribution are no longer kept, because of the tight system of espionage and surveillance. But it is certain that the Lord has blessed the efforts of his people. Amongst those who symbolized their consecration to do God’s will, by immersion in water, were some who formerly held positions of might and honor in Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah has made the foreheads of his people “as an adamant harder than flint’’, and, being upheld by the power of the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Alm</span><span class="font4">ighty, the faithful ones are walking courageously through “the valley of the shadow of death’’. They have the joy of the Lord, and many have shown their gratitude toward Jehovah by ‘taking joyfully the spoiling of their goods’. They are blind and deaf to everything except the interests of the Kingdom, and they are thankful to the Lord for their part in the vindication of His holy name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In view of these facts detailing some of the happenings in Germany at the present time it is easy to see that the persecution and cruel treatment of real Christians in that land is the same as that practiced by the Hierarchy during the Dark Ages. This proves that the Devil is back of all such persecution, and that the ‘Hierarchy Institution of Authority’ is the Devil’s chief instrument on earth to defame God’s name and to oppose the great Theocratic Government, which is the only hope of man. The faithful in every country will rejoice to learn of the steadfastness and stability of the men and women in Germany, and also the children, who have stood firmly on God’s side and defied the Devil and all his forces. It is so manifest that the demons under Satan’s direction have seized upon the ruling power of Germany that any sane person who knows anything about God’s Word can see this fact. Let the people of other countries take note now that that devilish system that has persecuted honest and sincere men in Germany during the last few years is spreading rapidly to other parts of the earth, and the same spirit prevails in the United States, where the Nazi-Catholic organization is desperately striving to grab control of the country and rule it with an iron hand, even as Germany is ruled. Let the faithful rejoice over the ever-increasing evidence that Armageddon is near, when Jehovah through Christ Jesus will rid the earth of all this menacing and destroying <sup>if</sup>beast” and put in operation his government of righteousness, which shall endure forever.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark109"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark110"></a>HUNGARY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The witness work in the benighted and priest-ridden country of Hungary has made very slow progress during the fiscal year. The Hierarchy system of Rome, as the evidence shows, is in a conspiracy with her tools in Hungary to destroy Jehovah’s people. This would have been accomplished ere now except for the Lord’s protection. During the year the total distribution of books and booklets is only 29,260. 241 publishers have done this work and have put in 13,750 hours in the field in doing it. They have had no sound machines, as they are not permitted to use them, being so easily detected in this manner. From the servant’s report in that section the following extracts are taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nearly all of the zone servants and pioneers are under police surveillance; meaning that they have to report personally at the police station, some once a week and some twice a month, and may not leave town without special permission. But they do service to the glory of Jehovah and fer the comfort of the people of good will, going great distances of from three to five hundred kilometers from their home town, leaving secretly by bicycle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Warrants were issued against two of the pioneers several months ago, b.ut they have continued in the service and have not as yet been arrested. These have a permanent residence permit ef which the police have been notified. A short time ago the home of one of these pioneers was searched, but nothing further was done, though she personally answered the door on that occasion; but the officer had mistakenly copied the mother’s name, so, he asking for the wrong person, the sister could easily reply that this person had never lived there, and the officer went away with that information. The Lord’s hand is clearly visible in such experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Hierarchy always finds reasons for bringing Jehovah’s witnesses into the courts. Only a few days ago the case of ten witnesses of Jehovah was heard before a People’s Court in Pecs, and it was quite evident that the presiding officer was under the influence of the Hierarchy and of the demons. Otherwise he could not have roared as he did at the mere mentioning of Jehovah’s name. He declared the Lord’s witnesses to be mad and their books to be trashy literature. When one of the brethren tried to tell something of the Bible, the officer shouted that he should shut up at once or a lock would be put on his mouth. The defendants were not permitted to mention God or the Bible. It was rather the raging of demons than a trial in court. Then the Devil uses his newspapers to report these matters in order to hold up to ridicule the Lord’s cause. But even this works out for good to those who love the Lord, and is helping to open the eyes of the people of good will. This Pecs comedy ended with a four-month sentence for one brother, three months for two others, and one and a half months for six others. But an appeal has been made to the higher court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another brother was arrested while on his way taking literature to a company. He was taken to prison, his bicycle and the literature were also seized, and in the same prison was another brother who had already given a good witness amongst the prisoners. One of these came to him, saying: ‘ ‘ Uncle X., in the office there are now many of those booklets of which you have told us; shall I bring you some?” The brother answered “Yes”, of course; so the first brother got more this way and gave it to his wife, who daily brought him his food from outside, and who took the literature away with her and distributed it amongst the other kind of prisoners who cry and sigh because of the abominations in &quot;Christendom”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to a new law, passed at the instance of the Hierarchy, anyone spreading literature from abroad is liable to imprisonment for six months. But he who is with us is infinitely more powerful than those who are against us; and until his witnesses acquire wisdom in his service, he is blinding the enemy, so that they cannot prevail against us. Pioneers have been repeatedly arrested, being charged with spreading literature from abroad, but weie sentenced only to from one to six day’s in prison and afterwards released. This is also evidence of the fact that not all officials are in sympathy with the clergy, and that there are even some amongst them who are distressed because of the conditions in &quot;Christendom” and who are willing to help the Lord’s witnesses rather than persecute them. The Devil will never be able to create unity in his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pioneers are seldom able to reach the required number of hours in the service, because of the many difficulties. After going from 30 to 46 kilometers on a bicycle, it often happens that they have to leave a community when only a very few families have been called on, because the priest is after them with a mob. It may be the same in the next community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pioneers must be very precautious to avoid arrest. One sister, for instance, working a community with a goodly number of goat-like inhabitants, put a black kerchief around her shoulders, covered her head likewise, and thus went forth. After having worked a part of the community, she was aware of the fact that one of the goats was in action, and in a short time he came along with two police-soldiers. The publisher took refuge in a by-street, changed her black kerchiefs for some of another color, and moved quietly on in the direction of the two police-soldiers; these asked her whether she had seen a woman wearing black kerchiefs, to which the sister replied she had seen one, evidently in a hurry, running in the other direction. The police-soldiers and their spy went off running to find her, and the sister went quietly home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are short of literature, and it will be impossible to have it printed in the country, due to the censorship exercised in co-operation with the cardinal’s office. For this reason we are very careful with the small quantity still on hand, in order that this might be distributed amongst people of good will only.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We find many who show the spirit of Rahab, and our efforts are concentrated on these people. We visit them regularly, carrying God’s message to them. It is gratifying to see how fast these people of good will are grasping the truth, ready to do something in the interest of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “evil servant” class is also manifesting itself, and its sole activity consists in slandering those faithfully devoted to the Lord and trying to stop others by ‘sweet words’. Those fully devoted to the Lord will not be deceived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since midyear the organization has been set going again by a brother sent to this country from the Central European office. Nearly everything had been destroyed by the unfaithfulness of one in the Budapest office and others with him. To reorganize the work has been all the more difficult, since in the course of the year some sort of state of war has existed at three different times. In connection therewith some brethren have been thrown into prison, because of obeying God rather than men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the above reasons, reports have been received for six months only. During that time there was a monthly average of 12 pioneers and 133 company workers, spreading a total of 522 books, 28,738 booklets and 164 Bibles in 13,000 working hours. The number of back-calls is 396 for the last two months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But these reports are incomplete, and we are sure that a great deal more has been accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the past few months Hungary has enlarged its boundaries. In October, 1938, after the Munich capitulation by the western democracies, some Slovakian sections were ceded to Hungary, and in March of this year, after the splitting-up of Czechoslovakia and the creation of an “independent” Slovakian State, the territory formerly known as “Carpathian Ukraine” was incorporated into Hungary by force of arms. The companies which were formerly under Czechoslovakian rule were at that time all well supplied with Hungarian literature; and thus considerable was again available for distribution throughout the land. But while the companies under Czechoslovakian rule had enjoyed full freedom, they are now in the same plight as all others in Hungary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Due to the change mentioned above, there are now also Russian, Ukrainian and Rumanian companies in Hungary. The recent events in Poland have given Hungary a stretch of frontier in common with Russia, and it is’ now Hungary’s turn to fear for its independence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus the political outlook is very dark; but we are truly thankful to the Lord for the privilege we still have, to do something in his work, and we are ready, dear brethren, to push the battle to the gate in co-operation with you.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark111"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark112"></a>ITALY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Particularly since the open alliance between the Vatican and Mussolini the totalitarian state of Italy has made it practically impossible for any of Jehovah’s witnesses to exist or go about with the literature announcing the great Theocracy. Thus it will be appreciated by the brethren outside that during the year books and booklets announcing the Theocratic Government have been placed in the hands of the people of Italy to the number of 3,709. This literature must reach Italy in a surreptitious manner and be distributed under a great handicap. The following report from Italy is quoted, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren in Italy are shut up from the outside world, as far as the regular supply of literature is concerned, and it is hardly possible to make shipments from here. As we have reported heretofore, such shipments are held up on the frontier or confiscated by the postal authorities. However, this year, by the Lord’s grace, we were able to get a large supply of books and booklets into Italy in such a way that the brethren there now have an opportunity of taking a larger part in the house-to-house service proclaiming the truth. The way it was done must be kept secret.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Brooklyn office asked us to reorganize the work there as far as possible, and that we have done. Already our efforts show some results, and the brethren there have expressed their great joy and gratitude for the help we have given them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The present condition, however, prevents a reliable mailservice and contact with the brethren; for all mail is censored. The brethren often write that they do not get the letters which have been sent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Italian people as such would be quite ready to receive the message, and we believe that the Lord will yet give a greater opportunity for the witness work in Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is no doubt that the death knell for religion sounded by Brother Rutherford over radio was also listened to with trembling in Vatican City.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the face of the opposition aforementioned, a witness has been given within the borders of Italy and notice served upon the enemy of God’s purpose to destroy everything that opposes the Theocratic Government. Let those who love Jehovah and his King rejoice that the day of deliverance is near.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark113"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark114"></a>LUXEMBURG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In this little section of the world dominated by the Nazis an average of only 23 publishers have been in the field during the year, spending 4,011 hours in the work. This was an increase over the service of last year’s effort, and that under a greater handicap. The fact that the distribution of literature has been small is due to the fear of the people of having the literature in their possession. During the year, literature including books and booklets to the number of 13,381 has been placed in the hands of the people. They have had 10 phonographs in the service. Says the report from that section of the field:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren have much joy in giving the witness with the phonograph, and honest people rejoice likewise when hearing the message of the truth from the records. In accordance therewith, good progress has been made in sound-activity, though in most cases the phonograph cannot be taken to the remote territory which is being reached by bicycle. The publishers try to leave a large quantity of literature each time they work this territory, since it cannot be done more than once a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The police officials were moderate in their proceedings against us. We found in most cases that they did nothing against us and confiscated no literature, unless required to do so by the clergy. Then when this was done, the Catholic press made it appear as if the authorities had acted on their own initiative in prohibiting the distribution of Bible Students’ literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Only three weeks ago six publishers were stopped in this way, while working a remote territory. But a week after, the confiscated literature was returned, without any further action against the friends. This shows that the police had interfered only to please the “Reverend”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Aside from the weekly service meetings we now have a monthly service convention in Esch, with an attendance of from 50 to 70 brethren, Jonadabs and other interested ones. Each convention is a great stimulus to all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the face of present world events, the publishers here are more active than ever, feeling that the field of activity may be less accessible in the future. We are trusting in the Lord and are willing to do our part in the power of his might.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark115"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark116"></a>THE NETHERLANDS (HOLLAND)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">At the beginning of the fiscal year foreigners who were acting as pioneers were forbidden to go from house to house. Prior to that time the major portion of the witness work had been done by pioneers. During the year there were placed in the hands of the people books and booklets to the number of 186,623. An average of 274 company publishers and 43 pioneers were in the field, and worked a total of 102,847 hours. Phonographs and transcription machines to the number of 94 have been employed, and the total attendance at these sound meetings was 30,412. Greater difficulties have been encountered in The Netherlands during the year by reason of “Catholic Action”. These tools of Satan go about and warn the people not to accept anything from Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s servant in that field makes report, from which the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We desire to remark that particularly the pioneers were very diligent last year; for many months in succession some of them worked 200 hours per month. The average per month in 1937-38 of 73 pioneers was 83 hours, but the average per month this year of 43 pioneers was 102 hours. The comparative low average of service hours is due to the fact that several pioneers could work only a few months of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brother Rutherford’s letter of January 1, 1939, was an encouragement, particularly to the company workers. In 1937-38 the company workers engaged on the average 11 hours per month in the service, while during this year they reached an average of 15 hours per month. The high aim of 60 hours, therefore, was not reached by far. We hope that we may greatly raise the average of service hours during the coming year, by encouraging the brethren to put in more time in the service of the Lord. Of course, there are many company workers who actually engage 60 hours per month in the service, but there are a number of irregular workers who sometimes work but two hours per month, and thus the average of service hours per worker is greatly reduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The back-call service was taken firmly in hand, and thus pioneers and company workers made, all together, 7,864 back-calls, to compare with 284 the year before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year four general service conventions were held in Holland. These service conventions are richly blessed by the Lord. They represent the intensive activity of the publishers. It has never before happened that in the course of one year so many new publishers joined the ranks of Jehovah’s witnesses as last year. On occasion of the above-mentioned service conventions, 29Et Jonadabs were immersed. On several smaller occasions a few more Jonadabs w'ere immersed, so that, all together, more than 300 persons took their stand on the Lord’s side during this year. That means that the number of the Lord’s people in Holland was doubled in one year. We are very grateful to Jehovah for this grand fulfillment of his promises and prophecies. The service conventions have greatly helped to encourage the publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Opposition</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Due to the constant warnings by the clergy, the police in many cases were forced to start proceedings and make arrests. However, the desire of the clergy was not accomplished, for we still enjoy the liberty of practically unhindered proclamation of the Kingdom message. For six years we had a Catholic Minister of Justice, who started many lawsuits against Jehovah’s witnesses, but until now without serious results. However, a few months ago, the cabinet of Colijn, this Catholic minister of justice, was dissolved and we now have a new cabinet with a Protestant minister of justice. It remains to be seen whether this change will mean a more favorable condition for Jehovah’s witnesses or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">According to Organization Instructions, we have divided the country into zones and appointed regional and zone servants, which has proved very timely, helpful and encouraging to the brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Printing Factory</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are very grateful to the Lord for his visible guidance in the various affairs of his work. For instance, the Lord’s providence in having the printing machines from Czechoslovakia shipped to Holland in safety, and that they are now set up in Holland. Just now, when the facilities of transportation from Switzerland to Holland have become more difficult, we are glad that we have a printing factory ourselves and that we can print our magazines and literature in our own country, for which we have already received the official permission.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark117"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark118"></a>POLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">During the year activity of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society has been greatly hindered by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. While some of the underoffieials would be glad to favor God’s people, they are afraid to do so. Now Poland is gone, having been lost to the gangster from Germany. Since the outbreak of the war against Poland no one in that land has been able to report to the outside; consequently what report we have is confined to events that took place prior to the beginning of the present war. As far as reported, the books and booklets placed in the hands of the people in Poland during the fiscal year totaled 201,539. 1,039 publishers were in the field, and they employed 167 phonographs, through which 51,571 people listened to the message of the Kingdom. From reports that came through prior to all communication’s being shut off, the following items are extracted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Conditions are not unlike the catacomb life of the early Christians. But though the number of arrests and condemnations in the courts have increased, the efforts in the work, and the results thereof, have also increased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In spite of the order prohibiting the work, the friends find very often that the police do not interfere, unless forced by the clergy to do so The friends everywhere have become more determined and fearless in their fight. The following shows how the Lord adds his blessing to such an attitude:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Three brethren are employed in a factory where the other 700 workers belong either to Catholic Action or Nationalist (patriotic) societies. Recently a special loan for war purposes was raised amongst the workers, but these three brethren refused to have a part, and all the others called for their dismissal. Three wheelbarrows were held ready to take them out of the factory, and the workmen threatened to carry out a sit-down strike if the three brothers were not dismissed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our brethren were then summoned before the board of directors and there gave a witness for forty minutes. One of the foremen, a preacher of a Protestant sect, tried to explain to them that they should give to God what belongs to God and to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, but he was silenced when the brothers convincingly told them that God has given life and only He has the right to take it; that while the State, issuing the money, has the right to collect it, this does not mean that one should lend a helping hand to the preparation of murder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An investigation followed, whereby the brethren were proved to be able and trustworthy workers, and they were not discharged, but their wages were cut. The whole affair was a good witness in that factory, and many showed then a greater interest in the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are passing through the fulfillment of what is shown in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> articles on “The Drama of Vindication”. In this country, too, the fight goes on with greater force than ever.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark119"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark120"></a>RUMANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Society has no legal status in Rumania, because the authorities there under the direction of the Vatican have dissolved it. Under the most difficult circumstances the Rumanian faithful witnesses to the Lord have during the year placed literature in the hands of the people to the number of 14,327 books and booklets. They have been unable to use their phonographs, and had to do the witness work by word of mouth and the printed message. The report received from Rumania shows the great difficulty under which the work was carried on, and from that report the following extracts are taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As a result of the clergy’s work, all our friends are spied upon and denounced for the most trivial matter. They are then brought into court, and sentences vary from six months to two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One brother worked in the woods as a lumberman and had taken his Bible and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearlook</span><span class="font4"> with him, to read in leisure hours. One day the clothes of all lumbermen were searched by a squad of police-soldiers, and the brother was arrested for having the Bible and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yearlook.</span><span class="font4"> He had to go with them afoot for 200 kilometers [125 miles], and was then taken before the court and given six months in prison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another family had to appear in court and was sentenced to three months in prison, because they had sung some songs from our Song Book in their home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If Someone is offered books at his door and does not inform the police at once, he is liable to severe punishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Existing conditions make it impossible to go from house to house. Meetings are not permitted. The whole country is in a state of siege. If we try to do something with the phonographs, these are immediately taken away and the records smashed. A close supervision of all mail, of telephone calls and of our every movement adds to the paralyzation of the activity in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But in spite of all these difficulties, the faithful brethren are courageously doing the best they can, to have a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark121"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark122"></a>SWITZERLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">As stated heretofore, Switzerland is the main point of activity from which the work in Central Europe has been conducted. Small in area, its people threatened and torn by the disturbed conditions round about, the spirit of democratic freedom long existing there has practically disappeared. Although the fundamental law of the land forbids Jesuits to carry on their pernicious activity in Switzerland, this has been overridden and “Catholic Action” has done much to retard the publication of the message of the Theocratic Government in that land. In the face of all of this persecution the witness work has progressed, and during the year the faithful witnesses have placed in the hands of the people books and booklets to the number of 431,450. Phonographs and sound machines to the number of 725 have been in operation proclaiming the name of Jehovah and his Theocratic Government. From the report of the Society’s representative at Berne the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It has been reported formerly that the authorities of the city of Lucerne tried to stop a public meeting held by Brother Rutherford in 1936 and that two representatives of the Society were punished by the court of Berne for ‘ ‘ slandering religion ’ ’, and that some of the publications of the Society were placed upon the Index in the chiefly Protestant canton of Berne. We must now supplement the shameful record for a democratic country, namely, that the Federal Police has succumbed to the pressure of the Hierarchy in forbidding the distribution of the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom.</span><span class="font4"> This proves that Switzerland has come to the crossing of the road. Officially this measure of the police was based upon a recent federal decree forbidding any attack upon rulers of other nations. It was also stated that the booklet contained an unlimited criticism of the Catholic Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thereupon a lengthy statement was addressed to the federal authority, in which the real motive for the distribution of our literature was explained. Numerous proofs were given that by our publications thousands of people were comforted and encouraged in their faith in God and in their confidence in one another, and that thereby the people received the hope of God’s </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom of peace in these troublesome times. If in this booklet, as in other publications which have been distributed in millions of copies during the last fifty years, attention was called to dangers, misdeeds and injustice, it is not done out of hatred or fanaticism, but this work is carried on to instruct the people of good will and to help them to avoid evil. It was said that the mentioning of Hitler’s name in the booklet could not be given as an excuse for suppressing the booklet, because with Hitler fanaticism is considered an ideal, he himself has stated that only fanatical people accomplish great things and that all Nazis should be fanatics, and therefore the statement calling Hitler a fanatical ruler and instrument to work evil is nothing but the truth. Thousands of our brethren in Germany are suffering as a result of Hitler’s fanaticism. Surely a few plain words in defense of these Christians should not be suppressed in liberty-loving Switzerland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Attention was also called to the fact that the point raised about attacks upon the heads of foreign governments was seized upon as a mere pretext; for the enemies of the truth are never frank and open in their procedure against Jehovah’s faithful witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our letter called further attention to the truth of what is stated in the booklet concerning the conspiracy between Fascism and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and that the attempt of the Hierarchy to have the Swiss authorities suppress the Bible message in this booklet is a further evidence of that very conspiracy. The Nazis and the Catholic Hierarchy have always worked hand in hand in the persecution of our brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Undoubtedly the Hierarchy is stung by the truth in the booklet, exposing the Hierarchy as being on the side of the suppressors of freedom. The Hierarchy naturally desires to carry forward her schemes of expansion at the cost of democratic rights of the people and does not wish to be disturbed by publications such as </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom.</span><span class="font4"> We have mentioned in our letter the multiplied and accumulated evidence proving the co-operation of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy with the dictatorships in destroying Christian liberty, and which overt acts of their conspiracy nave even been denounced in several Catholic newspapers. Everybody in Switzerland and Europe can now see this partnership: in Germany the Catholic agent of Papacy, von Papen and others; in the Saar territory bishops helping the Nazis at the plebiscite for Hitler; in Austria Cardinal Innitzer’s hailing of Hitler and the ecclesiastical appeals for the support of the Nazis in the elections; in the Sudetenland the secret activity by the Catholic prelate Hilgen-rainer; in Slovakia the treason committed by the prelate Tiso; in the Carpathian Ukraine the treason of the prelate Woloshin; furthermore attention was called to the battlefields of the Catholic-Fascist Hierarchy in Spain. Closing our letter, we stated that we are committed to peace and order, but there are certain fundamental truths which must be said and concerning which we must say with Martin Luther: <sup>(&lt;</sup>I cannot act otherwise, so help me God. Amen.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thereupon, within the week from the 7th to the 12th of August, about 100 Swiss newspapers seized upon this first general attack upon our work and carried a dispatch concerning the suppression of the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom.</span><span class="font4"> The Catholic newspapers particularly greatly distorted the facts, and so it was decided to print and distribute a tract setting out our defense against these abominable attacks upon Jehovah’s witnesses. 40,000 copies were printed and distributed throughout Switzerland. This action was very effective. It exposed particularly as the complainants against Jehovah’s witnesses Swiss Nazis, Catholic Action, the “Society for Church and Pope” at St. Gall, and the “Catholic International Press Agency” at Fribourg. Here follow a few paragraphs from this special paper:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Swiss citizens, let us speak openly. It is very pernicious if a federal ordinance is used to prevent anyone from designating a wrong as a wrong and a deviltry as a deviltry (for example, Abyssinia, Spain, China, the outlawing and the torture of innocent men in certain European states). The final conclusion of such a policy would be to make it a crime to say anything unfavorable about the Devil himself, who according to the words of Jesus is the prince and therefore the ruler of this world (John 14: 30; 2 Cor. 4:4).”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In our statement of defense the charge was refuted that in the booklet the Roman pope and the dictators are slandered and ridiculed in cartoons. The booklet contains a serious illustration on the cover, and no cartoons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The charge was also refuted that the booklet carries a campaign of hate. This last argument is surely sprung from the brains of Jesuits; for the clergy in all the earth is putting forth systematic efforts to have laws and decrees passed against race-hatred and for religion, which laws are supposed to be directed against Nazi and anti-Semitic propaganda, but they are actually used against Jehovah’s witnesses and for the suppression of the truth. They claim that whatever exposes the anti-freedom and anti-Bible schemes of the Fascist-Hierarchical elements is a campaign of hate. We pointed out that this tactic proceeds from one central office, where it is given out to call the proclamation of the truth a campaign of hate and thereby hinder the same. Proofs were given from various countries, and it was stated that Jesus himself did not flatter the great of the earth, that He told the truth and He did not thereby sow hatred, but He </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font4">self was hated bitterly on account of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Who, it was asked in our publication, in the course of history has incited to violence, and who, until the present day, has been guilty of bloody persecution of all who do not agree with them? The history of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy for a thousand years contains but one answer, and that is: Rome is guilty, and not the witnesses of the truth (namely, Jehovah’s witnesses), who to this very day are suffering and bleeding in the Dictator-States modeled after Rome. Reference was then made to the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crusade Against Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our statement also contained a portion of the letter addressed to the Federal Police and was then distributed throughout Switzerland within a very short time. This sudden and quick action stunned the enemy. Some of these who gnawed their tongues in pain addressed the following poisonous remarks to Jehovah’s witnesses, sending them through the mail, but without signing their names and addresses to their dirty epithets, such as this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I advise you not to send another of your agents to my house, for I can assure you that he will not offer his devilliterature a second time after he has received the appropriate corporal treatment. You should be put in jail, or you should be banished on Devil’s Island, where together with your master, the very Satan, you could put forth your foolishness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another: “You bad people, you traitors, do you wish to sell our fatherland for 30 pieces of silver? May God punish you, you Judas-people. With phew and abomination this is returned to the shameless distributors.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another: “We are glad that they have thrown you out of Germany (as also your crown-witness Prof. Barth). They should do it here also and let you work for Roosevelt, for instance, in his private propaganda department, to which you may belong already.—A genuine Bernese.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">None of these writers dared to give his name and address. One called himself a Protestant and is very likely a Jesuit, who is taught to lie and do anything under cover, according to the Devil’s own method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here are a few of the many who appreciated receiving our defense statement. One writes: “I have received your leaflet and have read it with great interest. It has surprised me in many respects, and it has awakened a deep interest in me for your association.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another: ‘ ‘ The contents of your leaflet I approve absolutely. My sincerest good wishes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another: &quot;You have sent me your leaflet. Although I am a Boman Catholic, your publications have interested me and have made me glad, because at least someone has had the courage to criticize the politics of the Boman Catholic Church. I am convinced that many other Catholics will also enjoy your criticism. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All of these letters and many others contained the names and addresses of the writers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, we know from the fulfillment of prophecy the time is near when we will no longer enjoy the blessings of comparative freedom in Switzerland. This is indicated in the threats made by Catholic Action, by disturbances of public meetings, prevention of meetings, and the confiscation of our literature by the police at the instance of the clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On one occasion, when members of Catholic Action, using violence, prevented a public meeting of Jehovah’s witnesses in a certain city of Switzerland, the Catholic press stated: &quot;Every one of our young men was ready in ease of need to take a hand and take the starch out of these witnesses by giving them a cool bath. ’ ’ Eegarding further arrangements made by Jehovah's witnesses, Catholic newspapers stated: &quot;They should think twice before they arrange that meeting, for we do not warrant a safe conduct for ttiem.” In this way and manner the clergy influences the authorities and incites mob violence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Again Switzerland is surrounded by nations at war. The Swiss army is mobilized, and governmental power is now taken from the civil government and delegated to the military authorities to a much greater extent than was done during the last world war. All this does not frighten God’s people in Switzerland, for they are courageous and strong and they continue in the work with zeal and ardor. The Lord has guided his faithful ones through much adversity and has given them strength for the final battle, and nothing can quench their zeal and diligence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The number of publishers increased from 813 to 1,039. All companies work now to the goal of getting all those attending meetings to become active workers, in order that the number of publishers should be equal to the attendance at the Memorial. Quite a number of friends ne longer partake of the emblems, but continue to be active publishers. They have abstained from partaking of the emblems because of a better understanding of their own position. All, the remnant and the Jonadabs, know that the Lord requires complete devotion and faithfulness in his service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Conventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The service conventions were marked by a greater attendance and more enthusiasm. All together, 13 regional service conventions have been held, with an attendance of nearly 5,000 publishers. A thousand persons attended the Basle convention; a thousand brethren also the Zurich convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The exhibition of the revised “Brama of Creation” continues to be a very effective means of proclaiming the truth in this -country. The halls were nearly always overcrowded where the “Drama” was shown. It was exhibited twenty times, to a crowd of 19,000 people, with 135 follow-up lectures, which were attended by 14,300 persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“Watchtower” Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The companies launched upon the four-month </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">Campaign with great enthusiasm. They received with joy and careful attention particularly the personal letter of Brother Rutherford, in order to accomplish the best results ever obtained. The brethren have been .shown how to make the best use of their time. Certain restrictions on account of the cattle disease made it necessary to give more attention to back-calls, which during the four months amounted to 6,120, to compare with 2,619 during the first four months of the year. Nearly all the new subscriptions, 1,045 for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> were obtained when making back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During this campaign there was an increase of 15,946 working-hours over and above the result of the preceding four months. The brethren are learning and understanding how to ‘redeem the time, for the days are evil’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“Evil Servant”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The spirit of the “elective elder” and of the “evil servant” class was also manifested. Several of the more “prominent” brethren, who at one time held special positions of service, have now withdrawn from the battle. Some of these preach the Devil’s lie of universal salvation and slander those who at one time they considered their brethren. They go about amongst the simple and by ‘ sweet words ’ seek to deceive them and use them for their own personal benefit. They were greatly disappointed when they failed to disturb the Lord’s work and when they realized that but very few are following after them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Tor tliis reason the Basle and Zurich company adopted a special resolution, expressing their faithfulness to the Lord and their loyalty to the Lord and to the representatives of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the time when these persons (about 10 or 15) left the ranks, fifty new publishers, Jonadabs, joined themselves to the Lord’s people on the occasion of the regional sendee convention at Zurich.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fact that the Jonadabs clearly see the issue is also manifested in what a Jonadab recently wrote: “Some have left the battlefield, but this did not shake us at all. Having read the marvelous </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> article on ‘The Theocracy’, all the brethren should now understand that faithfulness regarding instructions received from the Society means faithfulness to Jehovah. I hope that my lines will be taken as further proof that your work was not done in vain; for today there are thousands upon thousands of Jonadabs who are fully devoted to the Kingdom and who are looking forward to the glorious time when the Kingdom will be fully established.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Record of Persecution</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The distribution of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Crusade Against Christianity </span><span class="font4">called forth many favorable comments in the press. The following excerpts are taken from the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Bund</span><span class="font4"> at Berne, the leading newspaper of government circles:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Although we must say, as the editors (the ‘Europa Publishers’), that we do not identify ourselves with the Bible discussions contained in the book, nor with the aims of Jehovah’s witnesses (Earnest Bible Students), we are nevertheless glad to take the part of these valiant witnesses of Christianity who speak to us here. The author clearly marks the position of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">Christian during this time of revival of paganism. He shows, supported by reliable documents, how Christians, speaking for their conviction, are suffering today under a Neronian absolutism and an unscrupulous stupidity. Their Christian attitude is calling forth our full respect. The issue here involves nothing less than freedom of worship and conscience. It is always worth while to risk our lives to safeguard such freedom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A well-known Polish author, Hulka-Laskowski, expressed his appreciation of the book as follows: “My heart is filled with sympathy and admiration for these courageous people who are giving such a wonderful witness to their faith. If only half a million Protestants and Catholics were like these witnesses of Jehovah, everything would be different in that unfortunate country. ’ ’</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark123"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark124"></a>YUGOSLAVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The work has been, retarded very much in Yugoslavia during the year by reason of Catholic Action. Many arrests were followed by confiscations and convictions in the courts. Raids have been made upon the companies while in assembly for study. A large amount of Bibles and Bible literature has been seized, all of which has been done at the hands of the Vatican organization, the enemies of God and his Theocratic Government. In the face of all this wicked opposition 25,058 books and booklets have been put in the hands of the people. Fourteen phonographs and sound machines have been in operation, the attendance of the people to which has totaled 10,060. 387 back-calls have been made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following extracts are from the report of the Society’s local representative:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have had much joy in the service for and with the Jona-dabs, who also in this country are taking a very determined stand. Some of them have had to appear in court, too, but have maintained their steadfastness there and given a splendid witness. Most of them were acquitted, and the result of such persecution was greater interest on the part of those who learned of the proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The back-call service is already in quite good shape, and we are hoping to do much more in this branch of the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many letters are coming in from people of good will in every part of the country, but we are unable to do little more than give a written reply, because we cannot get everywhere with the three pioneers who are left us at present, and our zone servants can spend only their Sundays and holidays in the service and are hardly able to serve their assigned companies regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many of the friends have been intimidated by the persecutions, especially the older companies, which have gone to sleep with the exception of two. On the other hand, the newly organized companies are very zealous and energetic. We do not concern ourselves much with those sleeping, finding no time for that, because we must hurry while it is still day, sounding forth the glory and greatness of the great Theocrat, Jehovah, and of his King. And we hope to endure in this service until the end.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark125"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark126"></a>CHINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The evidence strongly points to the fact that the Vatican of Rome entered into an arrangement with the Japanese government to overrun China, grab possession of that vast territory and rule it by a dictator. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy has become bold in the land of China in announcing the greatness of their institution. They have made it difficult for the Lord’s people to work anywhere, and the great war that has been prosecuted in that land during the year has made it practically impossible to carry the witness to the interior country. The distribution of books and booklets during the year has totaled 6,942. Only three sound machines have been in operation, but these have been used to a good purpose. The Society’s local servant at Shanghai makes report, from which the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Devil has wrought great devastation -and destruction in this country and brought much sorrows and woes upon the people, particularly since the outbreak of Sino-Japanese hostilities two years ago. The Chinese people have, for the past many centuries through religion and superstition, been kept in ignorance of God’s purpose of establishing a righteous government through which blessings of salvation to life may be extended to all who obey the righteous laws of His Theocratic Government under Christ, His enthroned King. The bloody war, prosecuted and carried on by merciless warlords through the many whoredoms of the “mistress of witchcrafts” (Nahum 3:4), not only has caused untimely death to many, wrecked once peaceful homes, but also prevented the Kingdom message to be taken into the interiors. At present the Work is limited only in Shanghai. Nevertheless the Lord’s arm is not shortened, and he sees to it that the message is given to those who really desire it. On account of the threatening conditions prevailing in the interiors many native Chinese have Bed therefrom and come to seek refuge in Shanghai and thus the message finds a way to reach the ears of those who otherwise would have never heard it. Also the books have traveled far back into the remote places of the China Proper. This is indicated by the letters received from the interiors expressing the earnest desire to know more about the Kingdom which they have been praying for. Therefore, as soon ns the hostilities between the two countries eease some of the workers may be sent to the interiors to comfort those hungry souls who badly need consolation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The facts show that the “peaceable habitation” of the religionists in this country, particularly the so-called “Catholic population ’ has been disturbed by the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom message preached to them. The leaders thereof have been annoyed by the stings of the Lord’s “locusts”, the truth which Jehovah’s witnesses bring them; they begin to howL The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Review </span><span class="font4">in its editorial of June issue published much lies against Lord’s messengers, denouncing them as commercial canvassers selling books for selfish gain. A copy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered,</span><span class="font4"> has been served on the editress of that magazine. Most of the Catholics have been warned not io take any literature from the Lord’s messengers when called at their doors. Some Catholics even showed their horns when witnessed to, and their faces manifested a flush of anxiety, just as foretold in the prophecy by Joel (2: fi) Recently the Catholic organization employs the radio station XMHA (this station used to broadcast Watchtower program for a period of more than three years until the Catholic organization interfered in the fall of 1937, when they broke our contract) to broadcast “a series of five talks on the Shanghai Catholic Hour discussing the Encyclical of Pope Pius XI on</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Christian marriage”. The announcement, published in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">North China Daily News</span><span class="font4"> made such a boastful declaration to the effect that ‘ ‘ the voice of the Boman Pontiff is, for the whole of ‘ Christendom’, the voice of Christ”, aroused much argument and controversy of other denominations in the columns of the said paper. Never before the Catholics in China show themselves in the public life, and the indication is that they have taken advantage of the present crisis in China to gain control of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Awakening to their privilege and responsibility the Lord’s faithful ones in this part of the earth have recently bestirred themselves in the Lord’s service. They realize the time is short before Armageddon, and they desire to show their loving devotion to the Lord and appreciation of His Theocratic Government. More Jbnadabs are responding to the call of service. In addition the Lord sends more laborers into the field, and in June three German pioneers arrived from Switzerland. With this new reinforcement the witness work is now on a more aggressive basis against the enemy. The report shows a big increase in placements, publishers and hours in the field service over that of the last year. The total amount of literature placed during one month (September) alone exceeds over three-fifths of the total placements during the twelve months of last year. This indicates the zeal of the faithful ones for the Kingdom and the Lord’s rich blessings upon their efforts to advance His Kingdom interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In conclusion: The witness work in China has now entered on a new phase. All the faithful workers are determined to fight for the King whom Jehovah has enthroned, and under His immediate command they will joyfully and harmoniously march onward to victory, singing praises to Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark127"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark128"></a>GREECE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The witness work in Greece has been greatly retarded during the year by reason of the opposition of religionists. The total distribution of books and booklets has reached only 45,306, and the phonographs 32. Only 191 publishers have been in the field, and have worked 26,415 hours. It is manifest that the Devil is closing in on God’s people everywhere and that Jehovah is permitting it because his due time to crush the enemy under the heel of Christ the King is near’ at hand. The faithful continue their witness work, singing the praises of Jehovah and his Theocratic Government in the face of cruel opposition. The Society’s servant at Athens, Greece, makes report, and from his report the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Last September was enforced the law requiring the stamping of the literature by the representative of the Greek Church in the Prefecture, and for six months we found great difficulty in circulating the books, but, by the grace of God, His work went on. Last April the law was amended and required that the books be stamped by the editors with the name of religion which the books represented. As we do not represent any religion or heresy we made a stamp in Greek with the words ‘’'Editions of the International Bible Students Association”. This made easier the distribution of the books among the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Department of the Security of the State has issued many and severe orders against the work, especially against the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Protection;</span><span class="font4"> also the Office of Justice has issued an order against us as a nuisance element.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This year we had 106 cases in the courts in all, involving 194 brethren and sisters. Of these eases, 32 were for and 52 against, and 22 are pending. Many brethren were condemned to imprisonment from one month to one year; except the imprisoned were also fined from one to fifty dollars. Some of the brethren were cruelly beaten, and some of them were kept in filthy prisons without cause. Fourteen brethren are under displacement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There were in the field 5 pioneers, three of which have worked only part of the time, because two of them were sick from the hardships, and one is in prison for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Notwithstanding the obstacles from the enemy and the opposition against the work, we all are determined to go on singing the praises of the Most High. We look with joy to the day at which the Lord will vindicate His holy name by the performance of His &quot;strange act” against the enemy. With joy we see the great multitude coming out from Satan's organization and hailing the great King and Vindicator of Jehovah’s name, waving their palms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The work for the Theocratic Government in Albania is directed from the Athens office. Now that country is under the control of Italy. The work during the year has not made great progress, because of the continuous opposition of the religious leaders. Books and booklets were placed in the hands of the people to the number of 5,497. Twenty-three publishers were in the field, and they worked 800 hours. What they have accomplished in outward work has been small, but in spite of this the witness has been given.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">As is well known, the Hawaiian Islands are populated largely by a people who do not speak the English language. Many of the native Hawaiians do speak and read English, however. During the year the work has progressed to some extent in that land, and the workers have been faithful and earnest in pushing forward the witness work for the great Theocracy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Total placement of literature exceeded the previous year by 6,945; number of publishers increased from 18 to 30 (of 1938 publishers, 5 returned to mainland and another passed away; so actual increase in 1939 was 18); hours witnessing increased 3,130; subscriptions increased 215; sound attendance, 7,788; back-calls by 499; phonographs in use by 13; transcription machines by 1; and sound-cars by 1. This is the Lord’s doing, and we joyfully render thanks to Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Rain, heat, mountainous roads and other conditions make the work of the brethren devoting full time real pioneering. A total of six pioneers placed 3,908 books and 13,785 booklets, totaling 17,693 pieces, in 4,143 hours; obtained 274 subscriptions; had sound attendance of 8,354; and made 281 back-calls. This is an increase of pioneer placements of 3,593 over previous year. This does not represent a full year’s work, as one pioneer worked ten months; four worked eight months; and another, only one month.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">There are two company organizations, one at Honolulu, and another at Hilo, Hawaii, with 14 publishers at the first place and 8 at the latter.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sound Attendance increased 7,788 over previous year. One sound-car has been in use on the island of Hawaii, and the other on the islands of Oahu, Molokai, Maui and Hawaii. Lectures in English, Spanish, Japanese, Portuguese, Hawaiian, Hocano and Tagalog have been played. Excerpts from the literature in Visayan have been read over microphone. In one instance two rowboats lashed together ferried the sound-car ashore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Information Marches have been held in Hilo and Honolulu with all brethren participating, except the sick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Meetings to study Valuation began immediately upon its receipt in Honolulu and Hilo, and these are greatly enjoyed. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> studies and service meetings are held; also study meetings in Spanish, Hocano and Japanse languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Subscriptions to the number of 435 were secured during the year, mostly for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> Copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font4">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> distributed were 1,130 and 2,726.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Baptism: 18 persons were immersed during the year. Two of these first attended June 25 lecture sent direct from Madison Square Garden to Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Public by mail ordered 35 books and 62 booklets. Additionally, 31 books and 86 booklets were placed at Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The big meeting of the year was the occasion when “Victory” and “Government and Peace” were sent down to the islands from Madison Square Garden by shortwave. Besides the audience in Kingdom Hall, many heard by shortwave throughout the islands. Telegraph and letter communication came from Hilo; from Pahala, Kau; and from Kapaa, Kauai. There being so few in the islands who have taken their stand for Jehovah, and being so separated from one another, it was of very great encouragement to hear the message of truth going out on such a tremendous scale, and in so forceful a manner despite the enemy’s attack.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The recorded lectures, “Exposed,” “Pace the Pacts,” “Pas-cism or Preedom, ’ ’ and others have been put to good use. Public meetings with these were held at </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom Hall in Honolulu and other places including Hilo, and smaller towns. Many interesting experiences were had in connection with distribution of thousands of-invitations, information marches and use of sound machines to announce the meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation:</span><span class="font4"> The first consignment of 1,040 has already been shipped out from Kingdom Hall at Honolulu, and now beginning on the second shipment of 1,040.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the service meeting the brethren requested their Christian love and greetings be conveyed to you, and to inform you that their desire is to be 100-percent with you in the fight for Jehovah’s Theocratic Government. All join in thanking the Lord through you for the strengthening food being served at the Lord’s table through </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark144"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark145"></a>INDIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Theocratic Government has had advertisement in India during the fiscal year. Although the work in that country is handicapped by many difficulties, the faithful publishers have gone forward with the zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house and have made known that the Theocratic Government is the only hope of humankind. There has been an increase in the work over the previous year, and this in the face of the fact that some of the most efficient workers have been rendered inactive by reason of physical illness. From the report made by the Society’s representative the following is inserted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is with gratitude to Jehovah that I submit my report for the year just closed. The message of the Kingdom has gone forth in India in the face of much suffering on the part of those who bear the brunt of the battle, and the result is an encouraging increase over last year’s general figures. We are united with our brethren and companions in every part of the world acknowledging and proclaiming Jehovah’s name and the establishment of his Theocratic Government, under which we delight to. serve. We have endeavored to do our work faithfully and in strict obedience to the Lord’s command as expressed through his earthly organization, and great has been our joy to have a part in such “strange work’’. As the picture in Joel’s prophecy is now revealed we rejoice to be a part of that great army of “locusts’’, trained and disciplined, each doing his own job as efficiently as he can, going right ahead with the work of announcing the Kingdom and all that it means to distressed humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are only a Small band of soldiers in this land, and when some who are most efficient are taken away from us we feel the gap; but such experiences only make us the more determined to press the battle to the gate of the enemy and win through. During the year two of our most efficient pioneers were stricken down with typhoid fever. One died, and the other recovered only after months of careful nursing on the part of another very efficient pioneer. </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Alm</span><span class="font4">ost all the English pioneers have suffered much loss of time in the field through sickness, hut still they continue bravely on. These things have unavoidably left their mark upon the work accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since the truth was revealed that Jehovah’s Theocratic Government is now in operation, with Christ Jesus directing operations, the work has been conducted strictly in obedience to his organization instructions. There have been just one or two cases of rebellion against the Lord’s way of doing things, but no one weeps for those who choose to go their own way. Where companies are organized they are in full unity with Organization Instructions.</span></p>

</table>
<p><span class="font4">There is thus a decrease in the placement of bound books, due, no doubt, to the loss of time in the field by English pioneers through sickness above referred to. Both English and Vernacular booklets, however, show a substantial increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There has not yet been any appreciable increase in the number of regular publishers in the field, but those who have been active have put in more time. The call to put in sixty hours per month was heeded, and all who properly appreciate the importance of the Kingdom have set themselves to the task of reaching the quota. Not many have succeeded, especially amongst the Indians away in the villages, but the number of hours reported in field service is up by 28 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A comparison reveals that the pioneers, in half the number of hours, placed more literature than the company publishers, thus showing the need for some of the company publishers to improve their efficiency very considerably. Most of these, however, are Indians of very simple village life, and it is not to be expected that they will get the same results as those who have greater advantages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“Watchtower” Campaign</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This campaign last spring really set the ball rolling for sustained activity, and the picture of the march round Jericho forcefully encouraged all of us to go ahead, not merely for one month’s campaign, but continuously. Unfortunately it was just at this time when our most successful pioneers were on the sick list, and results were not up to our expectations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> magazine is published locally in Malayalam. All together there were 228 new subscriptions for the English edition and 60 for the Malayalam, making a total of 281 English and 431 Malayalam subscriptions for the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">World-wide Convention Broadcasts</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the greatest thrills of the year was the privilege of listening in to the world-wide convention broadcasts. A few of us were privileged to sit up, and in the middle of the night join in the convention by hearing the forceful exposure of the Fascist-Hierarchy system from London, and later on, New York. We were not able, however, to pick up the special messages for the Jonadabs on those occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Information Marches</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Bombay city information marches in conjunction with sound-car work have proved to be very effective. The sound-ear is not now permitted freely in the streets of the actual city, but out in the suburbs much publicity is being given. One hour is devoted to a march in the neighborhood of the sound-car, and then the houses in the vicinity visited with the literature immediately afterwards. This has proved to be a more effective means of giving information to prejudiced Catholics than any other means so far employed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Change of Office Premises</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The office premises in Bombay were deemed to be unsuitable for the proper advancement of the Kingdom interests; so, acting upon your authority, new premises were sought during the year. We are now housed in a much more desirable building, and it is hoped that the move will mark a vast increase in the work accomplished in this land. There still seems to be much work to be done; there are millions of people in this land who want peace and who, no doubt, are of good will toward God, but religion is the greatest of all enemies to their progress in the understanding of God and his purposes. It is truly the greatest snare and racket on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Vernacular Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The problem of knowing where to draw the line between the expenditure of time and money on work among the Indian population is still before us. Of the three hundred and fifty million people in India only about six million are known as ' ‘ Christian”, and of that number it is safe to say that five million are on the lowest mental plane. We try to witness to the more educated Indian, whether he professes to be a Christian or not, and we try also to witness to the so-called ‘‘Christians” whether they are able to read or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Travaneore the work has progressed. There are twenty-six companies organized for service, and thirteen additional groups where regular studies are being held and which should soon be participating regularly in field work. There are also seven places where isolated publishers are doing regular work. During the year six service conventions were arranged for these people with programs drawn up on the same lines as those in western countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the Punjab the work is not so extensive, but here there are nineteen places where definite interest is maintained. These people, though, are very simple folk and extremely poor, so that real progress is Slow. Only about 25 percent of them are able to read. There is a Continual fight going on between the missionaries and these villagers. A report just to hand states: “Our last convention has scared the Methodist mission, and they are very busy trying to bring the people under their control so that our activities may be stopped for good. They have started a school building there ...”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Vernacular Recordings</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year a few Speeches were recorded in the vernacular and are doing good work, but tills part of the work is greatly handicapped by reason of the expense involved and the inability of the Indians to provide themselves with phonographs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Vernacular Publications</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The publication of vernacular literature has increased considerably during the year. There is a growing demand from other branches for literature in Indian languages to cater for Indians resident abroad. To handle this work efficiently involves a good deal of expense, for we are not able, as yet, to do our own printing. The greatest obstacle is the fact that each language requires a different alphabet, and the difficulty of finding men and the cost of equipment to handle all these various languages is enormous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Booklets in seven languages have been published during the year, to wit: Bengali, Gujerati, Gurmukhi, Malayalam, Sinhalese, Tamil, and Urdu. The total number printed is 99,500, of which over 30,000 were dispatched to foreign branches. The book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> in Tamil is now being prepared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Ceylon</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The work in Ceylon has made little progress during the year. One English pioneer there has been unable, owing to sickness, to work at all for the last nine months. There are two or three publishers in Ceylon who are doing what they can to give a faithful witness, but, owing to the circumstances they are in, the work has been irregular. There is scope for much work in Ceylon, but the laborers are very few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As I write this report the war between the nations of Europe has begun. We know not how it may affect us here, but our determination is to allow nothing to interfere with our loyal and faithful service to the King of kings. We are with you, Brother JButherford, fighting shoulder to shoulder for the honor of Jehovah’s name, and we thank Jehovah for this marvelous privilege. By His grace we will go right ahead through the coming year, and as long as the Lord requires us, to sing forth the praise which alone .belongs to Him.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark146"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark147"></a>JAMAICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">It appears that in every country where the gospel of the Kingdom is preached the opposition increases together with other difficulties that beset the Lord’s people. Such requires greater determination on the part of the publishers to go forward in the work which the Lord has assigned to them, and, having full faith and confidence in the great Theoerat and his King, they are doing this work with gladness. Jamaica is a small country and its people are poor and work under much difficulty, but the message of the kingdom of God goes to them and many of the common people receive it gladly. The opposition of the clergy has not deterred them in hearing the message. During the year an American brother was sent to Jamaica to take charge of the work at Kingston, and he has put forth his best endeavors together with the local brethren to give a faithful witness to the Kingdom. From his report the following is extracted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Amid the many adverse conditions during the past year the work has gone forward to the end indicated by the report, which appears to be fair when taking into consideration labor troubles, “black spot” and tree blight in many sections, and now the war, which may have an ill effect; but in the end it will doubtless mean the opening the eyes of many to the real import of the Kingdom message and the conflict yet ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now with much to do and prospects bright for greater opportunities—more work in the field among the companies and in the office—the days are too short and too few of them in a month to accomplish the desired results. The month of September compares favorably with August, even though short.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So far, the opposition has been local, and very few have had the courage to come out in the open and oppose the truth. They have concealed their identity and endeavored to fight through the newspapers. Such attacks tend only to advertise the message to those who are really seeking to know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Jonadabs are coming in, as it has been stated. The number in the field service has steadily increased about 30 percent over the number of publishers at the be</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">ginnin</span><span class="font4">g of the year. The back-call work is steadily increasing, and very effective in holding the interest aroused by the house-to-house witnessing, public lectures and sound-cars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The zone work, though in its infancy, is proving to be a wonderful help to the companies, and its service cannot be overestimated for good. The zone meetings are very profitable in that they have all of the good effects of a convention without the expenditure of a vast amount of money in travel on the part of the brethren. It brings them face to face with the local responsibilities among those at their door and near-by neighbors, who may be visited by the strangers in attendance, doing a work that the brethren cannot do in their immediate neighborhood in breaking down prejudices that have been engendered by false conceptions. Whenever possible, arrangements are made to have a sound-car in attendance at these meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But few of the brethren are unencumbered so as to give full time to the work as pioneers. Therefore the zones are not completely supplied with servants. There are but four pioneer-zone servants who are capable of doing that work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year the books and booklets placed in the hands of the people totaled 89,851. Pioneers and company workers to the number of 674 were in the field and worked 102,056 hours. New subscriptions for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> were 318. Phonographs and transcription machines to the number of 156 were used, at which meetings the attendance totaled 311,481. Back-calls were made to the number of 7,777.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark148"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark149"></a>JAPAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">During the first part of the year the brethren in Japan were very active. Information was received at Brooklyn recently that all the workers had been arrested and were in prison, and for this reason we are unable to make report for this year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark150"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark151"></a>MEXICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The message of the Theocratic Government has been proclaimed in Mexico during the year, and those learning of the blessings of the Kingdom have turned their faces toward that righteous government and the great multitude is being gathered there. There has been an increase over the work of previous years. The total distribution of books and booklets during the year was 448,385. In addition to this, copies of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> to the number of 19,000, and of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> to the number of 17,000, were placed in the hands of the people. Phonographs and transcription machines to the number of 193 have been employed. The workers have zealously put forth their best endeavors to proclaim the name of Jehovah and his King in that land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society^ representative makes report, from which the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In short we can say that it was a happy and busy year. Certainly something is going on in regard to inaugurating Theocratic Rule on earth! Ours, though a small unit, is no exception, so we also did have a substantial increase in results. Eagerly and joyfully we are expecting the president’s report, for we feel that by it all the consecrated will perceive the Lord’s doings towards the increase of his kingdom on earth. It appears to us that, at least here in Mexico, the advance has been rather slow, as it were, just holding our ground and a bit more. But, in the year just past, daily a new feature of work was put into operation, and in all directions steps were taken to lay the foundations of the new earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Local Branch Headquarters</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our cry from the very beginning of the year was: ‘ The place is too strait for us; give place to us’ (Isaiah 49: 20), and mercifully the Lord, through his earthly agency, answered our cry to his glory and to our heart’s content. We are using now the entire building at Melchor Ocampo 71 for the Lord’s work. Some changes were made so as to fit it more fully to the work, and that naturally took some time. But now we are able to work more contentedly and efficiently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Printing Room</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But one of the greatest sources for our joy, and something that enables us to increase our output and efficiency, is the Chandler press and printing equipment that the Society sent to us. Up to now we were at the mercy of commercial printers of Catholic belief, running the risk of informing the Hierarchy of our every move. And that would not do now. So we pleaded with Brother Rutherford, who, always alert for the advancement of the Lord’s work, and always ready to co-operate with zeal and sincere and proved effort, had a press and other material sent. Surely the Society has spent plenty this fiscal year in connection with Mexican work, but all for the good of the work and to carry it on more economically in the future. Local contributions were higher than in any previous year, and contributions for literature, too, but these shrank a great deal on account of high exchange; we have not raised our rates of contribution for literature even though everything has gone up with the dollar, and now that the dollar came down, things remained up. Typical big business way, to oppress the poor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound-Cars</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For years we were hopeful of using sound-ears in connection with the work in Mexico. This fiscal year our vision became a reality, for, as far as now, we have in service two sound-cars, with more to come. Local contribution enabled us to purchase these used cars; the equipment for sound was brought from the States; for one car it was donated by a Jonadab in the States; for other cars, was sent by the Society. Sound-cars enable us to make more people listen to the message, and plenty of small literature goes out this way. Of course, a lot of fixing and reconditioning was done on the cars, and we were also busy preparing operators and at least one licensed chauffeur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Efficient Help</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord has provided good and efficient help, some being so thoroughly awake to their privileges that they are constantly busy and we have to watch them not to overdo it. In other words, we have to “stop them from working” rather than to make them work. We do feel “on duty” at all times, our first consideration being to serve eagerly and earnestly our Eternal King. The capacity for learning on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses and companions is really amazing. Undoubtedly the reason is that they aim at pleasing the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NORTHERN EUROPE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A keener appreciation of the great Theocratic Government has stirred the faithful servants of God to greater zeal. In every part of the earth this has been marked, and Northern Europe is no exception. The countries of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Baltic sea States, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and the far-away country of Iceland have done their part amidst great difficulties. The opposition along the Baltic has been greater than elsewhere, and it has been very difficult for the brethren to do much if anything in that part of the field. The activities of the radical Nazis have greatly frightened the people in the European countries, and this has caused many of them to give heed to the message of Jehovah’s kingdom and to learn that it is the only hope for peace and life. The work in these countries is directed from the Northern European office, situated at Copenhagen, Denmark, and it will be seen by examination of the report that the work in that section'd the earth has increased. The total distribution or placement in the hands of the people of books and booklets during the year was, to wit, 2,617,242.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The branch servant directing the work from Copenhagen makes a report, from which the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By the favor of Jehovah it is once more my privilege to send you a report concerning the progress of the Kingdom work in Northern Europe, and it has many encouraging features. &quot;The war which threatened last September is now. here, and it has certainly predisposed more people to listen to our message. Even people who will not accept it believe we have inside information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Important Happenings</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord knew that 1938-39 would be a year of strenuous activity, so he fed us on the finest of the wheat. The “Drama of Vindication” was specially enjoyed, and at the three main service assemblies in Sweden, Denmark and Finland the points thereof were dealt -with in six half-hour talks at each place. These, in each country, were the biggest and best conventions ever held there and were attended respectively by &lt;356, 925, and 750, while 21,733 pieces of literature were placed. It was wonderful to see the many new, young faces, and exceedingly encouraging to all who were present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then, by shortwave radio, many in Northern Europe had the joy of attending New York Convention and hearing the thrilling discourses on “Victory” and “Government and Peace”, together with the announcement of the new book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.</span><span class="font4"> The reception was the finest we have ever had, and the second discourse came through beautifully despite the caterwauling of the Boman Catholics. Their only effect was to improve and emphasize the delivery. Both discourses were “meat in due season” to the army Of the Lord of hosts. It was a wonderful privilege to be present and to note the enthusiasm of the Lord *8 people in that great assembly and how He overruled the interruption to bis praise. All in all, it has been the most wonderful year in the church’s history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Army Strengthened</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year 630 came forward and symbolized their consecration to do the will of God and thereafter took their place in the ranks. It is easy to see, therefore, how Jehovah rejuvenates and strengthens his army in the field. He thus enables them to continue doing “exploits” and to remain in condition to carry the battle to the gate, even after such a year of campaigns as we had never had before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Year’s Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year 656,521 hours were used for the work, as against 530,852 last year, and, even if the part ‘<sup>1</sup> way ’ ’ were eliminated, there would still be an increase. This is well reflected in our results; for, while we spread 1,961,251 books and booklets last year, we now increased this by 33 percent, to 2,617,242. True, we had 141,667 books last year, to compare with 129,162 this year, but the drop is explained by the terrific campaigns with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Facts</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism,</span><span class="font4"> the messages of the hour, which were as hail upon the enemy and gave us our large increase. Then we had a grand </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign, which increased our subscriptions by 4,369, to 10,625, so that, if we add all the copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> included in subscriptions and spread singly, we reach the amazing total of 4,135,201, which practically gives on average something to every family in Northern Europe and the clergy much to think about. It is the Lord’s doing, and marvelous in our eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Gramophone Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year over 700 new gramophones were sent out, so that we have now 2,204 in use, and the demand is increasing. There were given 325,645 lectures, to an audience of 534,762, which is equivalent to 534 public meetings with an attendance of 1,000 each. Then too, when an assembly is held in one of the zones, considerable interest is aroused in the chosen center when people see scores of brethren go out with their gramophones. Said one man to another recently in northern Sweden, as a brother passed by with his gramophone, &quot;Why these people who go round and play gramophones to people, they are really doing something.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Zone Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The dividing of the country into zones has been a great help in the orderly furtherance of the work, and this is reflected in the increased results attained. The old idea of pilgrims going around to the companies and delivering talks is now dead, and instead the zone servants see that the organization functions properly in all its details. Additionally they preach by example, which is better than precept, and lead the brethren into the field. Every district is now properly divided up and mapped, and all companies of any size have their full complement of servants. The reports by the zone servants after each visit are very useful, because the office is kept in close touch with the field. In other words, all the bolts and nuts of the organization have been tightened up, and without a doubt we see before our eyes the fulfillment of the prophecy, &quot;For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron: I will also make thy officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness. Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.” Here and there elements which did not belong have quietly faded away, and the people of God are united as never before in carrying out the commands of their Lord and Head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Worker*</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Northern Europe the number of workers has increased. The highest number out in any one month has been 3,871, in April. However, in the great 4-month </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign, from January 1 to April 30, our highest number in the period was 3,913. They worked 244,360 hours and spread 31,114 books and 1,177,522 booklets, and took 3,377 new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions and 19,914 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions, besides spreading 97,694 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> copies—a grand total of 1,329,621.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Prior to this campaign we had never imagined it possible to secure </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions in door-to-door work, but the Lord is in charge of his organization and is continually giving us delightful surprises if we but obey the instructions we receive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the whole year the companies spread 1,877,119 books and booklets, the pioneers 725,465, while 14,658 were sent from the offices. We have at the moment some 220 pioneers in the service, and often their presence in company districts has been encouraging for the friends. Prom their ranks we have drawn zone servants and company servants. The pioneer ranks have thus contributed in double measure to the improved results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“Consolation”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This magazine has been somewhat neglected, as compared with last year, when we had a special </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> campaign; but it is lively and its own momentum gave us an increase of 1,500 subscriptions, bringing our total up to 78,265. It is remarkable how, in the Lord’s providence, it fits in so well with the book work. Owing to the increase in the number of publishers, many town districts are gone over more frequently, but now and again a push with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> makes the territory entirely new once more. It must be remarked, too, that the gramophone work tends to enlarge the district; for it cannot be covered so quickly with gramophones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Again and again it has been proved how very fruitful back-calls are in helping the great multitude to take their stand on the side of Jehovah. Their questions are then answered and their difficulties disposed of, and they are shown how to profitably study a book and make use of its index and then to attend the book studies and the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> studies. Last year 102,826 back-calls were made, and this compares well with 28,146 from May, 1938—when a record began to be kept—until September. The brethren are appreciating this phase of the work more and more and all the rich and varied opportunities of service which it offers. It is indeed a real joy to see the people of good will subscribing for the magazines, getting the books and finally taking their stand for Jehovah and against the Devil and sharing in the “strange work’’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The new method of studying </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> has proved to be very profitable for those rightly exercised. Brethren who read the articles carefully and prepare questions have a clearer grasp of their contents, and gradually more and more of the brethren are appreciating this fact and contributing their share to the common weal. Studies are now finished in one hour, and so valuable time is caved; for the work meetings are usually held at the close of the studies. This leaves more evenings free for the service work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Additionally, in Northern Europe there have been held 2,954 meetings for interested, attended by 36,120, though that number included some friends also. Gradually as the interested ones increase in knowledge they find their way to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Three hundred of these were held in Scandinavia and Finland, attended by 38,069. There has been a considerable demand for these, and doubtless it will increase as we approach more nearly to Armageddon. Our past work begins to bear fruit, and people are dimly realizing that God has a people with a message vital to their eternal welfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Assemblies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In addition to the tour main conventions in Scandinavia and Finland there have been assemblies in the various zones to the number of 97, attended by 7,691, and these have served, in many instances, to popularize the use of the gramophone. Additionally the new method of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study has been used, and the various features of the work explained and emphasized, so that all the Eord’s people receive guidance and instruction as directed by His organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The War</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the whole year in Scandinavia and Finland the work has made uninterrupted progress, and the war, so far, has but given a fillip to it. True, there are restrictions for foreigners traveling, and rationing of food, electricity and gas now obtains, but, otherwise, we have full freedom, and, as will be seen from the Danish report, the Authorities ignored the Boman Catholic complaint as to our “blasphemy”. In the Baltic States, however, conditions have become worse. Some of the literature is forbidden in Estonia, and officially the work is stopped in Latvia and Lithuania. In March Hitler seized Memelland in Lithuania, where most of our workers were, and we are practically cut ofi: from communicating with them. Now there is great tension in all three Baltic States, for the Bussian bear has seized half of Poland and has his paws on Estonia; so it is, perhaps, but a matter of time before all Bussia’s old boundaries are restored. This may make it very difficult for our branch Servants there and end in the complete stoppage of the work, or, in the Lord’s providence, it may mean the possibility of a witness in Russia. The Lord will surely guide and direct through his organization as He has promised. “I will instruct thee, and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark152"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark153"></a>DENMARK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The countries afore-mentioned make separate reports, and many items of interest in these various countries are brought to the attention of other workers. There is a comparatively small force of publishers at the Society’s office in Denmark, who put forth their best endeavors to publish the Kingdom message. From the report of the servant in charge of the work in that place the following is taken:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The outstanding feature of the year was the spreading by the hundred thousand of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom,</span><span class="font4"> with the stirring messages directed of the Lord. Not so many bound books went out, viz., 18,770, as against 22,501, but our booklets jumped from 486,592 to 667,818. If we include copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font4"> our grand total was well over a million. We used 163,333 hours, against 129,380, which is an increase, even after allowing for part of the &quot;way” from May to September. Our average number of workers out week by week jumped from 524 to 642, or, if the monthly figure be taken, from 904 to 1,032. This is due to the fact that new workers came along. No less than 166 symbolized their consecration during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign resulted in 1,392 new subscriptions taken in Norway and Denmark; for the Danish </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">serves both countries. So now we have 1,245 subscriptions in Norway and 2,400 in Denmark, a total of 3,645.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Danish Press and the Truth</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The press in Denmark and indeed in Scandinavia is freer than in most countries; and under the heading, ‘ ‘ Gramophone Preachers at the Doors in Aarhus. Jehovah’s witnesses Hold Their Danish Convention with 1000 Delegates,” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jyllandsposten, </span><span class="font4">the largest paper outside Copenhagen, gave us a really good write-up. It appeared on Saturday morning, and our convention began in the evening and continued on Sunday and Monday. It was held in Aarhus this year, to give the friends in Jutland an opportunity of attending. In the write-up attention was clearly called to various doctrinal points such as “Where are the dead?” “the soul,” and “hell”, besides calling attention to the difference between religion and Christianity and to the coming settlement between God and the Devil in Armageddon. In part, they wrote as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The president is the well-known radio speaker and author, Judge Rutherford, and he calls attention to the fact that Armageddon is near at hand. Only a small number of people—witnesses for Jehovah—will be saved from the great slaughter, because they are God’s chosen people, just as Noah and his family were saved at the flood. That is why Jehovah’s witnesses go from door to door to gather men of good will and to warn the people of the coming day of reckoning.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The largest attendance was 925; so doubtless there were about 1,000 people in all at the convention. Some were prevented from coming, but 144 in all symbolized on this occasion, and this was mentioned in the radio news review and in various papers throughout the country. There were 203 gramophones in use, and 616 brethren were in the field and spread 5,776 pieces of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Gramophone Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year an average of four new gramophones a week were manufactured and sent out, and at the year-end we had orders for 50 more. In all 600 gramophones are now in use in this small country, and during the year 66,256 lectures were given, to an audience of 71,276. As an example of the interest which the brethren have in this new weapon, a little assembly at Holbaek may be cited. There were 55 in the field, and 52 had their gramophones with them, and in 188 hours 282 lectures were given, to an audience of 354, while 22 books, 571 booklets, a subscription, and 95 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> were left with the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many are the encouraging letters we receive testifying to the great help the gramophone affords in the work and to the good results attained by its use. Recently a sister wrote that a clergyman, after taking a burial service, wrote and asked her to call again and play once more “Where Are the Dead?” He had had some difficulty in giving his talk at the burial, so the truth gives pause even to such men, who are steeped in error. It is clear and satisfying, like a draught of spring water on a warm day. The following letter is typical of many, and its poignant ending refers to a German brother who, in the middle of September, was shot, because he refused to be a soldier. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Herewith I send you the month’s report. We had a grand final push for the close of our work year. On Sunday we hired a bus to Juelsminde and surrounding district, and it was just like a real gramophone assembly. The results were as follows: 26 in the field, 24 gramophones, 48 books, 356 booklets, 5 subscriptions and 22 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> copies. 152 lectures, with 225 listeners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Our thoughts were with our German brethren, and it was with a mixture of deep sorrow and quiet joy we heard of the brother (August Dieekmann) who was shot. We rejoiced over his victory; for is it not written: ‘Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life’?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">New York Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">About one hundred friends in Denmark, at over 20 places, listened in to the discourses on “Victory” and “Government and Peace”, and so they were one and all in a position to recognize the falsity of the news printed in the Danish Press under the following caption:'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Jehovah’s witnesses in a Free Fight</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“During a fight at a congress of Jehovah’s witnesses fifty people were wounded. There were 18,000 present, and the fight was caused by an attack made on the well-known radio priest Coughlin. Numerous arrests were made.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Clippings from twenty different papers were sent us, and we at once sent the following correction, which was printed by six, including </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Jyllandsposten:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“By reason of some misunderstanding you give in your issue of the 27th incorrect information about a fight that is said to have taken place during a public discourse at a congress of Jehovah’s witnesses on the 25th. I listened personally to the whole lecture, which came clearly over a short-wave set, and radio priest Coughlin’s name wasn’t mentioned once by Judge Rutherford. I shall be glad, therefore, if you will be good enough to insert a correction in your paper.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Norway, Sweden, Finland and Estonia Coughlin’s name was omitted from the notification, and one might have assumed there was a free fight among Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Without a doubt the Roman Catholic Hierarchy had seen to it that these false and tendentious cables were sent out over Europe so as to bring reproach upon the name of Jehovah and his witnesses, but the recorded speech absolutely disproves their wicked assertions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“Consolation”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This magazine has just about kept its position; for, despite the big booklet and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> campaigns, we have lost only some 200 subscribers. During the year, and including single copies and subscriptions, some 240,000 copies went out to the people and caused the Roman Catholics pain while helping rightthinking people to see the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethel Family</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year our little Bethel family of 14 have placed 17,668 pieces of literature, to compare with 15,098 in 1937-38 and 12,091 in 1936-37. We have experienced in the last month that the war has quickened people’s interest in the truth and that now they are more ready to hear. As one naturalized Danish lady (previously German) remarked, “You’d be surprised to find how many people are talking about you and the message contained in your books.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, it is one thing to talk, and another thing to take a stand for the truth. We shall do our best to deliver the warning from Jehovah, so that their blood shall not be upon our heads. Latterly many of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Light</span><span class="font4"> books have gone out, so that by the time </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> is ready we shall have place for it on our shelves. Many are interested by the explanation as to the number of the beast and as to the head “wounded unto death” and healed again, while all right-thinking people rejoice in the promised fulfillment of Revelation 21, “and at such a time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bethel family unite with me in sending you our warm love in the Lord and in praying his continued guidance of all your labors to the praise of his name and for the good of his people.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark154"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark155"></a>ESTONIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord’s people in every part of the earth are one, and their desire to serve Jehovah and his King is the same everywhere. Those who are working under a handicap and stress have it harder than some in other parts of the earth, but the Lord makes it up to them in the joy that he gives them, all being good soldiers under adverse conditions. In Estonia the opposition is very great, and now, since the coming of the war in that part of the earth, it may mean the early cessation of the work in that part of the field. The Society’s local servant reports to this ofSce as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions in Estonia realize the joy of the Lord, and he has blessed their united effort to serve the Theocracy during the past year. The records made during that period show an increase in the work done over that accomplished a year ago. This year 44,188 books and booklets wore dispatched from the depot. This is 9,451 more than were sent out in 1938. A year ago 35,211 books and booklets were distributed, whereas this year the number spread is 42,615.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because there are so few friends at any one place, no companies organized for service exist. Efforts are being made to gather the interested ones in the towns, and a pioneer brother is looking.after a few in the city of Tartu. Since the month of April he has spent 84 hours and has traveled about 900 miles in connection with this work. There are twenty-seven company workers, and they have placed 8,316 books and booklets with the people. Pioneers spread about ninety percent of the books, and in 11,621 hours an average of eight of them distributed 34,050 books and booklets. The total number of publishers taking part in the work was thirty-six, as against thirty the previous year. Of this number nine were pioneers. The average number of publishers out each week was thirteen. They spent a total of 14,810 hours in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Throughout the year an endeavor was made to obtain more subscribers for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span><span class="font4"> The effort made has been rewarded, and twenty-eight new subscriptions were got. To help toward the attainment of this result 639 sample copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> in different languages were distributed free, and 354 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> were likewise spread to persons who manifested some interest. Copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> to the number of 2,132, and 851 copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font4"> were spread. Compared with last year’s figures, this is an increase in the number of journals distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The pioneers, who work in the rurals during most of the year, find it difficult to make effective back-calls. However, they reported as having made 138, while other publishers reported 93. At most of these back-calls literature of some kind has been placed, and a few of the ‘<sup>1</sup> strangers ’ ’ have given evidence that they consider themselves to be Jonadabs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As reported last year, many up-to-date booklets and the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hiches</span><span class="font4"> were confiscated by the police. Since then it has been hoped that the ban placed on that literature might be removed and that the property would be returned. So far, this hope has not been realized. In the meantime a translation of the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font4"> was made and 23,000 copies have been spread since January, this year. At present the only literature in Estonian in stock consists of the booklets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Home and Happiness</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts.</span><span class="font4"> A reprint of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font4"> from Berne is on the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No public meetings have been held during the year, but a few friends have come together to read and learn the meaning of the prophecies now due to be understood. To instruct and guide the brethren concerning the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom interests the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> has been sent out each month, and a total of 600 copies were dispatched. The number of letters received during the year is 261; and the number dispatched, 328. One convention was held, at which three brethren were immersed. More time than hitherto was spent in taking the Kingdom message to the people, with whom 712 books and booklets were left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With this brief report on the Kingdom interests in Estonia, I send the love of the brethren here.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark156"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark157"></a>FINLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Publishers and supporters of the Theocratic Government in Finland have been active during the year just closed. The Lord has blessed their efforts, and they have advertised the Kingdom by placing in the hands of the people a decided increase of books and booklets over the year previous. The total distribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">during the year has been 615,632. The workers in the field have numbered 865, and these have worked 159,931 hours. Phonographs in use with sound machines totaled 469, and at these reproduced lectures 195,512 people have heard. Baek-calls have numbered 19,398. The following is extracted from the report of the Society’s local servant at Helsingfors:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By the Lord’s marvelous grace it is once more my privilege to send you the report of the work done in Finland during the just finished year. Notwithstanding the many great difficulties by which the great enemy has tried to fight against our work, it has pleased our dear Lord to bless our efforts so that the literature has gone out in greater amount than ever before, and we are very grateful as we see that we have still the grand opportunity to ‘ ‘ shew forth the praises of him who hath called [us] out of darkness into his marvellous light”. And how wonderful is that light! One is amazed in reading the dear </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and seeing the grandeur of the fulfillment of the prophecies. And how grateful we are for the privilege to take part in blowing of the antitypical trumpet! And it shall certainly be a great joy for us to take part in the ‘shouting’ when the time has come for the Lord to throw down the “walls”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The work with the sound machines has considerably increased, and a very powerful witnessing has been done in our country. From the interesting campaign I can mention some instances. One brother writes: “Jehovah knows that our company had not a sound-car. It is doubtful if we shall have it before Armageddon. For that reason he has blessed our company with more than usually strong rowers, and boats, and provided us with a territory very rich in lakes. We hope that you have had the joy to hear and experience how incomparable a place a lake is for presenting the record lectures. Here in the no man’s land our loudspeaker has been able to work with its full capacity. Those on shore have naturally been in their best tune: when the sun is shining and the airbaths calm the nerves. We can be happy and grateful as Jehovah has favored his people with such matchless lectures as are, e.g., “Value of Knowledge” and “Safety”. When some of our brothers came back from a witnessing trip to country, they had an opportunity to present lectures on the steamer with their loudspeaker. That aggravated some, who said so: “I came here to the finest steamer on this lake in order to admire the nature and enjoy the silence, but now the Jehovah’s witnesses are allowed with the consent of the captain to present during the whole journey lectures with their loudspeaker.” Yes, it was so, but not only did the captain give his permission to present the lectures, but he still offered a dinner to these “noise-makers”. Then still some words how some this time are to<sup>r</sup>mented in the presence of the Lamb and his holy angels. Their woe-cries are rising in following way: &quot;At home we have no peace; Jehovah’s witnesses are ringing the bell. We go in parks, but even there the witnesses are with their books. Now we seek outlying swimming places and sandshores, but immediately we are followed by the same witnesses with theii loudspeakers.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The summer has been exceptionally hot, and there have been great difficulties to find people in their homes, so the sound work has been a great help. Yet the enemy has been very angry, and some of the worst opponents have tried by stoning and in other ways to hurt our brethren. They have also tried to upset the boat, where our brethren have been with the sound machine. On one occasion, when the enemies on the shore made a plot to upset the boat and break the loudspeaker, other people said: &quot;Let us now see if their Jehovah can protect them.’’ But when they came, our brethren were very courageous and with the loudspeaker they gave a solemn warning, and a fear fell upon the attackers and they were not able to hurt our brethren. It caused only a still greater interest among the listeners on the shore, where about 10,000 were present according to the information in the newspapers. Yet in our report we calculated only that little part which could be seen from the boat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have used the sound machines also at burials with a very good result. Yet the clergy have been very annoyed trying to oppose us. A brother who arranged such an occasion was just called before the criminal police, accused by a clergyman. He had an opportunity to present before his examiners the same records that he used at the burial, and they showed a keen interest in the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There has been a nice increase in the sound work, compared with last year. The whole number of gramophones sent out from the office is now 469. The number of played lectures is 93,915 (last year 12,626), and the whole attendance this year has been 195,512 (last year 151,879).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There have been no new books this year, but the new booklets in connection with the great periods have caused an exceptional interest. Last year we had the privilege to spread so many books and booklets that we could not dream it possible to surpass it; but it has pleased our dear Lord to bless our efforts in a very marked way. We have-not been able to spread so many big books as last year, when we had two new books and spread 31,706, as against 27,187 this year, but in the booklets we have had the joy to spread 144,032 more than last year, and the whole amount spread, books and booklets, has gone up from 476,119 to 615,632; and if we take our magazines, we come to 1,055,676, which means about 1J copies for every family in our country, as we have about 750,000 families. The great output of the booklets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Facts </span><span class="font4">and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism</span><span class="font4"> was very annoying for the enemy, and he tried to stop our spreading of the literature. A policeman caught one of our zone servants, and he was accused of breaking the peddling law. If they now had succeeded to punish him, our whole work had come in great difficulties; but it pleased the Lord to help us and our brother was sentenced free, and so we could with joy continue the work of spreading out literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Zone Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The new arrangement has proved to be a great blessing, although we have felt what Jesus said: &quot;The harvest truly is great, but the laborers are few.” It has been difficult to get a servant for every zone, but we have tried to do our best, and the work in bigger classes has progressed well. So in our biggest class, which is in Helsinki, almost all the figures have gone upward: workers, from 180 to 205; back-calls, from 556 (last year only six months were reported) to 5,138; books and booklets, from 92,216 to 130,498; subscriptions, from 3,692 to 4,102; copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation,</span><span class="font4"> from 22,025 to 23,839; gramophones, from 39 to 66; lectures, from 6,807 to 10,619; and attendance, from 13,079 to 33,982. Only in big books and covered booklets the figures are little less than for the previous year. The spread literature was so great that it covered almost every person in our city. As we now will get the zone work better served, we hope the work shall be still more effective next year. We hope also that the new Organization rules with the new servant for advertising shall be a great help for the friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Publishers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The number of publishers has increased, as well as of pioneers. A good lot of young people have gone out as whole-time workers, and certainly the great multitude must soon come out to the full number which shall be saved. That was also well manifested at our last main convention here in Helsinki, which convention was a wonderful feast prepared by the Lord in the presence of our enemies. At the end of the convention, when our hearts were burning of gratitude and zeal to promote the Kingdom interests, all joined in sending our warmest love and greetings to you. Although a good lot of friends were not able to come to the convention, as the influence of the great war hindered many motorcars with which the friends should come, yet the number of publishers was the biggest we ever have had at any convention in- Finland, and, compared with the circumstances, the result was also very encouraging. The whole amount of spread literature was 10,754, of which 688 were big books. Last year at all conventions in Finland were baptized 59. This year the number is 172, which clearly shows how the great multitude is now coming into the Lord’s fold. It is indeed a great joy to see how the prophecy is fulfilled when the Lord’s time has come. It is also for us a great encouragement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Printery</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are very grateful to you as you gave us the permission to procure a new printing press for our smaller-size printing stuff. Although we have had it only a month, it has been a great help, especially as our printing has increased considerably this year. We have had the joy to print four covered booklets, a new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Song Boole</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font4"> for Sweden and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font4"> for Finland, besides our ordinary printing. The whole amount printed during this year in our printery is 876,608, which means an increase of 150,132 from the previous year. We are very grateful to the Lord for this provision, as it means a considerable saving and is a great help to care for the Kingdom interests. It has also been a great joy for us to see how the friends have helped with donations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Bethel Family</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Although the office work has considerably increased and last year we already thought not to be able to do more, yet, by the Lord’s great grace, it has still been possible for office members to do more service work than the year before. So our little company of 16 have used 5,056 hours instead of 3,777 last year. As the biggest time has gone to spread booklets, the big books are little down and were 1,947, against 2,195 last year; and also loose copies of our magazines have gone down from 2,447 to 2,014, but the increase of booklets has gone considerably upward, from 20,123 to 31,793, and also the subscriptions have gone a little upward, from 598 to 678. We are very grateful to the great Giver of all good gifts, who has given us the wonderful privilege to serve him with all our forces and time. It is a favor that can’t be overestimated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this connection we desire to express our gratitude to Jehovah for all his loving care during the past year, and our determination is to do whatever we can to magnify his great name. We are also very grateful to you, dear Brother Rutherford, for all that you have done to our encouragement. And daily remembering you before the throne of grace, the whole f</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">ami</span><span class="font4">ly here joins in sending you our warm love and best wishes for the new beginning year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark158"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark159"></a>ICELAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">In that bleak country of only 40,000 square miles, the inhabitants of which are less than three to the mile and live mainly around the coast, one lone pioneer during the year has placed in the hands of the people books and booklets to the number of 1,761. 1,073 persons listened to the reproduction of the lectures by the phonograph. The way is rough and rugged, but the one doing the work pushes on with joy, knowing that the day of deliverance is near at hand.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark160"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark161"></a>LATVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The religionists and Nazis, acting together, make it almost impossible to give a witness in the country of Latvia. A report has been received from the Society’s local representative in that land, unsigned because of the opposition in the censorship, and that report is inserted below:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is again my privilege to submit to you the annual report of the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses in Latvia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During the year just ended, there has been no outstanding change in the conditions under which the work is carried on in this country. In previous reports some facts have been submitted which would make you familiar with the restrictions which retard advance and prevent here the introduction of the latest means of advertising the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Notwithstanding, efforts are made to ensure that the latest publications of the Society are made available to as many of those who desire to have them as can be reached. In view of the disabilities already referred to, however, we are not able to gather the interested together, except to a very limited extent. The enemy is constantly on the alert and publishers are frequently threatened while engaged in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In February, through the action of an informer, hectographed copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> and the time of a forthcoming meeting, came into the possession of the Ecclesiastical Department of the Home Office. They, in turn, advised the police, who made their appearance in force shortly after the meeting began. Protocols were made out against everyone present, and inquiries continued for eleven weeks. In the end, heavy fines were imposed upon those members of the executive of the old Society who were present, and the rest were cautioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Against this negative action, we got real thrills on June 24 and 25, when we heard the two speeches given in New York at the convention. A telegram was sent saying reception was perfect. This was hardly an exaggeration; for, to have heard so well as we did here, one would need to have sat in a very favorable place in the Hall. We were only a handful, and some could not understand the language, but they were equally thrilled with those who could. We heard the rage of the enemy and rejoiced that this had no effect upon the message, unless it were to intensify it. At the conclusion we all joined in the “Aye” which came over the air from the Hall. There is no question, these world-wide broadcasts are great events and make a deep impression upon all who have the privilege to hear them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A short time ago copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font4"> were received, and it is hoped that shortly this may be made available for distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The outbreak of war at the beginning of this month is causing much anxiety in this country, in view of the close proximity of the war area, the strength of the nations involved, and the demands that are expected to be made upon their weaker neighbors. We may not know what the immediate results of this war will be, but we do know that it will mean a further weakening of Satan’s organization and will bring a step nearer the final overthrow of that wicked arrangement and the full establishment of the Kingdom, for which we have prayed, “Thy </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font4">gdom come.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The friends here unite with me in sending you their warm love.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark162"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark163"></a>LITHUANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s servants throughout the earth are deeply interested in their brethren in districts where it is practically impossible to give a real witness. In such countries as Lithuania literature can be placed in the hands of the people under very restricted conditions, and because of censorship it is almost impossible to get information from one district to another. Satan is using his power through his religious and other representatives to keep the people in the dark, but those who love Jehovah and his Theocratic Government rejoice to know that the day of deliverance is at hand. From the Society’s local representative in Lithuania the following report was received:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Events have followed one another with such rapidity that at one time it seemed unlikely that it would be possible to send a report from Lithuania this year. At the time of writing, Poland, Lithuania’s neighbor to the south, has fallen to the Russians and Germans, and a feeling of uncertainty exists in the three Baltic states. British subjects have been advised to leave, but it would appear that such advice is more of a precautionary measure than a matter of urgency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Last year the report from this country included the work of publishers in the district known as Memelland, where a measure of freedom was enjoyed, although there was much opposition by the agents of Nazi Germany as well as by the misguided dupes of religion. Since the occupation by Germany in March, no reports are to hand from that region and very little news has been received concerning the Lord’s people there. It is to be expected that many have suffered at the hands of those in</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">power, even as their brethren in Germany have suffered do suffer, even unto death, for their faithfulness to Jehovah and his King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The report for the past year, therefore, shows a considerable reduction in the output of literature, as the Memel district accounted for the greater portion of books spread as well as for subscriptions for the journals. In addition, conditions in Lithuania are even more difficult than they were a year ago, so that it is only with the greatest difficulty that the message is delivered. During the year a total of 366 books and 2,188 booklets have been placed in the hands of the people, such literature having consisted chiefly of publications issued many years ago, as for some time it has been impossible to import either books or journals. Two service gatherings were arranged in Memelgebiet, at which a total of sixty-two publishers attended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That considerable changes will take place is to be expected, but just what form these will take it is at present impossible to foretell. One thing is certain, and that is the ultimate victory of Jehovah of hosts and his great Field Marshal, the Lord Jesus. Confidence in that victory, and in the assurance that one is marching forward in harmony with the Lord’s great organization, brings a peace of heart and mind amidst the turmoil and distress in which the nations of Europe are living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is therefore with a feeling of deepest gratitude to Jehovah that this brief report is submitted, as well as with the desire to continue faithful whatever lies ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the same time I would like to take this opportunity of assuring you of my continued love, of my appreciation of the lead you are giving to the Lord’s people, and of my earnest wishes for the continued blessing of Jehovah upon your labors.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark164"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark165"></a>NORWAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The Lord has shown his great favor to his people in Norway during the past year and enabled them to do much in the publication of Jehovah’s name throughout that country. The work is carried on under difficulties from many viewpoints, but this rather heartens the faithful witnesses to press on in the fulfillment of their duties. The distances are very long for traveling, and the means of transportation are poor. Boats and cars are employed where this is possible, but this entails much expense upon the workers. The pioneers must travel long distances and work under difficulties, especially in reaching the rural districts. Some of these live in tents which they carry on their bicycles. In some parts of Norway the people are more religious than in others, and it is in the religious districts that the greater difficulty is encountered in spreading the truth. The Society’s servant at Oslo, Norway, makes report, from which the following is extracted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Motorboat “Ruth&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This boat has two brothers aboard. They are working in the north of Norway, and have also this year done a good work in places wliich can be reached only by boat. A month ago the motor suddenly stopped. The sea was quite calm. They anchored to look after the motor. In a moment there rose a vehement storm, which took the boat with the anchor and drove it ashore. The back of the boat bumped against the stony strand. A fisherman saw it and came from the other side of the fjord to help them. He had a bigger motorboat and towed ‘ ‘ Ruth ” to a safe place. Immediately when this was done the storm stopped and it was as calm as before. The keel was damaged, and ‘ ‘ Ruth ’ ’ must go on a slipway fourteen days for a new keel. The insurance office is paying the expenses. Now, when the war has begun, we are not yet sure if we can get oil for the motor so &quot;Ruth” can continue. The two brethren have had 2,555 hours in work, and &quot;Ruth” has used 269 hours to travel from place to place, in all 1,906 miles. The result is: 2,246 books, 10,655 booklets, 246 subscribers for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ny Verden,</span><span class="font4"> and 11 for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower;</span><span class="font4"> 3,593 copies oi </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ny Verden.</span><span class="font4"> In all, 14,248 pieces of literature. 1,072 phonograph lectures for an attendance of 2,531.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The War</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When we are so near the war, the people are very anxious, and very often they answer that they must use their money for food, not for books. But we notice that some who never wanted to listen to the message now listen and ask to know the situation. Jehovah has shown us clearly his working program, but we are nevertheless wondering what the war signifies. We know that Jehovah through </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> will give light, and we have full confidence in Him as our mighty tower. We lift up our heads and look at the silver lining behind the dark clouds. The shadows of the war are already here. The food costs more and must be rationed. No private cars can be driven. Only the transport-driving and some buses are permitted. Benzene, coal and coke must also be rationed. But the big woods in Norway can help the people to get firing. Import and export are very much stagnated, and a good deal of the factories have stopped. The prices have already increased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Military Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many of the young men are called to military neutral-service. Our friends deny this service. In Norway we have a law that gives them civil work, to build roads and cultivate land for new farms. Our brethren have been glad to do this. To such a brother the judge said, in Oslo, &quot;I do respect your position, and if all young men had been like you the world today had been another. ’ ’ He promised to help him getting the civil-service in two parts, so he could keep his work on the factory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Zone Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have four zone servants. They are doing a very good work. But the distances from the different companies are very far, so the traveling takes much of their time. We are thankful for this service. It is a very good improvement and enlargement for the organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Phonograph Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This work has given Jehovah’s people many joyful experiences. 187 phonographs are in operation. It is not so many, but the economic situation is very hard for the most of the friends, so it is difficult to buy phonographs. Some of the companies have bought one or two, so different friends can make use of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Also this woik has been a great joy, and is really necessary to come in contact with the people of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Model Studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Such we have started this year and are glad to note that they are a good help to the new friends for starting their systematic studies of the light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Annual Convention In Oslo</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This was in May. It was a great encouragement and pushed the work forward. 165 friends spread 267 books and 5,531 booklets. 38 were baptized; two of these were boys only 11 and 12 years of age. It was a pathetic sight. One of the boys has said, when his parents asked him if he had thought enough about it, &quot;I have thought of it a whole year.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Madison Square Garden Meeting</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Several places in Norway we heard your speech and enjoyed it. It was interesting and encouraging to participate in the great convention. We participated also by going from door to door. Some newspapers had a little bit saying that Jehovah’s witnesses were fighting in the meeting. We published the facts in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ny Verden.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark166"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark167"></a>SWEDEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">This fiscal year ending Sweden takes her place as a company of faithful servants in the increased list of publishers and publications put in the hands of the people. The report from the Stockholm office made by the Society’s representative well covers the points, and it is here inserted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The year has certainly been an eventful one, starting right in the crisis over Czechoslovakia and now ending during the war in Poland, with its consequences which are being felt all over the earth, especially as its outbreak furnished the occasion to introduce totalitarianism, that hideous monstrosity, also in countries heretofore boasting of their democratic institutions and liberty. As one of the leading liberal dailies in Sweden, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Goteborgs Handelstidning</span><span class="font4">, put it about a week ago: “Unlimited bureaucracy is well under way in the warring as well as in the neutral states. We experience the transformation of democratic nations into totalitarian units. ’ ’ This statement was forcefully corroborated by what appeared in the papers today, viz., that a law is being prepared by the Government whereby all persons under 70 years of age may be put to some work in case of war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus far, however, oui work in Sweden has not been in the least hindered, except by the restrictions placed upon the use of gasoline, which has made all witnessing excursions by means of motor vehicles stop. But luckily there are push bicycles, and where that is impossible we can still get along on foot. Some brethren have also been called upon to serve in the military formations for securing our neutrality, and that has given them many good opportunities to witness to the truth of Jehovah’s supremacy and that there is a people who obey Him rather than men. Seeing that some religious persons previously relieved of military service as conscientious objectors have now volunteered to serve, the testimony thus given has impressed both the military officers and the State Church priests, who have to issue the required certificates as to the sincerity of the applicant. So far as real ‘ ‘ legal ’ ’ interference with our work is concerned, Sweden’s record is still unmarred. The only “case” against us was that during this month the local police questioned a party of pioneers working along the Norwegian borderline; they were suspicious because of their fear of spies, and when they found that the brethren were visiting homes, etc., they called them in. But after hearing their testimonies and listening to a record, they provided themselves with some literature and let the brethren go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Lord having made clear to his people their relationship to his Theocratic Government and provided for adequate organization instructions as well as advance information from his prophetic Word, the remnant and the Jonadabs have been able to go forward all through the year with a zeal and vigor .and perseverance that is really inspiring. The results also show how the richest blessings of Jehovah have attended our elforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Special Campaigns</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is wonderful to see, when looking back, how Jehovah has graciously provided the people of good will with message after message, showing them the need to now flee and make haste to reach the city of refuge. They have had &quot;warning”, have been asked to &quot;face the facts” and get into the &quot;watchtower”, thereby making the right choice as to &quot;Fascism or freedom”. The campaigns with these various items have been very much appreciated, indeed. The prolonged campaigns nowadays, and each special testimony period being one month in duration, certainly stresses the fact that we are now living in the antitypical seventh day of marching around Jericho, and it is good to see the Rahab class quickly taking the message of Jehovah to their relatives and neighbors, in this country as elsewhere. The fact that not less than 247 people have symbolized their consecration during the past year is proof that they are coming and showing themselves. That figure is about three times as high as ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our number of publishers in the field is apparently lower, though, than last year, but this is due to a certain reason and, in reality, the number is higher this year. Last year, for the April campaign, we had an advertisement in the local </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> re the work, and several subscribers wrote in for a small packet of booklets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Cure)</span><span class="font4"> to distribute among their friends, etc. They also got a report slip, and we counted as publishers all who sent in that slip. All of these were then provided with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant,</span><span class="font4"> hoping that they would continue to witness. Quite a number of them, however, never turned up again in the field. The number of publishers given in the report this year shows those actually going from door to door, and this figure is up by 90 to 1,361. The average number out week by week has increased by 124 to 660.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Company Organizations</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the new method of organization in force the work in the various companies has become much more effective, especially along the lines of getting all territory done systematically and back-calls getting more in hand. Sixteen new companies have been formed, and quite a number of isolated ones have been organized to carry on the work in their neighborhood. The number of back-calls reported is 48,669. The &quot;Model Study” method which was introduced in Sweden late this summer, when we got the booklet ready, will cause this work to increase and yield fruit still more than hitherto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Zone Arrangement</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All the friends appreciate this arrangement very much, and the zone assemblies have been better attended than any local conventions in previous years, and, of course, furnishing better opportunities to fortify and equip the brethren for the fight. 22 such assemblies have been held, with an attendance of 1,914. Because of the geographical size of the zones in this sparsely populated country it has been necessary to have three or four assemblies in each zone to cover the territory and give opportunity to all the publishers in the zone to attend. There are six zones, one of which comprises Stockholm and its nearest surroundings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Annual Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Besides the zone assemblies we have had one big convention, at Stockholm. Surely the Lord overruled the fixing of the date for it, so that it was held August 11-13. Had it been only three weeks later, most of the friends might have been unable to attend, owing to the war conditions, and especially the prohibition of any motor-driving not licensed by the authorities. As it was, 658 attended, which was about 250 more than at any time before. 457 were out in the field, with 193 phonographs, and placed 5,210 books and booklets. There were visitors from Denmark, Finland, Norway and America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On this occasion 117 symbolized. It was inspiring to see so many young ones coming along, and the work and all other proceedings went smoother than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Speaking of conventions, I must mention that in 22 dilferent places small groups of “locusts” were listening in to your Saturday and Sunday discourses from the world convention at New York. The radio experts had stated, as usual, that it would be impossible to take in these broadcasts sufficiently clearly to get a coherent thread of the lectures. But Jehovah is greater than the radio experts, and we heard every word, including some of the disturbance. It was a grand time, and we were as if bodily present, praying the Lord to strengthen you and see to it that this important message would not be hindered. The fact of a disturbance at the meeting was told in some papers here, but very briefly, and in many cases the headings did not even mention Jehovah’s witnesses, although that was stated in the dispatch itself, of course. All of them mentioned the 18,000 crowd gathered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Hours Worked</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The reported hours in the field show an increase of 61,206 over last year. Part of this increase, however, is due to the permission received to count some of the time spent in going to and leaving the territory. But on the whole it must be said that the “60 hours a month” mark suggested by you at the beginning of January has proved a great blessing to every one of us, as it made us search ourselves whether we had really done as much in the past as we could have done. And when the war came in September, many stated: “Surely the Lord put that mark before us, because he knew what was coming.” The total number of hours reported this year is 226,163.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Books and Booklets Placed</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of bound books we have placed a few less than last year, viz., 53,881, against 55,869. This small drop is more than outbalanced, however, by the enormous rise in number of booklets. The prolonged campaigns with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font4"> are responsible for this, and we are glad. The increase over last year is 311,641 copies, thus making the net increase in both items taken together 309,653. Total booklets placed came to 816,071, and grand total of books and booklets, 869,952 copies, as against 560,299 last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I feel sure that many people who have got the books and booklets but maybe not as yet have taken the trouble to read them carefully will now do so, because of the events happening. Russia’s stepping out on the side of Germany has caused many to remember the drawing on the front of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of the books, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> takes the lead, of course, and thereafter comes </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Biches.</span><span class="font4"> Now we are in the middle of translating </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font4"> for which many are eagerly waiting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Magazines</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The biggest surprise of the year was the campaign with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> magazine and the colossal increase in subscriptions for it. We had never dreamt of getting </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscriptions directly from door to door, but even that was now experienced, and the joy of the publishers has been great when they have watched the constant rise of subscription figures, from 2,094 last year to 4,363 to date. Many a publisher has had the wisdom of the admonition, &quot;Trust in the Lord . . . and lean not unto thine own understanding,’’ brought home to him in connection with this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> subscription campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> magazine not only has stood its ground from last year’s great campaign with it, but shows a good increase, the number of subscriptions at the close of fiscal year being 36,430, or 2,505 more than last year. 13,233 of the subscriptions were new.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Study</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I must say a word also about the new method of studying </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> It has proved a great blessing, as every one must do a thorough study of the article before attending the company study meeting, and at the same time many unnecessary questions and aimless talking have been eliminated. From one hour’s study we are now getting as much, or more, real good than from one hour and a half when we used the old method, and we get much quicker through the articles, which is needful now in order to be up-to-date with the revelation of prophetic truth. The series on Joshua’s leading Israel across the Jordan and into the promised land, the siege of Jericho, and the final victory at Ai have been very inspiring and encouraging, and the solemn warning provided by the happening during the first attack upon Ai, and its fulfillment in recent years, has certainly been given in due time. We cannot be grateful enough that we are permitted to now see those things and understand how our Father through his beloved Son has led us all the way and made us perform exactly what was thus foretold, according to his will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Phonographs</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not the least interesting and enlightening was the application of the trumpets’ being carried round Jericho and sounded day after day, and ‘no other sound or word being uttered’ by the marchers. The modern-day “trumpets” have been an indispensable part of our equipment, and there is now a fairly big number of phonographs in use in the witness work in Sweden, i.e., 925 such machines and 2 transcription machines. These have played 140,003 records to 228,294 listeners, or to 74,508 more than listened last year. Even if one does not see immediate results in many cases, we have to ‘ ‘ take it by faith ’ ’, like Israel at Jericho, and just carry on as commanded. Little by little it becomes known among the people that it is Jehovah’s witnesses who are using phonographs in their work, and they hear about it from others, and so are more prepared to receive us and listen when we call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Pioneers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This service has been taken advantage of by 76 brethren, which is 9 more than last year, and the average out each month has been 59, or 11 more than during the previous year. It is indeed encouraging to see the new and young ones, and older ones, too, now entering this service and gladly going about proclaiming day after day that the Kingdom of Jehovah is at hand and that his name will be vindicated, and pointing the people to the “city of refuge”. 56 of these pioneers attended the annual convention at Stockholm, and it was a very happy company. And since then seven new ones have either actually entered the pioneer service or notified their intention to do so in the beginning of October. “This is the only work worth while,” wrote one of them; and we know he will find it so, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Office Staff</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The family of the Stockholm Bethel home have been active in the work both in the office and from door to door, and have performed their duties with much appreciation of the privilege. In the field service, 14 have been taking part, and spent 4,063 hours (increase 1,305), placing 1,217 bound books, and 21,466 booklets, ma</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">kin</span><span class="font4">g a total of 22,683 (increase 11,075). Additionally they have taken 44 subscriptions for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> (increase 44) and 487 for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> (increase 72) as well as placed 1,721 loose copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> (decrease 111). They made 1,262 back-calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Public Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Seeing that we have only 44-minute records, it is sometimes good to have a public meeting with a longer discourse, delivered by “a live brother”. During the winter season we had a number of such meetings, where the subject &quot;Rule of Violence: Why Permitted? What Will Be the Outcome?” was used and advertising done through folders, poster bills, information marches, cars with placards, etc. And for our circumstances the results were very good. At Stockholm 1,854 packed the hall and several hundred had to turn away; at Gothenburg 1,300 crowded the biggest hall there, and in nine other towns good audiences also heard this lecture. Total audience for these 11 meetings was 6,220, and 826 pieces of literature were taken by these people. In most places follow-up meetings were arranged, and in the result many new ones started to attend our studies and several of these are now taking part in the work. Beside these bigger meetings there were held 56 other public discourses, mostly at isolated places and at burials. Attendance at these meetings, 1,564.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In concluding this report, I beg to voice the heartiest greetings and expressions of love for you, Brother Rutherford, from all the friends in Sweden, and especially from the office staff. We thank the Lord for your untiring service and courageous example of loyalty and faithfulness. And we daily pray that Jehovah may continue his guiding and protecting care over you, as the days are growing hotter with intense warfare. We are remembering also, with deepest sympathy, all those brethren in various lands who are now resisting unto blood &quot;in the battle against sin”, as the Swedish rendering has it. And we rejoice every time some record of deliverances reaches us. Soon Jehovah will deliver everyone who remains faithful unto the end. From him alone we look for salvation, and meantime we are striving, by his grace, to faithfully look after the interests of his kingdom, The Theocracy.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark168"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark169"></a>PHILIPPINE ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The publishers and servants of the Theocratic Government operating out of Manila, P. I., have been zealous, earnest, and active in the service in the year just past. The results are gratifying. There has been a splendid increase. Books and booklets placed in the hands of the people in those islands during the year total 146,851, which is a large increase over last year. These publishers have worked in the field 62,232 hours. They have taken subscriptions for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> to the number of 182. 24 phonographs have been in use, and at these sound assemblies 29,628 people have attended. The opposition has been great, but this has not deterred the faithful workers. The Society’s servant at the Manila office makes report, from which the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I rejoice to inform you that in spite of the desperate and combined efforts of the 'seed of the serpent’ to oppose “His strange work” in this country, this Branch has been blessed with an unprecedented “increase” from the gracious hand of the Lord. While there was an increase of 20 percent in 1938 over that of 1937, this fiscal year just ended has an increase of 50 percent over that of 1938, and this not only in the placement of books and booklets, but in almost all angles of the work as well. Whereas in 1938 there were 10,297 books and 93,119 booklets, with a total of 103,416 pieces, put in the hands of the people, this year we have had the privilege of distributing 16,247 books and 130,604 booklets, a total of 146,851 pieces, an increase of 43,435 pieces. As in 1938, most of the literature placed has been </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Eiches</span><span class="font4"> and the latest self-covered booklets. Besides this total of 146,851 pieces for the year, this Branch distributed 1,723 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> copies and 1,420 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> Campaign was truly the greatest and the most blessed, because the most important, up to that time. Reports from different parts of the field show the immense joy and blessing that were the publishers’ during that special period. The result was 50 percent greater than even the richly blessed </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cure-Consolation</span><span class="font4"> campaign. 182 subscriptions were obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There has been a splendid increase in both the pioneer and company service. In 1938 there were 39 pioneers, 8 auxiliaries, 70 company publishers, and 4 at the Bethel, with a total of 121. For this year we have 48 pioneers, 111 company publishers, making a total of 159, with an increase of 38 over that of the last year. These have spent 62,232 hours in the field service, as against 42,715 hours for 1938. With the increase in number of the publishers, the territory is being covered oftener and more intensively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Company Organizations</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The gathering of the great multitude by the Lord has become more manifest than heretofore. There are now 14 companies organized, as against 6 for the previous year, and many more are waiting to be organized. The ‘' strangers ’ ’ are fast pouring in from all directions, joining “Israel” in the feast or tabernacles now in full sway. By the Lord’s grace, we hope to be able to organize many more companies this ensuing fiscal year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the purpose of helping the good will to be organized into companies a zone servant was appointed by this Branch. Because of the tremendous increase in the work, this Branch is intending to appoint also two or three special pioneers to cope with the work of starting studies and helping organize companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This will also stimulate the publishers with whom these special pioneers and zone servant get in contact in the use of the phonograph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound Equipment</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This year two sound machines and 24 phonographs have been in operation. But there has been a great decrease in the number of sound attendance, mainly because of the influence of the “evil servant” or Achan class. The “son of perdition” misrepresented to the government official the use of our sound-car, so that we were forced not to use it for some time because of the trouble created, resulting also in unnecessary expense to the brethren. The evil influence of a certain “elective elder” one, who told the publishers here, in substance, that their mouths are better than the phonograph, has also something to do with the decrease in sound attendance. We hope to overcome this this ensuing fiscal year, as the real “other sheep” of the Lord are seeing clearer and clearer who are not serving in harmony with the Lord’s organization. Also, we are now making the Tagalog records, and with these we expect to use the sound machines and phonograph more to the glory of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We made 1,921 back-calls this year, as against 119 in 1938. It is observed that it is specially the back-call that is responsible for the sudden increase in the number of the people of good will. The good will are in harmony with Jehovah’s truth, but they need a “lift” into the “chariot”. While not all here yet have appreciated that the back-call is for that purpose, many of the publishers do, and all publishers in general are coming to a greater realization that this new phase of the Lord’s ‘ ‘ strange work ’ ’ is mandatory and indispensable to the present stage of bringing the good news to the “other sheep”. The phonographs help much and wonderfully in bringing home a point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Translations</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another impetus in opening studies and organizing companies will be the translation of the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ricfies</span><span class="font4"> into Tagalog, the principal dialect of the Filipinos. Translations of the booklets into other dialects have also been started. We are eagerly looking to their early printing and distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Memorial</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This year 202 celebrated the Memorial of joy to the Lord. The number that partook was much smaller than previously, showing that the Lord’s people here are appreciating better their individual position before the Lord and the relationship of one class to another. More than any time before did all appreciate the purpose of the Memorial, which is the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Field Experiences</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Abundant proofs from field experiences show that the people are realizing more and more the fact that religion is the subtlest snare and the most cruel and most devastating racket. A pioneer working out the island of Mindanao together with another pioneer was told by the Protestant pastor of a certain town that the Watchtower literature ‘ misleads the people, as it does not tell the truth about the Bible’. The brother asked the pastor to prove his accusation by pointing out even but one proof that the Watchtower literature misleads the people or misrepresents the Bible. The d. d. (Isaiah 56: 10,11) could not. The brother challenged the pastor in turn to discuss in public the doctrines of the particular cult where the pastor belonged, that the people might be enlightened. He refused, giving the alibi that “good Christians do not debate’’. It happened that at the other side of the town the brother's companions met one of the ‘ ‘ principal of the flock ’ ’ of the cult of the afore-mentioned pastor, and not knowing that his “blind guide’’ had refused to discuss the doctrines of his religion in the light of the Bible, he challenged the brethren for a public debate. The two brothers accepted the challenge. To save his face, the pastor was forced to come out to the open. A formal debate was arranged, and the intelligent portion of the townspeople were present. The truth was too sharp and too pointed even for the big lies of religion. And the people were greatly enlightened. Manifestly to regain his reputation in the town the pastor proposed to have another subject discussed. The brother accepted it, and more people came to hear. Again the truth prevailed, and many people subscribed for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> and got books and booklets. Some honest prisoners of the pastor openly declared that thenceforth they would have nothing to do with religion. As the brethren were working house-to-house one day, a man called their attention and, laughing, pointed to the bulletin board of a certain rubber company. Looking, the brethren saw written on it, “Religion is of the Devil, and a racket,” in big words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another pioneer said: “While working Sulu, inhabited by semiwild Mohammedan tribes, I found out that the Mohammedan religion is just as much a racket as the so-called ‘Christian religion’. The Mohammedan priests called ‘Imam’ or ‘Pan-detta’, like the clergy of ‘Christendom’, put heavy burdens upon the people and oppress them grievously. As in ‘Christendom’, the racket centers in the dead. It is only by faith in Jehovah that we can ever work out such a province as Sulu. No agents of any kind go there, because for two pesos one’s head may be chopped. It would be not so bad if they simply got one’s money. But they first chop your head and then get the money. Specially outside the capital of the province, it is very dangerous to travel. Almost all are armed with long razor-edged ‘barongs’ [long bolos] and many always carry revolvers or shotguns. Chauffeurs and conductors are always armed. All houses, and especially stores, are closed by six o’clock in the evening. The worst thing among these semibarbarous Mohammedan tribes is that they have been taught by their religion that if a Mohammedan kills a Christian, that Mohammedan will go straight to heaven riding a white horse. And most Mohammedan homes have the picture of the white horse. Most of these Mohammedan prisoners, like their Catholic fellow prisoners, will not read books without the approval of the priest. Because of this demoniacal religion, chopping off heads is not uncommon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Another full-time servant of the Lord related how, in working his territory, he came into the heart of some unexplored mountain, and, like other pioneers, crossed rivers infested with crocodiles, making his way through pathless hills and dale, foregoing meals sometimes. In the heart of unexplored mountain places he met savages with long hair, called Hongots, and short dark fellows with Sat noses and kinky hair, called Aetas. Both of these are bloodthirsty tribes. He gave testimony to them and stayed and ate with them for a time. Such are just samples of the thrills of the courageous, faithful pioneers who have left everything into the Lord’s hand. Never before have these remotest places been reached. This year the people of this country have received an emphatic witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When four brethren combed the benighted province of Zamboanga, the message of truth contained in the books </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies, Eiches, Face the Facts, Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font4"> told so much that the representatives of the modern witch of Endor, the “Fakir” of Vatican, made bitter howls in the pulpit and in their paper, hypocritically called ‘ ‘ La Antorcha ’ ’. The newspaper article was written by a Jesuit. Not one statement in the long article was true, and sometimes two or more lies are put in single sentences. One of the brethren made a complete refutation of all the intentionally made lies in the Jesuit’s attack and even provided the local papers of the province copies, but those yellow papers refused to publish it. The letter was so “hot” that the Jesuit came trembling, with two body guards, to the boarding place of the brethren. Because the letter pointedly showed what the brother knows about “Jesuitry”, the priest asked: “What do you know about the ‘Jesuit’?” “You have read my letter,” the brother answered. “Your article is full of lies and misrepresentations maliciously made.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Priest: “For instance?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brother: “One of the malicious lies you made is: ‘This Butherford who calls himself “Judge”.’ I challenged you to show where in his works does the author, J. F. Butherford, call himself ‘Judge’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Priest: “Was he not a judge and did he not permit others to call himself ‘ Judge ’ ? If he permits others to call him ‘ Judge ’, then that is calling himself ‘Judge’ by permission,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brother: <sup>&lt;f</sup>The philosophy of man is deceitful. Notwithstanding, it remains a fact that the author does not call himself ‘Judge’. If he served as judge and others call him ‘Judge’, what bellyache have you? What you should answer now is, Why are you called ‘Father’? You do not marry, and therefore have no legitimate children.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Priest: ‘‘I do not teach the people to call me ‘Father’.” Brother: ‘‘How about you? Don’t you call your pope ‘Holy Father’?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Priest: ‘‘Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brother: “By what authority do you call the pope ‘Holy Father ’, or the pope to accept that title ? ’ ’ [Reads Matthew 23: 9,10, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Douay]</span><span class="font4"> Then the priest tried his best to discredit the validity of the Bible. Failing in that, he said: “We Roman Catholics do not base our teachings on the Bible alone, but also on traditions.” To which the brother replied: “Exactly, and, to be sure, the Lord foreknew that and so He foretold it. [Reads Matthew 15: 1-9, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Douay]</span><span class="font4"> Because your doctrines have no real Scriptural support you go out of the Word of God and resort to traditions.” The priest left after almost three hours’ discussion, with all his turkey-strut gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As in other “disfigured” places where the “ugly scars” of the cruel tentacles of the monstrous Devil-fish turns one’s stomach, the fanatical dupes of the Catholic cult are proving themselves to be stubborn goats. From different parts of the country comes the report that books are collected, burned or torn, and the brethren are abused, insulted and avoided as if they were leprous. This is because the priest tells the suckers that if they even but look into our books they will commit “mortal sin”. Thus those dupes become twofold more the children of gehenna than their “padres”. But however fanatical most places are, there are always a few who abominate the wickedness done in the name of the Lord. Many readily assent when told that religion cannot save, but that it is a vicious racket.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Going Fascist</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Commonwealth of the Philippines shows clearly its inclination in introducing the compulsory “flag-saluting” religion in schools. Already two children of a Jonadab were expelled from classes for refusing to displease the Lord. The other children of Jehovah’s people express their determination not to ‘bow down, to an image’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Convention</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">T .poking to the vindication of Jehovah's name, the Philippine branch for the first time is planning to hold a convention in the latter part of December, 1939. Tire theme of the activities in the proposed convention will be how to better serve the Lord in connection with his gathering of his “other sheep”. Emphasis will be laid on the back-call, Model Study classes, the use of the phonograph in house-to-house work, and the necessary co-operation of pioneers and the companies with the zone servant in developing new interests and organizing companies. Trusting in the Lord for guidance and sustenance, we will hold this convention to the glory of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We give thanks and rejoice with you for the victory He gave his people in the Watchtower convention at New York and for the wonderful book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.</span><span class="font4"> &quot;They shall not prevail.” &quot;Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah.” The great multitude must now appreciate this great truth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark170"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark171"></a>PORT OF SPAIN (TRINIDAD)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">The publication of the Kingdom message in the British West Indies was carried on during the year as far as possible. Great difficulties have been encountered, because the government in office contains religious politicians who have made strenuous rules against the distribution of the Kingdom message, and their police tools have added to the hardships by making these burdens more grievous to be borne. From Trinidad the work is directed in Trinidad, Grenada, Barbados, Dominica, Montserrat, and St. Vincent, B. W. I. The distribution of the literature in these respective places during the year is as follows, to wit, 19,414.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Society’s local representative at Port of Spain, amongst other things in his report, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I beg to report that I returned from British Guiana last week. As was planned, villages where the witness had never been given by means of an electrical sound machine were visited, and thousands of persons heard. This work was done mostly in the evenings, when the people could better give attention. As we went from village to village we sometimes operated after 10, and up to 11 p.m. Many persons got out of bed, dressed hastily and came out, and there were always some who gave contributions and took literature, also many who would want us to stay longer, or to visit some district in which they were interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We usually started each setup with the record &quot;Onward, Christian Soldiers” by a powerful military band; this both aroused the people and gave some idea of the character of the demonstration. They came. At some points we had to hire both driver and car for transportation, and some of the drivers became quite enthusiastic. One, after hearing the first setup, gave his contribution and took the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Riches</span><span class="font4"> and at the conclusion of the evening’s work said, &quot;I like this thing so much that I could walk [go] with you the whole night”; and his name was, Peter St. Mary. There were many expressions of appreciation of the work. The brethren also claim to have been helped by the visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here in Trinidad, we labor under severe handicaps. Further, the police have been exceeding the restrictions placed by the local government, by seizing phonographs, and also literature for which the government has given license. Last month, this was again done, and here in Port of Spain. The following Sunday the brethren here were joined by some from near-by companies, and a swarm of them went to the same part of the city and gave the witness, carrying literature, phonographs, and signs. That day the same policeman accosted the very brother, asking what he had. He was told, ‘ ‘ The same as last Sunday. ’ ’ He took no further step. It seems that our enemies have only now got to know about the magazine </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> and a circular was sent to police stations about it. In other parts of the island also they are asking about it. The record “Peace Messengers” was played at the police station the first Sunday in support of the brother’s answer that he was not selling anything, but preaching the gospel of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are doing what we can, and the resumption of the war makes it the more urgent. The people are eager for our literature, but a large number already have what is available. Surely Armageddon is at the doors.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark172"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark173"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">There is no power that can stop the onward march of the Theocratic Government. The Great Theo-crat is all-powerful. Satan and all his host, invisible and visible, continue to fight against The Theocracy. Jehovah God permits the enemy to do so until His own due time to completely destroy all opposition. That he will do at “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”. All the evidence points to the fact that that great battle is near at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who publish the name of Jehovah and his kingdom are his witnesses. In obedience to Jehovah’s commandment they are proclaiming his name throughout the earth. Those faithful publishers and the work they are doing under God’s commandment must go on, regardless of opposition, until it is finished according to the will of the Almighty God. Immediately after that “strange work” of the Most High is completed there will follow his “strange act”, which will accomplish the destruction of Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and dictator allies on earth, all under the command of Satan, have conspired together in their desperate attempt to prevent The Theocracy from ruling the world. The issue therefore is strictly, Satan and his host against Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, his King. There is but one possible result, and that is certain to be the complete victory for Jehovah God in the conflict led by his Field Marshal, Christ Jesus, and the end is everlasting destruction of all of Satan’s host, invisible and visible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The sole work of the publishers of the Theocratic Government is to declare the name of Jehovah and his King and kingdom. This they are doing by the Lord’s grace and in his strength. During the year past this little band of witnesses have been diligent in performing their commission, divinely given. They have placed in the hands of the people books, small and large, to the number of more than thirty million, and these published in 78 different languages. This year and its results, therefore, bring the distribution or placement of books in the hands of the people to upward of three hundred million. It is therefore readily observed that there has been a tremendous witness to Jehovah’s name, the advertising of his Theocratic Government, throughout the earth. The purpose of such publication is to inform the people of good will that the Theocratic Government is the only hope of humankind. Those who desire a righteous government upon hearing the Kingdom message hasten to take their place on the side of Jehovah and his King and to find protection under The Theocracy. The evidence is conclusive that the great multitude are now coming from every nation, kindred and tongue and are engaging in sounding the praises of the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who maintain their integrity toward God and who remain true and faithful to the Theocratic Government will receive protection and salvation from the disasters of Armageddon, and thereafter those faithful ones under the command of Christ the King will proceed to function under the great Theocracy and go forward to fill the earth with a righteous people. All those who love righteousness and hate iniquity, seeing by faith the grand and glorious result, rejoice with ever-increasing satisfaction and joy, looking to the time when Jehovah’s name shall be fully vindicated and every creature that breathes be proclaiming his praises.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">T</span><span class="font7">HE PUBLISHERS for Jehovah’s Kingdom know that they are in constant danger. On every side the enemy attempts to destroy them. They know that they have need of protection and salvation. They knov-z that there is only one power that can deliver them, and that is the power of the Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark175"></a><span class="font7">The people of good will are rapidly learning that there is nothing in the religious institutions that holds out any hope of protection and salvation for them. Hearing the Kingdom message, they are turning rapidly to Zion, which is God’s organization; and thus they are seeking protection and salvation. To aid all persons of good will in their fight against iniquity an appropriate scripture text is selected, for each and every day of the year. In this Yearbook are published appropriate and consistent comments on each daily text. By considering the text and comments at the beginning of each day the consecrated ones are aided to meet the perplexing problems that daily arise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These are perilous times. The Lord foretold that they would come in this day; and therefore the fully consecrated are not at all surprised. Like the faithful prophet of old, the faithful now with confidence look to the Great Theocrat, and in the language of the prophet they sing: “My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.” (Ps. 121:2) When the strength of Jehovah is shown in behalf of his children they have every reason to continuously sing, “My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation.—Ex. 15:2, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pharaoh and all his army, horses and chariots pursued the Israelites led by Moses, to destroy them. At the Red sea Jehovah exercised his power and gave the victory to Moses and the Israelites. The miracle there wrought caused the Israelites to fear Jehovah and to believe him and to serve him and to obey his servant Moses. That great victory over the enemy and the deliverance of the Israelites by drowning Pharaoh’s army in the sea brought forth songs of praise to the name of Jehovah. The words of that victory song sung by Moses and the children of Israel, foretell the song of victory and praise that will be sung by the remnant and the great multitude, which song now by faith they are singing unto Jehovah. It foretells the Lord’s great victory over the combined elements that now seek to destroy God’s people. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">We will flee before them. Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the Lord your God will deliver it into your hand.—Josh. 8:6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses on earth, the remnant and those associated with them, their companions, appear before “Christendom” by going from house to house and doing the witness work, which in fact invites the attack by the enemy, and, at the proper time and when commanded by the Lord, they perform some maneuvers that seem to the enemy like a retreat. Jehovah maneuvers the forces before Armageddon, both his own and those of the enemy, and puts them exactly where he would have them before the battle begins. The invisible angelic forces are the right-hand support and defense of Jehovah’s witnesses on the earth, while the earthly force work and walk in “the valley of the shadow of death”, and there the invisible forces serve as Jehovah’s protection provided for them and give assurance to them that no evil shall befall.

<p><span class="font5">Z </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth.—Joh 19:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This shows that the redemption or deliverance takes place in the latter days when Jehovah delivers his anointed people from Satan’s wicked organization, particularly the religious element, which Satan uses to oppose, reproach and persecute them. There is no direct mention made of a redemption- or redemptive money price or payment. The clear meaning given to the text is that of liberation, freeing, rescuing, delivering from the hand of the enemy, that is, Satan’s organization, including his agents that oppose and persecute God’s anointed people. None of the enemy organization are ever redeemed, but, on the contrary, the redemption is always spoken of as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">from</span><span class="font5"> the enemy. It is Jehovah, acting by and through his Chief Executive Officer, Christ Jesus, that accomplishes such deliverance from the enemy.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings.—Isa. 52:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “feet” members of the body of Christ are called God’s “watchman” because they watch for their brethren and foi' all who love God and they watch for the kingdom interests, and then, above all, they are watching the hand of Almighty God that they may ascertain and do his will. (Ps. 123:2) The watchman is diligent to look for the events which God brings to pass, furnishing a lead for his people, and they are quick when receiving orders from the Lord to obey the same. All members of the body of Christ now on earth and which are collectively called “the remnant” are also collectively the watchman of the Lord. To them the Lord makes known the meaning of his prophecies, and, when ascertaining what they must do, those of the remnant do it with joy. Thus they keep in step with God’s organization, which moves majestically forward to accomplish his purpose. 17 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.—John 17:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">True followers of Christ Jesus must follow where he leads, because they are called to take that exact course and they must be diligent to obey his and Jehovah’s commandments. (1 Pet. 2:21) Wherever there is conflict between the laws of the nations and the laws of Almighty God the Christian must always obey God’s law in preference to man’s law. All laws of men or nations in harmony with God’s law the Christian obeys. The world consists of the nations of earth under the supervision of the invisible overlord, Satan; and which world, in God’s due time, will be completely destroyed. Jehovah’s witnesses are set aside and commissioned by him to be the representatives on earth of the Most High, the Great Theocrat. They are not a political or religious organization, and have no part in the world’s political affairs, not even of nations wherein they reside.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.—1 Cor. 3:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why did God lay the foundation for salvation of sinful men ? For the vindication of his holy name. The challenge of Satan put God’s name at issue. Imperfect men, when relieved from inherited disability and then proving their integrity toward God, are a vindication of the name of Jehovah and a complete refutation and disproval of Satan’s challenge. The judgment entered against Adam was just. It must stand forever. His offspring are sinners by reason of inherited sin. God exercised mercy toward sinful man by laying the foundation for man’s salvation. How is that foundation laid ? It was laid by permitting the man Jesus to bring the required price for the purchase of mankind, that is, the descendants of Adam, and pay over that purchase price for the relief or release of such offspring from bondage.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith; and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen.—Joel 2:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As to the effect of Jehovah’s loving-kindness toward his consecrated and faithful people in sending them the “bread”, “wine,” and “oil”, they were so refreshed that there was no longer any reason why they should go about in an apologetic way in the King’s service, because Jehovah by his prophet had foretold their increased happiness and said: “I will no more make you a reproach among the nations [the religionists].” Why ? Because the time now approached for the vindication of his name and those who faithfully and boldly declare his name and who continue to do so are not at all ashamed of reproaches that come upon them by reason of their faithful service. Hence the reproaches of the religionists east upon them do not disturb them nor deter them from service. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">For the kingdom is the LORD’S; and he is the governor among the nations.—Ps. 22:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The government of the world by the immediate direction or administration of Jehovah, the Almighty God, is a theocracy. Following Satan’s rebellion God gave his word of promise that in his due time the world shall be ruled by a theoerat or theocratic government. Any rule or government set up in defiance of Almighty God or claiming to rule the world in the stead of Jehovah God is a monstrosity, “the abomination that maketh desolate.” Such an abomination or monstrosity turns men against God and leads them into destruction. Satan’s monstrosity takes away all the liberties of the common people and makes them slaves to Satan’s chief representatives. The Theocracy sets men completely free, enables them to pursue a course of righteousness in peace. The people of good will shall in due time dwell under the theocratic government and be for ever at peace. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The people there, behind the walls, pictured the religious element in particular, which element go into their holds. Sore afraid, they hid themselves behind the city walls; and this was in keeping with what the Lord says concerning the religionists of the present day (Jer. 51: 30). The walls of Jericho pictured the political and commercial elements of the governments, which support and keep in action the strong-arm squad and the military powers in an effort to accomplish their purpose. With the assurance from Jehovah that into the hand of Christ Jesus he has delivered the modernday Jericho, His witnesses should fearlessly go ahead regardless of the persecution by the enemy. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">With the mouth confession is made unto salvation. —Rom. 10:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is not sufficient that one have the mental conclusion that Jehovah is the true God and that Christ Jesus is the Savior of men, and earth’s rightful King. Man must go farther than that. He must openly acknowledge that he is trusting in God and in Christ Jesus. Confession means acknowledging Jehovah as supreme and that the one confessing had made a covenant or agreement to do his will. No one will be a member of the great multitude unless doing so, and then he is to render himself in full obedience to God’s will. Life from the gracious hand of Jehovah is given to those who show by their works and by their activity in the course they take that they are trusting in God and in Christ. One who thus shows faith is not ashamed to acknowledge God and Christ and is not backward in taking an active part in doing the witness work according to the will of God.

<p><span class="font5">Why has God taken out from the nations a “people for his name” ? In order that they may give testimony to the people concerning Jehovah’s name and purpose. They must be witnesses to the name of Jehovah, declaring to the people that he is the Almighty God and the only source of life. To those taken out, and who now constitute the remnant of his people on earth, Jehovah says: “Ye are my witnesses . . . that I am God.” Those taken out have no alternative as to what they shall do. They must be witnesses to the name of Jehovah, regardless of what any creature may think or say or do concerning them. It is God’s will that notice be served upon the nations, informing them that he is supreme and his name is above all names and that at Armageddon he will destroy all that continue in opposition to him.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Who is a liar, but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.—1 John 2:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Christ,” the “Messiah”, means Jehovah’s “Anointed One”, his King and rightful Ruler of the world and who shall destroy Satan’s wicked rule. Every thing and every institution that denies that great truth is a part of the antichrist. Every thing and every institution that is not for Jehovah and Christ Jesus is against the Lord and against his kingdom. Jesus not only magnified the kingdom, but also said: “He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.” Every religious institution magnifies creatures and keeps the people ignorant of the kingdom of Christ which will vindicate Jehovah’s name. Religion puts the state even above God and his kingdom. Religion is wholly anti-Christ and anti-God and hence anti-God’s kingdom.

<p><span class="font5">The Gibeonites voluntarily put themselves under the protection of Joshua, and then the five kings of the Amorites conspired together to destroy Gibeon because they had sought protection by associating themselves with Joshua. The Gibeonites pictured the great multitude fleeing to Christ Jesus for protection. At God’s command Joshua courageously led his army against the conspirators. That was one of the great battles foretelling God’s purpose to destroy his enemies at Armageddon, the record of which is made for the encouragement of those people of Jehovah who now serve him as Armageddon approaches. The great battle of Gibeon was fought by the Lord then as he will fight for his people at Armageddon. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The apostle Peter under inspiration at Pentecost located the time for the complete fulfillment of this part of Joel’s prophecy, and that time is named by the apostle as “the last days”. (Acts 2.-17) “The last days” is the time of the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple for judgment. This appearing of the Lord at the temple was in A.D. 1918. It was after that date that God’s consecrated ones on earth repented and turned wholly to the service of Jehovah, as commanded in the prophecy at Joel 2:12-17. Thereafter they were anointed with the holy spirit. Jehovah’s spirit is the holy power of the Most High by which he carries out his purposes. It is invisible to human eyes, but God causes it to move his creatures on earth into action to serve his purpose. He gives a commission of authority to certain ones to do and to perform the things designated by that commission, and this he does by putting his spirit upon them.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Joel 3:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The nations decided to throw in their lot with Satan. All nations today are opposing Jehovah’s faithful people. It is now the day of Jehovah. Hence “multitudes, multitudes” of the enemy must be gathered to the valley where God must deal with them according to his judgments already written. On the other side are gathered all those who are devoted to God, including the “remnant” and their companions, and the hosts of heaven. The valley is the place of execution. It is “the valley of concision”, or “threshing”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Margin)</span><span class="font5"> “Concision” or “threshing” means to completely cut to pieces as a threshing machine tears or cuts to pieces that which is thrown in among the knives of the machine.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">For, behold, in those days, and in that time ... I shall bring again the captivity of Judah.—Joel 3:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From A.D. 1918 onward is the period known as “those days” and “that time”. It is the time in which the Lord gathers unto himself his people, anoints them, commissions them and sends them forth to do his work, and within that time God also assembles the enemy, gives them notice and warning, and then administers a just recompense of reward. Jehovah’s witnesses have suffered and continue to suffer at the hand of religious conspirators; but let such faithful followers of Christ continue for a little season, fully trusting in God. He will square the account and see to it that those religious conspirators shall not go down to the grave in peace. After the Lord appears at the temple for judgment he brings his faithful people out from Satan’s organization and sets them free from fear of Satan’s crowd that they may boldly and fearlessly serve God and his King.

<p><span class="font5">While Rahab did show some faith in what she had done up to that time, she must openly confess with her mouth to witnesses that she had such faith in God. Everyone who receives the blessings of the Lord God, and who then takes a wise course, makes confession of his faith in God. (Rom. 10:10,11) Jehovah has made known his unchangeable rule, which applies to all who receive life. This rule is, Tinto me every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess.’ (Isa. 45:23; Rom. 14:11) Rahab played the part representing the great multitude, every member of which must confess faith in God and in Christ Jesus and therefore must take their stand publicly before men and bear testimony, all trusting in God.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Eph. 6:12, Weymouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the time of Eden until now Satan has fought against God and his kingdom. Because of this issue the kingdom is stressed by all the writers of the Bible. Those faithful men of old wrote prophecy under inspiration of Jehovah’s spirit and have magnified the importance of the kingdom. Who are they that seek to destroy those who serve Jehovah ? Satan and his forces are unseen to men, and it is these unseen forces that battle against Jehovah’s King and kingdom and all who represent the kingdom. Thus it is seen that the enemy against whom the Lord’s anointed fight is not those of flesh and blood, but is made up of the Devil and his host of. wicked angels, who use human creatures as their tools. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Now God makes it clearly to appear that the religious leaders are the Devil’s chief instruments used to reproach His name and to afflict His people. This the Lord has done since he brought his remnant to the temple. God has now raised his people “out of the place whither [the religionists] have sold them”, and He now causes his servants to announce to the enemy God’s recompense upon them. The remnant and their companions now have the privilege and obligation of declaring God’s determination to take action against the enemy. Because Armageddon is near, the time to “pay off” will take place and he sends Christ’s true followers throughout the land to declare his judgment in advance of its execution. This proclamation gives due notice to the enemy. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Lord does not require that his people do spectacular things, but does command that they be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might and have full faith in his power. They must be very courageous, and hence must not permit the slightest doubt in mind that God can carry out every word he has promised and that he will do so, and that as long as they serve him in obedience to his commandments no power can prevent the doing of the work which he has assigned them to do. Having this courage, they go forward with joy. At all times they have in mind the power that is behind them and backing them up and they know that “underneath are the everlasting arms” of the Most High and in due time, as God has promised, 'Tie shall thrust out the enemy from before thee.”—Deut. 33: 27.

<p><span class="font5">If one tells his neighbor that a lion is about to attack and destroy him, surely that information is not given because of hatred of his neighbor, but because of love for him. The Devil, like a Hon, walks about promulgating religion as his chief means of bringing about the destruction of men. It is therefore to the people’s best interest to be warned about the Devil and his deceptive doctrines and methods. Because a person is a Catholic, Protestant or Jew is no reason whatever, and is certainly no excuse, why he should be hated. Jehovah’s witnesses, acting at God’s command, are carrying these truths that others may know that Jehovah is the only true God, the only means of life, and Christ Jesus is his Vindicator and administrator of life to man. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">One of those days must have been the sabbath, but the marchers would not rest on that account. Likewise Jehovah’s witnesses do not lay off on Sundays and “hohdays”, but have worked all the time. It must have appeared to the Jericho-ites as a strange procedure for the Israelites to be marching around their city, blowing trumpets. Likewise the religionists regard the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in continually proclaiming the warning concerning Armageddon as a very strange course of action. As the marching around the city must continue every day for six days, so Jehovah’s witnesses must go over the same territory time and again, proclaiming the kingdom message. They are not to use carnal weapons. On the seventh day a great miracle was to be performed. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4/1/39</span></p>

Only those who have a vision of the Kingdom and who trust wholly and implicitly in the great Theocrat and his King. “According to your faith be it unto you.” Only those diligent in studying God’s revealed Word and who keep in mind his message, particularly relating to the kingdom, will be able to hold fast and withstand the enemy assault. Those who for any excuse or reason turn to the things of this world are certain to lose everything. Those who put their trust wholly in Jehovah and his King, and who with diligence press on in the fight in obedience to his Word, will continue to behold what is God’s purpose and what shall be the result. They hear the doom of religion and the complete overthrow of all of Satan’s forces. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Joshua . . . wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.—Josh. 8:30,32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This act magnified Jehovah’s law and stressed the importance thereof, and the record made of it was a testimony to all coming that way, and that could not be ignored; none could plead ignorance of the law and the covenant of Jehovah. “It pleased Jehovah, for his righteousness’ sake, to magnify the law, and make it honorable.” (Isa. 42:21, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.')</span><span class="font5"> His law is his Word. By it Jehovah vindicates his name. Since the spiritual Israelites have crossed the antitypical Jordan, and particularly since 1936, Jehovah has caused his law to be magnified against religion and its tradition ; showing that his law is honorable. Religion transgresses and nullifies God’s Word or law. Warning is now furnished to those who practice religion, that they may have no excuse to plead ignorance in justification of their practice.

<p><span class="font5">What price is required for the purchase of mankind ? The life of a perfect human creature. God’s law requires a life for a life. (Deut. 19:21) Adam was a perfect man when he willfully and deliberately sinned in violation of God’s law, and that law required the forfeiture in death of that perfect human life. Nothing less and nothing more could be required to purchase Adam’s offspring, but only a perfect life. Since Jesus always does God’s will, it must have been understood between God and his beloved Son that Jesus should become a man, <sup>c&lt;</sup>lower than the angels,” and suffer death, thereby proving his faithfulness to God even to an ignominious death, and by his death also providing the required purchase price for man’s salvation from death.

<p><span class="font5">In connection with the cities of refuge and the avenging of the blood of the one slain, something is required to be paid over that is equal to what was lost, that is to say, a life for a life. (Deut. 19:21) That redeeming of the blood does not refer to the blood-bought redemption at Calvary, but to the paying in kind, that is, a retribution, paid out to the death-dealing enemies of the Lord at the' battle of Armageddon, and which is paid by the antitypical Redeemer or Revenger, Christ Jesus, as an offset to the blood that was spilled by the enemies of the Lord. Otherwise stated, the Redeemer or Revenger, Christ Jesus, squares the account with the Lord’s enemies at the battle of Armageddon. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Continuously since 1922 there have been and still are those things which threaten to stop the progressive work concerning the kingdom. In the fulfillment of the prophecy the words “ye beasts of the field” do not symbolize living creatures, but rather refer to those things which are actively employed to promote the kingdom work. The burdensome part of the work is done by mechanical means, labor-saving devices and transportation facilities, which Jehovah’s witnesses have employed to do the work committed to them. More than 40,000 phonographs, with many recorded speeches, are employed to carry the message to the people. Such zealous work has brought about fruitful results. His fruit-bearing witnesses the Lord protects against the enemy’s vicious efforts, and his kingdom interests march triumphantly onward.

He who is The Faithful and True Servant of the Most High will defend those who are with him. Acts of opposition and violence incited by leaders among religionists will increase until Armageddon. Immediately before Armageddon begins, the Devil’s host will, by Gog, Satan’s field marshal, come against all those on the side of Jehovah in an effort to destroy those faithful to the Lord. Such horde of wicked ones will not succeed in their efforts, but, on the contrary, Christ will gain the victory over them. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The mission of Jehovah’s witnesses is now fraught with great danger because of the malicious animosity toward them of the ruling factors of “Christendom”. They are warned that they must not fear or be dismayed or frightened because of the threats made against them and the assaults and persecution brought upon them. As God had surrounded Jeremiah with protection, so he now says to his faithful witnesses on earth: “I have made thee this day a defenced city [organization].” Jehovah’s witnesses now know that religionists, politicians and traffickers are allied together against God and his kingdom and that they bitterly oppose his faithful witnesses. To Jeremiah Jehovah said: “And they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/1/39</span></p>

The remnant has received the commission from Jehovah’s hands to make proclamation of the vengeance of the day of the Most High and thus to sound the warning. That commission is given alone to the anointed; as written: “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to . . . proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God.” Sounding of the trumpet of warning is for the benefit of those in God’s organization, as well as for those who claim to be the servants of Jehovah.

<p><span class="font5">The “children of Judah” are all those who praise Jehovah, particularly the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, Christ Jesus, and including all his faithful followers. These go forth to the people with the message of Jehovah, and by delivering that message they in effect “sell” the Roman Hierarchy and allies of other religions. That message of truth operates to sell such over to others who will enslave, oppress and exploit the religionists. This Jehovah’s witnesses and companions do by drawing to attention of the people the truth of God’s Word showing that religion is the product and instrument of the Devil and that at the beginning of Armageddon Jehovah will deliver it and its practitioners over to their former allies, the radical ruling element, to be destroyed.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end.—Isa. 9:6,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah, knowing the end from the beginning, long centuries ago caused his prophetic Word to be recorded and declared that in his own due time he would set up a government on earth and under that government there shall be peace and that neither the government nor peace shall ever end. Today there is no peace on earth. For that reason we may know that God’s promised government is not fully in operation so far as the present rule of the earth is concerned. Jehovah God has not forgotten his promise, and his prophecies have not failed in the least. His due time must arrive before his promises are carried out; and having purposed to establish a government and peace, he is certain to do that very thing. No one who believes on God and Christ Jesus and has a knowledge of the Bible will have any doubt about that. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">These waters pictured the people of good will who hear and give heed to what the Lord is doing. War began in heaven and on earth in 1914. None of the nations knew why the Lord stopped the war in 1918, but the Lord knew. He was performing a miracle as foreshadowed by the miracle made at the Jordan. In the period of peace time or cessation, of hostilities the Lord, by sending forth his message of warning to the people of good will, held them up or back from the irresistible rush of distressed humanity rushing toward the Dead Sea of Armageddon. Except for that great miracle, as Jesus stated, “there should no flesh be saved; but for the elect’s sake those days [were] shortened.”— Matt. 24:22.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s name stands for everything that is righteous. His name could not be vindicated if he would approve anything that is unrighteous. The eyes of Jehovah are pure, and he cannot look upon lawlessness. (Hab. 1:13) Willful disobedience of his commandments is iniquity or lawlessness. The creature that receives God’s approval must be obedient. That unchangeable rule applies to all of his creatures. When God made a covenant with Israel he emphasized the necessity for full and complete obedience. Israel, in the covenant of faithfulness, pictured the spiritual Israelites in the covenant for the Kingdom. Those chosen of God to be associated in heaven with his beloved Son are a peculiar people, and their approval must be preceded by their full obedience to the Lord. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4J15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus and the members of “his body” are “trees of righteousness, the planting of Jehovah”, that bring glory to Jehovah’s name. “Christendom” loudly claims to be that tree of God’s planting, but the claim is false and, instead of bringing joy to the Lord, they bring great reproach to his name. “Christendom” has long claimed to be God’s “fig tree”, but she has brought forth no fruit whatever to the Lord’s glory. The message now sent forth by him through his faithful witnesses discloses that “Christendom” is totally barren of fruit and worthless because she has abandoned God and his kingdom and has sought promotion from Satan and hence is now a tree stripped even of its bark. God’s true fig tree avoids Satan’s organization as deadly. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The man who fears God does not give heed to what other men may say about him. The wise man is one concerned altogether about what God may think of him. He craves God’s approval because he knows that he must have God’s approval before he can obtain life. To have the disapproval of Jehovah God means destruction. As the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom on man’s part, it follows that man must ever thereafter continue to fear God and particularly to fear that he might not receive God’s approval. The only means, therefore, of escaping the Devil’s snare is the fear of God and to have no fear whatsoever of man. Man’s approval by God means everything. For a Christian to manifest fear of man, even fear that he would not receive man’s approval, is an open and direct insult to Jehovah God, and God permits him thus to be led into the Devil’s snare. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15/39</span></p>

Note Jesus’ words concerning a lowly, humble man who sought help from the Lord: “Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.” (Vs. 10) The faith exhibited today by the Jonathan class, who are not spiritual Israelites, often exceeds the faith and zeal manifest by those who claim to be Israel after the spirit.

No one could rest on his past laurels and say, T have done my part; let the others do it now.’ All must faithfully share the work with their fellows. No one could hire a substitute to work for him.and leave that work to be done by someone else; but he must work himself. Those faithful in the service say: “All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go.” (Josh. 1:16) These words express the right sentiment of one engaged in the witness work, willing to work, and being willing to work in any place to which he may be assigned.

Such has caused the fair-minded people and others of good will toward God to make an honest, impartial investigation. They see that Jehovah’s witnesses are obeying his commandments, and the people of good will turn to the Lord and serve him with joyful heart. Therefore Jehovah’s people should waste no time arguing or disputing with Satan’s religious representatives, but should be busy at all times telling the truth, that the people of good will may find the way to life.

Just march and sound the message of the kingdom with their antitypical trumpets, and when the marching is done they must shout in obedience to the command received. No carnal weapons nor acts of violence used by these faithful witnesses, but just the sound of the mechanical voice by sound machines, proclaiming the name of Jehovah and his kingdom, which must continue until the time of his miraculous “strange act”. Jehovah instructed Joshua as to what to do and what would be the result.

They are acting strictly in obedience to God’s commandment to proclaim his name and his kingdom. They do not hate men, but do hate evil or wickedness, which has defamed God’s name and brought great sorrow and suffering upon men. They hate what God hates, and God hates wickedness.

He shows that his anointed ones and their companions would stand shoulder to shoulder, working for the kingdom. He likens his faithful anointed ones unto locusts and calls them “his army”, who have no earthly king but who are under the leadership of Christ, the heavenly King. God’s faithful and loyal ones now on the earth do not need an earthly or visible king, head or ruler. They are all at unity; meaning they are all at one, and that Christ is their Leader and Head. Christ Jesus denounced religion as of the Devil, and they must follow their Head and Leader. In harmonious movement they follow their King whithersoever he leads.

<p><span class="font5">Vengeance against whom? Against all who oppose the Theocratic government, and which enemies on earth are chiefly the religious leaders. Therefore the commission granted to the anointed ones requires each of them to proclaim the truth, which truth of God’s Word exposes religion as a snare of the Devil and as a racket practiced for material gain of the religion mongers. The time then arrived for God’s “strange work” and the taken-out ones must participate therein by declaring God’s purpose as announced in their commission. To do that work the witnesses must have the spirit of God upon them. Upon all such in the flesh devoted to Jehovah he poured out his spirit by and through Christ Jesus and thus made them his witnesses and sent them forth to proclaim his purposes.

You have organized your “Catholic Action” as a body politic to conquer and control the world, defame the name of Almighty God, and oppose his kingdom. Now go right on and put pressure on all public officials of this world, political, judicial, legislative, police, executive, and all others who hear and exalt you and who join in oppression and in opposition to the Theocratic government.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah will have all creation to know that he is the Almighty God. Only those who know and acknowledge this will live. It has been very difficult for men to learn that indisputable fact. Among men there has always been a tendency to exalt creatures, and such has been due to Satan’s influence. That wily foe has employed all manner of means of deception and flattery to cause men to exalt the name of some creature or creatures. Satan exalts himself against Jehovah, and his purpose is to cause other creatures to exalt themselves against God in defiance of the Most High. Self-exaltation results in just one thing, to wit, abasement and destruction. Jesus’ words are: “For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.” Jesus took the course opposite to self-exaltation. 17 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Amalekites attempted to destroy the Israelites. At God’s direction by Moses the Israelites took the offensive. They did not hole up in the rocks or behind breastworks, but in obedience to Moses’ command went out and fought the enemy. In that battle led by Joshua, who represented Christ, the Lord assaulted the enemy, gained a great victory and delivered Israel. That it was Jehovah’s battle and that he gave the victory is shown in that Joshua prevailed only when Moses’ hands were held up. Thus is shown that Jehovah will uphold the Greater Joshua at Armageddon and will completely rout the enemy. Now Satan’s forces go forth attempting to destroy God’s people, and those who trust wholly in Jehovah and his Vindicator, Christ Jesus, must take the offensive and go forth into the battle trusting the Lord, who gives assurance of their deliverance. 17 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s anointed on earth must and will proclaim his roaring message now. They must make a lot of noise, like a lion’s roar, not by incoherent yelling, but by bold and fearless proclamation of the kingdom message. Today they and their companions are sounding forth the message at his command, declaring his vengeance against the enemy, and thus they give utterance to “his voice”. The present-day effect thereof now shakes Satan’s heavenly or invisible force and all of the visible part of his organization. Such is the final shaking just preceding the great battle. But at Armageddon Jehovah will literally shake the “heavens” and the “earth” to pieces, removing everything in opposition to the Theocracy.

<p><span class="font5">Not having forfeited his right to human life, Jesus still possessed that right when he was raised from the dead; and that right to human life constitutes the purchase price for sinful man. When God raised Jesus from the dead he clothed Jesus with all power in heaven and in earth; that is to say, God made Jesus Christ his Executive Officer, fully equipped with all necessary power and authority to carry into operation the purpose of Jehovah, both in heaven and in earth. When Jesus Christ was exalted to heaven he presented to God in heaven the value of his human life; and that asset, which was exactly equal to what Adam had forfeited, was received by Jehovah God as the offering of Jesus for sin, that is, as the purchase price offered and presented by Jesus in behalf of sinful men.

<p><span class="font5">While the ambuscade was set, the other part of Israel stood before the city and enticed the enemy to attack, and thus pictured those who fearlessly carry on the witness work just preceding Armageddon, and which brings on the enemy attack. The forces that will do the slaughter work at Armageddon are hidden or unseen by Satan’s organization on earth because the enemy do not believe what is recorded in God’s Word. It is further proof that God’s witnesses may repeatedly declare publicly God’s purpose concerning his enemies and their testimony will not be believed by the ungodly. The Lord’s forces are so stationed in the battle that, when Armageddon begins, all avenues of escape are cut off. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Men of great wealth, either of money or of position, influence and honor among men, such as the exalted clergy or their rich “principal of the flock”, think themselves especially favored of God and Christ and rely for safety upon their own wealth, honor and position. But what is the end thereof, according to the Scriptures? “They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches; none of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[(Young)</span><span class="font5"> atonement] for him; (for the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever;) that he should still live for ever.” Such men die like brute beasts, because they have no standing above the beast: “Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.”—Ps. 49: 6-9, 20. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/39</span></p>

But when the Lord brought again his people from captivity, particularly since 1922, his faithful witnesses, by zealous activity, well fulfill the picture seen at the threshing machines, and at oil and wine presses; and in doing this work they have greatly rejoiced in preparing such things for the use and enjoyment of those w’ho will form the great multitude. (Vs. 24) To this end the Lord has put laborers in his fields. Those who have labored joyfully, looking always to the praise of Jehovah, have received their pay.

<p><span class="font5">Jesus, in speaking of being smitten on the cheek, was addressing his words specifically to the Jews, who were under the law covenant and which law covenant was their adversary to keep them in line and punish them when they violated the terms of the covenant. The resisting of evil, therefore, could not mean that God’s people are to willingly submit to a beating at the hands of others who assault God’s servants while preaching the kingdom gospel. Jesus had no reference to such when thus addressing the Israelites; rather his words must mean that if evil comes upon those in the covenant from the adversary, the law covenant, they must not resist, but receive the same as a just punishment from the Lord, and to further prove their willingness they must go the limit of their ability in obeying their lawful adversary. He said nothing about resisting wickedness. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus was entirely neutral toward nations when he was on earth. He did not instruct his followers to take sides with any government or any nations in their controversies, but emphatically instructed all his true followers to devote themselves entirely to God’s kingdom, The Theocracy. He urged upon them the necessity of always praying for the coming and full operation of The Theocracy. He told them that the nations seek entirely after material or selfish things, and then said: “But seek ye first the kingdom of God”; that is, seek The Theocracy, and not democracy, totalitarianism, Fascism, or any other political government. Those who will have a part in the Theocratic Government, God’s heavenly kingdom, must be entirely neutral toward nations. TV </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/1/39</span></p>

The giving of his word of promise is a full and complete guarantee that what he has said shall be done. To know Jehovah and to believe his Word gives courage to the people that serve him. A comparatively small number of persons know of and appreciate these truths, because only a few know God and rely upon his Word. Those who do know Jehovah and who are in a covenant to do his will now have a grave responsibility resting upon them, the proper performance of which affords them an inestimable privilege and is accompanied by suffering. They need courage, and Jehovah provides that which is needed for them. Such courage comes only by knowing and relying upon the Lord, and they know that they are being fully backed up and supported by the Most High.

In all the efforts put forth by the Lord’s army of locusts no physical force or carnal weapons have been used. There has been no physical destruction of any houses, property or person. Locusts do not work that way. Jehovah’s witnesses, under command of their Head, Christ Jesus, turn on the light and the heat and devour the false teachings of men. The Lord continues to furnish his people with evidence that he is at the helm and that as long as his witnesses remain faithful to God and his King they may be certain of having everlasting blessings bestowed upon them by His hand.

The duty of Jonadabs is to do what they can to protect their companions. If telling that which actually exists would work injustice and injury to others, it is not at all displeasing to God to decline to tell the same. (A statement becomes a lie when it is made with the purpose and intention of working injury and injustice to another.) Those who do not show consideration for the lives, property and well-being of Jehovah’s servants, and who do not therefore safeguard the kingdom interests of the Lord, will not have any reason to expect that they will find protection and safety at Armageddon.

In the instructions issued by Joshua Jehovah is made most prominent as the One who would bring about the overthrow of the enemy. Jehovah, being present, was pictured by the ark of the covenant being carried around by the priests, and his name and presence must be heralded by the full and complete number of the priests, who by their trumpets blown drew attention of all to the presence of Jehovah. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Throughout “Christendom” hypocrisy now holds sway. Not one nation therein has any interest whatever in God’s kingdom under Christ Jesus, but, on the contrary, opposes the same. The religious practitioners among the Jews charged God’s prophets with carrying on a campaign of hate, and they persecuted the Lord’s messengers for that reason. Today the faithful men and women who at the Lord’s command go about “Christendom” giving testimony to the people concerning the fulfillment of the kingdom prophecies are charged with carrying on a campaign of hate. The religionists hated Jesus and persecuted him, and he told his followers plainly that they would be hated for the same reason.—John 15:19-22. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/39</span></p>

Since then his organization universal and his organization capital, as if full to overflowing, have dropped down upon his faithful ones great blessings and joys. This undoubtedly refers to the fresh Kingdom joys, which have provided jobs of service to Jehovah for his witnesses, working and looking towards vindication of His name. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Visible ruler's of the “present evil world” erect what they call “legal walls” by enacting laws to prevent anyone from speaking against religion. These walls do not cause Jehovah’s witnesses to stop their work, nor are they frightened at sight of such walls. Knowing that God has commanded his work to be done, and he having promised that the enemy shall not prevail against his faithful ones, those witnesses of Jehovah go straight ahead, trusting implicitly in the Lord and doing what he has given them to do. “They shall climb up upon the houses.” God’s faithful servants go from house to house to bring the kingdom message to those, who reside there, omitting none, and there they give witness to the kingdom because they are commanded by the Most High to do so. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/39</span></p>

Sanctify them through thy truth.” By the truth of Jehovah’s Word they are completely set aside to his exclusive service. Therefore such are commanded to keep themselves unspotted from the world. “Unspotted” means to be free from blemish and from mixing up with this world’s affairs.

That record will be a witness until and during Armageddon that God has miraculously preserved and delivered for himself his people that maintain their integrity toward him.

Christ Jesus is the First and Chief Witness of Jehovah, and one of his titles is “The Faithful and True Witness”. (Rev. 3:14) Everyone who is a true follower of Christ Jesus must also be a witness to the truth. The apostles of Jesus were faithful witnesses to the truth and always emphasized the importance of the kingdom and the second coming of Christ. They were faithful unto death and knew that they must remain dead until the coming of Christ Jesus and his kingdom, at which time they would be resurrected as spirit creatures and ever thereafter be associated with Christ Jesus in his theocratic government.

<p><span class="font5">No one devoted to Jehovah can partake of or take any part with that which is accursed of God. No compromise of the Christian with the world is permitted. (2 Cor. 6:17; Jas. 4:4) Sparing that which God condemns, so as to turn it to selfish gain, is disobedience subject to punishment. Deuteronomy 7:16 states: “And thou shalt consume all the people which the Lord thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them; neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare unto thee.” The entire camp would be a curse until it cleansed itself of that which brings on the trouble.

The Most High, addressing his faithful servants, answers: “For I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.” Be not dismayed at the faces and power of the enemy; and for encouragement look at the other side of the picture. Those who now love and serve Jehovah believe his Word and follow its instruction as their sure guide. By faith they behold a host of heavenly, glorious angels under Christ’s command marching to the battle of Armageddon, and they know that that invisible host shall gain the victory. To the little band of his faithful witnesses on earth the Lord is delivering this message: “[The enemy] shall not prevail against thee.”—Jer. 1:19.

That blood will be shed by the just and righteous Executioner of Jehovah. Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions have obediently and zealously sounded the trumpet of warning, and hence are not guilty, and no blood will be required of them. But the enemy, the religionists and their allies, have repeatedly shed blood of the innocents, and for that they shall be fully paid by Jehovah’s Executioner.

She expected God’s executioner to slay the people of Jericho, and she asked for herself and those of her family that they and all they had be spared and that the Lord might “deliver our lives from death”. Rahab was anxious to have this covenant made and bound with an oath before the day of battle. Likewise the Jonadabs are anxious and diligent to seek protection from the Lord by making a covenant for doing his will and carrying out that covenant before Armageddon.

Those who are wicked are not purchased. Whether the person is called by the Lord and granted life in the spirit or whether his hope of life is on the earth, the course of procedure concerning his purchase is exactly the same.

<p><span class="font5">This suggests that Jehovah’s witnesses are not to disclose everything of their movements to the enemies and to thus permit the enemy to forestall their activities. Let the enemy draw their own conclusions by their distorted minds and then take whatever course they may choose. Christ Jesus, the Greater Joshua, in command of all the forces of Jehovah of hosts, is maneuvering the invisible, heavenly hosts so as to co-ordinate them with the movements of Jehovah’s witnesses on earth. Every movement of both will be harmonious. The movement of the invisible force will begin immediately after the witness work is completed, and the invisible force will attack and destroy Satan’s visible organization. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus, the great High Priest and Executive Officer of Jehovah, with the value of his sacrifice, provides redemption for those who flee to him for refuge, and he is the Executioner of those who remain in the enemy camp and who because of their wickedness suffer destruction in order to offset the wickedness done by them to the Lord and his people. In both cases there is a freeing or delivering by means of a meeting or squaring the obligation, that is, meeting the penalty for sin. The redemptive price provided at Calvary was for those who exercised faith in and obedience to the Lord’s commands. The redemption at Armageddon punishes the deserving ones, that is, the ones who have caused damage intentionally or otherwise.

<p><span class="font5">It is now God’s people whom he has taken out for his name’s sake which come as a swarm of locusts to proclaim the name of Jehovah. They are not great in themselves, either in name or fame or power, nor great in the sight of men, but are regarded by such as very insignificant. They are made to appear as great, however, by reason of the work done and their methods employed to reach the hundreds of millions of people and place in their hands hundreds of millions of copies of the message of warning. These people who are taken out by Jehovah for his name are bold, because this is the day of the Lord’s judgment and his witnesses must be bold and thereby show their love for Jehovah. (1 John 4:17, 18) This does not mean that they are rude, but that they are fearless of creatures, fearing only God. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">God’s kingdom under Christ is the doctrine of paramount importance set forth in the Scriptures. This is true because it is the kingdom that will vindicate Jehovah’s name. The Devil has put forth religion as a subtle means of teaching and causing men to teach doctrines exactly contrary to the kingdom. Religious institutions magnify the importance of men, showing outward loyalty to earthly governments, and the necessity to appear as those who have developed a beautiful character. It is important that one should be honest, chaste, reliable, dependable, and do what is right. That is to be expected, and even required of men who make no pretense of serving God. One may do all these things, claiming to be a Christian, and not be one at all. The important thing for a real Christian to learn is God’s purpose and what is his will concerning his creatures and then to be diligent to obey God’s commandments.

<p><span class="font5">This speaks concerning the great blessings which the Lord promised and which he has sent upon his people, particularly since 1922. Such blessings are not to be attributed to any man, but all honor and praise is due Jehovah. Before 1922 the blessings from him, likened unto rain, came upon God’s people moderately and in just measure according to righteousness. Downpours of truth from the temple and upon them were sent from 1922 onward, and such downpours of blessings continue with increasing force. Such have been a great refreshment to the Lord’s remnant, greatly blessing them and gathering them to the service. They have brought forth and continue to bring forth the kingdom fruits, and the great multitude join therein. TV </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Abraham had nothing to do with the fight between the rulers of Sodom and Gomorrah and their enemies. Abraham and Lot, his nephew, were there, but took no part in that war. After that war between the contending nations was all over and one side seized Lot and his property and fled, Abraham did pursue the invaders, not because he was an ally of the defeated ones but because one of the enemy had seized and carried away Lot, “that righteous man.” Then Abraham pursued the invaders and recovered Lot, and not because he was his nephew, but because Lot was a faithful servant of Almighty God. Thus the divine rule is established that one of God’s devoted servants is justified in acting in behalf of his fellow servants, the servants of God. Lot’s rescue accomplished by armed forces of Abraham was fully approved by Jehovah. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/1/39</span></p>

The anointed faithful ones themselves are wonders to many. His witnesses in these latter days have been used by Jehovah in fulfillment of some of his wonderful prophetic dramas. Jehovah’s strange work on earth now is a wonder to many, and God’s people have a part in it. As to seeing “wonders in the heavens”, Jehovah has opened the eyes of understanding or discernment of his faithful servant class to see the two great signs or wonders in the heavens, which John saw in symbol. (Rev. 12:1, 3) These signs or wonders are the two great opposing organizations, God’s and Satan’s. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/1/39</span></p>

This the present-day enemy does because God’s consecrated people uncompromisingly and unqualifiedly advocate the kingdom of God under Christ. The record of God’s victory was made especially for the comfort and encouragement of God’s people. There Joshua pictured Christ Jesus. Those Israelites who followed and obeyed his command foreshadowed those who today believe on Jehovah and Christ and earnestly and faithfully follow Christ Jesus and joyfully obey his commandments.

You did not succeed in converting and gathering all nations into your religious-political camp; now employ all manner of force to get the people under your control. Your “Catholic Action” appears to serve you well; so go forward and openly announce your alliance with Fascists and Nazis to employ force to gain control of the governments of earth.’ The Lord taunts them by telling them to do their very worst. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The “two men” represented Jehovah’s witnesses, who spy out the land, the modern Jericho, “Christendom.” Jehovah makes clear to them in his Word concerning Satan’s organization. Jehovah’s witnesses have done much reconnoitering in God’s service, they being sent out into the midst of Satan’s visible organization. They have gone forth to the work, trusting entirely in the Lord and well knowing that according to his promise He who directs their paths will continue to do so and to guide and protect them. It has made no difference to them whether or not they knew just why they were doing the work, and what it signified at the time, but all that has been necessary is for them to know they were being guided by the Lord and hence acting according to his will. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1/39</span></p>

All parts and all elements of Satan’s visible representatives are gathered. The gathering work begins after the outpouring of the holy spirit upon God’s approved ones, since 1922. How is the gathering done? Jehovah sends forth his duly commissioned witnesses to declare, and they do declare, his message of vengeance, that his time for final settlement of the account which will vindicate his name is come. He causes his witnesses to proclaim that his anointed King and his kingdom are come. Instead of compromising with the Devil’s organization the faithful witnesses serve notice that within a short period of time the Lord will cut the enemy to pieces.

<p><span class="font5">For the honor of his name Jehovah will save the great multitude. But Jehovah’s witnesses must discharge their responsibility toward them, so that the remnant may be blameless respecting what comes to pass upon the people at Armageddon. They must point out the disaster that will befall all those who do not take the proper course, and must tell them how they may be identified and guarantee their protection from the Executioner. The line of scarlet suggests the blood of the redeeming Lamb of God and the faith of the great multitude therein, and in which they wash their robes, identifying themselves as servants of the Lord God. God’s people must publicly acknowledge faith in that shed blood and openly take their stand on the Lord’s side and serve, to guarantee protection at the time of Armageddon.

This apparent delay was a test to Rahab and her household as they continued to display the scarlet thread and watched from the windows the marching Israelites, not knowing what it meant. Likewise Jehovah’s witnesses have been going about antitypical Jericho for years proclaiming the message, and their activities have brought upon them reproach from the modern-day Jericho-ites. Such has been a real test of their faith, and some who entered the marching have failed in the test; but the real ones have gone obediently and joyfully on.

Jesus laid down his life and received life again in full accord with the commandment received from Jehovah God, which commandment Jesus fully agreed to obey. Carrying out that agreement, God raised Jesus out of death and gave him life as a spirit. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">By Christ Jesus his King and through his theocratic organization Jehovah roars forth his message proclaiming to all creation that the day of final reckoning is at hand. This is not for the purpose of exalting or praising the “locusts”, His witnesses, but for the express purpose of informing the people that the Almighty God is Jehovah. God’s “locusts” have no earthly king, but are under their heavenly King, Christ Jesus, who commands them. He is invisible to human eyes, and he commands and leads the host of the Most High. It is the “voice” of Jehovah uttered by his duly authorized and commissioned Executive Officer, Christ Jesus. “His camp is very great”; that is, very numerous as respects the volume of the message that the Lord sends forth and that his “camp” puts out. He is very strong, and he uses his campers to carry on his work regardless of opposition. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses are in the open before the enemy, with no carnal weapons and no means of striking a mortal blow, if they had such a desire. They do not desire nor are they permitted to use carnal weapons. An effort of the enemy will be made to completely crush those on the Lord’s side. The Greater Joshua, Christ Jesus, the Commander-in-Chief of the forces of the Most High, will permit it to be so, that Jehovah’s witnesses apparently are on the run, and this in order to draw the enemy into the open and cause a combined assault upon those devoted to the Most High. Then would be the time when the Lord commands his force in ambush, that is, the angelic host of heaven, to go into action, and that invisible force obeys the command.

<p><span class="font5">The message of God’s truth, which exposes “Christendom” and her so-called “Christian religion”, shows that religion to be a fraud and a snare, completely separate from and in opposition to Christianity, and hence separates “Christendom” from Christ Jesus, the Bridegroom. The prospect of becoming the bride of Christ was once set before her. Because of unfaithfulness that prospect has been entirely removed and now she is bereft of it entirely, like a cast-off, disowned virgin. Jehovah’s witnesses come with God’s message of truth informing “Christendom” that she has lost the one, Christ Jesus, to whom she supposed she was espoused. What is here said is not directed against individuals nor prompted by hate, but is against a system, which religious system has brought reproach upon Jehovah’s name.

One who is spirit-begotten and anointed and who fails or refuses to proclaim The Theocracy and magnify it above everything else, and who compromises with the enemy, is not proving his integrity. Some because of fear of religionists take a course of least resistance by compromising with the enemy and by failing or refusing to boldly declare for The Theocracy. Such fail to show love for God and Christ. To the faithful The Theocratic Government is the greatest of all truths declared in Scripture.

Being children, they would picture a young, vigorous group, keen of mind, unselfish of heart, and actively pushing forward in performance of their covenant and commission from the Lord. “And they shall prophesy”; meaning, they shall preach the truth. The apostle* in their day did thus prophesy. All the other anointed ones prophesied; that is, they preached or proclaimed God’s message relating to the future, as well as to the present time, and all did so under the power of the spirit of Jehovah.

Satan knows his time is short, and hence he puts forth all his power to control those who know not Jehovah God. The demons are seizing control of the radical element in every part of the earth, and thus that wicked one, the Devil, moves his forces in rapid preparation for the final showdown. To those forces under the immediate command of Gog, the first in command of Satan’s forces, Jehovah now says: “Haste ye, and come, all ye nations round about.” All the physical facts now coming to pass clearly show that “the great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly”.

<p><span class="font5">The enemy still refer to God’s people disparagingly as “self-styled Jehovah’s witnesses”. But that does not at all disturb them, because they know their “new name” which God gave to them, and they delight to bear it. They know their relationship to Jehovah and his King and kingdom. They know that the kingdom is here and that they have entered into the antitypical promised land. No more do they acknowledge the modern Egyptians as “the higher powers”. Henceforth the faithful know and joyfully acknowledge Jehovah and Christ Jesus as the true Higher Powers, and no one of the land is acknowledged as such. Therefore from now on the religionists cannot correctly reproach our God as having failed to keep his promise to his covenant people, and to bring them into the land of promise.

<p><span class="font5">“Lazarus” means “God [is] helper”, that is, one who receives help from God. The rich man gets no help from God, while the beggar receives God’s help in due time. Being a beggar, Lazarus pictures a poor class, not necessarily poor in material things of the present evil world, but in things that pertain to God’s Word of instruction, poor in spirit. “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” Those who become truly rich are the ones who receive their blessing from and through God’s kingdom. The beggar pictures a class of persons realizing that all their help comes from the Lord, and who cry unto the Lord for help and receive it because of their faith in God and their obedience to God.

David’s zeal was stirred to incandescent heat and, trusting wholly in the power of the Almighty God, he boldly engaged the giant in combat and slew him and put the Philistines to flight. David exhibited the faith of God’s people which they must now have and exercise. When David was installed as king of Israel, the Philistines attempted to destroy him. Twice the enemy joined battle with David, at Mount Perazim and at Gibeon, and David completely routed the enemy. It was God who gained the victory for his faithful servant David, and it is God’s sure promise that at Armageddon he will again fight for his people as he fought for them at Mount Perazim and Gibeon.

<p><span class="font5">The root of bitterness in the heart grows into malice, and therefore must not be permitted to remain there, because it may result in defilement and destruction of many. Unless one puts bitterness out of his heart, and pursues a course of righteousness, being governed entirely by the law of God and his commandments, one could not be finally approved of the Lord and made a part of the kingdom. The way that those of the kingdom are required to travel often seems very hard; but to the faithful the results are grand beyond description of words or appreciation of the human mind. To have a part in the everlasting kingdom of God is the greatest favor that could come to any creature.

I have declared, and have saved.” The miraculous deliverance of Israel from Jordan’s flood waters made a name for Jehovah, and to them his name therefore was famous. Likewise the bringing of his “faithful servant” class across the antitypieal Jordan into the kingdom conditions, and anointing them as his witnesses, made famous the name of Jehovah amongst those who believe on him.

Therefore their joy is cut off from their mouths, by the plagues which Jehovah sends upon them, and it is Jehovah’s antitypieal locusts that carry the plague message. Having rejected Christ, the King of the world, religionists and allies have no access to the joy of the Lord, and do not therefore 'drink the fruit of the vine new with Christ Jesus in the kingdom’. Only those who love the Lord, his appearing and his kingdom can partake of the Lord’s wine new with real joy with Christ Jesus, who has gathered them into the temple.

There are those who sigh and cry because of the abominations done in “Christendom”, and such persons must have opportunity to hear and learn what is the way of escape and where they may find safety. They must call upon the name of the Lord for mercy and express their determination to serve him and keep his commandments to promote the kingdom interests. When must this be done? Now, at the present time, before Armageddon. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">He shall deliver thee from the snare.—Ps. 91:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A snare that stands at the head of the list of those prepared and set by Satan is religion. Jehovah God is the source of life. Salvation belongs to him alone. He grants salvation only to those who obey him. A creature that claims to serve God and who at the same time gives reverential honor, worship or praise to any creature or thing in connection with such worship, is practicing religion. Jehovah commands all to worship Christ Jesus because Christ Jesus is the express image of his Father Jehovah, and is the Executive Officer of Jehovah always carrying out Jehovah’s purpose. But any creature performing a ceremony of adoration or worship, in which reverential honor, praise, or worship is given to a man, to woman or any image or thing, is ignoring God’s commandment and is practicing religion in direct violation of the command of the Most High.—Ex. 20:2, 3.

<p><span class="font5">The visible part of God’s revealed organization has been repeatedly defiled by unconseerated and wicked persecutors who once claimed to be of God’s organization. But since Christ’s coming to the temple he has not permitted the unrighteous to remain with his faithful servants, but has gathered them out and continues to gather out those who become offended at him and his organization and who work unrighteousness against the Lord and against his anointed. No “stranger” who is opposed to God’s kingdom or who persecutes his people shall remain in his organization. When Armageddon is done all in God’s organization shall be holy unto Jehovah. After Armageddon no violence or assaults will be committed against God’s people, bceause the wicked will all be gone. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Who shall ascend the mountain of Jehovah? and ivho shall stand in his holy place?—Ps. 24:3, Both. </span><span class="font5">Some might enter the temple, being approved, and thereafter might not stand or remain therein by reason of failure to meet the requirements. It is written that everyone in th° temple must show forth the praises of Jehovah. (Ps. 29:9) Those brought into the “holy place”, the temple, must devote their faculties to right and righteousness in obedience to God’s law and must refrain from touching or having anything to do with the Devil’s organization, which is unclean. Such must not desire vain things, religion. They having made a covenant to do God’s will, that covenant must be faithfully kept and performed. To break it willingly means that such have sworn deceitfully and hence could not remain in the “holy place”. That covenant with Jehovah requires the creature to avoid religion and to proclaim only the truth. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">12/1/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">There is nothing in the earth to which man has an inherent right as against God. Everything that man receives is by God’s favor. That is particularly true with reference to those in the covenant with Jehovah. It is his purpose that He is carrying forward, not man’s purpose. What God has purposed, that he will do, and no creature will be permitted to pursue his own selfish course contrary to God’s purpose and at the same time receive God’s approval. In due time everything that willfully takes a course contrary to God’s will shall be destroyed. Repeatedly God’s Word emphasizes the absolute necessity for the creature to be obedient to God the Creator. There could be no exception to that divine rule.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">God hath revealed them unto us.—1 Cor. 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Aside from Jesus, the prophetic pictures do not foretell or foreshadow individuals and do not show God’s dealing with individuals, but do set forth the work of God and Christ in which God’s faithful people are privileged to have some part. Individuals are not important, but the work in which they engage is important. Generally the faithful are permitted to have some part in the Lord’s work relating to the execution of his purpose, and thereafter they are permitted, by the grace of God, to see how they have been led by his hand and used in his service. Such revelation serves to increase their faith and courage, and hence they joyfully sing God’s praises and say: “By his hand he leadeth me.” Surrounded by the enemy that viciously assaults the remnant and their companions, these, full of faith in the Lord, say: “In thee, 0 Lord, do I put my trust.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Rahab’s request would require real work on her part and on the part of her relatives, if they would receive protection and salvation from Jehovah at the time of Jericho’s siege. She would be required to ask those of her household and relatives to “come into the safety zone”, and tell them the reason why they were urged to come. She must do that very thing whether they gave heed to the warning or not. It is incumbent upon those Jonadabs who hear and believe the kingdom message to give warning to their relatives and others who might desire to seek the way of salvation, and such testimony and warning they must give, whether the others hear and give heed or not. Rahab must prove her faith by her works. The Jonadabs must prove their faith by their works. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/39</span></p>

And Joshua had commanded the people, saying,</span><span class="font5"> Ye </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice.—Josh. 6: 9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The blowing of the trumpets would be good music to Rahab in Jericho and would be a signal for her to gather her relatives into her house on the wall, and to continuously display the “line of scarlet thread” over the wall. She relied upon the promise made to her by the spies that deliverance would come, and she must perform her part of the arrangement. Likewise the Jonadabs, whom she pictured, must do their part, trusting wholly in the Lord. The marchers were forbidden to speak to anyone on Jericho’s walls. They knew they were under Joshua’s command and that they must trust in the Lord and be obedient. Too much talk often results disastrously; and instructions given by Joshua prove this fact.

<p><span class="font5">Looking back, the commander saw the city of Ai on fire. “Trapped!” would be the astounding cry. Likewise when the Lord Jesus begins his aggressive assault upon the enemy at Armageddon, not one of them will find a way of escape. If some for a time hide themselves, they will be searched out and destroyed. By then all opposers of Jehovah on earth will have donned their fighting garments of identification, and will be easily found out, and no mercy or quarter will be shown them by the Lord’s fighting forces. Satan’s forces at that point will have abandoned religion and will be going exclusively after Jehovah’s faithful servants, and then will quickly meet defeat. Joshua’s turning back on the pursuers shows the angelic forces joining in the destructive work. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The wicked shall be a ransom</span><span class="font5"> [ (Young) </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">an atonement] for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.—Prov. 21:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This scripture applies at Armageddon. In the expression of Jehovah God’s wrath through Christ Jesus at that time the wicked and willful transgressors must be put to death as the price of freedom for the righteous and upright, to the end that the righteous and the upright may be delivered from the abuse and oppression by the wicked and willful transgressors. By the death of the willfully wicked transgressors they ransom the righteous. The reason is, because the wicked and transgressors will not submit to any other arrangement for the freedom of the righteous and the Lord enforces this remedy against them. Isaiah 43: 3, 4 supports this: “I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba. for thee. . . . therefore will I give men [the wicked men] for thee, and people [the transgressors] for thy life.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This parable includes the members of the body of Christ, because they form a part of the kingdom of heaven. If the purchase or buying that is mentioned in the parable concerning the kingdom of heaven referred to the ransom price the body members would have no part therein, because they do not have any part in the purchase of the human race. That the body members of Christ have a part in the kingdom is true beyond any doubt. The suffering of Jesus had nothing to do with the purchase price of mankind, but it was by his suffering that he learned obedience and proved his integrity and faithfulness to Jehovah God and became the heir of eternal salvation and of the kingdom.—Heb. 5:8, 9.

<p><span class="font5">All who love God fear him with a godly fear; hence Joel 2:1 states: “Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, . . . let all the inhabitants of the land tremble.” God’s anointed remnant and the Lord’s “other sheep” are the only ones who really fear God and who therefore take the wise course. Knowing that the sound of the trumpet is a message of Jehovah, which means a complete deliverance for his faithful servants and at the same time the destruction of the wicked and the complete vindication of Jehovah’s name, has the effect of filling the faithful with a godly fear and with rejoicing in their hearts. They have the joy of the Lord. The Lord Jesus Christ, the King, has appeared to their joy, and they know he shall vindicate Jehovah’s name: “Hear the word of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name’s sake, said, Let the Lord be glorified; but he shall appear to your joy.”—Isa. 66: 5.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses are not engaged in any fight against human creatures, but are carrying forward a good work by proclaiming the message of God according to his commandments. All who are on the side of Jehovah and his King must of necessity stand firmly together and work faithfully and harmoniously together, because they have a common purpose and interest, and that is to serve God and his King and to receive God’s approval. Necessarily then, the Devil and all his agencies, particularly religionists, oppose God and oppose Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions. The time must come when God would express his wrath against religion, and that time has come. He sends forth his witnesses to declare his truth, which exposes religion as the instrument of the Devil, fighting against God’s kingdom. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This is the day of war, and God’s promises give full assurance to his people. These precious promises were long ago recorded, and now God reveals to his faithful ones the meaning thereof. An invasion of the “land” or condition of Jehovah’s witnesses, such as by an army of locusts, would tend to work great injury to them, but the Lord assures his people that they need not fear because of such invasion. The enemy will not be able to destroy the earthly state or prosperity of the work of His remnant now on earth. Regardless of all opposition the faithful remnant must and will push on with zeal and rapidity, because we are now in the day of Jehovah. Hence the prophecy long ago written applies: “In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not; and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.”—Zeph. 3:16.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses are not moved by the influence of any earthly person. They have no earthly leader or earthly king. They are the servants of Jehovah God by Christ Jesus, and Christ is their Head and King. Jehovah’s words are: “I will pour out my spirit,” that is, God’s holy power, upon all devoted to him to do the work of proclaiming his message to the nations. The pouring out of his spirit is first upon the Head, Christ Jesus, and through him His spirit is poured out upon the members of his body. Christ Jesus is the Head and Leader of all of such, and no man can teach or lead such commissioned ones. “The anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you; but as the same anointing teacheth you.”—1 John 2:27.

Did he tell his brethren to quit work and hole up to safeguard themselves from enemy attacks? He certainly did not, but made ready for self-defense. The Jews did not have swords there merely as a bluff, but to be used when necessary to protect themselves and to prevent the enemy from interfering with the work God had commanded them to do. Can anyone successfully contend that the enemy of God’s kingdom can compel God’s servants to now cease their work which God has commanded them to do in order that they might avoid trouble? The watchfulness of Nehemiah and his brethren, wno even slept with their clothes on in order to be ready, is a striking example for those to whom God has committed his kingdom interests.

<p><span class="font5">How wide or great shall be the proclamation mentioned in this command? It must have the same extent as Jesus commanded concerning this gospel of the kingdom, which must be proclaimed to all the world for a witness. That means the proclamation is to all outside of God’s “holy nation”, who compose the kingdom class. This message from Jehovah attracts attention of those people of good will toward God. Hence the “great multitude” are informed of their privileges and come from all nations to serve Jehovah and his King. God says: “I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat.” (Vs. 2) In obedience to his command the proclamation is given by his witnesses, who thus have part in God’s work toward gathering the nations.

The nations pursue the selfish course for commercial and political gain. Some call themselves “Christian” nations, but all are opposed to God’s kingdom by Christ Jesus. Every religious institution under the sun has some part in the affairs of this world. That explains why rulers of the nations of this world do not hate the religious systems, as Jesus stated his followers are hated for his name’s sake. That proves that these religious systems are not for Jehovah’s name nor the name of Christ Jesus, but against God and his kingdom. The instructions given to those who are for the Theocratic government are that their citizenship is in heaven and their duty is to be entirely faithful to the heavenly government by Christ Jesus.

Self-exalted and self-righteous ones, having their attention called to the beggar class, have exhibited their own selfrighteousness and prayed hypocritically, like the Pharisee: “I thank thee that I am not as other men are.” The religionists do not feed the people of good will, but try to starve them. About the only crumbs that have fallen from the rich man’s table of modern times have been “purgatory for pay” and “restitution for the future”. Instead of helping to feed them, those of the “evil servant” class have been diligent to hinder the work of the Lord and his faithful witnesses in carrying the kingdom message to those who will form the “great multitude”.

Do you believe that Christ Jesus is the Vindicator of Jehovah’s name and that the day of vindication is at hand ? Do you believe that the conflicts in times past, when God showed his power to his covenant people, were pictures of what is now at hand and will come to pass? If so, then “according to your faith be it unto you”. (Matt. 9:29) Let your eyes of understanding, now being opened by the Lord Jesus, be set entirely upon the Lord, and know that he will accomplish Jehovah’s purpose and, therefore, that it is our privilege and duty to stand firm and fear no creature.

The Jonadabs must show by their course of action that they have faith that Jehovah at Armageddon will give the victory to Christ Jesus and his faithful followers over Satan and his crowd. Rahab feared God. The Jonadabs must fear God. Let them take notice of the importance of faith and works, and that the two must go together, that the Jonadabs may by their works prove their faith. The Lord has provided that they shall be and are companions of the remnant and that it is their privilege and duty to have an active part in the public witness work concerning the kingdom.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses have come to well know that they must study his Word and be fully obedient to his law if they would have God’s guidance and protection. They are not to turn aside to discuss with opponents their views; they do not need to hear the arguments of all opposers; they are to rely solely upon the Lord and, knowing that his Word is true, they go forward, and in so doing the Lord says to them that “thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest”. God’s people must feed upon his Word, “this book of the law.” They must study it and carefully meditate upon it at all times and follow carefully the instruction given therein.

He must believe that Jesus Christ is the Redeemer and Deliverer, and then take action in harmony with that belief. Otherwise the inherited condemnation abides on such one to destruction. (John 3:36) He must call upon the name of Jehovah before the battle of Armageddon begins; and this he must do by hearing, believing and acting upon the information of truth brought to him by those who are witnesses for Jehovah, and particularly upon whom God has placed his spirit.

Nothing thereof must be spared or saved. No one must desire or be willing to receive anything thereof for selfish purposes, as Achan did, who suffered destruction. Exception was made only as to Rahab and her household, because she had shown faith in God and favored his servants. Rahab and her household for good reasons were spared.

The telling of the truth exposes the Devil, his organization and his religious schemes; therefore the fight is, Satan against everyone and everything that is for God and his kingdom or theocracy. Jehovah’s witnesses have no desire, and make no effort, to build up a religious or other organization on earth. Their sole mission is to bear testimony to the people in obedience to God’s commandment, and to inform the people that Jehovah is the Almighty God and that his theocratic government is their only hope.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the Lord your God into the midst of Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone.—Josh. 4:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses not only came out of the persecution heaped upon them by the Jordan’s angry religious waters still alive and still going on in 1931 and thereafter, but they brought out with them “twelve stones”, that is, the records made for them and against the enemy in courts, in legislative bodies, and in the public newspapers, which records shall stand for ever against the enemies of God and his kingdom. The Lord has maneuvered the enemy so that they have made criminal records against his faithful witnesses, which records stand as a monument against the enemy. Let no one mistake the fact that the Lord will keep a record of the persecution of his people which shall stand against the persecutors, and regardless of the enemy’s efforts. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Removing of the shoes by Joshua appears to be a sign of self-abasement and willingness to completely obey the Almighty God and Christ the King. Those devoted to Jehovah are anxious to know and do his will. God’s anointed people have but recently learned that they must no longer honor men and laud and praise them as leaders, whether dead or alive, and that therefore they must proceed to clean up by putting away such system as that of “elective elder” and other means of man worship. No longer now do they look to such as their teachers and leaders. They begin to have the proper appreciation of the Lord’s words, that all who exalt themselves shall be abased and that it is their privilege and duty to give all honor and praise to Jehovah and his King. 17 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lord’s ministers, mourn.—Joel 1:/, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s locust plague has consumed “Christendom’s” crops so that there is no fruit or drink; hence their religion cannot be carried on as in the past. There is no real wine of the Lord among them to make glad the heart, and no bread from heaven to strengthen them. The Lord’s message today makes known that he has cut off all such religious offerings through his true sanctuary, and that includes the “elective elder” crowd. The sanctuary has been cleansed, and now the true worshipers of God must “offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousnes”. (Mal. 3:1-3) The Lord does not ask for nor will he receive religious offerings, because the same are a reproach to his name. Such offerings God regards as an abomination. 17 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">We must therefore conclude that he is guiding those who love and serve him, and that the Lord is now saying to his people concerning the fight of the enemy against them: “They shall not prevail against thee.” No foe can successfully fight against God and the people whom God has chosen for himself and who are blessed by his protection. To the faithful followers of Christ Jesus, who now bear testimony to the name of Jehovah and his kingdom, he says: “There is none like the God of [the upright], who rideth upon the heaven in thy help and in his excellency on the sky. The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms.” Jehovah and his King shall gain the complete victory. Those who maintain their integrity toward the Lord shall share in that victory. Be very courageous, therefore, and go out to meet the enemy; and as we go let us continue to sing the praises of the Most High.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Joshua stretched out the spear.—Josh. 8:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The enemy left their city with no protection. This shows that they played into the hands of the Lord, who is wiser than any creatures. Jehovah timed the manuevers of the battle forces, and so he gave command to Joshua to stretch out his spear, and Joshua obeyed exactly at the appointed time. In flashing his spearhead Joshua would have to turn about with his face toward the pursuing enemy. Immediately the men in ambush, seeing that flash of his spear, advanced to the attack. This pictures the signal given by the Commander-in-Chief, Christ Jesus, to the angelic host of Jehovah to attack and destroy God’s enemies. The great battle of Almighty God will grow with intensity. Fiery destruction will reduce Satan’s organization to a burnt-crisp ruin. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Without the ransom sacrifice no man could be saved, because he is a sinner by inheritance from Adam and upon all sinners the “wrath of God”, that is, God’s just condemnation, falls because of imperfection resulting from sin. God cannot approve an imperfect thing. Not by the exercise of justice, but by the exercise of his loving-kindness God provides that Jesus may buy men and that, when men exercise faith in God and in Christ, such will have the benefit of being released from the bondage of sin and given an individual opportunity to prove their integrity toward God and, so doing, receive salvation to life by and through Christ Jesus. But certainly those who fail or refuse to believe could not have salvation. If they could, then it would mean the conditions of belief are of no effect.

<p><span class="font5">Those who have damaged or committed violence against God’s little ones are indebted on account of their wickedness. Such are bound to pay and they pay with their lives at Armageddon. They cannot pay the debt to the damaged one, because that one is dead; they must pay to the dead one’s nearest of kin in flesh and blood. Death must be meted out to that slayer by the slain one’s nearest of kin, “the redeemer of blood,” Christ Jesus, and he removes the debt by exacting the life of the slayer. Only the Lord’s pool’ and needy are redeemed unto life. By poor and needy are meant those who come to a realization of their own utter inability to save themselves and who desire to be saved, and who exercise faith in God and in Christ Jesus and apply to Christ Jesus to be saved or redeemed. The wicked who refuse God’s provision abide under condemnation from Adam’s sin. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font5"> 6/1/59</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is the God of peace. He is not a pacifist, as that word is generally defined. In his own due time he makes war against those who blaspheme his name and defy him and who oppose The Theocracy. Jehovah God is always neutral in a controversy or war between nations or peoples who are on the side of Satan and a part of Satan’s world. Christ Jesus is “the Prince of Peace”, and when his kingdom is fully in operation there will be no end of peace. But Christ Jesus is not a pacifist. In God’s due time and at God’s command he makes war upon Satan and all of his organization and will completely destroy all the wicked. When there is a controversy or war between those who are of Satan’s organization Christ Jesus is always neutral as to the contending sides.

The locusts have an oblong-shaped head, somewhat like that of a horse, and he uses his head. Locusts are not afraid, nor is the horse afraid, and it is to such that the faithful witnesses of Jehovah are likened. Big religious leaders and allies try to frighten them into submission and to cause them to cease their witness work, but the faithful hear and obey the Lord Jesus Christ, who says: “Fear them not.” The locusts resemble the horse going into battle, and so Jehovah’s witnesses push on in the fight regardless of opposition.

They delight to make known to the people that the Theocracy is the only hope of mankind. “For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.” Religionists bow to idols in the form of hailing men and saluting flags, which stand as symbols of men for protection and salvation. Such shall be confounded. Exactly on the contrary, those of Zion maintain their integrity toward God and praise him and, continuing faithful, they shall never again be brought into captivity or shame.

The leaders thereof are enraged and are shaken at the sound of the message of God’s kingdom, and in their desperation they resort to every possible means to stop it. The enemy tried to destroy the Lord’s work during the World War, but after the war the witness work was revived and soon thereafter the “strange work” began in earnest. (Rev. 11:11-13) The Lord is now in command of his faithful witnesses, and the earthly governments are gi ring evidence of how they are quaking by enacting laws and making orders in council to prevent the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses. Seeing the inability of the police to stop the witness work, the ecclesiastics tremble in rage and fear. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/30</span></p>

That destructive work will culminate when Jehovah’s “strange act” at Armageddon is performed. All who received the anointing of the holy spirit and who acted upon God’s command were completely separated from the worldly organizations in which religion rules. Every one of the anointed, being commissioned by him to act in his name, must proclaim his message of truth, which is destructive to religion. To receive God’s approval all such must faithfully perform the terms of the commission and therefore make themselves the objects of reproach by the enemy.

<p><span class="font5">Moses did not receive any punishment or even a rebuke from Jehovah God for what he had done. Since then every nation has invoked the law of self-defense, extending that right of self-defense to the protection of near-of-kin. Do the Scriptures approve of a Christian’s defending himself against an unlawful assault and using force to repel such assault? Self-defense is the right of every man to ward off an attack and to use such force as to him appears to be necessary to safeguard himself from personal injury or injury to his property. The same right of self-defense may be exercised by him for protection of near relations or close friends, his brethren. Such is the law of the nations, but that law does not rest upon tradition, nor upon the conclusions of men alone, but finds complete support in the Word of God.

<p><span class="font5">For centuries Jehovah has permitted the enemy to operate without let or hindrance, but now he will settle the account with the enemy for all time. He maneuvers the enemy right to the place or condition of judgment and battle. He not only selects the battlefield, but draws out the enemy and all the people who support the leaders therein and compels them to show on whose side they are lined up. He forces them to show themselves to be against the Theocracy. The division is now rapidly taking place. The people of the nations are dividing themselves into the two classes, one designated “the goats”; the other, who are of good will toward God, are the “other sheep” of the Lord. Jehovah maneuvers the enemy and stirs them up and causes his witnesses to have part in this work by declaring the day of his vengeance.

His name shall be vindicated for ever. Centuries ago he 'went to Egypt to redeem to himself a people and to make him a name’. (2 Sam. 7:23) Now Jehovah, the almighty God of battle, goes to Armageddon to deliver those who love him and to for ever vindicate his name. “Armageddon” is the “assembly of troops”, which the enemy attempts to destroy. God has gathered all nations to the scene of that great battle, and all the warriors of heaven are there. Jehovah sits as Supreme Commander and the final Arbiter. It is the day for the vindication of his name. The scene is thrilling beyond description! Each one awaits with great anxiety the clash of the final conflict.

<p><span class="font5">Thus is pictured the complete destruction at Armageddon of all who have supported religion and form a part of Satan’s organization. The armed men that were permitted to act in taking the city and destroying the people pictured the invisible army of the Lord. That will mark a time of tribulation such as never was known before, and there shall never be another. Rahab and her household had been warned by the spies to remain in her house, and they were saved. This shows that the great multitude must remain in the city of refuge until released by the will and act of Jehovah.

<p><span class="font5">Abraham stands for Jehovah God, and his bosom represents God’s favor toward the beggar class. The Lord’s “other sheep” were alienated from God and were kept in ignorance of God’s provision for them by reason of the religionists’ influence. In this condition they remained until after Christ’s coming to the temple and beginning the work of gathering to himself his “other sheep”. At the temple he is accompanied by the host of “holy angels”. These the Lord at the temple uses to get this message to his servants on earth, and thus he uses the angels to carry out his purpose in gathering his “other sheep” to himself. Those who have heard and accepted his message and devoted themselves to Jehovah and his kingdom have a changed condition, and are truly carried away into the favor of Jehovah, the Greater Abraham, into the bosom of the Lord, where they find rest and peace.

Jehovah God will prove to all creation and compel all to know that he is the Almighty, whose name is Jehovah. He has purposed it, and he will do it. This is the time for boldness in the Lord, the time to be very courageous. God is opening to his people the meaning of his prophecies recorded of old. The time for his victory and vindication has come. Zion, of which Christ Jesus is the chief as head of God’s anointed, is “the apple of his eye”, and none can with impunity touch God’s anointed. God’s time has come to exalt his name, and Zion is his instrument to bear testimony to his name.

<p><span class="font5">Joel was “the son of Pethuel”, which name means “enlarged of God”. Joel, being a witness of Jehovah, represented the faithful remnant of God’s anointed, who are made and constituted the witnesses of Jehovah. The father of such witnesses is Jehovah God, because they are his children. Therefore the meaning of the name of Joel’s father would call attention to the fact that the remnant were loosed or released from the bondage of Satan’s organization; and that the mouth of such was enlarged or opened by the Lord that they might deliver the kingdom message; and that their ears were made to hear and to obey Jehovah’s commandments in delivering his message. The word of the Lord which came to Joel was an emphatic command which he must obey, and he must deliver the message as commanded.

They attack in the Lord’s strength, and Jehovah continues to provide them with all the needed strength. The enemies of God’s kingdom that shield, hide and protect themselves behind political and judicial walls find that these are inadequate to shield them. Jehovah’s witnesses do not stop, but go on regardless of the walls. Since they have seen and appreciated the theocratic government, which directs them, they have been rapidly disciplined and trained, and act orderly and fearlessly. Like locusts, they do not stop at tall obstacles, but climb right over them and keep going forward. Jehovah sends his locust army, who go right over and through those walls with his message.

When those of good will “see the abomination of desolation” named by the prophet Daniel and Jesus, that is, “see” the combine that is determined to rule the world instead of Christ standing where it ought not to stand by assuming such authority, then it is time for the Jona-dabs, as Jesus warned, to flee “to the mountains”, meaning to God and his organization under Christ. As Rahab gave counsel to the spies, so the Jonadabs are on the alert to give sound advice to Jehovah’s witnesses in harmony with God’s Word, that they might escape traps set for them by the enemies of God’s people.

Every one of his holy prophets, without a single exception, prophesied concerning the kingdom of God and its establishment, with Messiah as Head thereof. When Jesus came to earth he began the work by announcing the kingdom of heaven. He stressed the kingdom with his disciples, and those faithful apostles, while they lived, magnified the importance of his second coming and the kingdom. That which is magnified throughout the Scriptures is God’s government, which government is theocratic; that is, Christ Jesus is the Head of the royal organization carrying out Jehovah’s purpose. God promised to set up his government. Since “theocracy” means a government by the Supreme Being, that promised government is of necessity a theocracy.

<p><span class="font5">Turning the moon into blood could be done only by Almighty God, and such he does to show his displeasure toward his enemies. “The moon under [the] feet” of God’s “woman” is symbolic of his organization guided by his law. (Rev. 12:1) So Jehovah’s provision is that his organization shall be guided in the right way. Those who have the Lord’s spirit are guided by his light into paths of righteousness, and they delight to do his will As to the enemy, they have no such light, but in darkness continue to oppose God. The rulers all hold to and practice some kind of religion, and God’s Word of light appears to the enemy as a dead and hideous thing. The religious practitioners, particularly, hate the truth, because to them it speaks bloody vengeance and destruction. To such enemy God’s King and kingdom are loathsome.

The combined enemy marching on the faithful servants of Almighty God to destroy them are certain to fail. Like Jeremiah, Jehovah’s faithful servants now on earth go out before the enemy with the message, and as they go they know that they will meet strong opposition. They know great difficulties are before them, and for their encouragement Jehovah now says to his faithful people concerning the enemy: “They shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/1/39</span></p>

When the Lord revealed to his faithful ones his capital organization Zion and their relation to it, then they discerned the true meaning of the “highway” and they immediately began their march thereupon. All the righteous must go upon it. The remnant must take the lead upon the highway and teach others who are seeking the way to righteousness, that they may know the way to come to God and Christ Jesus.

<p><span class="font5">A friend is faithful and true, because “a friend loveth at all’times”. (Prov. 17:17) The relationship of friends between Jehovah and his beloved Son is eternal. Jesus, because of his love for his Father, laid down his life that he might vindicate his Father, that being the will of Jehovah. Thus Jesus did that he might be the One to fully carry out God’s will and vindicate his name. It was the love of Jehovah God that permitted his beloved Son to lay down his life that he might be the ruler in The Theocracy and the Deliverer and blesser of obedient men. Such love is known only to Jehovah and those of his organization. “He that loveth pureness of heart, and hath grace in his lips, the king shall be his friend.” (Prov. 22:11, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font5"> Such may have the King, Christ Jesus, and the King Eternal, Jehovah, for friends.

<p><span class="font5">The movement of a gigantic swarm of locusts is very noisy, but it is a harmonious noise. Forward, active movement of Jehovah’s witnesses is now and for some time has been carried on with much publicity, harmonious sound, and what they have done has been done openly and aboveboard. They warn the people of the near approach of the battle of Armageddon. They do their work systematically, in a well-organized manner, and their movements and sound of warning are much like the oncoming of war chariots hurrying to the battle. It is Jehovah’s war organization, the invisible part of which is rapidly approaching to destroy hypocritical and unfaithful “Christendom” and will do the real destructive work; but God’s remnant go before and announce the fact.

<p><span class="font5">One who had unawares, without enmity or malice, slain another might escape the redeemer or bloodavenger by fleeing to and remaining in the city of refuge until the death of the sin-atoning high priest. Antitypically one such must flee to God’s organization under Christ and there remain under the sin-atoning blood of Christ Jesus, trusting in that shed blood as a means of protection and salvation. Those who in the present time have unwittingly done violence to God’s law and against his people may gain redemption from destruction through the redeeming blood of the great High Priest, Christ Jesus. At Armageddon the destruction of tile enemy of God is a redemptive price for those slain by the wicked. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1 /39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">It is the day of the Lord’s vengeance, and the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion.—Isa. 34:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah always squares the account with the enemy. For a long period of time God permits the enemy to carry on without let or hindrance and then Jehovah chooses his own due time to fully pay the enemy for all they have done. The present time is the day of Jehovah, the time when his faithful witnesses must declare the “vengeance of our God”. This must be done before the pay-off. The religionists now make a great controversy with Zion, God’s capital organization, which is represented on earth by Jehovah’s faithful witnesses. God first informs his faithful servants of his purpose to duly recompense the enemy, and then he sends his witnesses forth to serve notice on the enemy that within a short time God will destroy them. Their end will be in war at Christ’s hand. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession.—Deut. 32:49.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Israel was the only nation of earth to which God ever assigned any territory and authorized them to take possession of it by force. Hence Israel’s wars for gaining possession of what belonged to them by gift of Almighty God foreshadowed Christ Jesus’ taking possession of the entire earth, a gift to him from Jehovah, and Christ acts under command of the Almighty. The Israelites did not invade that which belonged to others. They took the land that belonged to them by gift from Jehovah. Participation in war was by Almighty God’s command, and their obedience to his commandment was more acceptable than sacrifice. (1 Sam. 15:2.0-23) Such wars were righteous. Hence God heard and answered the prayers of his typical people as long as they obeyed him. Victory was not granted by superior military equipment, but because God exercised almighty power for them.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses are not armed with carnal weapons, but are thoroughly organized and under command of the great Field Marshal, Christ Jesus. The army of the Lord set in battle array is not a democratic form of organization, but is under the control and command of the Lord Jesus Christ, Jehovah’s King and Field Marshal, and therefore is a theocratic government. Jehovah’s witnesses, his army of ‘locusts”, are without fear of creatures because they know they are backed up by God’s almighty power. The faces of his “faithful servant” class are as “adamant, harder than flint”, made so by Jehovah, who says: “Fear [the religionists] not, neither be dismayed at their looks.” Regardless of opposition faithful witnesses go straight on doing their assigned work. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Rahab refused to lend herself to the enemies of God. Even so those of the great multitude refuse to render assistance to the persecutors of Jehovah’s witnesses. Rahab used her wits and her head and aided the two men .to get away. She was no idler, and this is shown by the fact that she had gathered flax and placed it on her roof, and she used that to a good purpose. “Who can find a virtuous woman? . . . She seeketh wool and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.” (Prov. 31:10, 13, 30) Likewise those of the great multitude are not idlers, but are industrious and fruitful. They may in the world’s eyes appear unclean and disreputable, like a harlot, but are diligent and appreciate their privileges of serving Jehovah.

<p><span class="font5">This means the restoration of the kingdom that had fallen down and concerning which all the prophets foretold in prophecies uttered by them at God’s command. The setting up of the kingdom is the important thing for the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and those who call upon the name of the Lord then shall have the blessed opportunity to obey him and receive life everlasting. Of course, restoration or setting up of the “kingdom which had fallen down’ also means the restoration of all the truths concerning the kingdom, which were hidden by reason of men’s resorting to religion and thus being turned away from the truth. The Scriptures show that religionists have no interest in the kingdom of God, but are in opposition to it, and are hypocrites.

<p><span class="font5">Those servants who had been faithful and who were brought into the temple and given instructions through Christ Jesus up till 1922, were now to obediently march right ahead into what to them appeared to be an unsurmountable barrier, which appeared to block all progress and would never open. What then ? They were to stand and look to Jehovah, and not become discouraged or turned back. Nor were they to lean on some human or to human reasoning and advice, but were to trust solely in the Lord God and Christ Jesus in all their ways and with confidence that he would show them the way forward and how to get out. The Lord’s bringing his witnesses across the antitypical Jordan is full guarantee that he will clear out the enemy and extend his kingdom control over all earth. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Christ Jesus is the head over Zion, around which Jehovah has erected an impregnable wall. Into that place of safety God, through Christ, has gathered the faithful anointed. The people of earth who are of good will toward God and his kingdom, upon hearing the kingdom message and learning of Jehovah’s gracious provisions, are hurrying to that defensed city, that they may have complete protection there until the storm of Armageddon has passed. Outside of that fortified city or organization there is no protection for anyone, and God’s announced purpose is to destroy all who &lt;ire outside thereof. Those who think to escape the terrors and destruction of Armageddon by taking a neutral place and remaining inactive are greatly deceiving themselves. Those who do find safety under the Lord’s organization cannot wait until Armageddon begins and then seek such protection. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The miracle shows that only those of good will and who will compose the great multitude will survive Armageddon. The waters on the south of the priests in Jordan and which disappeared and were completely swallowed up in the Dead sea, show that those who fall into Armageddon go into a place where there is no life. Thus it is shown that the great mass of humanity rushes unhindered and unchecked and entirely heedless to all warning, down the great broad way, the end of which is everlasting cutting off, the fate previously decreed by the Lord for the “goat” class. The waters, standing on the north and forming a great wall of protection, show the people of good will that are spared at Armageddon. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">When one assumes a position in the Lord’s organization for selfish gain or to make a name for himself, then, like Aehan, he is robbing Jehovah by failing to 'bring all his tithes into the storehouse of the Lord’, full performance of which must be done before Armageddon. All things in the earth, including praise and honor, belong to Jehovah, and not to men. Men who attempt to grab what belongs to Jehovah are stealing from God. just as Achan did at Jericho. Jehovah deals with his people as an entire organization, and not merely with individuals. If anyone in God’s organization follows a course for selfish purposes or selfish aggrandizement, and in doing so retards full obedience to the Lord’s work as commanded by Him, such would constitute a curse and must be put away before the Lord would be with his people and give them prosperity in the work. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/15/39</span></p>

The invisible host of the Lord, pictured by the armed men and which host do the real slaughter work in due time, march with the remnant of God’s “royal priesthood” on the earth, and thus God’s invisible host, his angelic company, seiwe as a safeguard to the van of and as a rear guard of his servants on earth. The invisible servants of the Lord are round about the visible ones to protect them. (Ps. 34:7) Understanding and appreciating this part of the prophetic picture, Jehovah’s faithful covenant people know they are protected by the Most High and the enemy can do nothing to them except by God’s permission.

<p><span class="font5">Of that terrible conflict Armageddon and what shall come to pass the faithful need not fear. Jehovah will put his hand over and shield and protect them, and be a complete refuge to them. The strength of Jehovah’s people is in the joy and joyful service of God and his King. As Nehemiah builded the walls of Jerusalem amid great trouble, so now the Lord’s faithful promote the kingdom interests amid great tribulation, and now they truly say: “The joy of the Lord is [our] strength.” (Neh. 8:10) Religionists put their hope in the totalitarian ruling powers, antitypical Egypt, the Devil’s organization, and their strength shall utterly fail them. Spiritual Israelites, God’s faithful people, put their hope and find their strength wholly in the great Theocrat and his King.

The “Lazarus” class, the people of good will, awaken to the fact that life is set before them, and, accepting this, they awaken to peace, joy, and life everlasting. The “rieh man” class awaken to the faet that they are rejected by the Lord, and they hear his judgment pronounced ; therefore they awaken to lasting contempt. The Lazarus class “God helps”. The rieh man class God declines to further favor. The rieh man elass abides in death, ‘although he liveth.’ (1 Tim. 5:6) Because of faith and obedience the Lazarus class become far removed from their former condition and find rest under the Lord’s organization.

He knows that, once having been enlightened concerning God’s purpose and his kingdom, to then turn again to the “beggarly elements” of the world means complete disapproval of God, ending in destruction. To him who visualizes the kingdom the full-time service to the King and kingdom is dearest to his heart, and he fears to lose the opportunity of service, and he will not voluntarily withdraw himself from that service for any reason. He hates flattery, because he knows that it is a net into which he is liable to be caught and destroyed. He yields not to flattery of even the one nearest to him. He refuses to give flattery to men, knowing the danger. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15/39</span></p>

Also Jehovah shows his witnesses that he is using them in the earth, guiding them to do his work in having a part in pouring out the “seven last plagues” upon “Christendom” from 1922 on, which plagues have tormented the enemy. Poured-out blood is a symbol of death and that which is deathdealing. Such was foreshadowed when Moses smote the waters of the Nile river, which became bloody afterward. Thus was revealed that the waters of religion and commerce are death-dealing when viewed in contrast with the waters of light and truth which proceed from Almighty God.

Do we believe that this is true ? If we do, then there can be no excuse to hesitate or to be inactive in the service of bearing testimony to the name and purpose of the Most High. To now be fearful of the enemy means to fall into the snare of the Devil. To entirely trust in the Lord and prove that trust by full obedience, means deliverance and salvation. There is now no middle ground for Jehovah’s witnesses and the Lord’s “other sheep”. To all such the Lord says: “According to your faith be it unto you.” For centuries Jehovah has furnished the opportunity for men to prove their integrity toward him. Now the greatest of all opportunity is offered.

When he takes a creature into a covenant with him, that creature could never have cause for doubt as to Jehovah’s carrying out His part of the covenant. The man who seeks Jehovah with a pure and whole heart is blessed. He must always know that whatsoever Jehovah has promised, that He is certain to perform. Every one taken into a covenant with Jehovah must prove his faith and faithfulness if he would receive Jehovah’s approval. That means that the creature must be put to the test and under it prove his integrity toward God. When the crucial test is applied and the creature seems overwhelmed with the burden, he must take courage and know that, if his faith remains strong and he continues faithful, Jehovah will bring him through in safety.

<p><span class="font5">The blood of the bullock represented the lifeblood of Jesus, which lifeblood was poured out as an offering for sin. The Most Holy of the tabernacle pictured heaven itself, where Jesus Christ appeared, presented and offered the asset or valuable thing, his right to human life, as the purchase price for Adam’s offspring. Thus Christ Jesus, God’s great High Priest, the spirit creature, appeared in heaven and his offering was accepted by Jehovah, and Christ Jesus became the owner of all of Adam’s offspring that willingly comply with the rules of Jehovah governing salvation. Thus God laid the foundation in Christ Jesus for the salvation of man, and there is no other possible means of salvation. TV </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">God discloses His purpose to extend his mercy to those who hear the testimony and prove their integrity toward Jehovah. To hold that because God is just he is under obligation to extend mercy to everyone is entirely inconsistent and wrong. To hold that because of justice God is bound to give every creature the benefit of salvation by the ransom sacrifice is wrong, and wholly unsupported either by reason or by the Scriptures. The challenge of the Devil raised the question of God’s ability to put any man on earth who willingly would remain faithful and true to God when he was subjected to the test imposed by the Devil. God has proved Satan a liar and proved his own supremacy in that many men up to the present have maintained integrity toward God.

This distribution of literature and witness work is not a religious movement, but the publication of God’s Word, and done at his commandment. When the strange work of proclaiming the truth is done such will never be repeated, because there will be no occasion to do so.

He stood firmly against all the religious influence of the Devil and his crowd, and because of his faithfulness to Jehovah Jesus was caused by the religionists to bear the same reproach which the enemy had heaped upon Jehovah’s name. All followers of Christ Jesus, that is, Christians, must follow in his footsteps because called to that purpose, and all must suffer reproach.

The Theocracy is the government of the world by the immediate command and direction of the Almighty God, administered by the Lord Jesus Christ. It is the kingdom long ago promised by Jehovah and therefore must take control of the affairs of the universe.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.—2 Tim. 2:3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One could not be a soldier of Jesus Christ and at the same time a soldier of the nation that is under the supervision of God’s enemy, the Devil. Hence the Christian Goes not entangle himself with the affairs of this world. The war of one nation against another nation is not the fight of the followers of Christ Jesus. If the nations of this world desire to fight, that is their affair entirely, and it is not at all the affair of one who has made a covenant to be faithful to Almighty God and his King and Kingdom. The Christian must not interfere in the least manner with the war between the nations. He is not to interfere with the drafting of men of either nation that goes to war. That is the affair of the nations of this world. The Christian must be entirely neutral, without regard to his place of birth or nationality.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s faithful servants have no occasion to fight one another. If they are found fighting with one another, that would be proof conclusive that thej' are not serving God and his King. They march forward in unity. They do not get out of line with one another. They do not try to mind the other fellow’s business, nor to interfere with another in the discharge of his assigned duty. Each one knows his assigned position and duty and is diligent to faithfully serve where he is put. AU keep themselves in the peace of God and maintain their fuU peace and harmony among themselves, just, as God foretold his faithful ones must do. “Though in among the weapons they fall, they shall not stop.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> None of these things stop the onward march of Jehovah’s faithful servants.

<p><span class="font5">No one is commanded to fast from the truth. It is the truth of God’s Word that he brings to the people and invites them to feed upon and live. Religionists do not have the truth, but have substituted for it the doctrines of men. Now the Lord tells them to cease from such and turn to the truth and feed upon what God has provided. Those among the religionists who would find relief must obey this command and fast from what religious leaders have been serving them. To obey that command of Jehovah would put such in a class with Christ Jesus, and upon them would fall reproach like that which fell upon him. The clergy steer clear of all things of that kind. The honest among religionists are anxious to obey the Lord, and they do so, and they find relief, protection and blessings under the Lord’s organization.

Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications; and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced.—Zech. 12: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those devoted to God and his kingdom, and who were privileged to do the “Elijah work” prior to 1918, were pierced and the work was killed, and for that reason they did mourn. The name of Jehovah and of his beloved Son were pierced through by the enemy in 1918, and there was great mourning among God’s consecrated people. Upon those faithful ones God poured out his spirit, and they must participate in his “strange work”. The “strange work” means a destructive work toward religion and the advocates and practitioners of religion, because all such are in opposition to the Theocracy. Proclaiming God’s name and Kingdom works destruction upon such opposers. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I lay down my life for the sheep.—John 10:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus did not become a substitute for Adam in death, but became the purchaser of Adam’s offspring by paying over a thing exactly similar to what Adam forfeited. Therefore the life of the man Jesus, which he gave up, is a price exactly corresponding to the life of perfect Adam. Jesus purchased for Adam’s worthy offspring the right to life, and it is his privilege to minister life according to God’s will. (Rom. 6:23) Christ Jesus is “the everlasting Father”. As a father he has power and authority to bring into life creatures who have died and to give life to as many as he will according to Jehovah’s pleasure. Such rescued life Jesus could rightfully bestow on those only, and no others than the ones for whom Adam had lost the right to life. Since he lost it for all mankind, Jesus can bestow life on only such of Adam’s race as meet the required rules of Jehovah. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">If</span><span class="font5"> an officer of the law in the exercise of his official duty places a Christian under arrest, then the person so arrested should not resist the officer but should go quietly with him and await the proper time to have a hearing and make his defense before the properly constituted tribunal. Such course is acting in an orderly and proper manner. The officer may have no right to arrest the Christian or interfere with his work, but the officer is acting in behalf of the state and there is a proper place to determine the question as to whether he is right or wrong. When Christians are assembled together to hear discussed or study God’s Word no one has the right to attempt to break up that assembly. When any attempt to do so they may be properly resisted and such physical force be used as may appear reasonably proper. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/39</span></p>

Plant your religious hirelings in high official places of present world powers. Raise your false cry against Jehovah’s witnesses, and denounce them as Communists or reds. Stir up the secular press and radio owners and induce them to join you in hope of strengthening your wicked position. You have for long influenced the people against God and his kingdom, while you have falsely claimed the right to rule the world in the stead of Christ. Now go to it, you big men; get together and see what you can do.

<p><span class="font5">The Devil and his invisible angels have gathered all nations of “Christendom” together against God’s faithful people. Visible to human eyes are the leaders of religion and their allies, particularly the dictators of the world, cruelly and maliciously bent on destroying all who proclaim Jehovah’s name, his King and his kingdom. By faith God’s people also see Christ Jesus and his invisible hosts surrounding the faithful ones on earth with full, complete protection. The Lord’s faithful witnesses completely rely upon God and Christ, and know that victory for the Lord is certain and that flieir own complete deliverance is guaranteed by the Lord, because he has said to them concerning the enemy: “They shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.” Everyone who believes and relies upon that promise will be courageous. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Thus are faithful Christians commanded to proclaim the name of Jehovah throughout the earth just preceding the battle of Armageddon. Jehovah’s theocratic government has come and the people must be told, and all of good will toward God rejoice because of this good news. The faithful Christians named by the Lord as his witnesses now go about the earth proclaiming the name of Jehovah and his theocratic government. Jehovah's witnesses are not religionists, and indeed they could not be supporters of any religious system and at the same time be witnesses to the name and kingdom of Jehovah. They are not in competition with any religious organization. Their sole duty is to tell the truth concerning Jehovah and his kingdom, which theocratic government will vindicate God’s name and bring salvation to men of good will. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">“Christianity” means full obedience to the law and commandments of Almighty God as set forth in the Bible, and therefore the worship of God in spirit and in truth, disregarding all forms or formalism. Christ Jesus always obeys the law and commandments of Jehovah God; and therefore Christianity means the following the lead of Christ Jesus in obeying God’s law and commandments. Religion is the Devil’s chief instrument to lead the people into his trap. Among all the religious institutions on earth today there is not one of them magnifying the importance of God’s kingdom. Those persons on earth who are completely devoted to God and Christ, and who strive to obey God’s commandments, are the only ones who advocate and advertise the theocratic government, the Kingdom.

<p><span class="font5">Like the spies, Jehovah’s witnesses going forth to the work have been tested as to their faith in God and their willingness to obey instructions and to go to that class of persons that are less popular than others in the world, even into the places inhabited by disreputable persons, and to there carry the message to a people not of the highest reputation. As Jesus made himself of no reputation, his faithful witnesses do not stop to consider what their reputation might be. Jonah had a like test put upon him to carry the message to Nineveh. The reputation that one has among men may gain him nothing and may lead to his downfall, whereas one’s standing with the Lord means everything.

<p><span class="font5">Practitioners of “Christian religion” are in an implied covenant to obey God, but they do not perform their part of the covenant. They are not God’s servants. On the contrary, they bring reproach upon Jehovah’s name. God will not permit them to have any excuse for their course of action, but sends them his word and demands that they give heed to the warning. Thus the Lord commands his witnesses to carry his message to “Christendom” at the present time, and even to those who do not ask for it or even want it. Jehovah’s witnesses go to the people, within the hearing of the leaders, and deliver to them Jehovah’s message. It is not the message of hate, nor is it delivered because of hate, but it is God’s message of fair warning and is delivered at his command, notifying all of his purpose to vindicate his name.

<p><span class="font5">Those in the covenant for the Kingdom must love God and keep his commandments. It is by the faithfulness of Jehovah, which is always certain, and by the faithfulness of those whom he has taken into the covenant for the kingdom, that his name will be vindicated. In due time the people who live shall worship Jehovah because of his manifested faithfulness. (Isa. 49:7) Only those who are faithful, prompted by love, and who thus prove their faithfulness unto death, receive the crown of life. Those who are in the covenant for the kingdom have this admonition: “Be ye holy; for I am holy.” Jehovah is wholly and unreservedly devoted to righteousness, and so those for the kingdom must likewise be wholly and unreservedly devoted to righteousness, manifested by the kingdom of God under Christ. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/15/89</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah made it clear that he is the power that saved the Israelites. No human power could have caused that wall of the river to stand up there until they got across. The ark of the covenant testified the presence of Jehovah God and that he was the One that was holding baca the destructive forces until his covenant people should be safely across. Jehovah and Christ his King served as protection of God's people, both in the front and in the rear. (Isa. 52:12) The Lord God wards off the enemy and guards and protects his people from the rear as well as in the front. They are under the shadow of his hand.

<p><span class="font5">Those of the great multitude, whom God has recently helped and now comforts, are greatly rejoicing. For many years the Lazarus class received that which was hurtful to them, but now having come into God’s favor they enjoy great comfort and peace. The message which comforts them is at the same time a message of despair to the “evil servant”, “the man of sin.” This rich-man class is tormented by the kingdom message, while those who are for the kingdom greatly rejoice. The “evil servant” and others of the “man of sin” were once in line for the kingdom. Had they shown faith and obedience they would have received kingdom blessing. Now they wail and gnash their teeth against the remnant and great multitude. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">12/15/39</span></p>

Jehovah’s “strange work”, pictured by the six-day marching, must be completed before his “strange act” begins on the seventh day. The marching continued for seven days, and no stopping for the sabbath. Likewise Jehovah’s witnesses continue to carry forward the witness work, and no stopping for rest days. They know that God will perform his “strange act” just at the proper time, and with them there is no doubt about it. If one begins to doubt, and grows weary, it is just too bad for such one.

The truth discloses that “Christendom” has no cause for joy but is empty and void, having none of the “joy of the Lord” and no part in the kingdom of God, which shall vindicate his holy name. “Christendom,” which practices the so-called “Christian religion”, brings no joy or good cheer to God or man. That is a great calamity to those “drinkers of wine” of Babylon and who become drunkards upon such wine and who are commanded by the Lord to wake up and view their deplorable condition. Hearing the alarm of the Lord by his witnesses makes the religionists exceedingly mad, and they froth at the mouth and threaten all manner of violence against Jehovah’s witnesses.

But that will avail them nothing. They cannot deceive the Greater Joshua, because he will search out all God’s enemies. Those would-be farmers will be completely wiped out. The true followers of Christ now will not fear or be dismayed, but with full faith in the Lord and with real courage will advance to the work and do so not slacking their hand or efforts.

The kingdom message brings no light of comfort to the enemy, but, on the contrary, that message causes them to murmur and complain and speak evil against and fight against Jehovah’s anointed, and the judgment against the enemy discloses that for them there is nothing but dismal and complete darkness. (Jude 6-13) During the battle of Armageddon the enemy will be in complete darkness and without hope. The remnant and their companions have the light of Jehovah’s Word and are guided by that light. They have the spirit of their Lord and Redeemer. They go on in their work amidst great opposition. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/15/39</span></p>

The sons of Eli, the high priest of Israel at Shiloh, were wicked; and those wicked sons pictured “the man of sin”, which composite “man” is made up of the “evil servant” class, and religious persecutors of God’s people, and their allies. Concerning such it is written: “Therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.” (1 Sam. 3:13, 14) What befell Shiloh pictures what shall shortly come to pass upon the religionists of “Christendom”.

God’s faithful remnant have now been delivered or redeemed from Satan’s organization and will be completely free therefrom when the Lord at Armageddon destroys everything pertaining to Satan’s organization, and then all who survive shall see the salvation of Jehovah In behalf of his people. God’s anointed remnant have been free from Satan’s organization since recognizing that Jehovah and Christ Jesus are the only “Higher Powers”.

To those who love Jehovah and the appearing of Christ Jesus, his King, the trumpet gives forth a sound that fills their hearts with joy, announcing the day of jubilee. To those who practice religion the trumpet of God gives a sound of distress. The religious leaders refuse to recognize that Jehovah’s day is here. They do not want that day of Jehovah, and they refuse to hear of the battle of Armageddon.

His faithful ones have learned that, in order to withstand the enemy, they cannot rely upon their own ability, but each one must be fully equipped with the armor of the Lord and rely upon him. His covenant people have learned that the time is here for a complete showdown with the Devil’s crowd and that therefore this is “the evil day”.

How can a spirit-begotten one of God’s remnant now on earth be assured that he may continue to have God and Christ Jesus as Friends? Mark the words of Jesus in answer to that question, at John 15:13, which show that the greatest love one can have is to die for his friend. Then Jesus added: “Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.” (Vs. 14) What motive prompts one to keep the commandments of the Lord? Love, the expression of unselfishness. Love for whom ?

Having made a solemn covenant to do the will of Almighty God and having become the true followers of Christ Jesus, such are no longer any part of the world.

For many centuries he has waited for this hour, that he might vindicate his Father’s name, and which will constitute his fullness of joy. It is a time of great joy to his heart when he hears Jehovah thus say to him, and to his heavenly host acting under the command of Christ, the great Field Marshal. Now the time has arrived when the knife must be thrust into Satan’s vineyard, to cut Satan’s vine loose from its moorings deep in the earth. It is to be cast into God’s winepress and there trodden and destroyed. In connection with putting in the sickle is included the gathering of the nations to the place of final conflict.

The result was that Haman was hanged on the gallows he had built for Mordecai, and in the battle that followed the Amalekites were completely wiped out. This prophetic drama disclosed Christ Jesus and his angels destroying all enemies and delivering those who serve Jehovah. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/1/89</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">What acts have you to settle with me that you feel justified in persecuting those who represent me and who belong to me ? Modern Tyre, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, has long been permitted by the Lord to operate her political racket without interference. His faithful servants have never been guilty of violence or any unlawful acts against the Hierarchy. They have never even called in question the liberty of that organization to practice their religion, and never objected to their freedom of speech. Jehovah’s witnesses have only obeyed God’s law and commandments in pointing out to the people the distinction between religion and its practice and the true worship of Almighty God properly called “Christianity”. This they do in obedience to God’s commandment. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/89</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">One in a covenant with the Lord may be working in His organization beside one who does not please him. He may think he has cause for offense because of the action of others of the Lord’s organization who are serving; but if he has a vision of the kingdom he will not permit that dislike of others to be an excuse for separating himself from the Lord’s organization and its service, which he has undertaken by the Lord’s favor. He will have in mind that God is conducting his own affairs according to his own sovereign will, and that the Lord alone chooses his own servants. He knows that God alone is right and righteous, and if he has a vision of the kingdom he loves God and loves his law and so he continues in peace and contentment to serve in the place where he is put, and that without offense. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 11/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance.—Joel 2:32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Necessarily it follows that whosoever shall not call upon the name of the Lord shall not be delivered. That makes it imperative for Jehovah’s witnesses to carry out their commission to proclaim his name, his kingdom and his vengeance at the present time. To now be permitted to declare the name and kingdom of Jehovah and the approaching hour of his wrath upon all wickedness, is an unspeakable privilege granted to those upon whom he has put his spirit. The message boldly announces the supremacy of Jehovah, and this done in the midst of religious opposition makes it possible for those who hear and obey to find protection and salvation. When must one call upon the name of Jehovah, that deliverance may be had? Not after the battle of Armageddon begins. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">At the present time the accursed thing is the religious organization and its allies called “Christendom”. The thing is accursed because doomed for complete destruction by Jehovah’s Executive Officer. “Achan” means “trouble”, and those who follow in his course always get into trouble. He pictures those spirit-begotten ones in line for the kingdom and who become unfaithful and bring trouble upon Jehovah’s organization. Those unfaithful ones in his organization become troublesome or serious troublemakers within the visible organization of the Lord. This, if left unchecked, would cause difficulties in the organization, leading to disaster. Therefore Jehovah brings the same to light and into the open that all may see and profit by what is done.

<p><span class="font5">All who receive the outpouring of the holy spirit and who continue to abide thereunder must be active in the service of God. Those upon whom the spirit of God is poured out through Christ Jesus are members of “the body of Christ’’. Is there a possibility of such losing that anointing and falling away? The Lord Jesus says: “If a man abide not in me, he is cast [away].” (Vs. 6) Those who fail or refuse to bear the fruits of the kingdom, that is, to proclaim to others the life-sustaining truths of the kingdom, could not abide in the Lord. Surely this means that one might pass the test, enter the temple and receive the anointing, and then fail to carry out his commission, and fall and be cast away. Those receiving the outpouring of the spirit must be the servants of the Lord. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">All of Joshua’s forces engaged in the slaying work represented all the unseen angelic forces fighting under Christ Jesus' command at Aimageddon. In that fight none of Jehovah’s witnesses on earth will have any part. Their part is to participate in God’s “strange work”, to sing forth his praises. Since it does not appear that there was any singing after the slaughter began, this supports the conclusion that the “strange work” will be done when the slaughter work begins. The destruction of Ai was so complete that it pictures complete extermination at Armageddon of every part of Satan’s visible organization in order that the earth may be entirely clean preparatory for the execution of the divine mandate concerning the Jonadabs’ filling the earth.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—1 Tim. 2:5, 6, Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The human perfection once possessed by the perfect man Adam (which human perfection carried with it the right to life, which life and right thereto were forfeited by Adam’s willful disobedience) is purchased or bought back or ransomed for Adam’s offspring, who were prevented from receiving that life and right thereto by reason of Adam’s sin. Those who accept God’s provision for their purchase, and who comply with God’s fixed rules concerning the same, are privileged to receive the benefit of the ransom price. By his own lifeblood Jesus ransomed or purchased life and the right to human life for those of Adam’s offspring that are saved. God desires all men to be saved and to come to an accurate knowledge of the truth who comply with his provisions. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Lord does not command that his people shall go about in grief and sorrow before the world, nor even before one another. Outward signs of grief would count for nothing and could not be pleasing to God when indulged in that others might look upon such action. True sorrow of heart because of failure to do God’s will is manifested by one toward Jehovah, and not for the purpose of being seen by men. There must be a truly contrite spirit, a genuine heart-sorrow because of failure in the past to show complete devotion to God and his kingdom. There must be a true inward sorrow, which the Lord alone sees; for he is the one whose approval must be had and enjoyed. It is not his will that his sincere servants perish, but that they should turn to him when they see the right way, and, so doing, receive his blessings. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The religious Israelites conspired together to kill God’s faithful servant and prophet, Jeremiah. Present-day religionists and their allies conspire together to kill Jehovah’s witnesses, of whom Jeremiah was a type or pattern. ‘The religious conspirators have digged a pit to take God’s anointed, and hid snares, traps laid by the clergy and their religious allies against Jehovah’s witnesses, for the “feet” of Christ, his last body members on earth.’ “Yet, Lord, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me: forgive mot their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight; but let them be overthrown [at Armageddon] before thee.” Such conspirators do not have the benefit of Christ’s ransom sacrifice at Armageddon or thereafter.

<p><span class="font5">The Jonadabs flee to God’s organization under Christ Jesus, and that they must faithfully remain under the protection thereof was foretold above. That requirement is exactly in harmony with the law of God governing those who fled to the cities of refuge and also to the blood-marked houses in Egypt at the time of the passover. To remain inside of the Lord’s organization prior to and during the expression of his wrath at Armageddon means safety and preservation. To disregard his commandment and go outside into the world and seek the favors and protection of men means destruction. “His blood shall be upon his head.” Full protection was guaranteed to Rahab and her household if they faithfully held to the agreement and obeyed instructions; and so it is with those who undertake to serve Jehovah God now.

<p><span class="font5">The faithful will not fear death at the hands of the enemy. All who will be of the royal house must die in some maimer, and some may die by the violent hand of the enemy. ‘Mischief framed by law’ will not cause God’s faithful ones to compromise or to slack the hand of unstinted devotion and service to The Theocratic Government. Christ is enthroned as King, and now here, and stands for The Theocracy. Who now is on the Lord’s side? There is no middle ground. Those who are for Jehovah and his kingdom will now stand firmly against the enemy, and, thus standing, they will win. To his faithful ones Jehovah says: ‘That crowd of enemies over against you will fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you, for I am with you to deliver you.’ </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/15/39</span></p>

Not only is he ready for the fight, but he welcomes it and invites the enemy to line up, saying to them: ‘Get ready for the fight; you have been boasting what you are going to do. Now do it!’ Jehovah’s time is here to vindicate his name, and so he invites the enemy to advance; and this he does by causing his witnesses, the remnant and their companions, to go out among the people and fearlessly proclaim his judgments that are written. Those who truly trust him delight to obey this command, and they with boldness proclaim the Theocracy. To the enemy Jehovah says: ‘Surround them completely. Encircle my faithful witnesses and do your worst to them in your cruel laws. Take away all liberty that your national laws once guaranteed.’ W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/1/39</span></p>

For centuries the enemy has proceeded in an arrogant manner, reproaching Jehovah’s name and inflicting cruel punishment upon God’s people. The payday is at hand, and the foot of the enemy shall slip and slide, because the due time has come. There will be no delay, but what is coming upon the enemy will come in a hurry. It is the day of calamity upon those who reproach God’s name. Religious leaders are the ones who have brought the greatest reproach upon Jehovah’s name. In their wickedness they have reached the climax, and the time for Jehovah to duly pay them off has come. Seeing this, his people rejoice.

In the prophetic picture Jehovah maneuvered the combined enemy and permitted them to come up against his people. In this was pictured “the last days”, the time of great peril, the time which now is at hand. Jehovah defeated the enemy, and will again defeat them. Shall his covenant people now on earth fear or be dismayed because of the enemy marching against them? Jehovah will show his strength in behalf of those devoted to him.

<p><span class="font5">The fulfillment hereof began in 1922 and continued until the end of 1931, inclusive, by which time all the Lord’s faithful servants, that is, the “laborers” in the Lord’s “vineyard”, had been brought into the service among the people (pictured by the Jordan waters), and these servants were there paid the “penny” by receiving at the Lord’s hands the “new name”, to wit, “Jehovah’s witnesses.” Experiencing the miraculous protection of Jehovah in bringing them through the waters alive, they were then Jehovah’s witnesses and to them he said, and still says: “Ye are my witnesses .. . that I am God.” From that time on they must fulfill their commission by bearing testimony to others of and concerning Jehovah, his name, his purpose, his King, and his kingdom.

<p><span class="font5">When Jericho should fall, Rahab’s house in being on the wall would put her in a very dangerous position, and only the power of God could save her. The position of the Jonadabs of the present day is dangerous, and the fall of Satan’s organization “Christendom”, which is certain to come, would mean their destruction unless those Jonadabs find protection with the Lord. But as Jehovah’s witnesses spy out the land in “Christendom”, the Rahab class of people of good will toward God discern that Jehovah’s witnesses are servants of the Most High about whom they have heard, and they desire to learn more about God and his ways and to have his protection; therefore they readily receive God’s messengers and do what they can for them.

<p><span class="font5">The “nation” is God’s holy nation, or people for his name’s sake, and such nation is represented on earth by the remnant of God’s anointed people. Associated with the remnant is a company without number, made up of those who are of good will toward God and who constitute the Lord’s “other sheep” and whose hearts are right; and they join with God’s holy nation, and they all work together in harmony. Against “Christendom” God sends his locusts to devour and devastate the products of the land. (Vs. 4) The locusts work together, just as God’s holy nation moves forward in a harmonious action. They have no earthly king, but are led by the Lord, the invisible King. “The locusts have no [earthly] king, yet go they forth all of them by bands.”—Prov. 30:27.

<p><span class="font5">The members of the great multitude must be diligent in doing what they can to gather others who are of the othei sheep of Christ Jesus. Such obligation on their part is emphasized by his words at Revelation 22:17. Jonadabs need not expect to have God's favor and protection if they are inactive, receive the truth, and then do nothing toward making it known to others. Many Jonadabs, almost immediately after learning of the kingdom, busy themselves in taking the kingdom message to others; and this they do by going from house to house with the phonograph and literature and by informing the people who will hear of God’s gracious provision for them if they give heed to his words.

By his prophet Jehovah tells the people what they should do, but the religious leaders refuse to hear. Those of good will and who are getting their eyes opened to the truth are shown by the prophet as crying unto the Lord. Instead of the religious clergy leaders’ joining with the common people of good will in this crying unto the Lord, they continue to call down God’s blessing upon the political and commercial schemes of the world and at the same time try to destroy those who do bring God’s message of good cheer to the hungry ones.

Today those who have a vision of the Kingdom and an appreciation thereof and who continue with such appreciation can never withdraw from the service of the Theocratic organization. Having once been privileged to enter the Kingdom service and then willingly withdrawing therefrom means the certain and complete end of that person. Complete faithfulness to the Theocracy is required of everyone who enters the kingdom. All must be faithful even unto death. The faithful men of old who shall be made princes exhibited that same degree of faith and faithfulness. Those who will form the great multitude must have and exhibit a like degree of faithfulness, even unto death if required. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">12/1/39</span></p>

Thus he has ‘left behind him blessings’ since 1922, such as had not been enjoyed by them before. “A meal offering, and a drink offering, unto the Lord,” has been graciously provided by Jehovah for his faithful servants that they might serve him in verity and offer to him an offering in righteousness. No one else has received such blessings from the Lord. As Jehovah’s witnesses go forward in the strength of the Lord, having a part in his “strange work”, their blessings continue to increase and their joy is greatly enlarged. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/39</span></p>

Jehovah waits upon the shout to be given. Not that he needs it; but such is like a faithful report rendered by the “faithful and wise servant”. It is not at all unlikely that at the time of the shout by the earthly witnesses of Jehovah the heavenly hosts, invisible to human eyes, “the sons of God” in heaven, will shout as they did at the laying of the foundation of the earth.

Truths of the Bible set forth in publications by Jehovah’s witnesses have been seized by religionists and destroyed. In their religious newspapers they have roasted, and some maliciously lied about, the Lord’s people and have misapplied Bible texts, and therefore tried to make it appear that Jehovah’s witnesses are unpatriotic, and anti-Christian and sedition-ists. Everything that belongs to the Lord and that should be devoted to his service religionists have seized and used for their religious temples, to make it appear that Jehovah’s witnesses obey a God unable to protect those who faithfully serve him.

<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures furnish no precedent or authority for a Christian to engage in war for one nation as against another, for that all such nations are against the great Theocratic Government and hence the fight between nations is not the fight of one in a covenant to do God’s will. The Israelites’ wars, which Jehovah approved, were for the purpose of taking possession of their own land. Outside of their own territory assigned to them by the Lord they were not authorized to extend their warfare to any more territory at any time. When the holy land was invaded by other nations the Israelites were authorized to fight in a defensive war against such invaders. In wars between the nations in the outside world beyond the boundaries of the Tneoeratie territory of Israel they were commanded to remain neutral.

Those people who hold to religion, even though they may make themselves believe that they are Christians, have great sorrow of heart and great vexation of mind. They are without food.

As long as men are in the flesh, however, they must have chastisement or discipline, because it is under such conditions of discipline that one learns obedience and proves his integrity toward God. (Vss. 5-11) Without chastisement or discipline, and without continuing faithful under such circumstances, one could not prove his integrity toward God. Brethren of the Lord, while in the flesh, find that they have differences or misunderstandings between themselves, but when such differences or misunderstandings arise each one must take into consideration the natural weaknesses of the other and deal with one another accordingly. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/15/39</span></p>

The dreamers are not obeying God’s command. All consecrated ones showing a dreaming disposition at the time of the temple judgment were rejected by the Lord. All such as since then have been highly impressed with their own learning and greatness, and who have insisted on going their own way, have found themselves in the same class of dreamers. Some who did receive the anointing, and who do not vigorously put forth an effort to fulfill their commission, will be relegated to that class. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Jonadabs, who are lovers of righteousness, see the righteous course of Jehovah’s witnesses, and, anticipating trouble will come to them because they are faithfully delivering the Lord’s message, they take precaution to arrange for the protection of Jehovah’s witnesses and do what they can to safeguard their interests. Such action on the part of the Jonadabs receives the Lord’s approval, and this is shown by what Jonathan did toward David when he resorted to a rus&lt; to throw David’s enemies, his cruel persecutors, off the track. He helped David to get away from his enemies. In this the Jonadabs are pictured, who show their faith in God and Christ Jesus by doing what they can to aid the faithful men and women who bear the Lord’s message to the people at the present time.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation, unto this day.—Josh, 8:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fight and complete slaughter of the inhabitants of Ai was not an act of fiendish and needless slaughter. The name of Jehovah is the great issue to be determined. Satan had challenged Jehovah to put on earth men that would remain true and faithful and who would thereby show Jehovah’s supremacy. The Canaanites that held possession of Palestine were entirely on the Devil’s side and practitioners of his religion. The judgment of Jehovah is that all such shall be destroyed. Had men profited by the expression of his wrath at the great deluge, and the exercise of his power there, they would not later have turned to religion. Having done so, they are in line for destruction. In the battle of Ai Jehovah made a prophetic picture of his purpose to wipe out at Armageddon all of the Devil’s supporters.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him. And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ.—John 17:2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those persons who refuse to know God and Christ Jesus cannot receive life. Many persons to whom the truth is presented and who are shown God’s provision for life and salvation spurn such truth and say, in substance: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font5"> am not at all interested. I am satisfied with what I have.” There is no reason to expect any of Adam’s offspring to receive life who willfully refuse to hear of God’s provision for life. “God is no respecter of persons,” and hence the ransom is for the benefit of all who conform themselves to God’s will or law. The man Jesus gave his life a ransom for all who God wills shall be saved and who comply with the requirements he has laid down. There is no authority to say the ransom sacrifice automatically operates for the benefit of all. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Mercy rejoiceth against judgment.—Jas. 2:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When God sentenced Adam to death justice required the forfeiture of Adam’s life. When he went down into the dust from which he came justice was completely satisfied. Justice has been satisfied at all times since, so far as Adam was concerned. His offspring justly came under condemnation by inheritance, but, not being under direct judgment themselves, God could consistently extend his mercy toward them. It was not a question of satisfying justice by death of another perfect man, and the death of Jesus was not for that purpose. The ransom sacrifice of Christ Jesus is a price exactly corresponding to what Adam lost; but it is not a substitute for Adam, nor was it given for the purpose of satisfying justice, but as a purchase price. Jehovah God makes Jesus “the Everlasting Father”, that is, the One who administers life everlasting, upon condition that men comply with God’s requirements.

<p><span class="font5">Before the coining of God’s “army” of locusts there came a devouring flame unto the religionists. That proclamation of the truth well heated up the religionists, who then began to witness the burning up of their pastures as a result of the heat. Then when the “strange work” has been completed the destructive “flame” at Armageddon comes upon them and finishes the job. Organized, progressive witnessing by God’s faithful servants began in 1922, after Christ Jesus had assembled the approved ones at the temple and anointed them, and it must progress until the conclusion of God’s “strange work”, quickly to be followed by his “strange act”. Hence before the coming of the locust army the heat was turned on; and behind the locusts a flame of fire shall burn. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/15/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Four combined kings came from Shinar and prosecuted war against Sodom. Lot, the kinsman of Abraham, was captured and carried away. Abraham with his servants pursued the enemy, and recovered and fully delivered Lot and all he had. There Abraham pictured God, while Lot pictured the great multitude, which company must be involved in the great battle that is near. In that fight the Greater Abraham will gain the victory for his royal house and will fully deliver the great multitude. To Abraham, the king-priest Melchizedek said: “Blessed be the Most High God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand.” This is an assurance to Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions that God will fight their battles and gain the victory for them at Armageddon.

<p><span class="font5">The enemy's visible forces have been warned that Armageddon is the battle of Jehovah, and that he will destroy all the enemy at that battle. However, that warning is ignored by the Devil’s visible representatives. They laugh at the warning and make no provision against what they are warned is coming, because they are ignorant of the Scriptures and have no faith in what they have read concerning them. The enemy senses an impending danger moving upon them, but do not know what it is. They hear Jehovah’s witnesses announcing it, and they hate to hear it. They do not fear the witnesses, but hate them because they sound warning. They do not believe Jehovah is backing up such witnesses, who are now proclaiming the message of the kingdom.

<p><span class="font5">This could not be construed to mean that it drags along with those purchased every member of the human family, wicked and otherwise, and that these are automatically bought. Would a slave be bought and be given his freedom who refused to obey his master? Those who become members of the body of Christ first come to Christ Jesus and agree to do whatsoever is his and the Father’s will. Then his purchase price applies to them, and they become his and no longer belong to themselves. They are his bond slaves, obligated thereafter to do his will and obey his commandments. They were not purchased against their will, but because they desired to be purchased. God’s rule is the same at all times.—Gen. 47:19-23. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 5/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses run to and fro in the service. They do not run away from the battle, but at his command they increase their speed. They are always anxious to do with all their might what is possible for them to do. The Lord in His Word has foretold diligence in his service. He likens his faithful workers to war horses, and that of itself is a strong indication that the servant should put forth his very best endeavors in this day of heated battle. Hours of field service have been greatly increased by the workers. Some at first thought themselves unable to carry the phonograph, but now have learned that the burden is easy when in the King’s service. Like a war horse they go daily in the battle with greater joy. If any desire to look back and take it easy, let them do so. All who really love God will do what they believe is God’s will, and if they can put in more time they will delight to do so.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And death and heU delivered up the dead lohich were in them: and they were judged.—Rev. 20:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is nothing in type that foreshadows or foretells that Jehovah provides a ransom or redemption for all human creatures down to and including the wicked individuals. Therefore the conclusion must be that during the thousand-year reign of Christ the willfully wicked will not be brought back from death. No one will receive the benefit of the ransom sacrifice or ransom price that has been paid unless he willingly avails himself of that privilege. It appears, then, that God would bring back from death only those who could and possibly would avail themselves of the ransom when coming to a knowledge of the truth, because the ransom is available only for such, and not for those who have no desire to be reformed or saved. The gift of God is not forced upon unwilling creatures. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">6/1/33</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Without doubt the ones responsible for persecution of God’s people during the World War were the Devil’s agents, his chief agent being Gog, leading the host of wicked angels which was said by the prophet to be the army coming from the north and which invisible ones employed religious agents, men on earth, to persecute God’s faithful witnesses. During the “Elisha work” the enemy forces have been measurably held back or restrained by the Lord that God’s faithful witnesses might proceed, but not yet have the enemy been fully removed far off. At Armageddon the enemy will be completely removed by destruction. The Devil and his religious hosts have tried to make themselves appear as very great, gathering all his forces against Jehovah’s government and his King.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses now go forth to preach the truth of God’s kingdom, and not to compel anyone to accept that truth. They place the kingdom message before the people, and it is the privilege of the people to accept or reject it. They are commanded that in doing their work they shall not employ carnal weapons, as the Catholics have repeatedly done to make others accept their doctrines. The weapons of God’s people consist of “the sword of the spirit”, the Word of God. Therefore the apostle’s words strictly apply to the means of carrying on their work of preaching this kingdom gospel. Jehovah’s witnesses are messengers of peace, telling forth the purposes of God, and they have no need of carnal weapons to compel the people to hear the Word of God.

<p><span class="font5">Only God can turn that great light, the sun, into darkness. God expresses his anger against the enemy by bringing darkness upon them. The spirit of God gives light, and the light God withholds from those who hypocritically claim to be his servants but who in fact are the Devil’s servants. All religionists oppose God and his purpose, and hence they are in darkness. Specifically the Lord names the “evil servant” class, which at one time was in the light but now is cast into outer darkness. The kingdom light and truth God makes dark to the opposers, who have cast away his Word. Only those who have the spirit of the Lord see and appreciate the kingdom, and all the others, particularly the religionists, oppose the kingdom, and hence they are in complete darkness.

<p><span class="font5">Some who profess to be consecrated to the Lord are weaker in faith than others, and because of little faith they for a time become fearful. For their aid and comfort Jehovah causes his prophet to say the above words to those who need more faith. Without full faith in Jehovah and his kingdom it would now be impossible for any man to withstand the vicious attack of the combined enemy. Jehovah is the God of comfort, and, that the hope of his people may be strong, he puts into the mouth of his faithful servants this prayer, to wit: “Arise, 0 Lord; let not man prevail; let the heathen be judged in thy sight. Put them in fear, 0 Lord; that the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah.”—Ps. 9:19, 20. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/1/39</span></p>

They are not propagandists for either side of the warring factions. They are separate and distinct from all such and are solely the witnesses of Jehovah God and his Theocratic Government. Hence they must stand aloof from every nation of this world. They must declare the kingdom of God, and without doing so they cannot be faithful to God and receive his approval and salvation to life. To them obedience to the world means everlasting destruction; obedience to Almighty God means everlasting life. What, then, must they do? They must be witnesses for the Lord and obey his commandments by pointing the people to his King and his kingdom.— Matt. 24:7, 14.

For the protection of Lot and his household against a mob the Lord, operating through his angels, smote the members of the mob with blindness and thereafter led Lot and his household to safety out of the city immediately before destroying it, this picturing God’s protection and deliverance of those devoted to him and who are associated with his service. The two angels appearing there as men seemed to picture the members of the royal house, including Jehovah’s witnesses now on earth whom Jehovah by Christ Jesus sends to modern-day Sodom, “Christendom,” to act in behalf of the great multitude, pictured by Lot and his household. It shows God’s protection and deliverance of those who love and serve him and that he always cares for his own. This is made known now for the encouragement of his people.

<p><span class="font5">They do not loot nor break into the houses, but set up their phonographs before the doors and windows and send the kingdom message right into the houses into the ears of those who might wish to hear. While those desiring to hear are hearing, some of the “sour-pusses” are compelled to hear. Locusts invade the homes of the people and even eat the varnish off the wood and eat the wood to some extent. Likewise God’s faithful witnesses, likened to locusts, get the message right into the house and take the veneer off the religious things that are in that house. Therefore the message comes to them like a thief that enters in at the windows, and this message is a warning to those inside that Jesus Christ has come, “as a thief.” The day of Armageddon is very close, and comes upon the world in general like a thief.

<p><span class="font5">To be courageous one must have full faith and confidence in the power that is backing him up. Relying completely on that power he must vigorously press forward in doing the work that is set before him. Christ Jesus, the Greater than Joshua, makes his faithful followers share with him in his kingdom work, and these become his joint-heirs in the kingdom. His faithful followers need not be fearful; they do need to be very courageous in order to meet the enemy onslaughts. This is shown by the Lord’s words to Joshua: “Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.” (Josh. 1: 6) Jehovah covenanted with Jesus the kingdom, and Jesus covenants with his faithful followers that they shall share with him in that kingdom by God’s grace.—Luke 22:29, 30, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.</span><span class="font5"> W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">God’s kingdom is symbolized by “The Stone”, Christ Jesus the King. His remnant are in line for the kingdom, and by God’s Word they are designated as living stones. The pile of twelve stones taken from the river bed and piled up at Gilgal constituted “a sign among you”, the remnant, and testifying of their engaging in active service in the years 1922 to 1931, which service required great zeal and was fraught with danger. The fact that the Lord brought these faithful ones through alive is a witness to his name. Therefore Jehovah’s witnesses, the faithful remnant, are themselves collectively a visible and undeniable sign or monument of Jehovah’s miraculous work in protecting and preserving them over Jordan.

<p><span class="font5">“Christendom’s” leaders have for long been under the influence of Satan’s wine made from “the vine of the earth” hnd are in a drunken stupor. Instead of repenting and weeping when first warned and thus forestalling what is about to come upon them, they first wake up when the calamity is just upon them. They heard the message during the Elijah period of the church’s work, but scorned it, and now, when Armageddon is very near, they get a stronger jolt. God does not mince words, but he makes them so emphatic that no one has an excuse for not understanding them, and when these words are repeated in the presence or hearing of religionists they go stark mad and desire to destroy the ones who bring the message to their attention. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/39</span></p>

Jehovah has warned the people of good will to seek righteousness and meekness if they would find refuge in the day of his wrath. This shows that as one of good will receives a knowledge of the truth his duty is and the proof of his faith will be his activity in proclaiming the kingdom message to others who have the hearing ear, that they may be gathered into the Lord’s organization and there find safety. Rahab and her relatives pictured those of good will who become the great multitude that abides in the earth for ever. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W //1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The chasm which cannot be passed over results from the final judgment Christ Jesus is now pronouncing and in which he separates the “goats”, the wicked, from the faithful “sheep”. This separation forms a great impassable gulf between the two classes. With that final judgment uttered the “goat” class can never come to the Lord’s blessing, and the “other sheep”, the ones faithful to the Lord, can never go over that gulf without losing life. Hence it is impossible for either of the two classes to again be brought together. Jehovah makes it clearly to appear from Ezekiel’s prophecy (35: 9, 15) that before his final judgment is executed against the wicked that class know that He is the Supreme One and, further, that the wicked have lost all favor with him.

Such rule is for the preservation of those who really love God. Covenant breakers will not be permitted to continue long in the ranks, but every root and branch thereof shall be removed. Covenant breakers defile God’s people; that is, they defile the temple and the temple service, and become secret agents of the Devil. Such God must destroy.—1 Cor. 3:17.

<p><span class="font5">One who desires to be highly thought of among men and refrains from bold service to the Lord for that reason is ensnared by the Devil. One who fails or refuses to look well to and defend the interests of a Christian, and does so in order to appear as a good fellow in the eyes of other men, is therefore a manpleaser, which is an abomination in God’s sight, and an enemy of Christ. What God requires of his servants is to be wholly devoted to him and his kingdom. There can be no proper course of compromise with any part of Satan’s organization. To receive the Lord’s approval one must be entirely for the Lord. Fear of receiving the disappr oval of men is due to self-pride, which is also fear, and which leads into Satan’s snare and ends in destruction.—Prov. 16:18.

<p><span class="font5">That circumcision was a symbol of complete devotion to Jehovah God. When God gave his earthly “friend” his new name, changing it from Abram to Abraham. God established with him the covenant of circumcision. Because of his faith and obedience to God Abraham was counted righteous. Therefore his righteousness was by faith. He was completely devoted to God, and this was symbolized by circumcision. Jehovah’s witnesses, exercising faith in and obedience to God, were brought out of antitypical Jordan in A. D. 1931, and their “new name”, which God had given to them, was now revealed and was bestowed upon them and publicly acknowledged. They were made aware of the “new name”. There the antitypical circumcision took place upon God’s faithful remnant, it being circumcision of the heart, in the spirit.

This ought to convince any reasonable person, and certainly anyone who has the truth, that the kingdom of God under Christ is the most important of all things, because that kingdom will wipe out Satan’s organization and vindicate the name of Jehovah and provide means for salvation for those who love righteousness. So understanding, those who love the Lord should be so enthused that they would want to increase their energies in looking after the kingdom interests and doing all within their power to make known the kingdom to others.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">—Joel 2:32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Escape and deliverance shall be found in no other place than in the Lord God’s organization, “as the Lord hath said ” Repeatedly God has thus said by his prophets, the “holy men of old”. He has said it through Christ Jesus and his apostles, and now he uses the remnant, or the anointed ones, to bring this message to the attention of the people of good will. The remnant constitute a part of Jehovah’s organization and now represent it on earth, particularly Jehovah’s capital organization Zion. Those who do escape and find refuge must now hear the message of the kingdom, must believe it, and must seek the Lord, and must take their place among those of the remnant and become companions of the remnant in the service. The survivors must abide in the organization. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">As</span><span class="font5"> the Israelites journeyed forward toward the land of promise the Devil sought their destruction by means of his religionists. The Midianites practiced the devil religion of Baal-peor. The spiritual adviser of the Midianites was the unfaithful prophet Balaam. The Lord brought destruction upon the Midianites and Balaam. Thus the Lord gave assurance to his faithful servants that they shall be delivered from religionists and their allies that now seek their destruction. As the Israelites continued to journey on to the land of Canaan God’s enemies fought against them. Arad the Canaanite, Sihon the king of the Amorites, and Og the king of Bashan, one after the other, assaulted the Israelites, and the enemy was overthrown and destroyed by Jehovah, and in each instance Jehovah fought the battle for his covenant people. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This does not mean to make preparation for another world war among the nations, but it means that the opponents of the Theocracy are to ally themselves and join themselves together in a world-wide confederacy to oppose Jehovah’s King and kingdom. It is the Theocracy that Jehovah’s witnesses announce and proclaim. “Sanctify war” is what the Hierarchy and allies are now doing. Religionists declare it to be a “holy war” or “war for Christian religion”. Only the religious element could “sanctify” such a war. The proclamation of God’s message of truth is seized upon by them as an excuse for Jesuits and other religionists to make war upon Jehovah’s witnesses in particular. In doing this they hesitate not to lie to the greatest extent in order to put over their wicked designs. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide; and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city.—Josh. 8:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fate of the king of Ai proclaims that Satan, after witnessing the total destruction of his organization, will be executed as accursed and upon his name there will remain everlasting reproach. He will be brought forth at the end of the thousand years. Some have unwisely suggested the impossibility of his being brought forth, assigning the reason that there is no ransom for Satan. The ransom is not at all necessary for one to be brought out of death. God’s power knows no limitation. It is within his power to do as he has announced, that is, to awaken Satan at the time when the earth is filled with righteous creatures and then show Satan what a great fool he has been all the time.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I lay down my life, that I might take it again. —John 10:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Life or existence Jesus did take again, not as a man, but as a spirit. At the same time he still held the right to life as a man because he had not forfeited that right. God raised Jesus out of death a spirit. Jesus still possessing that right to life as a man, that asset or thing of value he paid over to Jehovah as the price required, and thereby became the owner of Adam’s offspring who had not willfully sinned as did Adam, and who would in due time avail themselves of the value of that ransom price. Jesus then could release or deliver Adam’s offspring from bondage of sin and death which had come by reason of Adam’s sin, by which the right to life had been denied them. That means the ransom sacrifice would inure to the benefit of the worthy ones of Adam’s offspring, those who would follow God’s rules.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The redeemer of blood doth put the murderer to death in his coming against him. And ye take no atonement for the life of a murderer who is condemned—to die, for. he is certainly put to death.—Num. 35:21, 31, 'Young’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the type the malicious, willful and deliberate slayer could in no wise have satisfaction met or accepted for his life by any other means, but his life must be taken by the avenger or redeemer. This is done upon the wicked by the great Redeemer at Armageddon. This well pictures the fact that the sacrificed life of the man Jesus does not stand as an atonement, for or ransom for the willfully wicked who spurn God and his provisions for salvation. Such as die at Armageddon under such conditions of willful wickedness certainly will never have a redemption. In no ease are the wicked redeemed. Only the Lord’s poor and needy are redeemed.

<p><span class="font5">Since coming to the temple in 1918 Christ Jesus has been reigning and performing the office of Judge of the people and Vindicator of Jehovah’s name. Making this fact known is magnifying Christ Jesus in the sight of the people. No man, dead or alive, leads God’s faithful, but Christ Jesus, the Elect Servant of God now at the temple, is in full charge of Jehovah’s work and is leading those who joyfully serve him. The time has come for Jehovah to accomplish his work on earth. As he was with Moses, so he is with Christ Jesus and with those who faithfully follow in his steps. This is further assurance that the Lord continues to use the same Society as his earthly, visible organization to carry on his work from 1919 onward as he did during the time prior thereto. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world.—John 15:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is the privilege of each Christian to make his own position and relationship to the Lord clearly to be understood, that he is separate and apart from any of the nations of this world. Jehovah’s witnesses have separated themselves entirely from this world by covenanting to be faithful to God’s kingdom, and have received the commission from him to aid and comfort the people who seek righteousness, and that without regard to what nation such may be subject to. That worldly men and officials do not understand the clear distinction between nations of this world and the great Theocratic Government of Jehovah by Christ is no excuse for a Christian to yield to the demands of worldly nations. He has made a covenant to be faithful to God and his kingdom. To willingly break that covenant means his everlasting destruction.

<p><span class="font5">“Judah” and “Jerusalem” refer to those who serve and praise Jehovah God. Religionists have sold Jehovah’s witnesses to Devil worshipers, God’s enemies, who war against his people. Religionists, led by the Hierarchy, deal with and treat Jehovah’s witnesses as a thing for sale or commercial gain. And why have religionists done so ? &quot;That they might move them from their border,’ the enemy’s purpose being, if possible, to separate the faithful from God, even as the Devil claimed he could do. The effort of the religionists is to deliver Jehovah’s witnesses to their foes and to deprive them of their liberty to serve God. Thanks be unto Jehovah that the time is at hand when he will render a just recompense to the enemy, because the day of his vengeance is at hand. 17 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake, utter a song: . . . The Lord made me have dominion over the mighty.—Judg. 5:12, 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jabin, king of Canaan, and his captain, Sisera, were permitted to oppress Israel. The Israelites repented, and Jehovah heard them and used the prophetess Deborah and Barak to lead the battle against the enemy, which Jehovah fought. He overthrew and destroyed the enemy at the first battle of Megiddo. He used the stars of heaven and the swift waters of Kishon to destroy the enemy. That was an example of Jehovah’s unlimited power foretelling what he will do to his enemies at Armageddon. Record thereof is made that God’s covenant people may now have their faith made strong. Trusting wholly in the Lord and continuing to perform their duty to God, without fear of creatures, they will receive Jehovah’s protection, and share with the Lord in the victory.— Ps. 83:8-10. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 1/1/39</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Turn to the Lord: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously; so will we render the calves of our tips.—Hos. I/: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those gathered at the temple and who receive the Lord’s approval must show their love exclusively for God and for his kingdom. They must turn to God with all their heart and “with fasting and with weeping”, because of iniquity received in Babylon. “Fasting and weeping” would mean refraining from everything religious, because religion dishonors God’s name and is a reproach to his people. Mourning because of past iniquity shows his servants are in a right attitude toward him and in position to receive his blessings and approval. The Lord has comforted all of Zion who have turned entirely to him, who have turned away from religion, and who have unhesitatingly exposed religion and declared themselves unequivocally, without compromise, for Him and his kingdom.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Then Joshua built an altar unto the Lord God of Israel in mount Ebal. . . . and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the Lord, and sacrificed peace offerings.—Josh. 8:30, 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With great gratitude to Jehovah for fulfilling his promise to give the land to Abraham’s natural seed, and for giving them victory over their foes, Joshua-offered sacrifice upon that altar. Now Jehovah’s faithful remnant, the spiritual seed of Abraham, God’s anointed children, are in the “land of promise”. They are living stones placed in the temple. Now they ‘offer sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving to Jehovah by Christ Jesus, even the fruit of their lips’, by faithfully proclaiming the name of the Most High and his kingdom. Jehovah has already given the “remnant” victory in his kingdom country, and with the great multitude they thank him and praise his holy name.—Heb. 13:15.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Thou art worthy . . . for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people and nation.—Bev. 5:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This could have no application to the wicked, because they are not redeemed unto God. None are automatically redeemed, because those redeemed were redeemed, as stated, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“out of</span><span class="font5"> every kindred.” “These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.” (14:4) The fact that they were “redeemed from among men” shows that all men are not automatically redeemed. The members of the body of Christ, here mentioned, first consecrated themselves by agreeing to do God’s will, and hence asked to be bought. God’s purpose and provision is for the redemption of men without discrimination, but all who are redeemed must first have faith in God and in Christ Jesus, and then fully consecrate themselves to do God’s will.

<p><span class="font5">Surely God foreknew those human creatures who will spurn his proffered blessings of life, and he foreknew the class that would gladly accept his gracious provision. It follows, then, that those who have no desire to know God and Christ Jesus, and no desire to receive God’s blessings through Christ Jesus, on such He will not have mercy, and God will not force his mercy upon them. Could it be argued that justice toward all would require God to force his mercy upon all, even though he knows in advance that such persons would reject his loving-kindness? Certainly not. Justice is righteousness, and injustice is unrighteousness. “What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid. For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.” —Rom. 9:14, 15. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It is the time of which Jehovah speaks, a time of darkness to the enemy and of light to those who love him and serve him faithfully and truly. The light from his temple daily increases and makes glad those who are devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom. Therefore while the enemy is in darkness those who love and faithfully serve Jehovah God have an ever-increasing light, and with that light their joy increases. “The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day. The way of the wicked is as darkness; they know not at what they stumble.” Religionists are in the dark because they reject God’s Word. The Lord causes his light to shine on his “other sheep” while he gathers them to himself and comforts them. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">7/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">is the time of the Lord’s vengeance.—Jer. 51: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Organized religion began with Babylon, and ever since then the religionists and their organizations have been designated in the Scriptures under and by the name of “Babylon”. As God sent Jeremiah to warn those of Israel who were of good will that they might flee out of the Devil’s organization, so now he sends his anointed ones, accompanied by their companions, the Jonadabs, to give warning to all others who desire protection and salvation. This message must be carried to the people now, and upon every one who has received the anointing of the holy spirit God has placed the responsibility to participate in delivering that message. A failure or refusal to perform the commission thus given is certain to be disastrous to the ones thus failing of refusing. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">9/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Lord God approves the use of force to be applied against one breaking up that which does not belong to the breaker-up. (Ex. 22:2) One who attempts to commit an. unlawful act against another may be dealt with and against such wrongdoer such degree of force may be used by the one assaulted as may to him appear to be necessary to protect his property or himself oi' kin from the wrongdoer’s assault. Jesus used whips to drive the disorderly ones out of the temple, and he did not invite them to smite him on the cheek. Now Christ Jesus, the antitypical Moses, is present. His kingdom is come. He sends forth his representatives under command to proclaim “this gospel of the kingdom”. No one has the right to interfere with the execution of that command.

<p><span class="font5">And what is the sale price to the faithful servants of Jehovah? What do they get out of the transaction? This: All the benefit that comes out of exposing religion, which has been used to defame Jehovah’s name. The faithful thus serving Jehovah have part in vindicating his name, and that is a great pay to them. “They shall sell them ... to a people far off.” Therefore the religious leaders will be removed afar from the domain in which they have carried on their commercial, religious activities and will be taken so far away they will never get back. Their organization will be broken up and destroyed because the rulers, meaning the radical element, will bum her with fire. The Lord will put it into their minds.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah assumes no responsibility for national division, that is, for one system of government of men as against another system. Christ Jesus, his King, is now present, judging and separating the people of all nations into two classes, the obedient ones in one class, as “sheep”, and the disobedient or opposing ones as “goats”. The questions or issues upon which the individual division takes place and which all such must by their course of action answer are these: Are you for the Theocratic rule by Christ Jesus the King? Do you, on the contrary, favor the continuation of Satan’s rule by the political and religious elements of this world? Each individual must choose for himself. Jehovah’s covenant people stand aloof from the nations that are anti-Theocfacy. They must remain neutral as to all such nations.

<p><span class="font5">Moab, Ammon and Mount Seir formed a conspiracy to destroy God’s covenant people, and, to carry out that conspiracy, marched on Jerusalem. Jehoshaphat, in command of God’s people, was instructed by the Lord what he must do. The enemy far outnumbered the Israelites and were fully equipped for war. God assured Jehoshaphat and the Israelites and others with him that they had no occasion to fear the enemy, for the reason that the battle is God’s; that the duty of the Israelites was to boldly march out and meet the enemy, singing, as they went, the praises of Jehovah. Then God fought their battle and the enemy was completely destroyed. That was an example of his unlimited power exercised in behalf of those who love and obey him. Thus Jehovah foretold what will come to pass at Armageddon in behalf of his people. Do you believe it ?

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah says: “Your pruning hooks, which you employed to dress your religious vines, have not fulfilled your expectations in causing all people to join with you and become subject to your organization. Now try to oppress men; hence beat your pruning hooks into spears, instruments of violence, and use violence in your efforts to regiment and control the people. Become open warriors, and thus be better equipped to fight against Jehovah’s witnesses and Jehovah’s message and therefore against the Theocracy.’ Compared with the host of Almighty God every nation and every organization is weak and amounts to nothing. Compared with the small number of Jehovah’s visible witnesses, who appear to be entirely defenseless, religious leaders together with their deluded ones think themselves to be very strong.

<p><span class="font5">Rahab acted as Jesus states concerning strangers who do good unto the Lord: “I was a stranger, and ye took me in,” for the sake of God’s name and because of your good will toward God. Rahab showed faith in God, even as the Jonadabs today show their faith in Jehovah and the Lord Jesus Christ: “And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were.” (Josh. 2:4) Rahab regarded the favor of God much more to be desired than to have the favor of the king of Jericho. She showed her fear of God and no fear of man. Her conduct was approved by the Lord. Her faith was pleasing to him, and for that reason he counted her righteous. (Heb. 11: 31) Thus is shown that faith in God is the first essential to protection. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">This message of gladness definitely settles the matter that those who will enjoy God’s “government and peace” are the men who are of good will toward God. All such must and will believe that Jehovah is the Almighty God; that Christ Jesus is the King, and that his kingdom is the hope of humankind. In the present world there is no hope. It is time to turn to the Word of Almighty God and learn what HE says, and give heed thereto. To the people he now says: “Behold, my servant whom I have chosen; my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased. ... In his name shall the [nations] hope.” Persons of good will are the ones who will now give heed to God’s Word and turn their heads in the right way, because it is God’s time to do so.

<p><span class="font5">A swarm of moving, living creatures comes upon “Christendom”, does not engage in physical violence, but does devour the food which “Christendom” has prepared and invited the people to eat. The message of God’s Word, proclaimed in the hearing of the people, devours that which “Christendom” produces in the way of so-called “spiritual” food. Jehovah’s witnesses and companions, who carry the message, are not engaged in a work of hate, any more than that the locusts ate up the vegetation of the fields because of hate. Jehovah’s witnesses proclaim the message of truth because God has commanded that they must do so. Therefore the same is an expression of God’s wrath against hypocrisy by which the people are deceived and God’s name is defamed.

(Joel 1:4, 10, 12) This is a warning that the battle of the great day of God Almighty is close by. His wrath does not stop with the locust plague and the rainless season of spiritual famine in “Christendom”, but reaches a climax at Armageddon. Now is the time of the ‘destroying pests’ upon religion or “Christendom”. Hence the plague is not from men. It is not another religious campaign of men or a propaganda movement such as atheists, Bolsheviks and Communists, and other godless radicals, carry on.

<p><span class="font5">These stones symbolically say that in the very midst and depths of tortured humanity the presence and name of Jehovah God is declared by those whom he faithfully commissions to testify to his name. In fulfillment of this drama, thus giving testimony is the vast pile of literature God’s faithful servants have piled up and delivered to the people during the years in crossing the antitypical Jordan. They have left behind them a vast heap or pile of literature which declares the name of the Most High, and these are right in the midst of the people, and the people of good will toward God have profited thereby when they see the witness work is done not for selfish purposes but to the honor of Jehovah’s name. 17 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses brought into God’s capital organization must be entirely separate from the world and not conform themselves to it. One cannot mix up with any part of the Devil’s organization and at the same time purely and truly worship Almighty God. There must be no illicit relationship with Satan’s organization. There must be no compromise with the world. Therefore none of God’s covenant people could properly “heil” a human ruler, such as is required in Germany, or salute or do obeisance to or worship anything picturing or representing an earthly government, which action would attribute salvation to that government. Each one of God’s covenant people must be entirely for God’s kingdom regardless of what suffering this might bring upon them. They must not depend on worldly governments, but must entirely rely on Jehovah God and his kingdom. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Moses, as the representative of the Lord God, gave Oshea or Hoshea a new name, to wit, “Joshua,” which means “Jehovah the Savior”. That “new name” was given at the time Moses sent twelve spies into Canaan. The change of name shows that Joshua would magnify and celebrate the name of Jehovah God. Likewise Jehovah’s people, the faithful followers of Jesus Christ, originally known at times as “Bible Students” received the new name, “Jehovah’s witnesses,” and they must magnify Jehovah’s name. The father of Joshua was named Nun, and that name means “perpetuity”. Joshua therefore pictured Christ Jesus, the Son of the only perpetuating one, Jehovah God, and this particularly after A. D. 1918, when Christ Jesus engaged in the work of vindicating his Father’s name. IF </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Destruction of Jericho was not to enrich creatures, but for vindicating Jehovah’s name. All of Jericho must be rendered to him because of being the first-fruits of the land of Canaan, and must be destroyed. That was a test as to whether they would willingly destroy Jericho for the vindication of Jehovah’s name, because of their love for him. A similar test is upon all true servants of Christ. To receive God’s approval they must expose for destruction &quot;Christendom’s” wickedness solely because of their love for Jehovah and for the vindication of his name. Jehovah’s witnesses are not &quot;engaged in a campaign of hate”, as wrongfully charged against them. They are doing what God has commanded to be done. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">&quot;Fear” here means &quot;trembling” and &quot;inciting reverential adoration towards”, and is not limited to anticipating bodily injury. It also means the fear that one may not have the approval or receive the plaudits of men. One anxious to receive the approval of men is therefore the victim of fear. To dread to be disapproved by men even for doing one’s duty is fear that leads into the Devil’s snare. If one is commanded or commissioned by Almighty God to do and perform a certain thing, and then fails or refuses to because of fear that the performance thereof would call down upon himself the disapproval of others, he is thereby led into the Devil’s snare. God commands his people to sound Hie doom of religion and warn the people of the means of escape. One who has covenanted to do God’s will and who refrains from sounding His message against religion because of fear to receive reproach of others is led into Satan’s snare.

Offspring of the great multitude that turn to wickedness shall be annihilated. The awakening here is of two classes, one to a realization of their deplorable condition, which must be realized by them prior to Armageddon. They see disaster staring them in the face. The “dust of the earth” represents that which is low, mean, worthless, the dry, discredited things of the earth, that is, a condition of ignorance, inactivity and darkness. The awakening therefrom takes place in the day of Jehovah and before Armageddon.

<p><span class="font5">The faith of the Israelites weakened and they turned to religion, and God delivered them into the hands of Midian for seven years. Again the Israelites repented and eried unto God, and God reminded them that he had been their deliverer, but that the Israelites had become of little faith. To the Israelites he said: “I said unto you, I am the Lord your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell; but ye have not obeyed my voice.” (6:10) Then Jehovah raised up Gideon, who, under the Lord’s command, led the faithful Israelites against the enemy, and routed and destroyed them. There was made a prophetic picture of what Jehovah will do for his faithful servants at the battle of Armageddon. That was another evidence of God's merey and unlimited power exercised in behalf of those who serve him faithfully. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/1/39</span></p>

That was an important occasion. Even so now, the Lord brings to the people’s attention through the Watchtower publications his message of warning and instructions, to the end that all who love God and his kingdom may be instructed in that which is necessary that they may escape the curse and may receive the Lord’s blessings.

<p><span class="font5">There is no way for man to escape the just punishment of everlasting death except by the merit of Christ Jesus applied to and received by him. The doctrine, therefore, of a ransom for all regardless of belief’ is entirely without Scriptural authority. The ransom price is the valuable thing or price provided for the purchase of mankind, and which price exactly corresponds to that which the perfect Adam forfeited for himself and lost to all of his offspring. The act of ransoming includes both the providing of the purchase price and . the presentation and paying over of that purchase price. The entire work of providing the valuable asset and paying it over is performed by Christ Jesus according to God’s will and command. He alone, apart from his body members, performed the act of ransoming. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Job here represents the faithful followers of Christ Jesus, and the covering ransom is found in the advocacy of Christ Jesus, who is called the Messenger or Interpreter. In A.D. 1918 the antitypical Job class were in great distress because of oppression heaped upon them by the enemy. In that year the Lord Jesus came to the temple of Jehovah. The faithful ones cried unto the Lord and found a covering ransom in the advocacy of Christ Jesus. Only a faithful remnant were spared from going down into the pit, because for them there was a covering. They found an atonement or deliverance by and through their Advocate, Christ Jesus.

As the mighty Judge and Commander-in-Chief of all the host of righteousness Jehovah sits there to command and direct the execution of his judgment, which execution is done by Christ Jesus, his Vindicator. That will be no kind of trial, such as is held in earthly courts. No briefs filed and no arguments heard. It will be the time of execution. God has given Christ Jesus the “authority to execute judgment”. He will there be pitted against the forces of Satan, and Jehovah sits, as it were, to umpire the fight and make known the result.

Now the faithful see that religion has reached its end, is doomed, and shall shortly he destroyed, and that Jehovah and his government alone shall be loved and served. From this time onward only those who give their full allegiance and devotion to The Theocracy will please God and receive his everlasting blessings. Truly Jehovah, according to his &quot;Word, has guided his faithful servants in their devotion as to what course to take.

(Isa. 45:7) All of God’s creation is right and perfect, and therefore evil is far different from wickedness. The law covenant with Israel inflicted just punishment upon the violators of that covenant, and that punishment was evil to the Israelites justly administered. Jesus used figures of speech in pointing out to the Israelites what was and should be their proper attitude toward their adversary, the law covenant. If one suffered from this adversary, that was evil which proceeded justly from God and was not to be resisted, but the Lord Jesus said: ‘If the wrongdoer was smitten upon one cheek, he should even turn the other and receive a just smiting, rather than to resist.

The faces of the clergy show a flush of anxiety when called upon by Jehovah’s witnesses, and upon observing the activities of these and the message which they bring. Those clergymen usually resort to harsh words against Jehovah’s witnesses, and, seeing that their harsh words do not deter the witnesses but that they fearlessly go on in their work, the religionists conclude that it is a token of impending destruction of them and their racket. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 7/15/39</span></p>

Within himself Jeremiah had no strength, and so stated; but, being encouraged by the Lord, he had full faith and confidence in Jehovah. Likewise Jehovah’s witnesses now on earth have no strength in themselves, but the Lord is their strength and song. Men of the world insist that attention should not be publicly called to the derelictions of others. The argument they generally advance is, “Let us dwell in peace and not speak of trouble.” Those who obey Jehovah God cannot follow that rule. In obedience to his commandment Jehovah’s witnesses must go forward and tell the truth.

Then in 1918 Jehovah stopped that fight, thus 'shortening those days of tribulation’, and the interim of comparative peace furnishes the opportunity for his witnesses to go about in the earth and warn the people and serve those of good will that they may find the way of safety and salvation. That good and “strange work” is now in progress and is drawing near to an end. When it is ended, there will immediately follow 'great tribulation such as the world has never known, and which will be the last’.

<p><span class="font5">It is the lifeblood of the man Jesus alone that is the valuable thing, the purchase price, which is presented in heaven and paid over as a sin offering. The Lord’s goat did not sacrifice itself, but the sacrifice was done by the high priest. No man sacrifices himself, but the Lord Jesus, the great High Priest, does the sacrificing. The meaning of the sacrifice and sprinkling of the blood of the goat manifestly is this: That everyone of humankind that is called to the “high calling” must bear the reproaches that fall upon Christ Jesus and must therefore suffer with him and die with him as a condition precedent to reigning with him in heaven.

The man to whom it is made available and who refuses or fails to accept that offer, the gift does not operate toward him. Consequently the ransom sacrifice inures only to the benefit of those who ask for and willingly receive its benefits. Men must choose either to remain under condemnation that justly rests upon them or to avail themselves of the loving-kindness and mercy of God and seek and willingly accept his provision for salvation. The way of escape from death and the way to everlasting life are by and through Christ Jesus.

He knows that individually he has no strength, and therefore he does not become heady. He realizes he is small in himself but strong in the Lord and, like the description of locusts, he is “little . . . but . . . wise”.

Such must not be eye-servants to be seen of men, nor “men-pleasers”, but “the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart”. “As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.” (Eph. 6: 6; 1 Pet. 2:16) While some are assigned to some place of service, and some to another, each one must render service unto the Lord, and not to men.

<p><span class="font5">The kingdom is here, and Christ the King knows no defeat. He will get the victory. The enemy will bluff and bluster and threaten to inflict bodily punishment upon Jehovah’s witnesses, but the enemy cannot stop the witness work and it will not stop until finished and until God permits it to be stopped. As Jehovah said to Joshua and the other Israelites, so now he says to his faithful people on earth when facing the enemy: “Be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed; for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.” Today the fight is on, and the faithful, with good courage, are proclaiming Jehovah’s praises and are relying upon the promises of Jehovah, well knowing that ‘the battle is not man’s, but God’s’. Those who really love God and his kingdom will not be afraid.—1 John 4:17,18. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 2/1/39</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Then she let them down by a cord through the window; for her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.—Josh. 2:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All who love and serve Jehovah are to do good unto others when opportunity is afforded, and particularly to those who are likewise servants of God or members of the household of faith. (Gal. 6:10) Anyone who does injury to one of God’s little ones need expect no consideration from the Lord. Doubtless Rahab had with her own industrious hands made the rope or cord with which she let down the men. The Jonadabs must be energetic, and not slothful, and be prepared to use the faculties with which they are endowed in behalf of the kingdom interests. Rahab, by aiding the spies to escape, was helping them to continue in the service of advancing Jehovah’s organization. The same rule, identically, applies today with reference to the Jonadabs toward God’s remnant. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/15/35</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And I hate every false way. I hate and abhor lying; but thy law do I love.—Ps. 119:128,163.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The honest person hates everything that does injury to his fellow creatures and that defames the name of Almighty God. He does not hate any person because that person has been induced to practice any particular religion; but he does hate the religion, for it is false, defames God’s name, and works great injury to mankind. Only the truth can relieve mankind from the condition of blindness. Therefore those who proclaim the truth at God’s command are doing good. Jehovah’s witnesses love mankind, and for that reason they endeavor to inform the people what is for their best interest. The testimony given by Jehovah’s witnesses, which exposes the duplicity and crookedness of religion, they give because God’s will is that they shall do so. Their testimony is not their own, but proceeds from Jehovah. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/15/39</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the Lord, that it is mighty; that ye might fear the Lord your God for ever.—Josh. 4:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God brought his faithful witnesses through the antitypical Jordan. This is a witness to them, that their faith must be unchangeable and that their hope must be strong. For that reason they must continue to recount these facts to themselves and to those of good will among them; that they must also continue to be faithful witnesses to the peoples of the world, that such may have warning notice of God’s purpose to destroy all the enemy at Armageddon. Jehovah has given his people his name, to them their “new name”, and this “that ye [all consecrated to do his will] might fear the Lord your God for ever”. Those who do thus fear him will be diligent to obey his commandments. All such will continue to bear testimony to the name of Jehovah and his kingdom. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 3/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry.—Isa. 65:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is an abundance of spiritual food being scattered throughout the earth by Jehovah’s witnesses. It comes from God’s storehouse, but “Christendom” has no access to and no part in the distribution of it. Neither the Roman Catholic clergy nor other religious leaders or the “evil servant” class have anything to do with dispensing the Lord’s spiritual food. None of them are for the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and hence they are against the kingdom. All food from bis storehouse that is carried to the people is being carried by Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions, and all of these together are acting through the Watchtower organization. The religionists of “Christendom” see this fact and desperately attempt to prevent Jehovah’s servants from carrying the spiritual food to the hungry common people.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Circumcision is that of the heart.—Rom. 2:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s anointed must maintain their integrity toward God, which will be tested by their consistent praise of Jehovah, and do this regardless of all opposition or reproach that may be heaped upon them. They must not indulge in that which draws attention to themselves, but must always give glory and honor to Jehovah. They must be at complete unity with one another. They must be faithful in safeguarding and advancing and promoting the kingdom interests, which interests have been committed to them. To them the kingdom is everything, because it is the means of honoring and vindicating Jehovah’s name. To do these things, prompted by love, that is, an unselfish devotion to God and his kingdom, means to prove one’s faithfulness and integrity. That is what is the meaning of circumcision of the heart.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.—Mark 3:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If one called “my mother” is against God’s kingdom by Christ Jesus, then the only duty I have toward such is to tell her of God’s provision for mankind. If she is really devoted to God and his kingdom, then as my real relative in Christ I will do whatsoever I can for her protection and defense; but that does not mean I must fight against the nation or people that is fighting another nation, both of which are against God and his kingdom. As to such nations I am entirely neutral and cannot and will not fight for one as against the other. If an enemy of the great Theocrat and His King attempts to do me harm and to hinder me and my work for the kingdom and fights against me and my spiritual mother or brother, then I have the right to defend myself against such assaults, and the right to defend my brethren, and I will do so. Thus the Christian defines himself as for peace and righteousness but not as a pacifist. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/1/39</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father’s household, and dll that she had; and she dwelleth in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Israel even unto this day; because she hid the messengers which Joshua sent.—Josh. 6:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Joshua</span><span class="font5"> means “Savior&quot;’. The Greater Joshua, Christ Jesus, the Officer of Jehovah, will execute all of Satan’s army at Armageddon, but will save those of the great multitude, his “other sheep”. This further proves that the Rahab class, the great multitude, will survive Armageddon because of faith and obedience unto the Lord. No mention is made in the Scriptures of Rahab’s death, but she is reported as living in the land, “even unto this day,” that is, the day of Joshua, who wrote the record. As a reward the great multitude come into intimate relationship with God’s remnant while on earth and later are granted life everlasting and given the great privilege of carrying out the divine mandate. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 4/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer.—Phil. 1:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s “strange work” must now be done until it is finished. Those who had made a covenant to do his will and who then fail or refuse to perform their assigned part in his “strange work” cannot have his approval and blessing. To engage in the witness or “strange work” now necessarily brings reproach upon all who faithfully perform their duty, and such reproach is the privilege of suffering with Christ. Instead of shirking such duty, the faithful greatly rejoice in being permitted to have part in the sufferings of Christ. The remnant, accompanied by their companions, know they must go out to meet the enemy. No longer are God’s people on the defensive, but must take the aggressive and offensive and be very courageous in performing their duty because they know that Jehovah and Christ are backing them up.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">For the day of the Lord is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?—Joel 2:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That is, Who can maintain his integrity and abide as a member of God’s organization, whether said to be of the remnant or of His “other sheep” ? It is a time of test upon each and every one who has undertaken to do God’s will. Those who do abide in this day and prove their integrity are the ones who have full faith and confidence in God and his King and who march forward in obedience to his commandments, regardless of the opposition on the part of the foe. These faithful ones now fully appreciate that their fight is not against human creatures, nor against human governments, but that they are being assaulted and opposed by the Devil and his host of wicked angels. The work of Jehovah’s witnesses and “his camp” is to obey God and magnify his name that the people may learn their only means of salvation.

<p><span class="font5">A great thrill that will be for every creature that is privileged to see the forward march of the mighty Vindicator of Jehovah. It is the “time of war”! It is to be the final war. All the hosts of heaven will with most intense interest behold it. The faithful on earth will discern it and have full assurance in advance of what shall be the result. The zero hour has struck, and the Mighty Warrior, leading his invincible host, is marching to the attack. The deluge was the climax of the first world of wickedness and violence. That foreshadowed the climax of the “present world” of wickedness and violence. Let those who love Jehovah and his Kingdom note the onward march of the heavenly host and with eagerness a-wait the result as foretold in the prophecies. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 10/1/39</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, hlood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.—Joel 2:30. </span><span class="font5">Concerning “fire”, the fulfillment is found in the fiery message of Jehovah God, which he has caused to be proclaimed throughout the earth, and particularly in the land of hypocritical “Christendom”. Jehovah’s witnesses have been permitted to carry this fiery message among the people, and it has dreadfully scorched and burned religionists. “Pillars of smoke” appear well to denote the “smoke of [the] torment” of the enemies of Jehovah, and this because of God’s fiery message delivered among them. Furthermore pillars of smoke arising denote the expression of God’s wrath. Ever and anon in these “last days” he exhibits his wrath against his persecutors, but the complete expression of his wrath will be at Armageddon. Thereafter the smoke will ascend forever, denoting the class consumed have ceased to exist for ever. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Whether they know it or not, the leaders of Communism, Fascism, Nazism, and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy are all under the command of the Devil, bent on destroying God’s people that they might defeat Jehovah and his King. Standing there against all this ungodly, cruel horde of Satan are those forming the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions, the people of good will, and who are proclaiming the warning to the people; and for that reason these are the objects of Satan’s attack. All of Satan’s force are marching to the open attack of Jehovah’s faithful people on earth. But let no one on the side of Jehovah and his King be dismayed. The Lord Jesus Christ is in command, and the King of Eternity says to his faithful witnesses: ‘The enemy shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee. Be of strong courage.’ W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">5/1/39</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The grace of God that hringeth salvation hath appeared to all men.—Titus 2:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God has provided salvation by and through Christ Jesus. The lifeblood of the man Jesus is the purchase price of sinful man and was presented in heaven and paid over to God as a sin offering in behalf of as many as believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. Such was done by Christ Jesus in obedience to God’s will. Christ Jesus, having paid over the ransom price, is the owner of all men, and all receive the benefit of it who believe and obey. Life everlasting is the gift of Jehovah through Jesus Christ, because salvation belongs to Jehovah and Christ Jesus is his means of administering the same. There is no other means of gaining life. No man can gain life or receive life everlasting unless he believes God and believes on Christ Jesus and asks for salvation by making an unconditional agreement to do God’s will.

<p><span class="font5">The Assyrian king Sennacherib marched against Jerusalem, bullying the Israelites and defying Almighty God. Thus he pictured the combined opponents of God’s kingdom that now, in defiance of Almighty God and Christ his King, march out to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses. Hezekiah, the king of Israel, prayed to Jehovah for protection and deliverance. In answer to that prayer Jehovah smote the Assyrians. This is proof that he will deliver his faithful covenant people and completely destroy the enemy. That was a test of the faith of Hezekiah and the other Israelites, and God rewarded their faith. A similar test has come to God’s people now on the earth. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In the redemption of mankind by the blood of Jesus Christ the attribute of justice is not involved. If the divine rule of justice alone is invoked and applied, then the entire human race must perish because of sin and imperfection. It is the attribute of love that is involved. Mercy is the result of the exercise of God’s loving-kindness. From the viewpoint of justice God is under no obligation whatever to ransom sinful men, nor is God obliged to extend mercy to every creature regardless of whether that creature desires and seeks mercy. With Jacob and Esau God made a prophetic picture, showing his foreknowledge of the class of persons who seek the way of righteousness and life, and also of that class that takes exactly the opposite course: “As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.”—Rom. 9:13.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah gives assurance to those who hate lawlessness and love righteousness, and who prove it, that he will never forsake them. During the closing days of 1918 God did apparently forsake for a time his consecrated ones because they had shown fear of the enemy. But in due time these faithful ones were brought out of the depths of distress, and Jehovah has now given such full assurance that if they continue faithful his love for them shall be unbreakable. In 1919, after they began to emerge from the depths, Jehovah began to open to them the meaning of his prophecies. No longer is there any reason for the faithful to fear that Jehovah has forsaken them or ever will forsake them again. Jehovah is the Everlasting Friend of his chosen ones, and no power can prevail against them. Boldly they go forward. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">8/15/39</span></p>

The conflict between the Theocracy and Satan’s organization is therefore a deadly one. There can be no compromise. At the end every creature will be on the side of one or of the other. All opponents of the Theocracy are certain to be destroyed. The man who now has a vision of the Kingdom with appreciation sees that everyone who is not for the kingdom is against it. Either one must be working for the kingdom or else he is against it. I f a man has a vision of the kingdom, which God has now revealed to those who love him, that man loves the kingdom and will permit nothing to turn him away from a full devotion and service to it. He sees it is the means of completely vindicating Jehovah’s name and is the only means of man’s salvation.

Is it your purpose to do acts of opposition to me as if you could get away with it and thus show your contempt of me ? Do you think yourself immune from punishment, as if independent and superior to me ? Having done their wicked deeds in contempt and defiance of Jehovah, therefore the day of settlement has arrived and the account will be settled at Armageddon, when the enemy will be completely paid off for their wrongdoing. The Lord is now at the temple and says that as soon as the witness work, his “strange work”, is done, there will be no delay in settling the account with the enemy, for then sudden destruction cometh upon them.

The five brethren, with the rich man, make six and picture all of Satan’s house or organization. These have had the Scriptures, to which they might have given heed and found comfort. Instead of God’s law they have preferred religion. The Lord says: “If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.” (Vs. 31) Even if the faithful witnesses of old shall shortly return from the dead and bear testimony before the religionists and their followers, they will not hear and obey the truth.

<p><span class="font5">Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego refused to yield to Satanic religion, determining to remain faithful and true to the Most High. King Nebuchadnezzar caused them to be cast into a red-hot fiery furnace. The flames did not scorch them, because they were protected by the Lord; but the flames destroyed the men who threw them into the fire. Because of their faith and faithfulness the Lord God protected his and delivered them. Another faithful Hebrew, Daniel, was betrayed to the king, Darius, by men who sought his destruction. Fearless of the enemy and trusting wholly in God, Daniel refused to yield. The king caused him to be east into a den of lions; but God’s power was exercised in behalf of his servant Daniel, and the wild beasts did not touch him, but did destroy those who formed a conspiracy against Daniel.

<p><span class="font5">This applies to God’s “new creation”. Confirming that the ones here redeemed are the faithful brought into God’s organization, the apostle quotes from the text, to wit: “0 death, where is thy sting? 0 grave, where is thy victory?” (1 Cor. 15: 55) These anointed ones of God were redeemed from death at the time they were justified by Jehovah, following their consecration. The redemption here prophesied by Hosea, however, takes place after these spirit-begotten ones have proved their faithfulness and maintained their integrity toward God. In 1918 or thereabout Satan attempted to destroy all the consecrated. But in the year 1919 the Lord redeemed and delivered the faithful ones from Satan’s organization and thus prevented the enemy from overwhelming them. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 6/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The keenest interest of God’s consecrated must be in the kingdom and for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. God has taken out from the nations a “people for his name”, which consecrated people constituted the Lord’s heritage. If God should send a locust plague upon his people the religionists would mock. They mock God by denying his existence and by saying: “God is not all-powerful; hence his people suffer.” It was necessary for God’s “faithful servant” class to be shown mercy and to be recovered from the erring way, and particularly from religion and religious practice, that they might avoid the plague that was coming, which has now come upon “Christendom”, and that they might be servants to Jehovah’s honor.

To this day religionists continue to use violence, to devise methods and practices against Christ’s faithful followers, and also to incite the ignorant to use violence toward God’s servants.

Therefore as a follower of Christ Jesus he can be faithful and true to God, and will do so, come what may. Those who have taken their stand on the side of the great THEOCRAT and his King will stand fast in that position, trusting in and relying solely upon God, well knowing that God will deliver them and grant them everlasting life. All who are on the Lord’s side will be neutral as to warring nations, and will be entirely and wholly for the great THEOCRAT and His King.

Those who will compose the “great multitude” are not pictured as standing upon Mount Zion. All persons of good will who flee to the mountains as commanded, and faithfully abide there under the protection of Christ until the end of Armageddon, will be delivered.

But that promise does not extend to any of his enemies, nor to those who remain indifferent and inactive toward God and his “strange work”. Each one must take a positive stand for the Lord. It is the day when the Kingdom shall prevail and when the Lord will cover himself with glorious victory, and to all Jesus’ words now apply, “He that is not with me is against me.” Those who find refuge now must boldly stand on the Lord’s side and fully and completely trust in him; for in him alone must the people hope.

His message is now informing the honest people that their hope is not in religious leaders, nor in the principal of the flock, but that their only hope is in Christ Jesus and his kingdom. That truth shuts off the light from the big moguls of “Christendom”. The truth makes dark the light of the clergymen, and it shines upon and brightens some of the sin-sick world. Jehovah’s “strange work” gives no glory or honor to men, or creatures of the world. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Have boldness in the day of judgment.—1 John 4:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses have no personal fight with men, but are sent as messengers of Jehovah to declare to the people God’s judgments already written and to inform them according to God’s Word what will be the result; and this they do to the end that those of good will toward God might be informed and flee to safety. Those now in a covenant with Jehovah must keep this in mind: that there are many people held in bondage by religious institutions and who are persons of sincerity, desiring righteousness. They must be warned and informed, and the Lord has laid this obligation upon his witnesses and their companions to give the warning. Those who love God and his King and kingdom will do exactly as commanded. They will not be fearful, but, on the contrary, will be fearless and have boldness in this day of judgment, making known Jehovah’s purpose. 17 </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">That which is of greatest interest to all men, if they only realized it, is the kingdom of God, the theocratic government, with Christ Jesus, the King and official representative of Jehovah, in full charge, ruling in righteousness and bestowing lasting blessings upon all men of good will toward God. Because that theocratic government under Christ is of most vital importance to humankind the Devil opposes it, and employs fraud, deceit and lying as well as violence to oppose the Kingdom of God. Jesus informed his disciples that the kingdom is of first importance. He taught them that God would select from among men a certain number who would prove faithful and to whom he would entrust the interest of his kingdom on earth, and that the very least of these would be ultimately greater than any man living on earth.

<p><span class="font5">Particularly from and after 1933 some have taken a course like Achan’s by marching around the modern Jericho of Satan’s organization and declaring God’s judgments written against her; but after doing so for a season such servants yield to temptation and to satisfy a selfish desire they take a wrongful course and are ensnared by Satan. It may be a desire for more honor among men. Nursing such a selfish desire for fame among men, he yields to that selfish desire and falls into Satan’s snare. A desire to glorify self led Achan to commit a great sin. The desire to satisfy self led Esau to commit a great sin. The desire for personal or self gain has led men formerly in the organization to 'sell their birthright’ for self gain. TV 4/</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">15/39</span></p>

(Gen. 15:5) The number is small, as compared with the mass of humanity; yet by their zeal and their organized, harmonious action Jehovah’s witnesses and companions are likened today by “Christendom”, God’s professed 'Hand”, to a host “without number”. Christ Jesus is “the Lion of the tribe of Juda”, and ‘Tie hath the cheek teeth [(7?.V.) jaw teeth] of a great lion”.

<p><span class="font5">Abraham was not the servant of any earthly king, but was the servant and representative of Jehovah, the great Theocrat. Abraham’s neutrality in Canaan was due to the fact that he was wholly devoted to the Theocratic Government, and therefore God addressed him as his “friend”. He was a stranger and did not act as a native nationalist, putting the state above Almighty God. He had no part in the affairs of the government in the land where he resided. He “saluted” and thus attributed salvation to Almighty God and hence he did not salute the flag of those worldly governments and attribute salvation and protection to them. He did not look for protection or salvation from any earthly government. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">When you see that Jehovah God, as represented by Christ Jesus, is at the temple (in the drama pictured by the ark), then is the time to move forward, and then follow the Lord’s commandment, and not man’s leading. “Follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.” The Israelites on Jordan’s banks no longer had the cloud and the pillar of fire to lead them. They must look to and follow the ark of the covenant. So with Christ’s coming to the temple, no longer did the holy spirit serve as a guide, but the Lord Jesus, the antitypical ark of the covenant, the representative of Jehovah, then guides and directs the movement of his people. Those who have failed to see Christ at the temple have fallen completely away. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2/15/39</span></p>

When Jesus was on earth he vigorously condemned the Pharisees and their religious allies, telling them they were the Devil’s offspring and worthy of death. To hold that His ransom sacrifice would apply to such opposers of the Lord and his kingdom would be to deny the sincerity and truth of Jesus’ condemnation of such wicked ones. Jehovah’s loving-kindness and mercy are extended to all men who willingly believe God and faithfully serve him and his beloved Son, Christ Jesus: “Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the loving-kindness of the Lord.”—Ps. 107:43.

Everything will be ready for the clash of power. That “wine-press” will be a tremendous one, with capacity to hold all the nations that are against Jehovah God.

<p><span class="font5">The Theocracy is the heavenly, invisible government of Jehovah God by Christ Jesus, the King, who is invisible to human eyes. That government is not allied with or represented by any religious, political, judicial government on earth. Christ is not divided. The Theocracy is one inseparable, righteous government, always righteous. Therefore Jehovah must be neutral, and his ear is deaf to prayers of the clergy of all sides in war between nations. Jehovah hears only the prayers of those who are for his Theocratic Government. A religious state is anti-Theoeracy, and to such God shows no favors over another like state or nation. He is neutral, and his covenant people who have vowed to serve him and his Theocracy must therefore remain neutral, depending wholly and entirely on God for protection and salvation.

The prince standing there was the spirit Logos, now appearing in human form for the occasion. As Jehovah’s special agent he was taking charge of the approaching battle of Jericho. Christ Jesus is the great Field Marshal leading Jehovah’s host against Satan’s organization, and God’s remnant on earth are accountable to God’s Great Prophet and must obey or suffer destruction.

The King is the Ruler of Peace, and every one of his official organization must be at peace with God and his King and at peace with every member of the royal house. There shall be no controversy, and there shall be no end of peace in the Theocratic Government. That peace and harmony must prevail with the remnant of the temple company. Let everyone who hopes to remain in the Theocratic Government bear this in mind, that peace must at all times exist between those who are of the remnant. Each one in the temple is the servant of God. God hath placed the members in the body of Christ according to his good pleasure. No one in the temple can willingly withdraw from God’s organization and its service and offer as an excuse for such that he is offended at another who is of God’s organization.

Jesus’ words at Luke 14: 26 apply with stronger force today to those in a eoven ant to do God’s will. To beseech the brethren to make good such eovenant by entering into the service and to zealously engage in the Lord’s work, is each one’s privilege. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 8/1/39</span></p>

The dear inference to be drawn from Jesus’ words here is, that there would in the future be a proper time to fight, but Jesus must wait until that due time fixed by Jehovah, and then he will fight to a finish. There is a time for everything: “A time of war; and a time of peace.” (Eccl. 3:1-8) The foregoing scriptures do not mean that the Christian ean with impunity go about hunting trouble and getting into a fight; nor do they mean that the Christians must willingly permit the agents of Satan to destroy their efforts to preaeh God’s kingdom message. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">W 9/15/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The barrier of antitypieal Jordan having been passed, God’s anointed now came faee to face with their enemies.

Bearing the ark out of Jordan said in symbol that Jehovah God had now entered with his covenant people into the promised land and would be with them in the fight against the enemy.

God made known to Jesus His purpose to have a capital organization. When Jesus learned of this, he sold his all to become the heir thereof and head of the kingdom. It was not his human life as ransom for man that bought that estate of the kingdom of heaven.

With God’s faithful people there is now no “thirst for water”, for the hearing of the Word of God. The kingdom message of truth is not kept in the confines of his temple class, but the truth flows out to others.

This is the work which God long ago foretold, the work of Jehovah, in which he uses the remnant of his people and their companions, and both of these must now give close attention to God’s commandments and strictly obey. The faithful, anointed remnant and the Lord’s “other sheep” greatly rejoice, because they see that God’s kingdom under Christ is at hand and that complete deliverance is near.

Did Jesus voluntarily suffer death merely to save sinful men from death ? No 1 His death operates beneficially to those who were sinners but who later by faith and obedience are relieved of sin and devote themselves to Jehovah and his kingdom. Such, however, was not the primary reason for the voluntary death of Jesus. He suffered death because of his love for his Father and the love to do his Father’s will, and that means love for The Theocratic Government, which will vindicate his Father’s name.

Probably the continued success of the battle of Ai depended on his constantly signaling with his spear.

This seems to mean that the Lord Jesus Christ, the Field Marshal in command at Armageddon, will continue to signal his forces to continue the fight until every vestige of Satan’s organization is completely done up. Joshua wanted to be fully obedient to the command of Jehovah of hosts and to completely exterminate the enemy regardless of how long the fight had to last.

Furthermore, “Take the helmet of salvation”; that is, have an intellectual appreciation of the proper relationship between the remnant and Jehovah and his kingdom and rely upon God’s Word, knowing that salvation belongs to Jehovah and that there is no other means of salvation and victory. Take “the sword of the spirit”, the Word of God, and use it as he has directed it shall be used.

That promise is that they shall survive the battle of Armageddon and be on earth after it is over, at which time all their persecutors will have been completely wiped out. Jehovah’s universal organization will persist after Satan’s organization has gone down to destruction.

That man who has unselfishly devoted himself to God’s service is pursuing a wise course: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.” (9:10) Otherwise stated, the man does not begin to be wise until he fears God.

Only recently the Lord has revealed to his people that Jehovah’s organization on earth, as well as in heaven, is theocratic and that Christ Jesus, as his great Executive Officer, is in charge and that now is the time when individual things or selfish desires should be and must be put entirely away and when everyone must bend his efforts to know and to do the will of God.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The priests blew with the trumpets; and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat.—Josh. 6:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The shout of the people was a shout of triumph for Jehovah’s victory. The marching of Jehovah’s witnesses (his devoted priestly class) and their sounding of the kingdom message continue until God’s due time for that to end. When the witness work is completed according to his will, then all his witnesses will shout to him in faith for him to act in the victorious vindication of his name, and down “Christendom” must fall. Such is the “strange act” of Jehovah, and it will strip the religionists of their hiding place and their protection, pictured by the wall, that is, the political and commercial elements, which now use the strongarm squad to do the bidding of the religious leaders.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">God . . . teacheth my hands to war.—Ps. 18:32,34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A “pacifist” is one who refuses to fight under any and all circumstances. God’s covenant people are not pacifists, even as God and Christ are not pacifists. God’s covenant people are authorized to defend themselves against those who fight against the Theocratic Government. Nehemiah of Judah armed the servants of God, who worked with him, and commanded them: “Fight for your brethren.” (Neh. 4:1,14) Likewise Jehovah’s witnesses today, in caring for the interest of The Theocracy by holding public meetings and there proclaiming Jehovah’s name and his King, and by advertising the kingdom as commanded, have the right to defend themselves against assaults of the anti-God, anti-Kingdom crowd who would hinder such work which God has commanded them to do. In defending themselves they have the approval of the Almighty. W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">11/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Proclaim ye this among the nations: prepare war, rouse up the strong: let them come, let all the men of war come up.—Joel 3:9, Catholic Douay Version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Religious leaders, particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, think to frighten, browbeat, coerce and compel all others to obey and bow to their dictates. Hence the Lord says to them: ‘Come on and exhibit yourselves against Jehovah’s witnesses. Do your utmost to stop them, if you will. Boycott owners and operators of radio stations; compel them to refuse anything that might shock your religious susceptibilities and expose your racket. Use newspapers to proclaim lies against Jehovah’s servants, and employ men within your power to compel all other publications to support your religious-political scheme to rule contrary to God’s will. Let your mighty men continue to devise ways and means to hinder the proclamation of the message of God’s kingdom, and in this do your very worst. This is your last show.’ TV </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">10/1/39</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">They shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee.—Jer. 1:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our natural eyes behold only the enemy forces and power of men, but by faith in God’s Word we see that joined together with the Fascist-religious-Godless element is a host of wicked angels and the entire wicked army is fully under the Devil’s command and all are bent on rule or ruin. Without full faith and confidence in the Lord the enemy army would strike terror into the hearts of men; yet the faithful remnant and their companions do not fear. Jehovah says to his faithful people: “They shall fight against thee.” We are therefore fully forewarned that the ruling powers of “Christendom” are maliciously making war on those who faithfully serve Jehovah God and his King. Shall we now fear or be dismayed? No! Because Jehovah says to his faithful little band of servants: “They shall not prevail against thee.” W </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">1/1/39</span></p>

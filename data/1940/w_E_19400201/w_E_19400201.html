<p><span class="font3">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ In glory, clothed with all power In heaven and earth, and the'Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God's law and was sentenced to death ; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JESL'S was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death In order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus Is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act Is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth&quot; with a righteous race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The midwinter Testimony Period is called “Salvation” and occupies the entire month of February Thus the testimony for Jehovah’s name and his means of salvation, The Theocracy, will continue despite the season of the year. All Theocratic publishers will offer to the public first a combination of the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation </span><span class="font3">and the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace,</span><span class="font3"> on a contribution of 25c.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MEMORIAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Saturday, March 23, after six p.m., is the date for 1940 for the yearly feast in celebration of Jehovah’s name and to the sacrifice of the Lamb of God, Christ Jesus, his Theocratic King. Each company, therefore, should assemble after six p.m. of March 23, and the anointed ones thereof celebrate the Memorial, their companions the Jonadabs being present as observers. If there is no competent person present to deliver a brief discourse immediately preceding the partaking of the emblems, that short article ap pearing in the March 15, 1939, issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> should be read before those assembled before partaking. Since the breaking of the bread and drinking of the wine both picture the death of Jesus, it follows that both emblems should be served together at partaking, and not separately. The emblems should be unleavened bread and real red wine. Jesus and his apostles used real red wine in symbol of his blood, and the anointed remnant should follow their lead. A report of the celebration should be made to the Society as instructed in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font3"> In preparation therefor the article “Memorial” suggested above will be studied with profit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">YEARBOOK FOR 1940</span></p>

You will marvel at the most interesting and most successful service year yet, ever with opposition increasing, nations being swallowed up by dicta tors, and wartime restrictions being generally applied, curtailing the Theocratic work in many countries.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 1</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“But as the days of No'e were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.&quot;—Matt. 24: 37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">'JEHOVAH sent Jesus to the earth to proclaim the I truth. Jesus was diligent in telling the truth to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font6"> those who would hear him. All faithful followers of Christ Jesus must now be diligent in proclaiming the truth of God’s Word. The primary purpose of Jesus’ coming to earth was and is the vindication of Jehovah’s name by proclaiming the truth; and this is made certain by his words: “To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.” (John 18: 37) All real Christians are required to follow in the lead of Christ Jesus, and they prove their integrity by so doing; as it is written: “For even hereunto were ye called; because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.” (1 Pet. 2: 21) It follows that the words of Jesus were uttered according to the will of Almighty God. “And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape. And ye have not his word abiding in you; for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.”—John 5 : 37, 38.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>2</sup> The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> is devoted entirely to the publication of the truth of God’s Word, as set forth in the Scriptures. Ignorance of the impending danger hinders the helpless people from avoiding such great danger and finding a way of escape. All the people of the world are now in the gravest danger of the power of the demons. A knowledge of the truth will enable those who seek righteousness to find the only means of protection and the way of escape from the demons’ power. What is published here is solely for the purpose of rendering aid to those who desire to know, to learn and to abide by the truth, and the truth will enable them to find God’s provision for their protection and salvation from the disaster that is now impending upon the world and about to fall. It is not necessary nor is it the purpose of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> to hold up anyone to ridicule. The publication of the Scriptural truth, however, which discloses the cause of the great woes that are now upon the people, necessarily exposes the workers of iniquity and greatly enrages all such wicked ones, both spirit and human creatures. It is only the truth, set forth in the Bible, that will enable men to be free. (John 8: 32) Never has it been so important for human creatures on earth to know the truth, because this is “the last time”.—I John 2:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> The disciples of Jesus propounded to him the important question as to what conditions would be existent at the time of his second coming and the setting up of the great Theocracy. The answer of Jesus, uttered in response to the question propounded, is the truth, which truth was spoken by him with full authority from Jehovah God. Among the things uttered by Jesus in answer to the question propounded to him by his disciples he said: “And as it was in the days of No'e, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.”—Luke 17: 26.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> In Noah’s day that which stood out in the most marked degree was the influence and power of the demons over the peoples then on the earth. The words of Jesus prove that exactly a like condition would be existent at the time of his second coming and would prevail in the earth until God's due time to destroy the wicked. As shown by the Scriptures and the physical facts, Christ Jesus was enthroned as King in the year 1914. The Scriptural proof is that he came to the temple of God in 1918 and there began the assembling and judging of the consecrated ones Since that time the woes upon the people have continuously increased, and today the people® of the earth are in the most deplorable condition that anyone on earth has ever known. These are penlom times. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> now submits Scriptural testimony proving why such terrible conditions exist on the earth and then points out the provisions Jehovah God made for the protection and salvation from such terrors, and which protection can be had only by those who seek meekness and righteousness.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ORIGIN OF DEMONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup> To blind a man concerning his danger makes it impossible for him to find protection from such danger until that blindness is removed. It therefore be-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">hooves every person on earth to lay aside prejudice and preconceived opinions and earnestly seek the truth as recorded in God’s Word. In doing so it will be found that the chief amongst the demons is Satan, “that old serpent,” the Devil. When he was one of the trusted officers in the organization of Jehovah God his name was Lucifer, meaning “bright-shining one”, one with authority. He rebelled against God, and in that time of rebellion he became that wicked one who is known in the Scriptures as “the prince of the devils”, that is, the ruling one amongst the devils or demons. (Matt. 12:24) Jehovah changed his name to Dragon, Satan, Serpent, and Devil. A number of the angels joined Satan in his rebellion against God, and they also became demons, or wicked ones, or devils, and are designated in the Scriptures as “giants”, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">{Revised Version)</span><span class="font6"> “Nephilim”. (Gen. 6: 4) The name “Nephilim” means bullies or tyrants, who are willfully wicked and bent on doing mischief in defiance of God’s law. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font6"> issues of September 1 and 15, 1934, gives the detailed Scriptural proof concerning these demons and their operations in the days of Noah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">DEATH SENTENCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ The sentence of death was entered against Satan at the time of his rebellion, and which judgment of death appears at Ezekiel 28:18,19. Likewise those angels that joined with the Devil in rebellion against God were sentenced to death. The execution of such sentence or judgment of death, however, God deferred until his own due time to execute the same, at which time ‘all the wicked shall be destroyed’. (Pss. 145:20; 37:20) Satan challenged God to put on earth men that would maintain their integrity toward God, Satan at the time declaring that he could cause all men to curse God to His face. (Job 2:5) This boast of his was based upon the theory that he had influence and power over creation to turn them all against the Creator. In order to give Satan and his cohorts full opportunity to put forth their best endeavors to prove that wicked challenge, God deferred the execution of the judgment of death against them until his own due time to destroy all such wicked ones. Satan’s failure to make good his boastful challenge will prove to all creation the supremacy of Jehovah, the only source of life, the fountain of life, and the Giver of every good and perfect gift. In proof of His purpose in deferring the execution of the judgment of death against Satan, Jehovah said to him, as set forth in the Scriptures: ‘And for this cause have I permitted thee to remain, for to shew thee my power: and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.’ (Ex. 9:16, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser)</span><span class="font6"> The Scriptures prove that the suspension of the execution of the death sentence applied likewise to the other rebels called “demons”; and concerning which it is written: “And those angels who kept not their own principality, but left their own habitation, he has kept in perpetual chains, under thick darkness, for the judgment of the great day.” (Jude 6, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott) </span><span class="font6">“For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment.” —2 Pet. 2:4.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>7</sup> From the time of the rebellion and entering of judgment of death against those wicked ones God has permitted them to operate to the extent of their ability in support of Satan’s wicked challenge. God caused his servants to record in the Bible that, at the coming of the Lord Jesus and the setting up of the Theocratic Government with Jesus as King, the end of Satan’s rule without interference will come and then the wicked angels, together with Satan, shall be executed and no longer will the sentence of death be deferred. Concerning this it is written: “Whose judgment of old does not linger, and their destruction does not slumber.” (2 Pet. 2:3, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.) </span><span class="font6">No longer then shall there be any suspension of judgment. The execution shall then take place. Since the time of entering the judgment or sentence against Satan and his wicked associates those wicked ones have acted against God in their endeavor to make good the challenge of the Devil, and to this end they have deceived the masses of the people upon the earth and turned them away from God, but at all times there have been some who have maintained their integrity toward Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NOAH’S DAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ Noah was a servant of Almighty God and one who preached righteousness. (2 Pet. 2: 5) In Noah’s day the Devil and his other demons had exercised power and influence over mankind to such a degree that all the peoples of earth were corrupted, save Noah and his immediate family. “And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them: and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.”—Gen. 6: 5, 8,11,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ Because of such wickedness and violence God sent the deluge of waters, or great flood, in which all humankind except Noah and his immediate family were destroyed. (Genesis chapters 6 and 7) The words of Jesus, quoted in the foregoing text (Matt. 24:37), together with the physical facts now well known, prove that exactly a like condition now exists on the earth and that such condition becomes prominent immediately preceding the battle of the great day of God Almighty, in which battle the wicked ones will be executed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">DEMONS AND BABYLON</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup> Follow now the Scriptural account of the activity of Satan and his horde of wicked demons from the day of Noah and the flood even to this present day. God’s Word, recorded in the Bible, is the truth and alone can enlighten men, showing them the right way. (Ps. 119:105; John 17 :17) God’s Word of truth must be the guide of all who will now find the right way and escape the impending disaster. “God is light, and in him [there] is no darkness at all.” (1 John 1: 5) “Light is sown for the righteous.” (Ps. 97:11) That means that one must seek righteousness in order to see and appreciate and benefit from the light of God’s Word. The enemies of God walk on in darkness, and Satan, the chief one of the devils or demons, is deceiving them and leading them in darkness, and all the demons associated with the Devil are in darkness and all are workers of iniquity or wickedness. They all -work against Jehovah God and those who serve him. Mark, then, the means employed by the workers of iniquity to keep mankind in the darkness and away from God. The purpose of the Devil and his agents in keeping men blind is to bring about the destruction of mankind.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>11</sup> Within a short time after the flood Babylon was organized, with Nimrod as the earthly dictator. (Gen. 10:8-11) That was the first human government organized. From the Babylon stem all political governments of earth, past and present, have sprung. Elven though the original city of Babylon has disappeared, all governments on the earth bear the name of their mother, “Babylon,” and the Devil and his associate demons have exercised and continue to exercise influence, power and control over such governments. The organization of Babylon by Nimrod united religion, commerce and politics as the means of keeping the people in subjection and ruling them. Today all governments, including what is called “Christendom”, keep alive and carry on these same three elements composing Babylon, to wit, religion, commerce, and politics. The thousands of languages that originated at the^time of the confusion of the people on the plains of Shinar, in the land of Babylon, and spoken by the peoples in the different parts of the earth, have kept alive and have been under the control of these three elements, to wit, religion, politics, and commerce.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>12</sup> Babylon was demon-controlled, and the people worshiped demons. Its religion was demonism. That chief demon, Satan, from then till now claims Babylon (including all the governments of the earth) as his own, and this Jesus did not deny, but admitted, when he was on the earth. (Matt. 4: 8, 9) The Scriptures show that organized religion originated with the Devil, who created and brought into action religion for the very purpose of turning mankind away from God. The Scriptures also clearly prove that all the nations, including so-called “Christendom” at the present time, constitute “Babylon” and all such practice a Devil religion because the Devil has deceived men and carried on his religious practice, even in the name of God and Christ. Concerning such Jehovah says through his prophet to the modern-day “Christendom” or “Babylon”: “Come down, and sit in the dust, 0 virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground: there is no throne, 0 daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate. Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail. Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee. Behold, they shall be as stubble: the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame; there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before it.”—Isa. 47 :1,12-14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>13</sup> Satan, who is the arch demon, is designated in the Scriptures as “the god of this world” or “prince of this world”, meaning that the world is ruled and influenced by him. (2 Cor. 4:4; John 14:30) All governments of the earth constitute a part of Satan’s visible organization, and such are under the power and influence and control of the invisible demons; and few, if any, of them know this fact. The organization is united to Satan, like as a woman or wife is united to a man, and Satan’s organization is designated by the Scriptures under the symbol of an unclean woman, that is, a Devil-worshiping, sorcerypracticing woman. (Isa. 47: 1-15; Jer. chaps. 50 and 51; Rev. 17: 1-18) Satan’s world organization is generally known as “Babylon”, and all parts thereof practice some kind of religion brought into action by the Devil for the purpose of turning men away from the true and almighty God. For this reason the apostle and servant of Jesus Christ specifically warned the Christians, that is, the true followers of Christ Jesus, that this world is ruled and controlled by the demons and that all Christians must avoid religion, and informs them that their enemies, the demons, fight against all who serve God and Christ. “For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.”—Eph. 6:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>14</sup> Before the confusion of human speech at the tower of Babel the name “Babylon” had the meaning of “gate of god’&quot;. That was a religious name, without designating to which god it referred, but which in fact had reference to the mimic god Satan, that is to say, the god or mighty invisible ruler of this wicked world. (2 Cor. 4:4) In Babylon religion took the most prominent part. Nimrod set up religion, with himself as the visible representative of god, that is, Satan, and demanded that the people worship him, Nimrod; and for this reason he became a “mighty one”, and it is written of him in the Scriptures: ‘Nimrod, the mighty one in the earth; the mighty hunter before [that is, superior to] the Lord Jehovah.’ (Gen. 10: 8-10) (See, for further consideration, McClintock &amp;&nbsp;Strong’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Cyclopaedia,</span><span class="font6"> under the subtitle “Nimrod”.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>13</sup> Bible prophecy has much to say about Babylon and its destruction. The book of The Revelation tells that the destruction of Babylon is the coming event of surpassing interest both in heaven and in earth, the destruction of which refers to the complete fall of Satan’s organization, and not to the literal earth. The destruction of Babylon, as the Scriptures disclose, means the final end of the wicked world over which Satan and his demons have ruled, and which destruction will immediately follow the completion of the proclamation of Jehovah’s name and his kingdom, which work is now in progress in the earth. That witness &quot;work is now designated God’s “strange work”, to be followed by God’s “act, his strange act”, —Isa. 28:21.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“CHRISTENDOM&quot; IS “BABYLON”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>16</sup> The Scriptures disclose that the name “Serpent” is given to Satan the Devil to denote him as the arch deceiver, the one who practices fraud and deception upon mankind. One of his chief means of deception is to keep the people always in ignorance of the truth concerning his organization, and particularly concerning Babylon. The Scriptures definitely state that Babylon must be in existence at the end of Satan’s world, at which time it must be and shall be destroyed. “Babylon” is not merely “heathendom” and its religion, but also applies to “Christendom”; and it is in “Christendom” in particular that religion, commerce and politics unite to control the world. So-called “Christendom”, by means of fraud and deception, employs the name of Christ, and that name was so chosen and applied by the Devil for the manifest purpose of defrauding and deceiving the people and turning them away from God. “Christendom” is the highest development of and the most seductive form of Satan’s visible organization. The basic doctrine of ancient Babylon was the religious teaching or doctrine of “immortality”, first of the Devil and all his demons, and also including all human souls that come under the control of demons. Such doctrine is contrary to and taught in defiance of the truth of Almighty God and his announced decree that the wicked shall be destroyed. That doctrine of human immortality was the first lie ever told, and which was told by Satan to deceive and mislead Adam and Eve (Gen. 3:4, 5) Such lie resulted in the death of man. thus making Satan both a liar and a murderer. “Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of youi father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.&quot; —John 8:44.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>17</sup> That same Devil-religion doctrine of “immortality of all human souls” is today the fundamental doctrine or religious teaching of so-called “Christendom”, and which proves that “Christendom” is modern-day Babylon. That false doctrine of “human immortality” was obtained from the doctrine taught by the mother, or ancient Babylon, the Devil’s “woman” or organization, and the religious system of “Christendom” is plainly described in the Scriptures as “the daughter of Babylon”. (Rev. 17:5) By tins false doctrine religionists forming &quot;Christendom'' have been deceived and are still being deceived into yielding to the influence and power of the demons and thus they lay themselves open to complete demon control. “Christendom,” so called, offers no protection whatever to the people against demonism, but rather leads the people right into the trap of Satan and his associate demons, and for this reason becomes one of the chief means of hurrying the nations of earth into destruction. The Devil practices all manner of fraud and deception. He organized the chief religious system on earth, under the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and falsely designates that as “the Christian religion”. Even the so-called “Rrot estant” systems of religion claim to be opposed to Romanism, but, in fact, they all work together. The Devil then organizes and brings into action Communism, which openly fights the so-called “Christian religion” and also true Christianity. He uses atheists likewise to fight against those who serve God, and thus the Devil uses all these means and organizations to fight against God and against God’s faithful servants on the earth, and to deceive men.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">EXISTENCE OF DEMONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’* Modern-day religious leaders claim that the demons were all destroyed at the time of the flood, and hence by thus teaching they lure the people into the trap of the Devil. The people are thus deceived; and being deceived they easily become the victims of the Devil. The people are made to fear their religious leaders, and the fear of man leads them into the Devil’s snare. All the scriptures bearing upon the point show beyond any question of doubt that the demons, otherwise designated in the Scriptures as ■'Nephilim” (Gen. 6:4, 7?.F.), were not destroyed at the time of the flood, but continued their operations after the flood and are operating with the Devil even to this very day. To avoid confusion it must be clearly observed that the “Nephilim”, or wicked demon giants, and “the spirits in prison” to which Jesus preached (1 Pet. 3:19,20) are entirely separate and distinct from each other. The Devil and the Nephilim deceived the spiritual creatures designated “the sons of God” arfd induced them to materialize as men and take human women for wives, and to raise an offspring by such union, and all such offspring were destroyed in the flood. (See </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch-toiver</span><span class="font6"> 1934, pages 263-266.) Those “sons of God”, who materialized as humans, were imprisoned by the Devil at the time of the flood. (See proof, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> 1934, page 275.) As to the Nephilim, the wicked spirit creatures or demons that joined Lucifer in his rebellion, they survived the flood and are yet alive, and are the ones that, together with the Devil, now exercise power and control over the people and the nations of the earth. That the Nephilim were not destroyed in the flood, but were degraded, together with the Devil, the chief demon, and have been permitted to continue actively in their endeavors to turn men against God, mark the Scriptural evidence that follows, to wit: “The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them; the same were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown.”—Gen. 6:4, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>12</sup> Another authoritative translation of this text reads: “The fallen ones were in the earth in those days and even afterwards when sons of God came in unto daughters of men, and they have borne to them, they are the heroes, who, from of old, are the men of name.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Young’s)</span><span class="font6"> It was the offspring of the spirit creatures who materialized as men and of human women that were known in the earth as “men of renown”. The demons, “the fallen ones,” that is, the wicked spirit rebels and bullies, were in the earth then and afterward^, and it is the same wicked Nephilim or demons concerning which the following scripture is written, to wit: “For if God spared not angels when they sinned, but cast them down to hell </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[(Greek)</span><span class="font6"> Tartarus], and committed them to pits of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment; and spared not the ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven others, a preacher of righteousness, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly.”—2 Pet. 2:4,5, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>20</sup> The word </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Tartarus</span><span class="font6"> means a degraded condition, that is, a condition of darkness with no further hope or opportunity of understanding God’s purpose as revealed in the Scriptures and no hope of life everlasting. Being in darkness or degraded, they are wholly unable to understand God’s purpose concerning the great Theocratic Government. A similar condition is that of the “evil servant” class described by the Lord Jesus, and which persons are cast out from the light and into outer darkness. (Matt. 25 : 30; 13:41,42) As, soon as one turns against the organization of Jehovah God he becomes blind beyond any possible hope of recovery. Although denied the favor of light or understanding of God’s purpose, those wicked spirits or demons have been permitted to exist and to work with their chief, the Devil, to carry out his original wicked challenge made to Jehovah, to wit: That he, the Devil, could turn all men against God. This and other supporting scriptures which follow show that God has reserved or deferred the execution of the judgment of death against these wicked ones until Armageddon, the day of his vindication, and that until that time he keeps the wicked ones under surveillance and protects his faithful people from them. Jehovah declares his purpose at Armageddon to show the Devil and all his supporters that he, Jehovah God, is the Supreme One; and that day of final conclusion of the matter rapidly approaches.—Ex. 9:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>21</sup> The Devil himself, that is, the chief amongst the demons, is debased and degraded and beyond any possibility of recovery. He is totally depraved. He maintains his organization only by means of fraud, deception and other wicked machinations. That the Devil has and does maintain an organization which operates against God and against all who serve Jehovah God is shown by the Scriptures and the facts, beyond any doubt whatsoever. As an example, there appears in the prophecy (Dan. 2:30-34) </span><span class="font5">the </span><span class="font6">description of a terrible image, disclosing that the Devil is the head of a great and wicked organization, and that next to the Devil are princes or rulers subordinate to Satan the Devil. At Daniel 10: 13, 20 </span><span class="font5">is </span><span class="font6">the record concerning some of these demons designated under the titles “prince of Persia” and “prince of Grecia”. Among these princes is Gog, the demon officer next to Satan. (Ezek. 38:3,16) Next to the princes, according to the prophecy of Daniel, is another order or class of the wicked officers which “bear rule over all the earth”. (Dan. 2:39) This shows three separate divisions of Satan’s invisible organization: “principalities,” that is, the principal ruler exercising supremacy among the wicked ones; “powers,” that is, officers among the wicked ones that exercise power and control; and, third, “rulers,” invisible wicked creatures who have immediate power or influence over the nations of the earth under the supervision of the principal power, that is, the Devil. The apostle Paul, under inspiration and direction of Almighty God through Christ Jesus, recorded testimony concerning the foregoing wicked ones, and therefore his testimony is authoritative. Without doubt he knew of the wicked spirit creatures because he was familiar with the Scriptures written by the holy prophets of old. Note, then, that the apostle tells of these wicked invisible rulers that exercise power and control over the nations of the earth, and he divides them exactly as the prophet does, into three classes, to wit: “principalities,” “powers,” and “rulers”; all of which fight against God and against those who serve God. (Eph. 6:12) Also have this in mind: that the Devil has declared his purpose to be “like the Most High”. (Isa. 14:13,14) He therefore sets up an organization, which is a mimic of Jehovah God’s invisible organization. Satan exalts himself to the position of supremacy like unto that of the Most High, Jehovah. Gog, the chief officer of Satan, takes the place similar to that occupied by Jesus Christ, the Prince or Ruler or King of the great Theocratic Government. The wicked angels, that have direct influence and power over the nations of the earth, are made to correspond to the angels of Christ Jesus that always serve him and are under his immediate command.—Matt. 25: 31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>22</sup> As this invisible organization of the Lord Jehovah is provided with earthly representatives, so the Devil has provided his organization with earthly representatives, as the facts following will show. The purpose of the wicked organization of the Devil is to operate in defiance of Jehovah God in his attempt to turn all creation against Almighty God and plunge them into destruction.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ACTIVITIES OF THE WICKED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>25</sup> After the flood, or deluge of waters, which destroyed all flesh except Noah and his family, and after human creatures had multiplied and greatly increased in the earth, devil-worship, that is to say, Devil religion, was set up with Nimrod as the chief visible one, and religion was used or employed by the Devil through Nimrod to deceive the people and cause them to ‘worship the creature instead of the Creator’. (Rom. 1:25,30) That was the beginning of organized religion. (Gen. 10:8-10) Demon-worship, or devil religion, was thereafter adopted and practiced in Egypt, where “magicians”, or Devil agents, operated before the people in the practice of devil-worship to deceive both the ruler and the ruled of that land. “And it came to pass in the morning, that his [Pharaoh’s] spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.” (Gen. 41:8)—Ex. 7:11; 8:7,19; 9:11</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ISRAEL INVADED</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ Jehovah, by the act of Moses his servant, led the descendants of Israel out of Egypt, and at Mount Sinai God affirmed his covenant and declared to them his statutes and laws. The Israelites &quot;had journeyed but a short distance when the Devil, with his religion, invaded their ranks in his endeavor to turn them away from God in violation of their covenant (Ex. 32: 1-10) When the Israelites reached the land of Moab they again fell under demon power and influence and practiced demon religion known and designated as “Baal-peor”, a grossly immoral ceremony. (Num. 25:1-18) Time and again the Israelites fell away from God in violation of their covenant, and in every instance this they did under the influence of religion, which the Devil introduced amongst them. “They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger. Thex sacrificed unto devils, not to God ; to gods whom the) knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.”—Deut. 32:16, 17.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2S</sup> Jehovah specifically warned the Israelites that the religion of the demons would be a snare unto them. All the Canaanites and the people round about practiced devil religion, and the warning against such peoples and their practices was a warning against demon religion. God had given the land of Canaan to the Israelites for their inheritance and. as that land was inhabited by people who practiced demon or devil religion, God commanded that the Israelites should drive out these demon religionists “And when the Lord thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, noi shew mercy unto them. Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son. And thou shalt consume all the people which the Lord thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them; neither shalt thou serve their gods; </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">for that</span><span class="font6"> [devil religion] </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">will be a snare unto thee.”—</span><span class="font6">Deut. 7: 2, 3,16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>20</sup> The Israelites were clearly warned that religion would constitute a snare into which the Devil would entrap them. It was the Devil and the Nephilim that ensnared the Israelites and induced them to practice devil religion in defiance of God's law and their covenant. “And they served their idols; </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">which were a snare unto them.</span><span class="font6"> Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils, and shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood.”—Ps. 106: 36-38</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2 T</sup> As further evidence that the demons overreached the Israelites, note this in the Scriptures: “Jeroboam and his sons had cast them [the Levites] off from executing the priest’s office unto the Lord: and he ordained him [Jeroboam] priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made.”—2 Chron. 11:14,15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>28</sup> The apostle Paul, who was entirely familiar with the Divine Record concerning the activities of the demons and concerning their inducing the people to practice devil religion in defiance of Almighty God, wrote: “'What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing? But I say, that the things which the Gentiles [non-covenant peoples] sacrifice, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">they sacrifice to devils [(A.R.V.)</span><span class="font6"> to demons], </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">and not to God;</span><span class="font6"> and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils [demons]. Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils [demons]; ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of devils [demons].”—! Cor. 10:19-21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>29</sup> When the child Jesus was born at Bethlehem it was the Devil and his associate demons who put the wicked Herod wise to that event in order that he could carry out the Devil’s scheme to destroy the babe Jesus: “Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaaa in the days of Herod the king, behold, Wise-men </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[(Greek)</span><span class="font6"> Magi] from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we saw his star in the east, and are come to worship him.” “Then Herod privily called the Wise-men [magicians, religionists], and learned of them exactly what time the star appeared.”—Matt. 2:1, 2,7, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>30</sup> The magi, or “wise men”, so called, were clearly the servants of the Devil. This should serve as a warning to all who profess to be the followers of Christ Jesus and who have been deceived by clergymen and led to ignore the existence and power of the demons. Instead of following the admonition of the Scriptures, the religionists known as “leaders” and the principal ones of their flock exalt these devilworshipers or magicians by the ceremonies performed at what is called “Christmas time”. Each one of the magi was of the same class as those otherwise designated in the Scriptures as “the sorcerers”, and which the apostle Paul named as frauds, such as Elyrnas the Magus, who opposed the gospel preached by the apostle and whom Paul designated as a “son of the devil”.—Acts 13: 8-10, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.,</span><span class="font6"> margin.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">DEMONISM FORBIDDEN</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>31</sup> If men were righteous by nature, they would not need the law of God, because they would do righteousness, which is in harmony with God. “The law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient.&quot; (1 Tim. 1: 9) Jehovah God selected the Israelites as his typical people and led them out of the land of Egypt. Those people were imperfect, and therefore needed a law to guide them and keep them in and define to them the right way. Hence God gave to them his law prescribing what is right and prohibiting what is wrong. The law of God was given for that purpose, as shown by the words recorded, to wit: “The law was our schoolmaster [pedagogue, or teacher] to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.”—Gal. 3: 24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>82</sup> From the time of the promise of God that he would send Christ Jesus the Messiah until the actual coming of the Lord Jesus Christ was a long period of time, and the Israelites were given the law of God to keep them in the right way and shield and protect them from Devil religion until the coming of Christ Jesus. One of the specific things commanded by Jehovah God was that the Israelites were not to indulge in any religious practices or demon worship. Note this part of the law, to wit: “And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations.&quot;—Lev. 17 :7.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">” The offer of sacrifices unto demons was an act punishable with death. (Lev. 17:3,4; Gen. 9:5,6) According to the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Douay Version</span><span class="font6"> (Catholic Bible) Leviticus 19: 31 reads: “Go not aside after wizards [them that have familiar spirits], neither ask any thing of soothsayers, to be defiled by them; I am the Lord your God.” According to the same translation the following is written: “The soul that shall go aside after magicians, and soothsayers, and shall commit fornication with them, I will set my face against that soul, and destroy it out of the midst of its people. A man, or woman, in whom there is a pythonical or divining spirit, dying let them die; they shall stone them; their blood be upon them.”— Lev. 20: 6, 27, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Douay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’<sup>4</sup> The practice of any sort of witchcraft and the observing of times, such as Hallowe’en, Friday the 13th, the “Holy Year”, constitute an abomination in the sight of God, because the same relate to demons. “There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, or a charmer, or a con-suiter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. For all that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord; and because of these abominations the Lord thy God doth drive them out from before thee.” (Deut. 18: 10-12) This same text in the Douay Version of the Bible, which Bible is used by the Catholics, reads: “Neither let there be found among you any one that shall expiate his son or daughter, making them to pass through the fire; or that consulteth soothsayers, or observeth dreams and omens, neither let there be any wizard, nor charmer, nor any one that consulteth pythonic spirits, or fortune-tellers, or that seeketh the truth from the dead. For the Lord abhorreth all these things, and for these abominations he will destroy them at thy coming.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” When Jesus was anointed and began to carry out his commission on earth of proclaiming the truth, the demons, led by the chief one, Satan, the Devil, began actively to interfere with his work and to oppose him. The Devil sought to induce Jesus to violate His covenant with Jehovah God and thereby bring about His own destruction. In that he completely failed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>56</sup> The other demons, working with the Devil, were active at the same time, which proves conclusively that at that time the judgment against them was not executed, but its execution was deferred from the time it was made until God’s due time, Armageddon. Demons are also designated in the Scriptures as “evil spirits” or “wicked spirits”; and such at the time of Jesus would seize the mind of a person and control that person, and it is even so today. Early in the time of the activities of Jesus while in the flesh and preaching the gospel, the demons began to show themselves in opposition to him. Jesus was in the synagogue at Capernaum, there teaching the truth to the people, and his teaching was a great astonishment to them. “And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.” (Mark 1: 23-26) It was one of the wicked spirits or Nephilim in darkness that thus exhibited his power over the man described in the foregoing text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” There are times when many of the demons, acting together, seize control of a human creature and use that creature to do and perform unusual things. The Scriptural record tells of a poor man dwelling in the tombs, who exhibited unusual and marvelous power. When he was bound with fetters and chains those chains were immediately broken. The power required to break those chains was beyond the power of any ordinary man. It was the demons who seized control of that poor man and put forth the power to break the fetters and chains, thus making it appear that the man himself could do it. The demons know that Jesus is the Son of God, and they know that God’s judgment is written against them and that it declares their ultimate destruction. When the spokesman of those demons that had seized control of the poor man saw Jesus, the Scriptural account thereof says, “When he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him, and cried with a loud voice, and said. What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not. For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit. And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion; for we are many. And he besought him much, that he would not send them away out of the country. Now there was there, nigh unto the mountains, a great herd of swine feeding. And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine; and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand,) and were choked in the sea.”—Mark 5:6-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” The demons work in divers ways to control human creatures. They seize the mind of men and use men to perform strange acts and cause such deluded ones to believe that they hear voices of their friends who are dead. There are many instances recorded in the Scriptures of how the demons worked when Jesus was on earth. Only a few of such are here cited, and they are cited to prove the point that the demons, at the time Jesus was on earth, were alive and were not destroyed in the flood as clergymen have represented. One instance follows: A large company of the poor were seeking information at the mouth of Jesus, and the following incident is recorded: “And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son; for he is mine onh child. And lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again ; and, bruising him, hardly departeth from him.” “And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.”—Luke 9: 38, 39, 42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” As further proof that the demons were alive (and are yet alive) and expected a time to come for their final execution, note the following, in which the demons spoke to Jesus: “And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time?”—Matt. 8: 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">*° The Devil and his horde of demons employ a more subtle way of gaining control of the higher-ups amongst the people. Fear of men leads into the Devil’s trap. The Jews feared that they would not stand as high among the other nations unless they had a king. At their request God permitted them to have Saul for king. Saul thereafter fell under the complete influence and control of the demons. (1 Sam. 28:7,8) Furthermore the leaders of the Jews, fearing that they would be ridiculed by reason of not having some formalism called “religion”, adopted and practiced the form of worshiping idols and images. When Jesus came to the Jews he found the leaders teaching and practicing religion, showing that they had fallen under the influence of the demons. These leaders, called “Pharisees”, feared they would not be able to hold control over the people and have the people honor them and speak of them as “rabbi” and hail them in public places unless they had some kind of formalism to practice and to thereby induce the people to believe that such leaders were above ordinary men and. were clothed with special power or authority from Almighty God. That fear led such leaders to fall into the trap of Satan. (Prov. 29: 25) They had failed to trust God and obey the covenant God had made with the nation, although they had been frequently warned by Jehovah. For personal gam both of money and of approval of men those clergymen were willing to use the temple of Jerusalem as a place to sell various kinds of merchandise, and thus they made the temple of God a den of thieves”, and this was the result of the machinations of Satan and his associate demons. (Matt. 21: 12,13) Jesus, observing that the leaders of Israel had fallen under the influence of the demons and had adopted and were teaching doctrines contrary to God’s Word, denounced them in unparalleled, vitriolic language. By yielding to the influence of the demons and teaching the people doctrines contrary to God's Word, those clergymen had brought great reproach upon the temple and upon the name of Jehovah God and made his Word of none effect amongst the people; and therefore Jesus said to them. “But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men; for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.”—Matt. 23: 13.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>41</sup> Concerning the senseless formalism employed by the Pharisees in their religious practices Jesus said: “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint, and anise, and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith; these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. Ye blind guides! which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.” <sup>&lt;f</sup>Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers! how can ye escape the damnation of hell !”—Matt. 23: 23, 24, 33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>42</sup> Those Pharisees, who were religious leaders, had failed to teach God's Word and had substituted the traditions of men; and this they had done by falling under the influence and power of the demons; and concerning them Jesus said: “Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying: Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders! for they wash not their hands when they eat bread. But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition! Ye hypocrites! well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.”—Matt. 15 :1-3, 7-9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>45</sup> The religious leaders, the Pharisees, were blind to the truth of God’s Word because they had yielded to the Devil and adopted his religion, and hence Jesus said to them that they were blind. (Matt. 23: 19, 24) These Pharisees were not willing to accept the truth as brought to them by the Lord Jesus Christ, and were trying to prevent the people from seeing and understanding it; and this they did under the influence of the demons. They had been made blind by Satan and his horde and thus turned away from God. It was the truth Jesus spoke to them that stung those clergymen and cut them to the quick, and their only answer in defense was attempted violence against Jesus, and that violence was prompted by the demons. Mark this part of the record, which proves conclusively that those clergymen were under the influence, power and control of the Devil and for that reason they attempted to destroy the Lord Jesus Christ: “But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication ; we have one Father, even God. Jesus said unto them. If God were your Father, ye would love me; for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. Why do ye not understand my speech! even because ye cannot hear my word Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.”— John 8:40-44.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">“After the crucifixion of Jesus his apostles continued to proclaim the gospel of the kingdom of God, and the demons actively opposed them in their work. The apostles, by the power which the Lord conferred upon them, healed the afflicted, and for their good work the religionists condemned them. (Acts 5:16-18; 8:5-7) Seeing Paul, one of the apostles, exercising power over the demons, some of the commercial Jews tried to do likewise, even as some of the clergymen today pretend to represent the Lord; and concerning this it is written: “Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preacheth. And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so. And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye ! And the man in whom the evil spirit was, leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.” (Acts 19:13-16) Clearly the proof here is that those men were under the influence of the demons, and this is further proof that the demons were alive. This fraudulent representation of the Lord Jesus by the chief priest of his religious organization finds an exact parallel today amongst many of the priests, who fraudulently claim to represent the Lord, and who may soon expect to have their clothes torn off and go about naked and bare.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>45</sup> In the days of the apostles those wicked demons attempted to deceive and in this present time do deceive some who claim to be servants of God. They were alive and active then, and even in the present day those wicked spirit creatures are alive and active and do likewise deceive many who think that they are serving God. The testimony of the apostles authoritatively written clearly proves that in the end of the world, where we now are, clergymen claiming to serve God would fall under the influence of the demons, and concerning these it is written: “Now the spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron.”—1 Tim. 4:1, 2.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">*• In the days of the apostles the non-Jews as well as some of the Jews were offering sacrifices unto images or idols, and concerning that offering it is written: “What say I then! that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is an\ thing! But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">: and </span><span class="font6">I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.”—1 Cor. 10:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">*’ This is further and conclusive proof that the Devil uses religion and religious ceremonies as a means of deceiving the people and turning them awa\ from God. Thus the Devil used religion from the days of Nimrod to the days of the apostles, and what fol lows herein proves beyond all doubt that the demons are in this very day unusually active, employing religion to turn the people away from God. Let those who desire to be on the safe side study and considei carefully what follows. It will be found from the Scriptures that the close-girdling or besetting sin of all who profess to serve God is the influence of de mons brought to bear upon them by religion, and that in order to safeguard themselves they must be dih gent to avoid religion and for safety they must follow closely the Word of God.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark5"></a>WHEN JEHOVAH WAS ALONE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font4">HERE is but one First Cause: He who is from everlasting to everlasting. Addressing Him, Psalm 90:1, 2 says: “Lord, thou hast been our dwellingplace m all generations. Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.” He testifies: “Before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am Jehovah; and besides me there is no saviour.” (Isa. 43:10,11, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> His adoring creatures now worship Him, “saying, We give thee thanks, 0 Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast.” (Rev. 11: 17) “Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come.” (Rev. 1:4) He is “the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords ; who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen”.— 1 Tim. 6:15,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Hear, 0 Israel: Jehovah our God </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">[Elohim]</span><span class="font4"> is one Jehovah.” (Deut. 6:4, A.E.V.) There must have been a time when the great God was alone. There must have been a time when he, the one First Cause, began his creation. Does his written Record, the Bible, disclose what was the beginning of God’s creation! It does. The time of the beginning is not revealed; that is to say, there is no date disclosed for this among the dates given in the Bible. Whethei that time was a million or ten million years ago is not ma terial to man The fact of the beginning of creation is what man seeks. We may know that the mighty Eternal One who would create all things according to his sovereign will and who would cause a record thereof to be written, woule cause that record to be written truthfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Word of God records the fact that long before the creation of the earth, when there was no sea, when there were no springs and lakes, before there were any mountains or hills, yea, before the sun and the moon and the stars were made, God began his creation; and that beginning of his creation was his beloved One, known in the holy record as “The Word” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Ho Logos,</span><span class="font4"> in the Greek text): “and Ins name is called The Word of God.” (Rev. 19:13) The word </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Logos</span><span class="font4"> is one of the names or titles given to the beloved Son of God, “his only begotten Son,” and carries with it a deep meaning. When God gives a creature or thing a name, that name bears much significance. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Logos</span><span class="font4"> means the representative or spokesman for the great Creator. The title is therefore translated “Word”, at John 1:1,14, and 1 John 5- 7 (Auth. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ver.),</span><span class="font4"> and Revelation 19: 13, because he who is the Logos is the express Word of the One whom </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">he</span><span class="font4"> represents</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It pleased God to speak through the Logos, that His message might be conveyed to others of his intelligent crea tion. (Hcb 1-2) It is therefore appropriate that this mighty and beloved Son be called “the Word of God”. Concerning him it is written, at John 1: 1, 2 according to the interlinear reading of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Emphatic Diaglott:</span><span class="font4"> “In a beginning was the Word, and the Word was with the God, and a god was the Word. This was in a beginning with the God.” According to God’s will, he is the one “in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge” (Col. 2:3); he is the one “who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption”. (1 Cor. 1:30) This mighty, godlike One, the Logos, speaking as the embodiment of wisdom and as the authorized representative of the great Jehovah God, said concerning the question of the beginning of creation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Jehovah possessed me [(marginal reading) Jehovah formed me] in the beginning of his way, before his works of old I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, before the earth was. When there were no depths, I was brought forth, when there were no fountains abounding with water. Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth ; while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the beginning of the dust of the world. When he established the heavens, I was there: when he set a circle upon the face of the deep, when he made firm the skies above, when the fountains of the deep became strong, when he gave to the sea its bound, that the waters should not transgress his commandment, when he marked out the foundations of the earth; then I was by him, as a master workman; and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him.”—Prov. 8: 22-30, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This beloved One, the beginning of God’s creation, was the delight of the great God; and the Father, the Creator, took his beloved Son into his counsel, and thereafter operated through him in the creation of all things that have been created. “All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.” (John 1: 3) “Who is the image of the invisible God, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">firstborn of every creature</span><span class="font4"> [firstborn, not as to mere rank and position, but as to order of being created] : for by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: and he is before all things, and by him all 11.mgs consist” (Col. 1:15-17) As further proof that the Logos was God’s true and trusted One, Ephesians 3: 9 states. “God . . . created all things by Jesus Christ.” Not that he was Jesus Christ at the time all things were created, but this mighty One who now holds the name and title of Jesus Christ, as well as other titles, was the One who created .11 things aside from himself. Nothing was ever created by the Almighty God after the creation of the Logos, except by and through this hisHieloved One.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In God’s due time this creature, the Logos, was transferred from heaven to earth and was made in the likeness of man. “The Word </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">[Ho Logos}</span><span class="font4"> was made flesh, and dwelt ..mong us.” (John 1:14) He was then known by his God-c'lven name of “Jesus”, because the name “Jesus” means that he is the Savior. (See Matthew 1:21.) At the time of (tie beginning of his earthly ministry he was anointed by i lod’s holy spirit (Matt. 3:16,17) ; and from that time for-vard he was known by the title “Christ”, because </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Christ </span><span class="font4">means Anointed One. (Matt. 1:16) After he had repre sented Jehovah faithfully on the earth, he was given, in addition to his other titles, the title of “Faithful and True&quot; —Rev. 19:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At Revelation 3:14 it is stated that the Logos was “the beginning of the creation of God”: “These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God.” After creating him God made the Logos his active agent in the creation of everything that was created. The great God placed his beloved One, the Logos, in a position of confidence and trust. He counseled with him; and all things were created at the direction of the Almighty God, by and through the work of his beloved One, the Logos. Here then, in the Bible, is the authoritative proof that the stars and all things visible and invisible were created by Jehovah God by and through his active Agent, the Logos. In this and in all other work the Logos has been at all times true and faithful in representing the great Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Logos, when made flesh, said: “God is a Spirit” (John 4:24) Jehovah is “the invisible God”, invisible to man, and he always will be. “Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto, whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.” (1 Tim. 6:16) The word “spirit” is translated from the word </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">pneuma</span><span class="font4"> in the original Greek text of the Scriptures, which Greek word is elsewhere translated in the English Bible </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">wind.</span><span class="font4"> The wind is invisible to man, and it has power. God is invisible to man, and possesses unqualified power. It is therefore appropriate that we speak of God as The Spirit; because he is, and always will be, invisible to man and in him resides all power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah God is not a spirit creature, but is The Spirit Being, because “from everlasting to everlasting”. The Logos is a spirit creature, and was created by the Great Spirit, Jehovah. From the time of being created the Logos was “with the God”, in his presence, and ever his delight It is therefore entirely proper, according to the Scriptures, to state that the Logos, now also known as Christ Jesus, the great and mighty Son of God, is a spirit creature, and tin. first creature of all of God’s creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No creature can exist without form or organism Everv creature must have a body suited to him. “There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">[pneumahkon]</span><span class="font4"> body ” (1 Cor. 15:44) The natural body is flesh and blood and bones. A spirit body has none of these; “for a spirit hath not flesh and bones.” said Christ Jesus to his disciples after his resurrection when he appeared to them in a specially created body of flesh. (Luke 24: 39) “Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.” (1 Cor. 15: 50) Man cannot describe the appearance of a spirit body, because this knowledge has not been given nor revealed to him. To the spirit-begotten Christians the apostle John wrote: “It doth not yet appear what we [spiritual sons of God] shall be”, that is, what a spirit creature is like.—1 John 3: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Among the spirits created by Jehovah, through his beloved One the Logos, was Lucifer. His name means “morning star”, or “the bearer of light”. (See Isaiah 14:12, marginal reading.) It is also written concerning him : “Thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.” (Ezek 28: 14) The term “stones of fire” here seems to refer symbolically to other spirit creatures shedding forth great light. (Heb. 1 • 7 , Ps. 104 ■ 4) In symbolic language the “stars” are used to represent spirit creatures. (See Numbers 24:17; Job 38:7; Psalm 148: 3; Daniel 12:3; Revelation 2: 28; 22 :16.) As the stars which we behold shed forth light reflecting the glory of the great Creator, so the spirit creatures in the realm of the great God are bearers of light in His name and to His glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A class of creatures created by the great God, by and through the Logos, is described in the Scriptures as “cherubim”. The great eternal Jehovah is represented as dwelling between the cherubim. (See 1 Samuel 4: 4; 2 Samuel 6:2; Psalm 99:1.) Thus the Scriptures indicate that the cherubim occupy positions of honor and trust near the great Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Seraphim” is the name given to other creatures of the spirit realm. They were created by the Logos, acting in the name and under the direction of the great Jehovah God. These creatures are bearers of light reflecting His glory. —Isa. 6: 2-4, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Archangel” is the name given to some of God’s spirit creatures, which name signifies “first in rank” of the angels. (1 Thess. 4:16) The title or name “archangel” was also applied at times to the Logos, when he was serving Jehovah in a certain or specific capacity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Angels are others of God’s spirit or heavenly creatures, made by him through his beloved One the Logos. “Who maketh his angels spirits: his ministers a flaming fire.” (Ps 104:4; Heb. 1:7) “Angels” means “messengers”, sent or dispatched as deputies or representatives to perform some specifically assigned duty. In the outworking of the divine purpose these messengers or angels have always been employed by Jehovah to carry out his orders. These angels are spirit creatures, and are therefore invisible to man. They have from time to time been granted the power to appear before men in material bodies, and then at the proper and convenient time to disappear or dematerialize. Many instances are recorded in the Bible where angels have appeared in the form of men in order to perform some mission granted to them by Jehovah. These spirit creatures have often been sent by the Lord God as messengers of war, to execute orders against the enemies of his people. These angels are spoken of as the hosts of Jehovah God. They are also referred to as “legions”, thus indicating that they are organized into great bodies to carry out Jehovah’s purposes. When the Logos, then Christ Jesus, was on earth and was about to be slaughtered by his enemies, he said to Ins disciple: “Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to mj Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?” (Matt. 26:53) These mighty spirit creatures God has made for his purposes and for his pleasure. That they are beautiful and glorious beyond description of human phrase there can be no doubt. When some of these appeared in the form of men they were beautiful and glorious. It follows, then, that in their spirit bodies they are far more beautiful and glorious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Long ages ago, before earthly time began, the great Jehovah God had a wonderful and mighty organization consisting of a host of spirit creatures, the beautiful angels among them, archangels, seraphim, cherubim, Lucifer and the mighty Logos, the two latter being designated as “the morning stars”. (Job 38:7; Isa. 14:12; Rev. 22:16) We may be sure that the great Creator would not create these mighty creatures for any idle purpose; therefore we must know that each one of them was assigned to some duty of importance. They were, when created and so assigned, all holy; because they were completely devoted to God These glorious spirit creatures, all in harmony with God, constitute what is called “the heavens”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Above and higher than all, of course, was the great Jehovah God ; and all his holy creatures were singing praises and rejoicing before the Eternal One. Psalm 68 4, 33 “Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH [abbreviation for 'Jehovah’], and rejoice before him. To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old. Io, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.” All these heavenly creatures of the spirit realm obeyed, supported, upheld and looked up to and praised the great GOD, therefore it is written that Jehovah rides above the heavens of the heavens All the heavens declared his glory and sang his praises</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Up to the period of time thus far described in God’s creation there was no earth and, of course, no man Up to this time there was nothing in heaven to mar its peace, beauty and happiness. We know this because God had created everything there, and all the works of Jehovah ar&lt; perfect, says Deuteronomy 32: 4. So far as the divine record discloses, nothing up to this time had occurred as an inducement to cause the deflection of any of the spirit creatures. As a mighty host, led by The Logos and the other great light-bearer that walked by his side, they proclaimed the praises of Him “the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy”.—Isa. 57:15.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">We declare that we stand firmly on the side of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, and for the Theocratic Government, which we know, from revealed prophecy, is now being established on the earth We recognize that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> is the means used to bring these truths to those of good will We resolve that we shall obey all instructions received from the </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower,</span><span class="font3"> knowing that such proceed from the higher powers, Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. We resolve to be completely obedient to the Society as the visible part of the Great Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ON SIDE OF JEHOVAH GOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I am a patient at the hospital and have been for some time. Both my lungs are affected, and four years ago the family doctor advised my coming here to take treatments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When I first entered Sea View I became interested in the Seventh-Day Adventists and was reading their literature and having studies with them. I really was beginning to accept the seventh day, or Saturday, as the Lord’s Day of Rest and tried to observe it as best I could here. But it seems, now, that God interfered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One day, by accident, my bed-partner tuned in her radio at 1300, and the Watchtower was broadcasting its fifteen-minute reading period I did not understand what “church” was broadcasting, but, as it sounded good to me, I sent for the booklet offered Soon thereafter Brother Shuter and Sister Miller called on me and wanted to know if I had enjoyed reading the booklet, to which I replied, ‘Yes,’ but that I was interested in the SeventhDay Adventists I had become quite convinced that the sabbath must be kept, and told them so. This they contradicted; but I was a little stubborn and said they would have to prove it to me from the Bible. Sister Miller said she would be glad to get me some reading matter on the subject, which she did, and I started reading it with an open mind and a prayer that I might see the truth, but quite sure that before I was finished I could still say the sabbath must be kept. As I read and looked up the Scripture verses I began to have some doubt in my mind, and further study revealed to me that the sabbath law was meant only for the Jews and only until such time as the promised redeemer should come to fulfill the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Soon after Sister Sexton started coming to see me regularly and brought me the Bible study helps and other literature. At limes it amazed me to see how differently these books explained things as compared with that taught in the churches, and I bega’i to understand the reason for present-day conditions</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The state of death was another thing which was never satisfactorily explained to me until I read these books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">1 am most fortunate in having my own little radio now, with earphones, and almost daily listen to your recorded lectures and studies broadcast over station WBBR Also had the privilege to listen to your world-wide message “Government and Peace” from Madison Square Garden on June 25 of this year It was a most stirring message, and I am glad I did not miss it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It has been my desire for some time to be able to attend one of the Sunday evening Bible study meetings here on the island, and on Sunday, August 20, this was made possible Sister Sexton and Sister Miller arranged it so they could bring me back to the hospital in good time. It was good to be among people of good will and to see how a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> study is conducted. The ready response to the questions on the study was interesting to note All this has convinced me that Jehovah’s witnesses are the anointed of God performing their work in declaring the vindication of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I would like to be counted as among those of good will who are looking forward to the righteous kingdom, under Christ Jesus the King. I have taken my stand on the side of Jehovah God and abide his will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Sincerely,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Theresa Erust</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SOURCE OF JOY AND CONSOLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I am writing to you to say how pleased I am that the books I have had, including </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font3"> have revealed the truth of the Bible, Jehovah’s Word, so vividly in the light of the events of the past week. The Scriptures are certainly revealing the naked truth, and already Fascism is upon the civil population of England</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I am pleased with these truths, and find the reading of the Bible a source of great joy and consolation. I am of military age (32), but will register my conscientious objection, as the Bible says “Thou shalt not kill”. If only all the peoples of this earth were to be witnesses for Jehovah as I am, what a beautiful paradise we would be living in 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I must now close and hurry to post this, as it is growing dark now and the permanent black-out is due to start in a few minutes and I must find the pillar box before then.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s witness,</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RESISTING INVASION OF HOME RIGHTS (ENGLAND)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I had played two (four sides) of the records on my gramophone and was playing the third record at 5k p.m. in the living room of my home, on Sunday 20th August, when I heard a loud ringing and banging on my door. I went to open the door, to see who it was, and as I opened it two policemen stepped in. I checked their progress down the lobby with my outstretched arms. One policeman, No. C 15, then said: ‘If you don’t take that damn thing off, then I will.’ I asked him, ‘What thing?’ and he said, ‘That gramophone or wireless or whatever it is. It is annoying the whole neighborhood. It’s annoying me; I can hear it a mile away.’ I told him it was a gramophone and that I did not know it annoyed anyone, as I had had no complaints and did not think it possible for anyone to hear unless he came very close to the house. They went away. I put the record on again, as I had not heard it properly, and at five minutes past five the two police, C 15 and C 67, came again, this time to tell me that I must give my name, address, age, etc. C 15 said: ‘The row has gone louder; you’ll hear more about this.’ I replied that I had done no harm, annoyed nobody, and that I could not be charged with something I had not done. I also said that whoever had caused them (the police) to come, should have come to me first and the annoyance, if any, would have ceased. C 15 then said, after C 67 had taken all particulars: ‘You know full well this record stuff annoys all Catholics; I am Irish myself, so don’t worry, as 1’11 get you.’ The two police then went away after causing an unnecessary crowd of children to gather at the front and side of the house. I looked out and saw three women laughing, sneering and triumphantly gibing about the affair.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">GROWTH AT DUCKENSFIELD, ST. THOMAS, VIRGIN ISLANDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“In February of this year (1939) a publisher left his home to work on an estate, and took with him his phonograph and some publications. There he met an interested lady with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> They started to study as a company of two, and now they are a company of seven publishers, with several attending the study meeting.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">GETTING THEM TO READ “KINGDOM NEWS NO. 5&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I have been able to get several Catholics to take the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font4"> by telling them: ‘It is a little newspaper. Surely your priests don’t keep you from reading newspapers.’ Their usual reply—‘Oh, no, they will let us read that.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">LEARNING TO RIDE THE “BEAST OF BURDEN”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“A publisher in poor health said she would like to use the phonograph, but found it too much for her to carry I asked if she ever had tried the ‘doorstep method’, to which she replied, ‘No.’ I then asked her if she would like to come along with me to the4iomes and see how it was done; which she did. After about an hour and a half she remarked it surely was wonderful how the phonograph got one into the homes, and said that she was sitting down most of the time and really was resting instead of working, and letting the machine do the work. After three days of using the doorstep method she said she would not be without it any more, because she worked far less and got much better results, and more back-calls. She also stated she does not have to carry it very far, as it is sitting on the floor working most of the time while she rests.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ENTERING WEDGE FOR BACK-CALLS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“If they take literature, ask them this: ‘If I come back in two weeks, will you tell me what you think of the booklet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font4"> and give me an honest opinion of it?’ If they don’t take anything, offer a booklet and ask the same question, and if they agree to give you an opinion, then take their name and return in two weeks. I have gotten as high as ten back-calls a day by doing this.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PHONOGRAPH MORE EFFECTIVE THAN RADIO IN CALIFORNIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The mother told me she was a true Catholic After some discussion, though, it developed she was studying her Bible, and at one point she turned to the daughter, saying, 'See. that is just what we were talking about.’ She took </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation. Riches,</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies,</span><span class="font4"> remarking again to the daughter, T wonder what Father------would say if he saw me taking</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">these.’ It was decided that we should run the lecture ‘Warning’ at that time. As it neared the end a car drove into the driveway and she said, ‘That is my two brothers; they have been to mass.’ When the men came in, both ladies, pointing to chairs, said, ‘Sh—, listen!’ At the conclusion the me’i had little to say, and, as it was noontime, I left and ate m&gt; lunch in the car near by. Shortly after, the lady camo to the car and said her brother wanted some of the books, also Outcome: six more books placed and a back-call arranged for the following Friday night; at which time they wen ready and waiting for us. Meantime they had read </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Un covered,</span><span class="font4"> and the older woman quite a ways in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font4"> We ran ‘Government and Peace’. As the Madison Squan Garden disturbance as recorded broke out thex really sat on the edge of their chairs. When the judge said, ‘Doubt less none of them had been educated in a parochial college.' the man hollered ‘Wowie!’ and laughed when the parochial college was referred to the second time In the discussioi that followed, the lady asked about images She xx.is quiti familiar with the Ten Commandments, and the first om had caused her to question the use of images. After a turn she said, ‘I am not going to mass Sunday; it’s going to bi hard, as I haven’t missed for years, and I’m going to get rid of these crucifixes hanging around here, and as inuel as I love my little altar, I’m going to put it aside and stoj repeating prayers.’ To take the place of mass Sunday she is going to listen to the speech ‘Victory’ Also, ne me to begin a Model Study with them Friday night ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">LIKE THE LOCUSTS’ TAIL LEFT BEHIND (REV 9:10)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“While working the business section I handed the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Sa! vation</span><span class="font4"> folder to a man in a garage who ‘did not think !.&lt;• would take any of the books’. Before 1 had finished witness ing to the others in the garage this man came to me ami said, ‘I believe I will take those books, both of them ’ Next day some publishers were working the rurals near this sam.

When the record ‘Snare and Racket' had finished, a lady who was visiting her rural fiiend said ‘Yesterday I was away from home, and when I returned I found a leaflet under my door which told about a book calk : </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation.</span><span class="font4"> I had intended sending for it, but if this is th&lt; same book you have, I will just take it now ’ A few weeks later a man came hunting for me from three or four doordown the street, with this folder in his hand He had decide'<sup>1 </sup>after reading it that he would like to have the book.”</span></p>

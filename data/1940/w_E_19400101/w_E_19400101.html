<p><span class="font3">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, Is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind ; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH'S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord's next great act is the destruction of Satan's organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MEMORIAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Saturday, March 23, after six p.m., is the date for 1940 for the yearly feast in celebration of Jehovah’s name and to the sacrifice of the Lamb of God, Chnst Jesus, his Theocratic King. Each company, therefore, should assemble after six p.m. of March 23, and the anointed ones thereof celebrate the Memorial, their companions the Jonadabs being present as observers. If there is no competent person present to deliver a brief discourse immediately preceding the partaking of the emblems, that short article appearing in the March 15, 1939, issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> should be read before those assembled before partaking. Since the breaking of the bread and drinking of the wine both picture the death of Jesus, it follows that both emblems should be served together at partaking, and not separately The emblems should be unleavened bread and real red wine. Jesus and his apostles used real red wine in symbol of his blood, and the anointed remnant should follow their lead. A report of the celebration should be made to the Society as instructed in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font3"> In preparation therefor the article “Memorial” suggested above will be studied with profit.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark1"></a>REJOICE IN HIS SALVATION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.&quot;—Ps. 13:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH is the Almighty, the Rock, the Eternal King, the Fortress, the Deliverer, the power of salvation. His salvation is for the righteous, that is to say, for those who believe on him and who joyfully obey God’s commandments. The end of the willful transgressor is destruction. “But the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord; he is their strength in the time of trouble.” (Ps. 37:39) The man who looks to another source for salvation is a fool and by his action declares there is no Almighty God Jehovah. “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.”—Ps. 14:1.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> These are days of peril, when the wicked one is endeavoring to destroy all men and that wicked one, acting through his earthly agents, is seeking specifically to destroy those who have devoted themselves to Jehovah. The ever-increasing woes upon the peoples of earth cause many to desire to find a way of escape. There is but one means of escape from disaster, and that is the way which Jehovah God has provided for those who love him and who prove that love by gladly serving him. During the past year the people of God have been beset on every side by enemies. Being warned by the Lord that much opposition would be shown to those engaged in his service, and much persecution upon such faithful ones by the enemy, the faithful have been greatly comforted by the text for the year 1939: “They shall not prevail against thee.” As we enter upon another year our confidence is wholly in Jehovah, and, in view of the perils that threaten, the text for the ensuing year, and to which attention of those who love righteousness is directed, is this, to wit: “My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">’ Being positively informed that this and other scriptures recorded long ago were written for the learning, aid, comfort and hope of the faithful on earth just preceding the final destruction of Satan’s organization (Rom. 15: 4), it will be well to give consideration to the year text and to the context, that we may have comfort and hope. Undoubtedly Psalm 13 is a prophecy recorded for the aid and comfort of God’s people at the present time, and which prophecy is now being fulfilled upon the people of earth who are wholly devoted to Jehovah and to his King. It is a song composed and sung by David, the “man after [God’s] own heart”, and who was a type of the Greater David, Christ Jesus, the beloved Son of God. The Psalm therefore applies to the “feet of him” (Isa. 52:7), because such are a part of The Christ. The Psalm appears to apply to the actual experiences through which David the king was required to pass. It was not written by the shepherd lad, but by the mature man who had been cruelly persecuted by the opponent whom David mentions as “mine enemy”. It must have been written after David had killed Goliath and after King Saul had been stirred to malice by reason of the praise which the women had bestowed upon David in preference to Saul, and after Jonathan had become the real friend and lover of David. It was after that time that 'Saul becomes David’s enemy continually’. (1 Sam. 18:29) Saul spoke of David as “mine enemy”. (1 Sam. 19:17) David’s companions and associates referred to Saul as “thine enemy”. (1 Sam. 24:4; 2 Sam. 4:8) Jonathan declared that David’s enemy would be cut off; which was also a prophecy. (1 Sam. 20:15) Note that verse 4 of Psalm 13 refers to “mine enemy” and “those that trouble me”, and which must have reference to those who connived with and supported Saul in his persecution of David, such as Doeg, the Edomite, Saul’s chief herdsman.—1 Sam. 19:19; also 21: 7; 22: 6-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The persecution which Saul heaped upon David put David in a position where he appeared to have been forsaken by Jehovah, as his words indicate. (Ps. 13:1) Such experiences filled David’s heart with sorrow, and David realized that he was in great danger. That persecution of David was done in a malicious endeavor to cut David off from the kingdom. That also was prophetic. Similar persecution began against Christ Jesus, the Greater David, immediately following his anointing. Like persecution has been heaped upon God’s anointed people especially since A.D. 1922. Saul was the one to whom David refers as “my strong enemy”. (2 Sam. 22:1-8; Ps. 18:17) Those prophetic pictures made long ago are being fulfilled in this day, and Psalm 18:17 specifically refers to the deliverance of the antitypical David class from the antitypical Saul class, “my strong enemy.” God’s anointed people now appreciate the danger in which they are placed, and by faith they adopt and utter the words that David uttered, to wit: “He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me; for they were too strong for me.” (Ps. 18:17) “They prevented me [from service to Jehovah] in the day of my calamity; but the Lord was my stay. He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.” (Ps. 18:18,19) These consoling words are now a means of strength which God administers to his faithful people on the earth.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> It may be well to call attention here to the other “enemies” of David during his reign, because these were also typical. The rebellion of Absalom caused David to flee from Jerusalem. Again, there was that prototype of the traitor Judas Iscariot, whose name was Ahithophel the Gilonite, who for some time acted as David’s counselor or confidential adviser, and who became unfaithful, turned traitor, and joined in a conspiracy against the king. (2 Sam. la: 12) Concerning that traitor counselor David wrote: “Wickedness is in the midst thereof; deceit and guile depart not from her streets. For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it; neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him. But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance. We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.” “He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him; he hath broken his covenant. The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.” (Ps. 55:11-14, 20, 21) Such is a description of those who enter into a confidential position with the Lord’s people and then betray them to the enemy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> Psalm 109 likewise applies to such. Manifestly the Lord caused these things to be recorded as a warning to the feet members of Christ and to notify them that they would be assaulted in like manner by the enemy in the last days of their earthly journey.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FULFILLMENT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> Jehovah caused prophecy to be written and recorded by holy men of old, which prophecy must have fulfillment in God’s due time. The fulfillment and revelation thereof to man is for the good of “the man of God”, that he may be thoroughly equipped for the difficulties he must meet. (2 Tim. 3: 16,17; 2 Pet. 1: 21; Rom. 15:4) When God brings to pass upon his antitypical people the experiences that exactly fit the typical, then we may know that the prophecy is in course of fulfillment. Therefore, in correspondence with the typical experiences of David the fulfillment of Psalm 13:5 comes to pass after A.D. 1922, and comes to pass upon the anointed “feet of him”. It was in that year that the holy spirit was poured out upon all the faithful ones then in the organism of flesh. (Joel 2:28,29) The fulfillment applies even later than that and during and after A.D. 1929,- at which time the antitypical Goliath’s fear-inspiring power over God’s anointed remnant was killed by “the stone” of the kingdom truth identifying the “Higher Powers” as Jehovah and Christ Jesus, and after the “seven last plagues” had been poured out. (1 Sam. 17:40-54; Rev. 15:1; 16:1) Psalm 13:5 applies even later, to wit, after 1931, when the antitypical Jonathan class was first seen by the “remnant” to be foreshadowed by the prophecy at Ezekiel 9:4, and which identification was followed later by the revelation of the same earthly class as the modern Jonadabs. (2 Ki. 10: 15-23) That identification was made more complete in the year 1935 (A.D.), when it was revealed by the Lord to his people and caused to be publicly proclaimed that the “great multitude” is an earthly company, the “other sheep” of the Lord, which are gathered to the Lord before Armageddon. (Rev. 7:9; John 10: 16) It was at that same time, at the Washington (D.C.) convention, that the idolatrous practice of flag saluting was publicly mentioned at a meeting of God’s people held on the 3rd day of June, 1935, and which laid the basis for more trouble. Thereafter the modern-day Philistines were identified and made known to the people of God. Thus the physical facts that have come to pass locate the beginning of the fulfillment of the prophecy, and the present-day facts show that the prophecy is yet in course of fulfillment The prophecy, therefore, has a peculiar interest to all who have covenanted to do God’s will.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">DANGER</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Looking again at the prophetic type, it is observed that David was in danger of death by violence, not a death of peaceful sleep due to the inherited condemnation that came through Adam’s sin, but a danger of death at the hands of his mortal enemy Saul and his allies in wickedness. (Ps. 13: 3) David was therefore in need of protection and deliverance that he might be saved from being cut off from the throne to which he had been anointed by Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">’ “The feet of him,” that is, of the Greater David, Christ Jesus, are those of the anointed remnant, the witnesses of Jehovah who are commissioned and sent forth to declare the name of the Almighty God and to announce his King throughout the earth as a witness and warning to the people. Because of their faithfulness in the performance of duty, as commanded by the Lord, Jehovah’s witnesses are continuously set upon by their mortal enemy, the Devil, and his wicked agents on the earth, who have conspired together to cut off the remnant from the kingdom and from becoming a part of God’s “holy nation”. (Ps. 83:1-4) These faithful servants are now greatly in need of protection, deliverance and salvation, not from death the result of inherited sin, but from destruction at the hands of the enemy. The salvation needed is from destruction of Jehovah’s faithful witnesses and their companions, the Jonadabs, which destruction is threatened by the combined enemy, and particularly the religious element, and which the enemy is maliciously and desperately trying to carry into execution. The text for last year informed God’s people that the enemy should not prevail against them, although they would fight against them. While the persecution increases, with faith in God and full confidence in him and his King those who truly serve the Lord now can confidently look to the Lord for protection and say: “My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ENEMIES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> The invisible enemies of those who are devoted to the great Theocrat and his government by Christ Jesus are, to wit: Satan the Devil, the arch enemy, and a host of wicked spirit creatures operating with Satan against God and against all who love and obey Jehovah. Those invisible enemies moved against David and, in doing so, used Saul and his supporters in an effort to destroy David. Likewise today the Devil and his wicked spirits move to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions, and in this wicked warfare the antitypical Saul class, the visible ones who do the bidding of the Devil, join in the conspiracy to bring about such destruction of God’s faithful people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> The antitypical Saul class is “the man of sin”, “the son of perdition,” made up of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and other malicious religionists, including those who were once in line for the kingdom and who now form the “evil servant” class. (2 Thess. 2:3, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.;</span><span class="font5"> Matt. 24:48-51) All of these who, together, compose “the man of sin”, “the son of perdition,” work together and induce many simple-minded dupes, who are now influenced and controlled by the wicked demons, to join with them in this malicious conspiracy. Such visible leaders hide themselves behind a “refuge of lies” and resort outwardly at times to “fair speeches”, by which they deceive the simple-minded. All such fear man, but do not fear God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> Saul’s Edomite herdsman, Doeg, whose name means “fearful”, spied upon David and gave information to be used to the destruction of David. Likewise the modern-day Saul class have their spies who seek for information to bring about the destruction of the faithful servants of God. Such spies mingle with God’s faithful servants, pretend to be friendly, and do this in order to find something that might be used against the faithful. Such spies, like the meaning of the name of Doeg, are “fearful” of men, but they do not fear God. They fear men may not think as highly of them as they desire to be thought of, and hence they are led to do things in the presence of other men which they think might bring to them praise and approval. Such spies serve the Devil for selfish gain and are held to their leaders of the Saul class by ties of religion. Otherwise stated, they are religionists and followers of religious leaders. Some specific examples of these are the dupes of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, who attempt to break up the meetings of God’s faithful people, and such as police officers who act at the behest of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy or members of that priesthood, and such organizations designated as “The American Legion”, “The Christian Front,” the “Christian Mobilizers”, the Coughlinites, and other similar dupes and agents of the Hierarchy. Thus it is seen that the Lord foretold this combination of enemies who would conspire together to bring about the destruction of those who serve God, and this conclusively proves that such enemies are the offspring of the Devil.—John 8: 44.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Working together with and playing into the hands of the aforesaid agents of the Hierarchy are also the rebellious ones pictured by Absalom, who claim to be in line for the heavenly throne. These do not see the existence of the Theocratic Kingdom because they are blinded by self-interest and are moved with ambition for positions more favorable to them; and they try therefore to discredit the servants of Jehovah, by which means they hope to exalt themselves to more favorable positions than they now occupy. The modern-day-Absalom rebels against the kingdom are supported in their work by those who attempt to counsel and advise the Kingdom class, and which false counselors were pictured by Ahitho-phel the Judean counselor who betrayed his chief. The name Ahithophel means “brother of disguising” or “dissembler”. By his act of treason against the king he prophetically foreshadowed Judas Iscariot, who betrayed the Lord Jesus Christ, the Greater David, and he also foreshadowed the modern-day Judas or traitor class. This conclusion is fully supported by the words of Jesus at John 13:18, 21, and also those words of Jesus serve to apply Psalm 55 to Judas, and to his antitype, the Judas class of the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> The horde of enemies against Jehovah and his King and kingdom were further foreshadowed by the Philistines and their allies. The Philistine giant Goliath was survived by other monstrosities, to wit,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">(1) Ishbi-benob; and (2) Saph, another giant; and (3) Goliath’s brother; and (4) the twelve-toed, twelve-fingered giant of Gath. (2 Sam. 21:15-22) All of those wicked giants fell by the hand of David and those who were companions with or servants of David. That entire wicked combination above mentioned prophetically pictures the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the Nazis, the Fascists, the Communists, the totalitarian-monstrosity organizations, which now fight against the Theocracy, which government or Theocracy is now represented on the earth by Jehovah’s witnesses and their “companions”. These faithful representatives .of the Lord have a commission from Jehovah to advertise the Theocratic Government, and this commission they must fulfill; and by doing so they draw upon their heads the wicked persecution and assaults from the combined enemy aforementioned. Thus the prophetic picture shows the antitypical David class, the “feet of him [the Greater David, Christ Jesus]”, together with their companions, in action, and that all such servants of Jehovah God are in great danger and in need of protection, deliverance and salvation. The faithful now see and appreciate this prophetic picture given for their warning. The cry of David unto Jehovah, as set forth in the 13th Psalm, prophetically foretold the cry of the faithful servants of Jehovah and the companions who are now on the earth. Everywhere on the earth today the persecution of Jehovah’s servants increases. This is clearly in fulfillment of the words of Christ Jesus applying to the present time: “And ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.” (Matt. 24:9) These faithful servants of Jehovah are now beset by the combined enemy, and are often arrested and thrown into prison. They are ill-treated and abused and some of them cruelly put to death. The combined enemy now surrounds those servants of the Lord, all of whom are in danger, and that danger is ever increasing. Some of the Lord’s little ones come to the point of almost despair, and it is for the comfort of those who are weak in faith that these precious promises are recorded in the Scripture. This is the time, therefore, for all the Lord’s servants to fully trust in and have complete confidence in Jehovah and his King.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> All of Jehovah’s servants with anxiety look to Jehovah and Christ.Jesus for help, and many of them wonder how much longer they must endure the assaults heaped upon them by the enemy. They pray unto God words to this effect: “Consider and hear me, 0 Lord my God; lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death; lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.”—Ps. 13: 3, 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>16</sup> The experiences through which David passed exactly fit the conditions and experiences that now surround and beset the faithful servants of Jehovah on the earth. Those servants of the Lord now call to mind the words of Jesus, which apply to them at the present time: “But he that shall endure unto the end. the same shall be saved.”—Matt. 24: 13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">” These words were spoken by the Master to aid and comfort those who are undergoing trying experiences. The test is now upon God’s people. Jesus was put to the severest test and proved faithful. His servants, called to follow in his footsteps, must be subjected to a like test; and being thus forewarned, they are forearmed and they put their trust wholly and completely in the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MERCY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> Jehovah heard the cry of David and showed his mercy toward his servant, the “man after [his] own heart”. David, while suffering at the hands of his persecutors, said to Jehovah: “But I have trusted in thy mercy.” (Ps. 13:5) The faithful servants of Almighty God do not trust in vain for the mercy of Jehovah. It is written: “His mercy endureth for ever” toward his servants. (2 Chron. 20: 21) “Which keepest covenant, and shewest mercy unto thy servants that walk before thee with all their hearts.’’ (2 Chron. 6:14) One who covenants to do the will of Almighty God, and who because of natural imperfections stumbles but rises up again and goes forward, and who continues in that way with a pure heart, may confidently expect to receive the mercy of the Lord. “For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him. Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children’s children; to such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.”—Ps. 103:11, 13, 14,17, 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">” Because one claims to be a servant of the Lord does not mean that he shall obtain mercy at the hands of Jehovah. The Scriptures show that God’s mercy is extended to those who faithfully serve him. “Also unto thee, 0 Lord, belongeth mercy; for thou render-est to every man according to his work.” (Ps. 62: 12) The mercy of God is not extended to the wicked, that is, to those who continue willfully in wrongdoing. God puts in the mouth of his anointed the prayer, and the faithful ones speak the words of the prayer concerning those who willingly persecute God's faithful servants: “Let there be none to extend mercy unto him; neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.”—Ps. 109:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> One who has covenanted to do the will of God and who has received a knowledge of the truth, and who then willingly does violence to God’s anointed, cannot hope for mercy at the hands of the Lord. The Scriptures make plain this matter concerning those once in line for the kingdom who do violence to God’s organization, because by so doing they treat Christ and his blood as a common thing.—Heb. 10: 26-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>81</sup> Jehovah extends his mercy to his anointed. The man David was subject to natural weaknesses as are other men, but his heart was always right and pure toward God. He was God’s anointed servant and never willingly departed from the way of righteousness. David trusted in the mercy of Jehovah, and he received mercy at the hand of Jehovah, and therefore David’s words concerning the mercy of God apply to the class whom David pictured, namely, “the feet of him [Christ Jesus, the Greater David].” “He is the tower of salvation for his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.”—2 Sam. 22: 51.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> Jehovah saved David from his enemies and granted salvation to him in mercy. There were those who forsook Saul and took their stand with David and served with him, and they also received salvation in mercy. (1 Sam. 22:1,2; 1 Chron. 12:1-22) So likewise Jehovah grants salvation in mercy to the “remnant”, who are of the antitypical David class, and to the “companions” of the remnant, who are the antitypical Jonathan class. Those who are of Jehovah’s organization, and those who put themselves under that organization and who continue faithfully to serve God, may confidently expect to receive the mercy of the Most High.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> Why did God extend mercy to David and deliver him and save him from his enemies? For the same reason that he in mercy grants protection, deliverance and salvation to the remnant and their companions; and that is for His name’s sake. Jehovah’s name is called upon the anointed remnant, and the Jonathan class become companions of the remnant in declaring Jehovah’s name. The individuals who make up these classes are not of first importance, but are only of secondary importance. God does everything for his name’s sake. It is his great name that is involved and must be vindicated. The words of Jehovah addressed primarily to Israel apply with full and complete force and effect to those now in a covenant to do the will of God and who trust in his mercy. Therefore Jehovah says concerning those of spiritual Israel and his companions, and in behalf of whom he exercises mercy: “But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went. Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God, I do not this for your sakes, 0 house of Israel, but for mine holy name’s sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went.”—Ezek. 36:21,22.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> ‘ Today God’s mercy is extended to the remnant who because of natural weaknesses commit unintentional wrongs, but it is not extended to those who resort to lies against God’s organization and who do wrong against his organization but do not repent and turn entirely away from wrongdoing and then seek the face of the Lord for forgiveness. David said: “I have trusted in thy mercy”; and so likewise those who follow in the footsteps of the Greater David, Christ Jesus, trust in the mercy of Jehovah and receive “the sure mercies of David”. (Isa. 55: 3) They receive God’s mercy because they continue in a perfect heart devotion to Jehovah and in the faithful, actual service of the great Theocrat and his King. They are faithful in declaring God’s name as they are commissioned to do. They are faithful to protect God’s organization.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHO SAVES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>25</sup> Those who practice religion rely upon their religious organization to provide for them protection and salvation. Such are doomed to complete disappointment, and their end is destruction. Those of the “evil servant” class are also religionists, who rely upon their own ability to develop character that will insure them the protection and salvation from Jehovah God. They too will be sorely disappointed. The “evil servant” class often deceive themselves to the point of advocating “universal salvation”, falsely claiming that the love of God provides salvation for the Devil himself, and this they do in the face of God’s plain declaration, “All the wicked will [God] destroy.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>26</sup> Jehovah God is the source of life. He grants salvation only to the obedient ones through Jesus Christ. “Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah.” (Ps. 3:8, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font5"> Jehovah grants salvation by and through Christ Jesus, and 'there is no other name given under heaven whereby men can be saved’.— Acts 4:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>27</sup> Those devoted to Jehovah, in the language of God’s prophet, truly say: “Behold, God is my salvation.” (Isa. 12: 2) ‘Truly in the Lord our God is salvation.’ (Jer. 3: 23) “Salvation is of the Lord.” (Jonah 2:9) If a person believes that the Bible contains God’s Word of truth, then that person must surely say that there is no means of salvation aside from Jehovah. Christ Jesus the King is the Greater David and is the anointed of Jehovah God and is the agent by whom Jehovah sends salvation and who saves his people from the disaster that Armageddon brings upon the world. To those who are devoted to Jehovah and who continue in faith and faithful to him and his kingdom he says: “Behold, thy King cometh unto thee; he is just, and having salvation.”—Zech. 9: 9.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">” Salvation is not for the wicked at any time: “Far from the lawless is salvation, for thy statutes have they not sought.” (Ps. 119:155, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham) </span><span class="font5">Salvation is only inside Jehovah’s Theocratic Government, and those who oppose the Theocracy cannot receive salvation. Those who are not wholly for the Theocracy are against Jehovah and his King. Surely those in this day of God’s enlightenment granted to his people, who trust in Jehovah and Christ Jesus, must see that the Theocratic Government is of paramount importance, because that government vindicates Jehovah’s name, and they must also see that unless one who claims to be the servant of Jehovah God now fully and entirely supports the Theocracy he cannot expect salvation from the terrors and destruction of Armageddon. Nor can such unfaithful one expect salvation to life. The vindication of Jehovah’s name shall now be accomplished, and it is his government by Christ Jesus that accomplishes this vindication. Therefore Jehovah says: “I bring near my righteousness [for vindication of my name]; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry; and I will place salvation in Zion [God’s capital organization] for Israel my glory.”—Isa. 46:13.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> Addressing his words to Zion, Jehovah says: “Thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise.” (Isa. 60:18) Let those who desire salvation and who have put their trust in the religious systems give heed to the infallible Word of Almighty God and utterly disregard the speech of men. This is the day of Jehovah, and of this time Jehovah says: “In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah [not Babylon, nor any part of the religious systems of the world or elsewhere]: We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks. Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in. Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee; because he trusteth in thee. Trust ye in the Lord for ever; for in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font5"> JEHOVAH is everlasting strength.”—Isa. 26:1-4.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> God set up the “cities of refuge”, to which the unintentional manslayer might flee for protection from the executioner’s hand (Num. 35:9-34), and which cities of refuge picture the salvation under God’s organization from destruction that shall fall upon the world at Armageddon. It is in that organization that those who will f'oim the great multitude now find shelter and protection, and which shall be to their salvation from disaster at Armageddon. The ark which Noah built at the command of Jehovah also pictured God’s organization which furnishes protection and salvation to those who place themselves under God’s organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>31</sup> Now all nations of earth are in distress and perplexity. It is clearly to be seen that the wicked demons under the command of Satan are besieging or obsessing and taking possession of the minds ol both those who rule and those who are ruled. Religion practiced by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and others has been the means for the demons to seize control of the people. Upon the faces of multitudes now is seen the expression of the demons. Only the demons could induce persons who were once quiet and considerate people to now resort to such wicked deeds as those committed by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy'and their dupes in their attempts to break up peaceable assemblies of persons who come together to worship God in spirit and in truth. Let the reasonable and sensible persons who believe the Bible is God’s Word have in mind now what the apostle of Jesus Christ said to those who practice religion, to wit: “I perceive that in all things ye are extremely devoted to the worship of demons.” (Acts 17 : 22, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dia-glott)</span><span class="font5"> Not since the days preceding the flood has there been such a manifestation of demons and demon influence as that now exercised upon the people. Concerning this very time Jesus gave full warning: “But as the days of No'e were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.” (Matt. 24:37) Multitudes of persons are yet held in subjection to the religious systems, and particularly to that wicked system ruled by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy of Authority, and are blinded by such religion and know not the right way to go. Many of these desire protection and salvation. Let all such, then, depart from the religious teachings of men and demons and look to follow and obey the Word of Jehovah God, which is man’s only true guide. (Ps. 119:105) The religious systems can furnish neither protection nor salvation to anyone from the terrors now upon the world and from the disaster that is about to come upon the world at Armageddon. To those of sincere heart who truly desire his salvation Jehovah now says: “Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom nn soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him. and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles [nations] And in his name shall the [nations] trust.”—Matt 12:18, 21.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SALVATION WHEN?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> “Salvation” means deliverance from the world disaster at the battle of Armageddon and the granting of life everlasting to the faithful obedient ones under the kingdom of Jehovah. Salvation or deliverance was foreshadowed by what came to David and to his companions. They were delivered from King Saul, who pictured the “man of sin” class, “the son of perdition”; and that deliverance to David and his companions came at the battle of Gilboa, which battle pictured Armageddon. (1 Sam. 31 : 1-10) David and his companions were saved from the traitor Ahithophel; and that wicked one, when his counsel was rejected, went and hanged himself, just as Judas Iscariot did after betraying Christ Jesus. (2 Sam. 17:1-23) They were saved and delivered from the rebel Absalom at the battle in the wood of Ephraim, in which Absalom was killed. (2 Sam. 18: 6-17) David and his companions were saved from the Philistines at the battles of Perazim and Gibeon, in which battles Jehovah fought for his anointed king and his army. The battle of Gibeon particularly pictured Jehovah’s “strange act” of vindication at the battle of Armageddon, at which time, that is, the battle of Armageddon, those who are devoted to God will receive deliverance and salvation. At the battle of Armageddon salvation and deliverance will come to the anointed remnant and to their companions, at which time all the enemies will be destroyed, down to the lowest earthly member of the Devil’s organization. That great destruction will immediately follow the time when the earthly representatives of Satan shall proclaim “peace and safety”. That battle of the great day of God Almighty will strike down all the enemy. Rapidly is that day now approaching. It appears that quite soon the religious head of the earthly organization of Satan, thinking that God’s witnesses are done for, will proclaim “peace and safety”. The witnesses of Jehovah, seemingly forsaken, may wonder how long it is until the end, and they say: “How long shall mine enemy be exalted . . . ! and [continue to] say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am [re]moved.” (Ps. 13:2-4) Jehovah, by Christ Jesus, will exercise Ins almighty power against the enemy, proving that Jehovah is supreme, and this will follow immediately after the completion of the proclamation of Jehovah’s name and kingdom in the earth (Ex. 9:16) and suddenly when the proclamation of “peace and safety” is made.—1 Thess. 5 : 3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS ACT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>33</sup> Jehovah’s act of salvation is certain at his appointed time, and all those who remain faithful and true to the great Theocrat shall be delivered. The faithful may confidently rely upon such deliverance. Therefore the faithful will not now be discouraged by the increasing woes upon the world and the persecution of themselves, but they will lift up the head with gladness because there is overwhelming evidence that the day of deliverance is near.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>34</sup> For his name’s sake Jehovah will save and deliver his faithful people. “And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor; therefore his arm brought salvation unto him [as represented by his faithful people on the earth at Armageddon] ; and his righteousness [the vindication of his name], it sustained him. For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke. According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompence.” —Isa. 59:16-18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>35</sup> Describing his act of vindication the prophet of Jehovah records: “Was the Lord displeased against the rivers! was thine anger against the rivers! was thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses &quot;[war steeds] and thy chariots of salvation! Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.” This Jehovah does for his faithful people. “Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.”—Hab. 3: 8, 12,13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">’• Of necessity the woes upon the world must increase until the final climax at Armageddon. It is clearly to be seen that the enemy is surrounding God’s people on every hand. They should therefore keep in mind the words of Jesus concerning this time: “And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption [deliverance] draweth nigh.”—Luke 21:28</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>ST</sup> The time arrives when there is a great calamity upon the earth, and no more opportunity to carry the message to the people, but, Jehovah having supplied his people abundantly with spiritual food for their strength, they can say as his prophet records: &quot;Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls: yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation.” (Ilab. 3:17,18) (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> 1935, page 202.) At that time the makers of images, who bow down to idols and who worship demons and who compel flag saluting, shall go to confusion together: “They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them; they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols.”—Isa. 45:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ The disastrous result upon the enemies the prophet of Jehovah describes in these words: “Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner [die like gnats (Young’s translation) ; like a louse </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Hebrew)]</span><span class="font5"> ; but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness [vindication of Jehovah’s name] shall not be abolished.”—Isa. 51: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">” At that great battle for the vindication of Jehovah’s holy name, to those who are devoted to the great Theocratic government it is said : “Ye shall not need to fight in this battle; set yourselves, stand ye still [after having gone through to the finish of God’s ‘strange work’], and see the salvation of the Lord with you, 0 Judah and Jerusalem; fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them; for the Lord will be with you.”—2 Chron. 20:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REJOICE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>40</sup> What this calendar year may bring forth we do not know. With God’s people time is no more. His people do know, however, that all the surrounding conditions point to the near approach of Armageddon, when the great issue of supremacy and vindication of Jehovah’s name will be settled for all time. They confidently look to Jehovah for his mercy and protection, and they know that salvation belongs alone to Jehovah and that those who trust in his mercy and continue faithfully to obey God shall receive protection, deliverance and salvation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>41</sup> For some time the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, in the lead of the religionists, have put forth their strong efforts to prevent the Jonathan class from hearing the truth. In this wicked effort they have received the aid and help of the “evil servant” class, which class continue to say with sarcasm: “Where is the great multitude!” That combined company of religionists that go to make up “the man of sin”, “the son of perdition,” continue to blaspheme the name of Almighty God by holding forth to the people that salvation may be had from the religious systems and through character development. Those enemies ridicule the faithful witnesses of the Most High who carry the message of the Theocratic Government to the people who desire salvation. The enemy derides the faithful witnesses of the Lord and heaps contempt upon them and at the same time shames the counsel that is given to the poor in spirit, the Jona-dab class, many of whom are yet held under the religious system and who cry and sigh because of the abominations there done. To the enemy Jehovah says: “Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor; because the Lord is his refuge.” (Ps. 14: 6) For some time many of God’s people have said, and say: “Oh that the salvation of Israel [spiritual Israel] were come out of Zion!” (Ps. 14:7) Let all such who have hope and who look for salvation now rejoice because the day of deliverance is at hand. By faith we now see the climax of Armageddon and, like David, continue to say: “But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.”—Ps. 13: 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>42</sup> Mark this: that the saved ones now say: “My heart shall rejoice”; and all those who now trust in the mercy of God and rejoice from the heart proclaim the truth, for “out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh”. (Matt. 12:34) Having a heart appreciation of the salvation which vindicates Jehovah’s name and proves his word true, the remnant and their companions continue to rejoice and go forward sounding with the mouth and by the use of recorded speech the praises of Jehovah and his government by Christ Jesus.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>43</sup> This time of rejoicing was pictured by the deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt. With the sea in front of them and the great army of Egypt, the Devil’s agent, behind them, the situation looked desperate for Moses and his host of Israelites. But they trusted in Jehovah, and when Jehovah’s mighty hand delivered them, Moses and those with him with great joy joined in the song: “The Lord is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation.” (Ex. 14: 30, 31; 15:1, 2) Now by faith the people of God see the day of deliverance near, and at the climax of the battle of Armageddon they will greatly rejoice and sing: “The Lord is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>44</sup> For the comfort and hope of his people Jehovah long ago caused to be recorded many prophetic pictures, some of which are here mentioned. When King Jehoshaphat and all the people with him beheld the destruction of Ammon, Moab and that religious crowd of Mount Seir-ites, the Lord made them rejoice: “Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy ; for the Lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies. And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets, unto the house of the Lord.&quot; (2 Chron. 20:27,28) So likewise Armageddon will witness the end of the enemy. Then will the faithful behold the destruction of the enemy: “For in one hour is she made desolate. Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.” (Rev. 18: 19, 20) That will be a time of great rejoicing as foretold by the Lord Jesim Chri.-t “And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God: for true and righteous are his judgments; for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.” “And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunder-ings, saying, Alleluia; for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.”—Rev. 19: 1, 2, 6.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHO REJOICE NOW</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>45</sup> There is now no joy in the world for those who are against the Theocracy. On the contrary, a great cloud of blackness hangs over the earth and the people are held in gross darkness. Religious systems bring no comfort or joy to the people. The efforts of the commercial element to turn the people to religion bring neither comfort nor joy to mankind, but, on the contrary, increase their woes. Amidst all of the darkness, strife, war and confusion and the everincreasing activities of the wicked demons the faithful people of Jehovah God trust in his mercy and rejoice and have every reason for increasing joy. Because of his faith in Jehovah David wrote: “My heart shall rejoice in thy- salvation.&quot; He wrote this as God’s prophet for the benefit of the present-day faithful people of God. David manifested his joy in the coming salvation of Jehovah. Likewise the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions now by faith see the ever-increasing evidence that deliverance and salvation are at hand, and by faith their joy increases and they continue earnestly and zealously to publish to the world that salvation will come to those and those only who trust in and who obey Jehovah and his King. Concerning the faithful anointed it is written: “In thy name shall they rejoice all the day; and in thy righteousness [vindication] shall they be exalted.” (Ps. 89:16) Mark this: that their joy is solely in “Thy salvation”, that is, the salvation that belongs only to Jehovah. As “the feet” of Christ Jesus, the royal One, the faithful remnant now ‘publish salvation’ (Isa. 52: 7), and joyfully and with full confidence in the Theocratic Government they proclaim to those who will hear: “Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” (Rom. 10:13; Joel 2: 32) As for their “companions”, the prospective “great multitude”, these rejoice and with zeal engage in proclaiming the name of Jehovah and his Theocratic Government as the means of protection, deliverance and salvation. Behold them now coming from every nation and people and tongue and ‘with a loud voice, saying, Salvation [be ascribed] to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb”. “Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.”—Rev. 7:10, 15.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">*• Regardless of what the ensuing year may bring forth, and of the burdens that may come to those who have devoted themselves to Jehovah, let all such at all times keep this before them: that salvation is by Jehovah’s Theocratic Government and that government is here and Christ Jesus has taken his power and reigns. '“Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ.”—Rev. 12:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘<sup>T</sup> Many centuries ago faithful men such as David and others of the prophets set their heart upon the Theocratic Government. Because of their faith m that government and its King, and their love for Jehovah and the Messiah, those men endured all manner of persecution and affliction and died in faith, waiting for the coming of the King. The King is now here. The Theocracy has begun to function. With confidence we look for the early return of those faithful men of old, and then they will enter into the service and joy of the Lord in fullness Those who are now on the earth and who are wholly devoted to God and his King need to wait only a very short time, but in that time they must endure hardness as good soldiers of the King. Keep in mind the admonition of Christ Jesus: ‘He that endures to the end shall be saved.’ We know that the day of deliverance is near. We fully trust in the mercy of our God and diligently strive to obey his commandments and proclaim his name and kingdom. Therefore all of God’s people may throughout the coming days have constantly in mind these words: “My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">I</span><span class="font3">N THE typical picture made with the nation of Israel, Jehovah's priests occupied a position of responsibility toward him He makes first the best provision for them God’s provision for occupancy of the land by his priests, as well as by those who are not of the priesthood, was portrayed in the vision given by Jehovah to his prophet Ezekiel concerning the division of the land and the location of its inhabitants.—Chapter 45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The “land” here is not the literal earth. Rather, it pictures the position and condition in which members of God’s organization are placed.</span></p>

I go to prepare a place for you.” (John 14:2) Allotment of the land, as described in Ezekiel’s prophecy, clearly refers to the same thing. The faithful disciples of Christ Jesus are made members of Jehovah’s “royal priesthood”.—1 Pet. 2:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ezekiel’s vision referred to the time when Jehovah’s people on earth, his faithful witnesses, would be delivered from the religious enemy organization and its power and would be restored to God's favor and brought into his Theocratic organization, receiving an allotment therein Jehovah’s government or kingdom is a Theocracy. The organization of The Theocracy, as disclosed in the Scriptures, may be stated thus: The Almighty God, “whose name alone is Jehovah,” and who is the Supreme One. is the Creator and Builder and Organizer. His only begotten and beloved Son, Christ Jesus, is Jehovah’s Executive Officer, whom Jehovah makes the King of the world. By the grace of Jehovah and by his selection there are associated with Christ Jesus in the Kingdom 144.000 who are taken from among men and begotten of God’s spirit as children of Jehovah God. These are antitypical Levites and must serve him m his spiritual temple. When anointed of his spirit for temple service, they are in line for Jehovah’s “royal priesthood”, and, proving faithful, they are made “priests of God and of Christ” and “shall reign with him a thousand years”. (See Revelation 7: 4; 14:1, 3 ; 1: 6 ; 20: 4, 6.) Christ Jesus is the Head thereof, or the High Priest of Jehovah God. Such is a brief description of the capital organization of Jehovah God, to which in Scripture the name “Zion” applies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The official or capital organization Zion is the new heaven of righteousness. It is not visible to human eyes, and the earthly remnant thereof yet on earth must be changed from human to spirit in the first resurrection. The Scriptures further disclose that The Theocracy will have visible representatives on the earth, who shall perform the duties of governors under the direction and supervision of the theocratic King. In times of old such men were “fathers” unto God’s people. They proved their faithfulness unto Jehovah God and shall have a “better resurrection” and be made the children of The Christ and also be made his representatives on the earth. These visible representatives of the theocratic King are designated “princes in all the earth”, according to Psalm 45: 16. “Princes” here means governors, rulers or stewards.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">(Diagram of the allotments in “the holy poition”, twenty-five thousand foursquare)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ezekiel 45 1 reads : “Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto [Jehovah], an holy portion of the land : the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds [cubits], and the breadth shall be ten thousand. This shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about.” This “holy portion of the land” occupied the central position in all the land of God’s restored people, thereby picturing how the lives and interests of all the people will move about Jehovah’s organization, which is Zion his royal house. It is Jehovah God who does the selecting; as stated at Deuteronomy 16: 6: “The place which [Jehovah] thy God shall choose to place his name in.” Allotment of the land is also given consideration in Ezekiel 47 (verses thirteen to twenty-two) and in chapter 48 (verses eight to twenty).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The allotment of persons and things in the holy place is described in this manner: “Of this [oblation of land] there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length, and five hundred in breadth, square round about; and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof. And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place.” (Ezek. 45:2,3) This was the area of ground on which the temple of Jehovah stood, and the ground for the temple occupied the centei of the tract of land; hence the portion of the land abo\ &lt;&nbsp;described is for the priests to occupy. “The holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary, which shall come near to minister unto [Jehovah] ; and it shall be a place for their houses, and an hoh place for the sanctuary.”—Ezek. 45: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Only the. Levites of the family of Aaron were priests, all other Levites were servants or ministers at the temple of Jehovah God. Jehovah locates the antitypical Levites at a convenient point for service. “And the [portion of land] five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand of breadth [immediately north of the portion assigned for the sanctuary and the priests], shall also the Levites, the ministers of the house, have for themselves, for a possession for twenty chambers.” (Ezek 45:5) Jehovah God has provided an everlasting abode in his organization for the Christians here pictured by the nonpriestly Levites The mam fold foresight and wisdom of Jehovah is thrilling. Even the most minute things he has provided. For instance, undei the law covenant arrangement made with the nation of Israel the Levites were located in forty-eight different cities, six of which were called cities of refuge. (Num 35 1-S'&gt; Three of those cities were on one side of the river Jordan and three on the other side of it. It was the duty of the Levites in the cities of refuge to give information, aid and comfort to those who fled thither, seeking refuge Likewise it is the duty of the antitypical Levites or Christians to givt information, aid and comfort to those who now seek Jehovah’s theocratic organization. This they must do by giving them a mark in the forehead, that is to say, giving them intelligent information as to what such must do m ordei to have Jehovah’s favor. God, through his prophet Ezekiel especially commands that those of the antitypica! Levite class must go through the land proclaiming the message oi Jehovah’s theocratic kingdom under Christ and thus put .1 mark upon the foreheads of those of good will toward God and who are seeking the way of Jehovah It is this dass ot persons who are thus marked, and who thereafter &lt;en:e nru and abide in the city, that are spared and taken through tin great tribulation.—Ezek. 9 6, Zeph 2:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the outer court of the temple seen in vision by Ezekiel (40:17) the Levites are assigned thirty chambers However, in the assignment of the territory to the Levites God specifies twenty chambers for them, and that would seem to signify that God divides the Levites up into twenty courses of service at the temple. There will be divisions or courses of service, but the Levites will all be together in one territory, and no longer scattered about in forty-eight cities as formerly. In the allotment of the land, showing the ultimate condition of their location, all the antitypical Levites, the called, chosen and faithful ones taken out by Jehovah from all nations, peoples, kindreds and tongues as a people for his name, by his grace will finally be gathered up and brought into his heavenly city or great organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Allotment of land is made for “the city”. “And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long [from east to west], over against [(7?.7.) side by side with] the oblation of the holy portion [for the temple] : it shall be for the whole house of Israel.” (Ezek 45: 6) Thus the temple was not in the city, but the temple and the city were separated from each other by about eight thousand cubits. Since the city Zion is not mentioned in this vision, it seems that “the city” here described is not Zion, the invisible kingdom, but that it pictures more the earthly representation of God’s heavenly invisible government. (Consideration is given to this city also in chapter 48:15-17, 30-35.) Both the city and the temple were in the “holy oblation” of land, the temple being in the upper or northern portion, and the city in the southern. The entire “holy oblation” of land, twenty-five thousand cubits square, is a picture of God’s universal organization called “Jerusalem”, while Zion, Jehovah’s royal family composed of Christ Jesus and his church, is pictured in the land allotted to and occupied by the temple, and which is also occupied by the priests. The city mentioned at Ezekiel 45:6 is said to be named Jehovah-shammah, “the wonder or renown of Jehovah.”—See Ezekiel 48:35, margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The earthly representatives of Jehovah’s kingdom will be the resurrected faithful prophets and witnesses before Christ, and these are designated at Psalm 45:16 as “princes in all the earth”, and their position is shown in God’s organization Ezekiel 45: 7, 8 states: “And a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy portion, and of the possession of the city, before [in front of] the oblation of the holy portion, and before [in front of] the possession of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east side eastward; and the length shall be over against one of the portions, from the west border unto the east border. In the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people, and the rest of the land shall they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes.” The word “prince” in this text manifestly applies to an entire company and refers to the resurrected, faithful prophets who were faithful witnesses before the day of Christ, and who, as a company, Christ will make rulers in all the earth. Christ is King of these earthly representatives, and Jehovah God is the great King over all. The fact that there shall be no more oppression, as these verses say, shows the kind of men Jehovah will install in office as officials ruling the earth. They \\ ill be righteous and their rule will be righteous. Instruction is given concerning these earthly rulers “Thus saith the Lord God, Let it suffice you, 0 princes of Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and justice, take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord God.” (Ezek. 45:9) This prophecy indicates what the &quot;princes in all the earth” will do. Righteousness will be maintained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The commerce of Satan’s organization is wicked and oppressive. In God’s kingdom everything must be done in righteousness. “Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath. The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of ■in homer, and the ephah the tenth part of an homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer. And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels shall be your maneh.” (Ezek. 45-10-12) There will be no juggling with the medium of exchange, nor changes of measures. Big Business, with its military organization for its protection and for the oppression of the people, will never again exist. The righteous representatives of the kingdom on earth will instruct the people in righteousness and will require all to deal righteously. The measures and weights will be in harmony with the divine rule which Jesus declared: “Good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over.”— Luke 6:38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah’s righteous government will not tolerate insubordination on .the part of anyone, but all must obey the Theocracy. Ezekiel 45:13-15 says: “This is the oblation that ye [earthly rulers] shall offer [the Lord], the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of barley. Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, ye shall offer the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is an homer of ten baths; for ten baths are an homer: and one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel, for a meat [meal] offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord God.” These verses describe the amount that shall be brought in for various offerings, all of which offerings are “to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord”, that is, reconciliation for the people. All the people will be required to recognize God’s kingdom and accept these resurrected faithful prophets or servants of God as the representatives of the kingdom on earth, and that the earthly princes are their representatives to treat with the heavenly royal priesthood and in behalf of the people who seek reconciliation with God. The prophecy also shows that the people will be required to contribute something toward such reconciliation, and that such contributions will be their full obedience and co-operation. The people will receive their instructions from the visible princes, and these instructions they will be required to obey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ezekiel hears further instructions concerning these rulers: “And it shall be the prince’s part to give burnt offerings, and meat [meal] offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities [in all the appointed feasts (7? V.)] of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat [meal] offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliation [ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(R.V</span><span class="font3"> ) atonement] for the house of Israel.” (Ezek. 45: 17) The fact that Jehovah gives such specific instructions regarding the duties of the princes indicates that he, by and through Christ Jesus, gives special recognition to these faithful men who of old maintained their integrity, and who died faithful to God, and that he will resurrect them as perfect men and make them representatives of the kingdom on earth. These men will be the visible representatives on earth of Zion, which is God’s organization. (Isa. 32: 1) The peoples of earth will be required to act through these earthly representatives of God’s organization. A grand inheritance for these princes'</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The vision of Ezekiel does not at all mean that an earthly temple will be built at or near present-day Jerusalem for the use of the people. There will be no reason for the erection of such a building. What this vision really means is that it is a prophecy which will be fulfilled in Jehovah’s due time It is a vision of God’s organization in operation, showme the assigned positions of those who have to do with the organization. That God’s temple is clean is shown by Ezekiel 45:18: “Thus saith the Lord God, In the first month, in the first day of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock, without blemish, and cleanse the sanctuary.” It was on the tenth day of the month when Ezekiel was given the vision; therefore the vision in substance says that this invisible temple will yet be constructed by Jehovah to begin operations at God’s own appointed time after being brought together. The faithful disciples of Christ Jesus are made clean through the merit of Christ Jesus’ shed blood and are made living stones for Jehovah’s temple. (1 Pet 2:5) All who are brought into the temple and made a part of it must be of this cleansed condition.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">GREATER THE BATTLE, GREATER THE VICTORY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Gathered in assembly here in New Orleans, Louisiana, 225 of your brethren, at the time of our zone assembly, wish to take this opportunity to send to you our deep gratitude and warm Christian love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We are grateful to our heavenly Father for the marvelous and rich supply of spiritual food he has provided for us through the columns of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> at a time when darkness covers the earth and gross darkness the people, when there is a famine in the land, not for bread and water, but for the hearing of the Word of the Lord, and when the Devil’s totalitarian crowd are desperately seeking the destruction of all who support the Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We appreciate that the greater the battle, the greater the victory, and this we see in this priest-ridden section in our zone. Six months ago we had in Louisiana Zone One 142 regular publishers, 100 irregulars, 302 associated, and a peak of publishers for one month of 187. Now there are 197 regular publishers, 190 irregulars, 500 associated, and a peak of 260 publishers. The increase is largely made up of those sincere persons of good will who have come out of the Catholic system</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your fearless stand before Satan’s wicked crowd is an incentive to your fellow warriors to faithfully perform the task set before them</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We wish to inform you that we are wholly and unreservedly for the Theocracy and will remain loyal regardless of all opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">May Jehovah, our heavenly Father, continue to richly bless you and keep you, is our daily prayer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH’S LOVING-KINDNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I take this chance to show my gratitude and appreciation of Jehovah’s loving-kindness which he has extended to me. Owing to my first association with one who was once enlightened of the knowledge of God but who has shamelessly and openly joined the pollutions of this world and become a willing tool of Satan, the house-to-house witnessing was entirely foreign to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But now, seeing the forces of Satan in entire shape, and that the Lord has graciously extricated me from such a tool of the Devil, and a demon m human form, who strictly launched his activities in vilifying and disdaining the Lord and his people and the method and means Jehovah is using in performance of his strange work, now I thank Jehovah for enjoying the grandest privilege of the field service with his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The article “Drama of Vindication”, disclosing the fulfillments of Joshua’s prophecy, which the Lord recently caused to be discussed in seven consecutive issues of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> is really a permanent blessing from the Lord and has enabled the Lord’s people to more fully locate and identify the forces of Satan and the Achan class. The book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font3"> is also a bountiful gift of Jehovah “This is the Lord’s doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">And I wish to assure you, dear brother, that I am now wholly and wholeheartedly united with you, the Society, the Lord’s representative on earth, and all others of like precious faith in every land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With fervent and warmest greetings, I am Your brother in His service,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">We believe that Brother Howlett’s visit was timely, fully under the direction of the Lord. There has been so much confusion created by those letters that O. R Moyle sent to the different brethren throughout this particular area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Enclosed you will find the Waukegan [Ill.] company’s Pledge of Loyalty to the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, also to you as the Society’s president.

<p><span class="font3">We, the undersigned, wish to express our appreciation and thanks to Jehovah’s Theocratic arrangement on earth, the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">At the end of December last the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses were reported to the pnest-in-charge of the Bonda mission of the Church of England in Inyanga district, in Southern Rhodesia. The priest was so desirous to know what message Jehovah’s witnesses are delivering to the people m his district He sent for them to visit him at the mission station on Sunday morning in order to find out for himself what was going on The company servant Brother Johnson Chishaya, Noah Porno, and several others accepted the invitation</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On Sunday morning these brethren went to the mission station, taking a phonograph with “Religion and Christianity”, “Enemies,” and several other records and some books and booklets in English. The priest received them gladly; they were taken into a private chapel; ministers and sisters were sent m to greet their visitors. These brethren were astonished to see European ministers and sisters shake hands with them, as this is seldom seen in Southern Rhodesia. Food was prepared for them and they were made to feel at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The pnest called in aU leading men and women, black and white, to come and listen to what their friends would have to say On addressing this special gathering he said: “Brethren, we have heard little about your preaching, but we would like to know fully what is your teaching and what is wrong with our teaching of the Bible.” Brother Johnson Chishaya gladly responded and said: “Do you know that there is a difference between religion and Christianity-f” Priest: “No. We know they are the same.” Chishaya: “Would you like to hear Judge Rutherford’s lecture dealing with this matter on the gramophone f” “Play it, please,” replied the priest After the records were played Chishaya presented the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font3"> and the booklets </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Safety</span><span class="font3"> and a few others to the priest. He received them gladly and Chishaya asked to continue to play more records. After hearing the records Brother Chishaya continued and showed to them how religionists rob the people in the name of God, and read from some chapters in the Bible: Isaiah 55:1,2; Micah 3:11; John 10:11-13. The priest and his minister were exceedingly pleased both by what they heard on the records and by what Chishaya explained to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A public meeting was arranged in the church, and all the members were asked to attend this meeting. In this meeting the minister spoke strongly against what they had been teaching to the people and the method they had employed in collecting the money from natives in the church. The minister said' “No preacher or minister will be paid monthly as we used to do; and no plate will be used to collect money from the public in the church; we shall have to work ourselves to get money; there are many means of making a living. Those who want much money would have to go to towns and work there. We cannot deny the truth; we will try to do as Watchtower books say.” When this statement was made by the pnest in charge many natives, preachers, ministers, etc., resigned from their work or position in their church. Thirty-four people left the mission work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In a few days’ time there was a great change at Bonda mission Watchtower books were studied publicly in the church as we.l as in the public meetings by the European ministers. They wanted Brother Johnson Chishaya and others to help them to teach the people the truth. Immediately this was reported to the bishop of this church at Salisbury, the capital town of Southern Rhodesia The bishop was very angry and proceeded to Bonda mission immediately. When he arrived there he was very wild against the European priest and ministers who allowed and accepted Watchtower literature in the mission He found that things had been changed; and this annoyed him very much He called a big public meeting in the church, and there he called the European minister who allowed the'Watchtower teachings at this place to come to the front of the crowd of natives (the church members). He rebuked and insulted him shamefully. The unfortunate minister bravely said: “We believed what Jehovah’s witnesses said because we proved things ourselves when we read their books and heard some lectures on the gramophone. I would like the bishop to examine the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.’’</span><span class="font3"> On hearing this the bishop grew more angry and threatened to assault this minister who asked him to read the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The bishop started from the bottom again to reorganize the work, but many people have lost confidence in them. But this minister refused to follow their teachings again, and immediately left the place, having nothing more to do with that church. The bishop instructed all his members to assault or kill anyone who came to the mission station as Jehovah’s witnesses or if any of them visited their houses; telling them that if they killed any of them he (the bishop) would defend them in the court or would take the blame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When I visited Inyanga company I went out with brethren everywhere in that district, as we had some friends living near that mission station. I went there to help them to go forward in their work against the enemy. We experienced no opposition a' all, and up to this time no trouble has been given from anyone in that district. God’s Kingdom work is increasing in every corner of Southern Rhodesia, with a very little opposition here and there The boldness of the Kingdom publishers in this colony is bringing the crowds of enemies to shame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By the Lord’s grace brethren have determined to stand firm on Jehovah’s side to the very end.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">“I called back on a man last Tuesday evening and ran ‘Government and Peace’. He was so thrilled he was beside himself with joy and couldn’t thank me enough. He fed me on buttered scones and tea and sent me home laden with home-grown tomatoes and gorgeous bronze and golden chrysanthemums. I called the next morning to pick up my phonograph and the man said he would remember that message to his dying day and couldn’t go to sleep till three o’clock in the morning for going over the message. It was the grandest speech he had ever heard: ‘Good old man, it’s the truth, but God’s putting the words on thee mouth’; ‘My word the parsons and priests would murder him if they could’; 'My word, lass, I am glad you’ve come and opened my eyes before it’s too late, but it’s God who’s directed you here and I’m right glad ; you’ve made me happy.’ Last night he heard ‘Victory’ and nearly went mad with joy and gratitude to Jehovah for sending me to him. I had to go home again weighed down with flowers, vases and tomatoes, and tonight he has been to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font3"> study and is coming to the Kingdom hall Sunday. He has been a Sunday-school teacher for over twenty years, but now has finished with religion for ever. Saturday morning I worked territory witnessed only on a fortnight ago and placed 3 books and 40 booklets, and appointments to play ‘Government and Peace’ at three homes. This is proof that people are thinking and taking an interest in the truth. Saturday afternoon I was working in some poor property and could quite distinctly hear a heated discussion on religion and Jehovah’s witnesses. A man was telling the household that religion was a snare and a racket and Judge Rutherford was the only man on earth telling the truth to the world. Imagine their surprise when I knocked on the door, presenting the message, and the man giving out the truth said: ‘Come in, you’re just the person we want here. Now tell ’em what we stand for and tell ’em where religion’s a racket.’ I recognized him to be one with whom I placed booklets. He has never attended a meeting and yet was standing up for the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PHONOGRAPH IN NEW YORK CITY BUSINESS TERRITORY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“In the nation’s greatest city a pioneer (a deaf-mute) now uses the doorstep method of setting up his phonograph with excellent results. Recently during three hours of actual door-to-door witnessing in the business section he had 12 setups, an attendance of 30, placing 24 booklets and 2 books. ‘Jehovah certainly is blessing the doorstep setups,’ he writes. ‘I mostly work business and put it up on everything; have from 12 to 18 setups daily.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RE A 23-YEAR-OLD CANADIAN-BORN CHINESE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Recently I made a back-call on Mr. Suey. He was glad to see us. ‘Oh,’ he said, ‘I have saved up some money. Have you a phonograph for me!’ I replied: ‘Sure, you can have mine at a reduction. I have used it six months, also the records.’ Mr. Suey said: ‘You know I am studying to go out in the Lord’s work, as soon as my father comes here [Alberta] on this farm. Next fall I can go. I have some money left. Can I get </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation? </span><span class="font3">Mr Suey added: ‘I have been lending my books out and need some more. Give me two </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font3"> one </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah,</span><span class="font3"> four booklets, and I am glad you come. Now I can visit my neighbors and the records will explain.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">OCTOGENARIANS NOT ON THE RETIRED LIST</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Maryland: “On invitation of our daughter, Mother and I came up here for the summer. After consultation with the local servant, I went to work witnessing. Results: Day-(mostly September and October), 57; hours, 156; books 112; booklets, 464. September 10, while here, celebrated my 80th birthday anniversary. Have six married sons anc daughters, 16 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren Had four or five successful information marches, followed by transcription lectures at the Moose Hall.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cleveland, Ohio: “Pardon me for intruding on youi precious time, but I just can’t help letting you know hov much I appreciate the phonograph which came to me on the morning after the 8th, which was my 80th birthday. It was indeed a birthday gift from Jehovah, to be used in proclaiming his name. May grace and strength be given me to do with my might what my hands find to do.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pennsylvania (Zone4) : “A publisher 81 years of age consistently leads the entire company in hours in the field He always exceeds his monthly quota of 60 hours, and has mon than once put in nearly 100 hours in the field. Recently, while engaging in an information march with others a vicious and incompetent police chief forcefully removed the signs from this elderly marcher’s person, but, strong in the Lord, this marcher immediately returned to the soundcar where extra placards were kept, put on another set, and went whistling down the street. Incidentally, the high handed police chief is now under arrest charged with mah cious abuse of process, while the faithful elderly pubhshci continues to push the battle to the gate.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WELSH RELIGIONIST TURNS TO CHRISTIANITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;About two months ago (Port Talbot) I called on a Catholic woman. She was so nasty she began shouting and causing an uproar and told me to ‘go to hell’; but I left her with a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts</span><span class="font3"> booklet. I called last week again on her. She asked me if I was the woman who was there last time, and I said, Yes. She then told me how sorry she was and did I have more books to give her more light So I left her with </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Riches,</span><span class="font3"> and now I have to call back with the phonograph records.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">IN MORMON TERRITORY, ’WAY OUT IN UTAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I’m now working in territory which was covered thie&lt; weeks ago, and in sixteen hours, during three days, placed 22 bound books and 36 booklets, with 48 sound attendance Having started at last to really use the doorstep setup, 1 find it much more effective to invite them to listen rather than to ask if I may play or if they wish to listen, as I used to do. Even though we may feel a little embarrassed at first, it always proves the best course to follow every single detail of the instructions we receive from the Governor oi The Theocracy. Many things have happened in the course of these few months that I have been a pioneer which prove beyond a doubt that I have chosen the right course and that Jehovah has protected me. These Mormons—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">they</span><span class="font3"> want to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">convert me!</span><span class="font3"> One said today (measuring about two inches with her finger and thumb) : ‘Well, you have a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">little</span><span class="font3"> of the truth.’ The varnish is sure hard to peel off from these Mormons ! I think I need a chisel.”</span></p>

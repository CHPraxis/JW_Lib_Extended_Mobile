<p><span class="font3">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are Ins witnesses whose duty and privilege It is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God's kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE RELIEF and I Icssings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them; he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.'’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">TEHOVAH instructs the obedient ones that they | might receive comfort and be strong in hope. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font6"> He assures those who serve him that when his time arrives to vindicate his name he will remember for good all who have maintained their integrity toward him and that he will not pass over unnoticed any of the wicked. Those now on earth who are fully devoted to Jehovah are hated of all nations for his name’s sake, reproached and oppressed. God’s time to administer due recompense to the wicked is very near, and Jehovah will see to it that none of them escape. The Margolis Bible renders the text in the foregoing Psalm in this manner: “For He that aveng-eth blood hath remembered them [those who wrongfully shed blood] ; He hath not forgotten the cry of the humble [the ones who are obedient and who declare his name].”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> Jehovah makes inquisition, that is, he inquires into the facts or calls to mind the facts, that he may properly recompense those who have done wickedly and that he may put his blessing upon those who have obeyed him. The day of his vengeance is near, and God will not overlook any of his enemies: “The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in their goings; they have made them crooked paths; whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace.”—Isa. 59:8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> In the preceding issue of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> consideration is given to the prophecy of Zephaniah 2:1-7 and discloses God’s purpose to completely clear out the religious racketeers. In this present issue of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> consideration is given particularly to the commercial and political element of Satan’s visible organization. The Philistines were on the west of the tribe of Judah. On the east were the Moabites and the Ammonites. Moab pictured the commercial wing of Satan’s visible organization. Ammon pictured the political wing of that wicked organization. Both the commercial and political parts of the organization of Satan are supported by the military and strong-arm squad. All of these have joined with the religionists for the purpose of doing violence to</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">9:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah’s servants. Their action shall not be passed over unnoticed by Jehovah, but he will recompense them shortly. Upon those adversaries disgrace and destruction shall come as upon the ancient Sodomites and the people of Gomorrah. That punishment will be a just recompense for their sell-glory and pride and arrogance in wrongfully claiming what belongs to Jehovah alone. God’s faithful servants shall finally triumph. They that worship God shall fill the whole earth. Worshipers of demons and men will cease for ever. That instruction now comforts the people of God and makes their hope strong that they may move forward in the work that God has assigned to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">* At Armageddon there shall be no hiding places for those in far-off lands nor for the empire builders who have opposed God and persecuted his faithful witnesses. Such enemies were foreshadowed by Ethiopia and Assyria, and particularly the city of Nineveh. Individuals held amongst those who oppose The Theocratic Government, and who were pictured by Ebed-melech and by the repentant Ninc-vites, may escape. The organization of Satan, made up of political dictators and commercial traffickers who have allied themselves with religionists, shall be basely degraded and forever despised by those who survive Armageddon and who continue to praise Jehovah. The Lord remembers his faithful servants and avenges them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ Proceeding now with the examination of the prophecy by Zephaniah: It is noted that Jehovah mentions the reproaches that his enemies have put upon him and his faithful servants. “I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border.”—Zeph. 2: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘ Moab of ancient times reproached Jehovah and his typical people, the Israelites. The modern-day Moabites, the commercial traffickers in the wealth of the earth, and in human blood, have heaped great reproach upon the name of Jehovah, and those reproaches have fallen upon the ones who love and faithfully serve the Most High and his King. (Ps. 69:9; Rom. 15:3) To his faithful servants the assurance is given: “Thy Father, which seeth in secret, himself shall reward thee openly” (Matt. 6:4); and to his adversaries he says: “Understand, ye brutish among the people; and, ye fools, when will ye be wise! He that planted the ear, shall he not hear! he that formed the eye, shall he not see?” (Ps. 94: 8, 9) At Armageddon Jehovah will make good these promises, fully carrying them out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ The antitypical or modern-day Moabites, that is to say, the commercial element of Satan’s visible organization, as the facts fully disclose, have yielded to the laws of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. That wicked religious organization has repeatedly declared that Jehovah’s servants are carrying on a money-making scheme and indulging in a campaign of hate and intolerance. They further lied saying that Jehovah’s witnesses are Communists. The commercial element, in their propaganda sheets, the daily press and magazines, continue to publish such lies against Jehovah’s witnesses, while at the same time those publications refuse to publish any true statement of the facts even for pay. Thus it is seen that the commercial element, through their propaganda sheets and at the instance of religionists, willfully and deliberately and with malice aforethought, resist God and persecute his servants. They continue such bitter opposition to all publications concerning The Theocratic Government. They have put forth their endeavors to prevent the radio from being used to broadcast the message of The Theocratic Government. They prevent Jehovah’s witnesses from obtaining the use of public halls for their assemblies. The commercial press stoops to the basest lies against Jehovah’s servants and does so always at the instance of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their other religious allies.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> The ready and willing servant of the commercial giants, who traffic in human blood and property, is the strong-arm squad and the military group. They continually heap reproach upon the name of Jehovah God and his servants. These servants of God they denounce as pacifists and charge that they are unpatriotic and dangerous to the security of the state. They willingly and wickedly circulate reports that the publications of Jehovah’s witnesses are subversive and should be suppressed for that reason. This commercial and military group, acting at the instance and on advice of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, attempt to force upon the servants of God compulsory saluting of flags contrary to the commandment of Almighty God. They attempt to force Jehovah’s faithful servants into the military service and to engage in killing contrary to God’s Word. All of these things God will not forget at Armageddon.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">He will permit none of that commercial element of Satan’s organization to find the way of escape. They will not be hid. This, of course, does not apply to legitimate and honest dealers in goods, wares and merchandise of necessity, but the application is to that class of commercial men who prey upon the people and use their power wickedly against mankind, and particularly against the servants of Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ammonites</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> Jehovah takes full notice of the reviling of his people by the Ammonites of modern days, that is to say, the political element, which element works with the religionists for political gain. The totalitarians are now determined to rule the world or to bring about the destruction of the nations. They get their inspiration, of course, from the Devil by and through the religious element, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. None of these like the message of God, because it discloses that The Theocracy shall rule the whole world in righteousness and that the totalitarian rule shall soon for ever cease. Those modern-day Ammonites, or politicians, join forces with the Hierarchy to destroy Jehovah’s servants and to prevent the spreading of the gospel of God’s kingdom. To accomplish their wicked purpose they enact laws giving men dictatorial or arbitrary powers to enable the chief political ruler to declare an emergency when he desires and to thus justify his actions in taking away all privileges of those who love and serve the Almighty God. Thus have many of Jehovah’s witnesses been imprisoned and killed in the dictatorial countries, not for wrongdoing, but because they persist in declaring the good news of The Theocratic Government. Those enemies of God and his servants will find no hiding place at Armageddon. They will not be hid.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup> Jehovah says of the modern-day Moabites and Ammonites: “They have reproached my people, and magnified themselves.” The commercial and political element therefore serve the Devil's purpose by acting in conjunction with the ultrareligionists, and all of them are against God. That wicked element purpose to make it very difficult for the people of good will toward God to hear God’s message, which message from Jehovah shows man the only way to safety. Envious of those who speak the truth and who therefore tell of The Theocracy and the relief it will bring to humankind, those agents of Satan persecute all who openly serve God and Christ his King.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>11</sup> The political and commercial elements, supported by the military and strong-arm squad, insist that those who have devoted themselves to Jehovah must now put the state above Almighty God and therefore render unto Caesar all allegiance and support. In this they bring great reproach upon the name of Jehovah and upon those who serve him. Hoping to fully control the rising generation the political, commercial and military elements, acting at the behest of the big religious group, attempt to compel the small children to salute flags, “heil” men, and engage in other ceremonies in violation of God’s law. Bent upon arbitrary rule or ruin, they go beyond all proper limits and insist that the law of the state is supreme and that the state must be obeyed under any and all circumstances. They magnify men and rulers, and thus magnify and exalt themselves against God, blaspheming and reproaching his name. They shall find no way to escape the wrath of Almighty God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>12</sup> Jehovah God is the fountain of life. (Ps. 36:9) No creature can live without God’s permission. The entire universe hangs on the life of Jehovah, the Almighty. Strange as it may seem, now the existence of God is at issue. “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.” (Ps. 14:1) These modern-day Moabites and Ammonites by their course of action deny the existence of Almighty God. Therefore in their heart (seat of motive) they say there is no God. Many of them openly deny the existence of Almighty God and speak of him as “the tribal God of Israel”, “only a God of antiquity.” There are none of the political rulers of the nations of this day that tell the people of the Almighty God as the Ruler of the universe and that all blessings must come from him. ‘All nations have forgotten God.’ (Ps. 9:17) All take a course of action exactly contrary to what God has pointed out in his Word that man should take. The nations have yielded to the influence and power of the demons, whether they know it or not. Almost all of them advocate some kind of demonism or religion. Note, then, what Jehovah’s prophet says of and concerning them: “Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, even the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation ; the residue of my people shall spoil them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them.”—Zeph. 2: 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>13</sup> In this declaration Jehovah by his own life swears that he will bring all such opponents to an everlasting end. His eternal existence obligates the Almighty God to openly demonstrate to all creation that he is supreme. At Armageddon he will so demonstrate to all, that he is the living God, the selfexisting One, without beginning and without end; that he is the King of Eternity, who inhabits eternity, and that there is none before him. (Jer. 10:10; Dan. 6: 26; Deut. 5: 26; Isa. 57:15) He first made a covenant with the nation of Israel after the flesh; therefore he was the “God of Israel [after the flesh]”. That nation broke the covenant with Jehovah and turned away from him and denied and continue to deny him, and particularly to reject Christ Jesus, the beloved Son of God. That nation still holds to religion, or demonism, although professing to serve God. Jehovah is the God of spiritual Israel, that is, those who are of the spirit, fully devoted to him; meaning, those who have taken his name and joyfully obey his commandment and worship him in spirit and in truth through Christ Jesus, the King of The Theocracy.—Rev. 12:17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">“Jehovah therefore says to those who deny his existence: “Surely Moab [the antitypical Moabites, the commercial traffickers] shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon [the political ruling element] as Gomorrah.” Thus is the judgment written against them, and that judgment will be executed at Armageddon. Destruction shall come upon them by the superhuman power. The visible result upon them will be like that which came upon Sodom and Gomorrah, and this is also mentioned at Jude seven. As Lot fled from the ancient cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and was saved from the destruction that came upon those cities, so the persons of good will who shall now flee to the place of safety may be saved. Many of these persons of good will are now under the dominating control of the political and commercial elements; but by taking their stand firmly on the side of the Lord they may escape to the place of safety. (2 Pet. 2:6-8; Gen. 19:14-29) Sodom and Gomorrah were reduced to complete desolation, from which there is no possibility of recovery; and so likewise the modern Moabites and Ammonites shall be destroyed, and the place where they have inhabited shall be “even the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation”. The totalitarian rule and rulers, the commercial robbers and those who have defied God, shall perish for ever at Armageddon, as the prophecy declares.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>15</sup> Now mark how God turns the tables upon the wicked and permits those who serve him to have His blessing: “The residue of my people shall spoil them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them.” (Vs. 9) Those who serve God and his King are not looking for material gain or spoil now held by the godless, political and commercial elements of the earth. The spoiling here mentioned is spiritual; showing that only those who love and serve Jehovah God shall have the blessings of Jehovah in abundance. The faithful who shall be changed from human to spirit creatures shall receive forever the blessings of Jehovah by and through Christ Jesus, and the faithful on earth shall enjoy forever the material things which God has made for man, and all of which blessings proceed from the throne of the Almighty One. This spiritual spoiling snatches the people of good will out from the power and control of the modern-day Moabites and Ammonites. The result is that the people of good will toward God shall find a way to escape to safety and, being faithful, shall receive life everlasting and enjoy the blessings of The Theocratic Government.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>16</sup> Jehovah has made known that the faithful followers of Christ Jesus shall be ‘forever with the Lord' and that these constitute his “holy nation”. (1 Thess. 4:17; 1 Pet. 2:9) Such are the “remnant of her seed”, that is, the seed of God's organization (Rev. 12:17); meaning the last of the faithful spirit class on the earth. These constitute a part of his “holy nation”, and concerning them it is written: “And the remnant of My nation shall inherit them.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Margolis)</span><span class="font6"> The modern-day Moabites and Ammonites being wiped out at Armageddon, those surviving ones of His “holy nation”, of which Christ Jesus is the King of kings, will come into possession of that unobstructed freedom, liberty of action, and use of the earth which God provides and into its fullness, and which the enemies of God have selfishly used and abused and denied to the servants of the Most High. With Christ Jesus these shall have to do with aiding those of the “great multitude” to carry out their assigned duties. Thus it is seen that those of good will shall be brought into the fold of the Lord and ultimately they shall be all of one fold and all shall be under one shepherd or king. (John 10:16) This is further and supporting evidence that some of “the remnant” will remain on earth for a time after Armageddon and co-operate with those who will form the “great multitude”.—Rev. 7: 9-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>17</sup> Moab and Ammon of the modern day, that is, the commercial traffickers and political rulers, supported by the military and strong-arm squad, will receive full retributive justice administered by the Lord. (Zeph. 2:10) The totalitarian rulers and the commercial tyrants, that rule and oppress the people now, are very proud and haughty. Many of them claim to be servants of the people, but they are in fact cruel oppressors of the people. They rely upon the religious racketeers to keep them in a way that they believe is safe for themselves. Mark what the Almighty God says concerning such modern-day Moabites and their allies: “We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud,) his loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart. I know his wrath, saith the Lord; but it shall not be so; his lies shall not so effect it.” (Jer. 48:29,30) Jehovah’s rules are fixed and do not change: “Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fail.”—Prov. 16:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> The poor in spirit who obey God are constantly ill-treated and oppressed by those proud and haughty political and commercial great men, and concerning them God says: “Thou hast seen it; for thou behold-est mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand; the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.” (Ps. 10:14) None of these proud and haughty ones of the present day have Almighty God in their thoughts. All of them are against The Theocratic Government. These proud and haughty ones will be brought to a despicable end. That end of such proud, haughty and oppressive ones will be further proof of the supremacy of Jehovah God: “For in this mountain shall the hand of the Lord rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill. And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim; and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands. And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust.”—Isa. 25:10-12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>19</sup> Why will the Almighty God inflict upon the modern-day Moabites and Ammonites such dire punishment? “Because they have taunted and spoken boastfully against the people of the Lord of hosts.” (Margolis Bible) “Because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the Lord of hosts.” (Zeph. 2:10) No one will be permitted to taunt and treat with contempt the servants of Jehovah and be permitted by him to go unpunished. The accounts will be fully squared in his due time. Affronts to God’s name will not be overlooked. The persecution of his people and faithful servants will not be overlooked. “For he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.” (Zech. 2:8) “And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? 1 tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?”—Luke 18:7,8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>20</sup> The proud, haughty, self-centered ones persuade themselves that their contemptuous treatment of Jehovah’s witnesses is being noted only by men, but they have overlooked the fact that they are ill-treating the servants of the Lord and that the Lord counts it as unto himself. ’Forasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of my brethren, ye have done it unto me.’ (Matt. 25:40) “Whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased.” (Matt. 23:12) The wicked deeds of the haughty, austere ones who now control the nations will not be overlooked by Jehovah’s Executioner at Armageddon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>21</sup> The proud, austere and haughty religionists of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy have encouraged the modern Moabites and Ammonites to ill-treat Jehovah’s servants. This they have done because the religionists craved the aid of the political and commercial elements and have desired to share in their ill-got gains. They have not heeded the admonition given to those who make a covenant with or who profess to serve Almighty God: “Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.”— 1 Tim. 6: 17-19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>22</sup> To the Israelites God caused Moses to declare that they should worship him only. These words Jesus repeated to Satan: “Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.” (Matt. 4:10) This commandment applies to all who would receive God’s favor. Contrary to God’s commandment, men have given themselves over to the worship of demon-gods. Thus they have rejected Jehovah and his King and kingdom. The political and commercial elements deny Almighty God and now oppose The Theocracy, and to such Jehovah says: “The Lord will be terrible unto them [Fearful is Jehovah against them </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Young)];</span><span class="font6"> for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one from his place, even all the isles of the heathen.” —Zeph. 2: 11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>23</sup> At the “battle of that great day of God Almighty” he will be terrible unto those who have given their worship to men and to demons. Those who survive Armageddon will not forget what God has done unto the modern Moabites and Ammonites: “And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts; and I will declare thy greatness.” (Ps. 145: 6) With great awe and wonder the prophet of Jehovah, having a vision of what was coming upon the world at Arma-aeddon, exclaimed: “O Lord, I have heard thy speech ltire report of thee], and was afraid.” (Hab. 3:2) Jehovah’s battle against the enemy will be so terrible that it will cause all the survivors beholding it to be afraid and tremble.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>24</sup> Those who receive God’s favor cannot divide their service or devotion by giving to others some part thereof. He is the Almighty, the Most High, the Giver of life, and those creatures who oppose him and exalt themselves as gods shall perish. Therefore Jehovah says: “For the Lord your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward.” (Deut. 10: 17) “For the Lord most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth. He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet.” (Ps. 47: 2, 3) “He shall cut off the spirit of princes; he is terrible to the kings of the earth.”—Ps. 76 : 12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>25</sup> The word “gods” in the original language of the text literally means “mighty ones”. Therefore, “all the gods of the earth” refers to the demons, and also to mighty ones amongst men, that is, the political, commercial, and religious lofty and mighty ones amongst men. Such are the political, commercial, and religious lofty and mighty ones whom the people highly honor and worship. And what shall be the end of such high, exalted and mighty ones, both of the demons and amongst men? “He [God] will famish all the gods of the earth.” Among the demon mighty ones or gods are these: Chemosh, the abomination of Moab; Molech or Milcom, god of the Ammonites, and the abomination of Ammon; 2\shtoreth, goddess of the Zidonians; Baal, the god of the Tyrians. (1 Ki. 11:5,7; 16:31) These are all demons, of which Satan is the prince or the chief. There are mighty men who are also called “gods” because of the power that they have to exercise against others. These rule in politics and in commerce and in religion, all of which are a part of Satan’s organization, and some of whom are deified by the admirers of the deluded people. Amongst such human mighty ones called “gods&quot;, and representatives of the demons, are these, to wit: Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, and Pacelli, and others. —John 10:34, 35; Ps. 82:1,6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>20</sup> To “famish all the gods” would mean their destruction. This would mean that commercial traffic would become very lean for the clergy of “Christendom”, and it is now becoming lean because the people of good will are turning away from those religion mongers. The waters of truth are overflowing and sweeping away the refuge of their lies. (Isa. 28: 17) Religion is now at a great discount, due to Jehovah’s “strange work” and the exposing of religion as being of the Devil and all religionists as being the servants of that wicked one. Religious frauds are shriveling up. The mighty men amongst the clergymen, becoming weak and lean, will famish when God causes the commercial and political mighty ones to close down on the religious racket, even as the people of Moab and Ammon closed down on the people of Mount Seir and destroyed them. (2 Chron. 20: 23) Then will follow the destruction at Armageddon of the mighty ones of the commercial, political and military forces.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>27</sup> Jehovah then by his prophet shows what accompanies the famishing process, and the results: “And men [those of good will] shall worship him [Jehovah], every one from his place.” Such are they of good will who forsake religion and engage in the true worship of Almighty God. (Luke 2:14) This the people of good will do regardless of where such persons may be. They will come from all nations: 'all nations, kindreds, peoples and tongues.’ (Rev. 7:9) All such Jehovah will bring into the temple courts and put them in touch with the “remnant” of the temple company yet on the earth, and therefore such persons will form the “great multitude” and serve Jehovah at his temple.—Rev. 7:14,15.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> Such true worshipers and true worship will not be confined to only one nation or a few nations, but “even all the isles of the heathen [nations]”. There shall be some from all these nations. The testimony to the name of the great Theocrat and his government under Christ Jesus his King is now being carried to the various nations, and the “great multitude” is being manifested: “For I know their works and their thoughts; it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory. And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those [the remnant] that escape of them [from Babylon, Satan’s organization] unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.” —Isa. 66:18,19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>29</sup> These faithful ones who survive will sing the praises of Jehovah: “Sing unto the Lord a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.” (Isa. 42:10) “Let the multitude of isles be glad thereof.” (Ps. 97:1) “The isles shall wait for his law.” (Isa. 42: 4) “Surely the isles shall wait for me.” (Isa. 60: 9) There being such a great number of isles would indicate that the “great multitude” will come and worship before Jehovah and that they will come from every part of the earth. Such are the people who are now of good will toward God and who are scattered amongst the nations but who are diligently seeking the way to the “city of refuge”, God’s organization.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ETHIOPIANS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>30</sup> It further appears in the prophecy that Jehovah will not overlook any of the enemies. He identifies the Ethiopians as a part of the enemy horde and declares his judgment against them: “Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword.” (Zeph. 2:12) The ancient Ethiopians were black men, cruel and bloodthirsty, who willingly hired themselves out to fight against God’s covenant people. (See 2 Chronicles 12:2-4; 14:9-15; 16:8.) The record of the Ethiopians is against them. “Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith the Lord. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?” (Amos 9:7) The antitypical Ethiopians are the men of merchandise for selfish gain who in these last days hire themselves out to “Egypt&quot; (world rulers) and fight against Jehovah’s witnesses and the kingdom of God, and do so for what selfish, temporary gain they reap therefrom. They plainly appear as sin-darkened, and this is indicated by the dark-skinned Ethiopians, that is to say, the present-day ones degraded through sin. None of these shall be overlooked or “hid” at Armageddon, but, as the Lord says, ‘Ye shall be slain by my sword.” Being far removed, that is to say, remote or isolated, will not aid them or save them. There will be no way for them to escape. It appears that there may be among them some individuals that will escape, such as were foreshadowed by Ebed-melech of Ethiopia, and who showed favor to the servants of God and whom God did not forget. These must turn to God and serve him before Armageddon breaks: “Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.” (Ps. 68: 31) Such are the ones who now do good unto the brethren of Christ Jesus, for which good deeds the Lord remembers them.—Matt. 25: 34-40.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ASSYRIA</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>81</sup> On the north from Ethiopia was ancient Assyria, with its main city Nineveh. Assyria was then a world power. God remembers these at Armageddon, and therefore says: “And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like a wilderness.” (Zeph. 2:13) In this part of the prophetic picture Assyria foreshadowed the political wing of Satan’s visible organization, and particularly a totalitarian monstrosity, which is now reaching out over all the nations of the earth. Assyria was an absolute, totalitarian government, and specifically pictures the entire political system, and especially at that time when the Roman Catholic Hierarchy have extended their influence and power over all the governments, and particularly over “Christendom”, and when all governments shall become totalitarian or Fascist and all recognize the Hierarchy as the spiritual higher power. The prophecy, therefore, is beginning to apply right now. In proof of this the countries of the northwest that claim to be neutral, such as Sweden, ban or prevent the publication and distribution of books, magazines or literature that speaks the truth concerning Hitler and other arbitrary, totalitarian rulers. Information published shows that recently a newspaper publisher in Oslo, Norway, is charged with a crime because he published an editorial uncomplimentary to Hitler and this the so-calied neutral countries declare is an insult to the throne Thus it is shown that the state is put above God and above everything that is true, because truth proceeds from God, and the Scriptures and facts further show that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, with its mountain of lies, is pushing its influence into every part of the earth. This is further evidence that Armageddon is rapidly approaching.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>82</sup> In the picture ancient Assyria first assisted or helped the cause of unfaithful Israel, which unfaithful Israel pictured religious “Christendom”. Thereafter Assyria suddenly faced about and destroyed Samaria and later Jerusalem. (See 2 Kings 16:7-10; 17:1-6,23,24; 18:13-37; 19:1-13.) Still later Assyria joined Babylon in destroying Jerusalem. (2 Ki. 25:1-21) Such facing about, or what is modernly called “double crossing”, was foretold by the prophet Ezekiel in chapter 16:28-43 and chapter 23:1-49. This shows, in harmony with other scriptures, that the totalitarian rule and rulers will turn against the religious element and destroy them and that God wifi destroy the totalitarians after the modern-day Assyrians have fulfilled the prophecy at Revelation 17:16,17. That is to say, after the destruction of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and all religious organizations, then will follow the destruction of the modern-day Assyrians. This is fully corroborated by what is recorded in 2 Chronicles twentieth chapter.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">“ In the picture Assyria served God’s purpose against the unfaithful Israelites. The action of the Assyrians, however, against unfaithful Israel was taken because of malice and in defiance of Jehovah God and at the instance of the Devil, the Devil’s purpose being to carry out his challenge and boast that Jehovah is impotent and inferior to the demon gods, and to thereby bring reproach upon Jehovah’s name. (Isa. 10:7) In like manner the modern-day Assyrians, the political totalitarian crowd, attack God’s true people, joining with the religious element, and then turn against the religious practitioners. The modern Assyrians must be wiped out at Armageddon just as the Ammonites and Moabites will be destroyed, as shown in the type where they destroyed Edom and then destroyed each other. (2 Chron. 20:1-23) In brief, then, this is shown by all these prophecies: that the political, commercial and military element join with the religious element to destroy Jehovah’s faithful servants; that then the political, commercial and military element destroy the unfaithful religious element, and then God cleans them all out by causing them to fight against one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’‘Note the corroborative Scriptural proof: “0 Assyrian, the rod of mine anger [upon unfaithful 'Jerusalem’, modern, religious ‘Christendom’], and the staff in their [the Assyrians’] hand is mine indignation. I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them [the religious element of Satan’s organization, particularly the Hierarchy] down like the mire of the streets.” “Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols? Wherefore it shall come to pass, that, when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem [that is, upon hypocritical, religious ‘Christendom’], I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the [boastful] king [that is, boastful totalitarian, political rulers who boast that their building and power shall stand forever] of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.”—Isa. 10: 5, 6,11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” “And they shall waste the land of Assyria [totalitarian, political rule] with the sword, and the land of Nimrod [of devil-worshipers] in the entrances thereof; thus shall he deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders.”—Micah 5: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">** From these prophecies it clearly appears that God will destroy the elements of Satan’s organization, specifically naming all of his organization and all of the gods, demons and mighty men that oppose Jehovah. Out from such organization, however, shall come some who are of good will toward God, even as some came out of Egypt and Assyria to serve God; and this is corroborated by the prophecy of Isaiah, to wit: “In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria; and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria; and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians. In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, even a blessing in the midst of the land; whom the Lord of hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance.” (Isa. 19: 23-25) This prophecy corroborates many others that those who will compose the “great multitude” will escape from the Devil’s crowd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MODERN NINEVEH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">” God “will make Nineveh a desolation”; and that will cause astonishment. Ancient Nineveh was given over entirely to devil-worship. It was built by Nimrod shortly after the deluge, and in that city religion, the worship of the Devil, the demons and Nimrod, the “mighty” man, took the lead. (Gen. 10:11,12) That totalitarian rule of Nimrod foreshadowed or pictured the political, dictatorial monstrosity that is now overrunning the earth. Both the typical and the modern-day Nineveh, the totalitarian rulers, deal with the people of earth as so much barter material. The totalitarian governments make the state supreme and the people as things to be dealt with to advance the interest of the wicked state rule. As proof of this, Germany now provides for the breeding of men and women, and the rearing of illegitimate children, that they might grow up under the supervision of the state to make cannon fodder. This is further corroborated by the four-man conspiracy that sold Czechoslovakia at the Munich Conference; the theft of Austria; the rape of Abyssinia and Albania; and also of Poland, and the unwarranted assault upon Finland. Concerning the bloodthirsty, political, totalitarian rulers Jehovah’s prophet, by God’s command, wrote: “Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and robbery; the prey departeth not; . . . because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavored harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.”-Nahum 3:1-4.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>38</sup> In all these wicked deals the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has conspired with and aided and supported the totalitarian rulers in carrying out their wickedness, the religious element hoping to ride on top and hold the position of spiritual advisers and rulers of the earth. This wicked combine will be made a desolation, even as ancient Nineveh was made a desolation. Out of modern Nineveh shall come some seeking Jehovah, and these will be spared at the battle of the great day of God Almighty; but none of that totalitarian crowd will be spared at Armageddon. All such the Lord will make, as the prophet declares, ‘a dry and desolate wilderness.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>39</sup> The totalitarian monstrosity rule will end for ever at Armageddon. The complete desolation is pictured by the fact that the wild beasts inhabit the place of such rule: “And flocks </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[{Young)</span><span class="font6"> droves] shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations [all beasts of every kind (R.F.)]; both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds; for he shall uncover the cedar work.” (Zeph. 2:14) That modern Nineveh now preys upon the peoples of the earth like wild and vicious beasts. She shall have just retiibution at Armageddon.—Nahum 2:11-13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>40</sup> Ancient Nineveh indulged in the chase and slaying of wild beasts and in military campaigns and exploits, the proof of which is now found in tablets unearthed in modern times. Likewise political, totalitarian rulers today delight in the slaying of others, and particularly those who serve Almighty God. This wicked rule shall come to an end, and the desolate places of modern Nineveh shall, figuratively, be occupied by wild beasts and hateful birds; as the prophecy puts it, “the cormorant [(Tottn//) the pelican] and the bittern [porcupine (R.F.)],” which creatures are unclean according to God’s law. (Lev. 11:13,17) Continuing, the prophecy says: “Their voice shall sing in the windows [of the ruins].” Through such windows there now comes the sound of the hilarious and drunken, demonized totalitarian politicians, who, while reveling in their political debauchery, have caused the faithful servants of Jehovah God to be beheaded or shot down. God makes it clear, then, that such totalitarian rule shall be made a place of desolation. No more shall statues or images of church saints, of great warriors and of dictators ever be found before which the people shall duck and kneel. The buildings erected now to the glory of such as Hitler, who claims that his buildings will stand for a thousand years, shall crumble to the dust. They will come to a bitter and terrible end.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>41</sup> And why? “For he [Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s Executive Officer] shall uncover [lay bare] the cedar work”; that is to say, the work that claims to be everlasting. All such work of the totalitarians is now about to collapse. The time draws near when they shall fully collapse, and then never again shall the cruel politicians enjoy their stately buildings erected to the memory of those who are demoncontrolled and who are debauching the nations of the earth. Their work will be exposed, and such work, when compared with The Theocratic Government, will appear like a dump.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>42</sup> Concerning the pomp and glory of these dictators and slayers of the innocents, the monstrous organization of the Devil that is wrecking the world at the present time, Jehovah says: “Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of the young lions, where the lion, even the old lion, walked, and the lion’s whelp, and none made them afraid* The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin. Behold, I am against thee, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions; and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.” (Nahum 2: 11-13) Such will be the condition of the modern Nineveh after Armageddon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>43</sup> Then the Lord, with scornful sarcasm, addresses the desolated organization of the totalitarians, which has flourished for a season: “This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly; that said in her heart, 1 am, and there is none beside me; how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.’' —Zeph. 2:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>44</sup> The totalitarians now boast of their power and strength and declare that they are invulnerable. They dwell carelessly, and the big dictator says in his heart: ‘I am, and there is none else beside me.’ Then the totalitarian rule comes to an end and the place occupied by such becomes desolate. This sarcasm here spoken by the Lord is compared and contrasted with what God says to his organization, that is, those who obey his holy Word and magnify his name. (Zeph. 3:14) The present-day, boastful, wicked, harsh, cruel dictator rulers now laugh and deride the faithful servants of Jehovah God, ill-treat them in an unspeakable manner of wickedness, and to them will soon apply the words of Jesus, to wit: “Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.” —Luke 6: 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>45</sup> The modern-day Ninevites now sing hilariously, but soon they shall mourn and weep. There were some in Nineveh that repented, and there are some today among the modern cruel rulers and who are held under their rule that flee from the religious totalitarians, and who devote themselves to God, and these will find refuge in the hour of stress. Such are persons of good will who must flee now and seek meekness and righteousness that they may be hid during Armageddon.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>48</sup> Ancient Nineveh “dwelt carelessly” and said in her heart: “I am, and there is none beside me.” She trusted in her own power and that of the demons. She built her organization which she expected to stand for ever, just as Hitler now says: “Our building is for a thousand years.” Today modern Ninevites taunt God’s covenant people, even as the Assyrians said to the Israelites: “Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?” (Isa. 37:10,11) Likewise today the religious totalitarian rulers say to Jehovah’s faithful servants: “What can your God do for you? Look to us; we are mighty.” They boastfully say: “I am the great one; I am the state, the citizen is nothing.” Then that totalitarian ruler says to the women : “You must present the state with more babies for gun fodder; you must do my bidding.” Similar boasting was done before the people of Jerusalem when Hezekiah was king. And then in one night God sent his officer who slew the boasting Assyrians. In one hour the totalitarian rule shall come to an end and perish from the earth.—Isa. 37: 3G.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>47</sup> Recently a number of Jehovah’s witnesses have been compelled to stand before Hitler’s firing squad and for a time were bullied and browbeaten by the officers in an attempt to compel them to confess that Hitler is the mighty one. Refusing, they were next told to be blindfolded, that they might be shot. These faithful witnesses refused to be blindfolded while they were being shot down. Those faithful men trusted in Jehovah to the end and were instantly raised to life in God’s glorious realm. They did not quail before their murderers.—1 Cor. 15:51,52.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>48</sup> The totalitarian misrule now defies The Theocratic Government, and in this such is fully supported by its religious allies, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. This unholy combine will soon come to a terrible end. In this hour of distress when Armageddon is approaching God warns the people who desire salvation to flee to The Theocratic Government. (Mark 13:14) This is the time when “the abomination of desolation” stands in the place where it ought not to stand. It claims to be the rightful ruler of the world. Therefore this is the time when those of good will must “flee to the mountains”, God’s organization, if they would be hid in the time of the battle of that great day of God Almighty.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>48</sup> The prophet of Jehovah, having at God’s command uttered His words, sarcastically directed against modern Nineveh, then says: “How is she become a desolation!” That means that, following Armageddon, the totalitarian rule, made up of religious, political and commercial mighty men, shall never function again. It shall then be a complete desolation. And who will witness that complete change? Those people of good will who now flee to the “city of refuge”, to the organization of Jehovah God under Christ Jesus. Zephaniah the prophet was given a vision of that and wrote it down. The faithful servants of God now have a vision by faith of what is shortly to come to pass, and those persons of good will who now turn wholly to the Lord also see vhat is soon to come to pass and will have a demonstration of the desolation of the wicked within a shoit time after Armageddon is fought.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>80</sup> The battle of that great day of God Almighty will leave none of the wicked. Only those who have served God and his King shall survive. Until the time after the dead bodies and bones shall be removed or buried as prophesied by Ezekiel (Ezek. 39: 9-15), the desolate places will be occupied only by wild beasts that have participated in slaying the wicked by God’s command and direction. (Hab. 2:17; see </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> 1935, pages 168, 169) Therefore the words of Jehovah spoken by his prophet are concerning that wicked organization: “Ho v is she become ... a place for beasts to lie down in !” In hm due time Jehovah will make a covenant with the v.ild beasts, and no more will they be enemies of man. —Hosea 2:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>51</sup> As to the organization of the totalitarian religious institutions, such will be for ever m contempt in the eyes of all people who live. The smoke of the torment of such shall ascend for ever and ever (Rev. 14:11); that is to say, the memory of such, like smoke, will go up and disappear for ever. “Every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.” The great nightmare of distress will then be gorw for ever, and the survivors of Armageddon will shed no more tears for those departed wicked ones. The faithful people who will form the “great multitude” will then be free and will rejoice forever.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>52</sup> Today as the faithful servants of God by faith see what shall shortly come to pass they have much cause to sing for joy. Even while the totalitarian spirit of demonism is sweeping over the nations of the earth the faithful followers of the Lord Jesus Christ rejoice because they know what will be the result. What is now taking place in the governments ruled by the dictators may soon come to pass in Great Britain and America. Even though this does come to pass the faithful servants of God will not be in the least deterred from doing the work which God has committed into their hands. The wicked deeds of the religionists and their allies will not discourage the faithful in the least, because they know what will be the final result. The confidence of these faithful ones is now strong because they trust wholly in Jehovah and his King, and by their action and their countenances they say: “My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.”—Ps. 13:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>53</sup> Seeing that Jehovah will soon vindicate his holy name and avenge his faithful servants, the “remnant” and their “companions” calmly and serenely wait upon the Lord. To those of good will Jehovaji, by Christ Jesus, now says: “Come out from her [Satan’s organization], my people.” The “great multitude” are coming and together with the remnant are rejoicing and singing the praises unto Jehovah and unto his King. (Rev. 7:9,10) When Jehovah is making inquisition preparatory to the destruction of the wicked and as to the humble or obedient ones he will not forsake them. Over them is his protecting hand. He will shield them from the assaults of the enemy and bring them off victorious through Christ Jesus, and provide a place of safety for those persons of good will who fully devote themselves to him. By faith these see the day of deliverance is near. While waiting for the great and final conflict to take place they continue to seek righteousness and meekness. They desire more instruction and are anxious to be instructed, and the Lord has more instruction in store for them.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(To be continued)</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark7"></a>CONVENTION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">C</span><span class="font4">OLUMBUS, Ohio, July 24 to 28. That is the place and the time. Jehovah’s witnesses and companions will assemble there to consider ways and means to further the Theocratic interests. Those too far away from Columbus to attend there in person will go to the convention nearest and most convenient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the time when all nations are in great distress the occasion will be appropriate to give comfort to many sincere persons who are of good will toward the Most High. Encourage all persons who desire peace and righteousness to attend the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Dictators and their allied enemies prevent the convention extending to countries outside of America. That is a greater reason why persons of good will in America should now assemble togather to comfort and edify each other. There may not be many more such conventions before Armageddon. Those who love the Lord will do what they can now to aid others to see and to appreciate the great convention that shall follow Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All the pioneers, all the zone workers, all the regional servants and all the Bethel family will attend some one of these conventions. By “America” Canada is included.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All persons of good will toward Jehovah and his King and who love righteousness and hate iniquity will be welcome, and this regardless of any religious institution with which they may be associated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those who have the Nazi spirit and are bent on doing injury to others or disturbing the peace of others will not be welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That convention will be for the purpose of doing good to all persons who desire to see peace and righteousness prevail in the earth and who desire to see justice administered to all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That will be an assembly of persons who worship Jehovah God in spirit and in truth. Therefore let all now keep the matter before the Lord in prayer that it may be a season of great refreshment for those who love righteousness and a great advertisement for </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Theocracy.</span><span class="font4"> Trust in the Lord implicitly and let your heart rejoice in the blessings he has in store for those who love and serve him Encourage your neighbors to attend and participate in the presentday blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Anticipating that the spacious Fair Grounds at Columbus will not be adequate to accommodate the great multitude that will attend the convention, arrangements have already been made to simultaneously hold conventions in more than thirty other cities in the United States. All these will be tied in by private land wires so that it will in fact be one convention, all of one mind and one spirit, all united in the cause of righteousness. The other convention cities arc named below</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At Columbus, Ohio, the assemblies will be at the Ohio State Fair Grounds, which the City of Columbus and the State of Ohio have graciously put at the disposal and use of the convention during the days above mentioned From the Columbus Coliseum all activities will be directed. Memorial Hall, in the downtown section of Columbus, will be used for special meetings, announcement of which will appear in due season.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Information now received shows that many will attend from Canada, Mexico, and from such European points from which they may be able to get steamship passage to America</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The time will be devoted to meetings for study, for discourses to be delivered by able speakers and for service meetings, for the conducting of Model Study classes and for consideration of other ways and means to further the Kingdom interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The convention will be opened Wednesday, and it is expected that the president of the Society will deliver the opening address.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The peak of the convention will be Sunday, July 28, at which time all these assemblies will be addressed by the president of the Society on the subject </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Religion as a World</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Remedy”.</span><span class="font4"> The time for this address will be as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">4: 00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">5:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Saving Time</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1: 00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The convention cities tied in with Columbus, Ohio, will be the following: Atlanta, Ga. Bangor, Maine Beaumont, Texas Boise, Idaho Boston, Mass. Burlington, Vt. Des Moines, Iowa Duluth, Minn. El Paso, Texas Fargo, N. Dak. Fort Worth, Texas</span></p>
<div>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ADVERTISING</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Extensive advertising will be carried on by all the publishers throughout the United States and Canada directing the attention of the people to the principal lecture by Judge Rutherford, who speaks on the subject </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“Religion as a World Remedy”.</span><span class="font4"> Fifteen million handbills are now being printed extending an invitation to all the “other sheep” to attend one of these conventions. These invitations will be consigned to all the companies for careful distribution from June 15 onward. Be sure that all persons on the back-eall list are called upon and given this information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Everyone should have in mind that our commission is to aid those persons of good will. Controversies are undesirable. Avoid engaging in controversies while advertising the meeting or engaging in field work. If any opponent endeavors to engage you in controversy, merely say, “Come to the convention and your questions will be answered.” Remember that you are ambassadors of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Theocratic Government</span><span class="font4"> and should deport yourselves with calmness and dignity in keeping with that government. In the convention cities themselves there will be much additional advertising done for the benefit of the people in the vicinity of the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BOOK ROOM</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Each convention will have a book room where publishers can be supplied with the literature to be offered. During the convention one bound book with three booklets will be offered on a contribution of 35c. If any desire they can bring their supply with them, or they can obtain their literature at the convention book room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Magazines for the magazine work can be obtained at the conventions, also. Publishers should bring with them their magazine bags, and their current supply of magazines if they are not needed for distribution in the local company. Come equipped with witnessing bag and phonograph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CAFETERIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Arrangements are being made for each convention to operate its own cafeteria, wherever this is possible. Three meals a day will be served at a nominal cost. The amount charged for meals is to cover the cost of the food and expense of operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">AUDITORIUMS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The names and addresses of the auditoriums in the convention cities will be announced later. Each of these auditoriums will be equipped with public-address system, so that persons attending can easily hear. Brethren capable of handling a public-address system or who have had experience in this work before should register at the convention they are attending and offer their services. It is very important that reliable, experienced persons handle this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">INFORMATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Booths will be established at all convention points, where people can receive mail, telegrams and local information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ROOMING</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All persons desiring information concerning rooms and hotel accommodations at Columbus, Ohio, can address</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Watchtower Convention Committee 187$ S. High St., Columbus, Ohio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Addresses for other convention cities will be published soon Requests for accommodations should be made in writing, and in all cases brethren should address the Watchtower Convention Committee in the city they expect to attend. The committee will be ready to make assignments after June 1. In writing for accommodations be very specific as to the requirements, setting out the following in a letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Name, street, city, state or province.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nationality, and white or colored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Date you expect to arrive in the convention city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Date you will leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Kind of accommodation you desire—residence or hotel. Number of rooms required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Number of persons in party.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Number of married couples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Number of single men. Number of single women. Single or double bed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">State definitely the amount you want to pay per person per day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Good accommodations can be had at 75c per person per day in rooming houses, two or more in a room One m a room, $1.00 and up. In almost all convention cities there will be some accommodations at 50c per person per day in rooming houses. Very good rooming houses will charge as high as $1.00 per person per day. Hotels will vary. So that the brethren may have an idea of what can be obtained m first-class hotels in Columbus, and most likely in other cities, the following rates are set out:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Single rooms with bath: $2.50 and $3.00 per day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Double rooms with bath, double bed: $3.50 and $4.00 per day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Double rooms with bath, twin beds: $4.00, $4.50 and $5.00 per day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Large-capacity rooms with bath, single beds, 3 persons to a room, $2.00 per person per day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Large-capacity rooms with bath, single beds, 4 persons to a room, $1.50 per person per day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If anyone wishes to stay in a lower-rate hotel, please make request for such. The convention rooming committee will see what they can do for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your accommodations will be mailed to you It will not be necessary to report at the rooming assignment booth at the convention on your arrival, but you can go direct to your accommodations. The hotel or people operating the rooming house where you are to stay will be notified by the Convention Committee that you are coming and be told how long you will stay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is requested that all attending the conventions obtain their rooms through the rooming committee rather than hunt their own rooms. Your co-operation in this matter will greatly aid the committee and there will be less confusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is especially requested of those persons attending the Columbus convention and desiring the same room they had the last time that they make their arrangements through the Convention Rooming Committee at Columbus, giving them the name and address of the party where they stayed previously and any other brief details that would assist. If the committee can arrange this, it will be done, but your request should be in before June 20, so that these particular accommodations will not be assigned to someone else. This is mentioned because requests of this kind have come in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOUSE-CARS AND TRAILERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At Columbus there is a certain space assigned for the ‘'trailer city”, in the Fair Grounds, with properly arranged streets, and persons arriving with trailers and house-cars will be assigned a location for parking during the duration of the convention. There is no need to write in advance for this accommodation. Persons attending conventions other than Columbus with trailers or house-cars should write the Rooming Committee for the exact location of the camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SOUND-CARS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All sound-cars in good condition may be brought to the conventions. Some of them will be used for overflow meetings; others, for announcing the public meeting in small towns, villages and probably in the convention city where operation of sound-cars is allowed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SERVICE IN THE FIELD</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A convenient number of hours during the convention will be devoted to field activity. At Columbus particularly, and the other conventions in general, arrangements must be made to give all the brethren some portion of the field activity, because of the large number attending. The following will be the four ways of advertising the Kingdom.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. Regular door-to-door witnessing with phonograph and literature and handbill distribution.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. Magazine publishers working daily at assigned locations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. Special groups to handle all back-calls previous to the convention and those turned in during the convention.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4. Information marches and the distribution of handbills on the streets.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Detailed instructions on these methods of service will be furnished at each convention. Reports of your field service in any of the above-mentioned ways should be turned in at the convention. Your report should also be turned in to your home company when you return there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PARKING SPACE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At Columbus ample parking space for cars is provided in the Fair Grounds free. All parking will be done according to the direction of those in charge of the traffic. Other conventions are making the best arrangements possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">CHECK ROOM</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A room for checking packages and other like things will be provided. Those in charge of the check room will not be responsible for anything left in the check room after 9 •. 00 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FOREIGN-LANGUAGE AND COLORED MEETINGS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the cities of Atlanta, Ga., Jackson, Miss., and Montgomery, Ala., special arrangements have been made for the assembly of the colored brethren. This is particularly noted here because of the numerous colored brethren in the South. Colored brethren, of course, are welcome at any convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the benefit of the Spanish-speaking people in Mexico and the Southwest special sessions in the Spanish language will be arranged at El Paso and San Antonio, Texas. At Columbus, Ohio, if a sufficient number of brethren request a meeting in their own language, such can be arranged, and announcement of the same will be made at Columbus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">IMMERSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At each of the conventions arrangements will be made for an immersion service for those who desire to symbolize their consecration. The baptismal talk will be given Sunday morning at eight o’clock, at which time the candidates will assemble in the main auditorium for further instructions. All persons desiring to be immersed will bring with them their own bathing suits and towels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HOSPITAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Doctors and nurses should register at the information booth if they desire to offer their services in case of any emergency. Where doctors and nurses are available they will take care of anyone who may become ill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NURSERY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Where possible a nursery will be provided where mothers can take care of their infant children. The care of the children is the responsibility of the parents, and the parents can work out their own arrangements among themselves for the care of these infants. Children under five years of age should not be brought into the convention auditorium if other arrangements can be made , and if they are brought in, the one taking care of the child should take a rear scat near an aisle, so as to be able to leave without causing a disturbance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“THE MESSENGER”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society will publish </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font4"> immediately after the convention. All persons who desire to receive this report may subscribe for their copies through their company servant, giving him ten cents for each copy desired, which will cover the cost of publishing this report. The company servant will keep a list of all those persons subset ibing, and on July 1 mail to the Society, together with remittance, the order for the number of copies of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font4"> wanted. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font4"> is not chargeable to accounts. Remittance must accompany the order. Please send in only one order Be sure to have all subscriptions from the brethren prior to July 1. Some companies will want a few extra copies for back-call work. These should be ordered at the same time, together with remittance. If the brethren order through the company servant it will save much time and correspondence on the part of the Society. We hope to publish </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The, Messenger</span><span class="font4"> about September 1. As soon as published it will be mailed. Pioneers will be furnished one copy free by the Society. If they want extra copies they will have to order them, enclosing a remittance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MUSIC</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is hoped that in most of the conventions a good orchestra can be arranged so as to lead in the music. Persons playing musical instruments well will please bring them to the convention they are attending and report to the convention committee. Those persons playing musical instruments and planning to attend the Columbus convention will please write in advance, stating what instrument they play. Address your letter to Watchtower Convention Committee, 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, N. Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">TRANSPORTATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Railroad and bus lines have recently reduced their fares. Many of the conventloners will use these modes of travel; others, their private cars. Almost all railroads have special rates on round-trip tickets. An even better rate is arranged when 25 or more persons travel in a group </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">going to</span><span class="font4"> the convention city, but they are allowed to </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">return</span><span class="font4"> on any train within a certain number of days. Examples are set out here to show what advantages there are if traveling in groups, both by train and by bus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Example - New York city to Columbus and return:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By rail, first class, round-trip rate—$35 40</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Round-trip coach fare, person traveling alone, good for 60 days—$18.95.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Special parties of 25 or more, round trip, good for 20 da)s—$17 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Persons in groups of 25 or more must travel together from same starting point to the convention city, all having similar tickets, but they can come back on any train within 20 days on the same railroad, or, in some instances, if arranged with the ticket agent, they may return on a different railroad. Tins arrangement must be made in advance</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If 150 persons group together, getting the $17 10 roundtrip coach fare, a special train can be made up out of New York to Columbus, otherwise, special ears for the group can be attached to any regular tram New York to Columbus</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From New York to Columbus the same rate would apply on the Pennsylvania, the Baltimore &amp;&nbsp;Ohio and the New York Central railroad. If a group of 25 wish to go to Columbus on the Pennsj Ivania railroad and some of this group want to return on the New York Central, they could have their ticket so arranged before they leave. Persons desiring to go to Columbus via Baltimore &amp;&nbsp;Ohio could also return by the New York Central.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These illustrations are given here so that you might inquire of your local railroad agent as to his best arrangement for an individual trip or a group out of your city to your nearest convention point or to Columbus</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BUSES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Bus companies offer rates lower than the railroads As an example, a person traveling from New York to Columbus, one way, would pay $9 25. If he purchased a round-trip ticket it would be $16.65. Where groups of 10 or more travel together going to the convention city, a round-trip ticket is $15.00 They may return on any regular scheduled bus w ith-in six months. Round trip to Columbus, 25 or more in a group, $13.90 each The same rule applies as in part les of 10</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Chartered buses out of New York to Columbus, 33 passengers in a bus, $422.00 for the bus; average cost approximately $12.80 each. If a sufficient number of passengers can arrange for the big cruiser type Greyhound 37-passenger bus, the charge would be $467.00, making an average cost per person of $12.60 for the round trip The party going out as a group in one bus may return on anv regular scheduled bus, or if the group desires to return m a chartered bus it can be arranged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All large companies, in particular, should select ot e brother to investigate all means of travel and report to the company, so that the brethren can use the best means of travel at rates convenient to themselves In man) instances companies within one zone might find it a saving to go to one central point and from there charter a bus or make special arrangements with the railroad The zone sei rant m these instances might well look into the details, communicating with the passenger agent of the railroad best serving Ins territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ISOLATED PUBLISHERS IN SMALL COMPANIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brethren in this group desirous of coming to the Columbus convention, in particular, might communicate wi’h large companies such as Los Angeles, San Francisco. Chr-a-go, if in that vicinity, and see what arrangements they arc making. It may be that these brethren can join a special train or special car or bus that they are arranging All companies making arrangements for any special trains or buses should, as soon as it is definitely settled, communicate this information to the Society, so that publicity can be made either in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> or in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font4"> for the convenience of other brethren en route who desire to ti&lt; in</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Brethren in the New York area desiring to ’.'he adva■; tage of this group arrangement, either on S,■ tur&lt; 1 ,i\, Jul) 2h or on Tue.sd.i) evening, Ju!)- 23, si o ild «i iti to</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract S&lt; .-n ty Convention Traveling Committee 117 Adams St , Brooklyn, N 5' and the information concerning special eai-s attaci ul to regular trains, and schedules of chartered buses, «.! be given them. In their letter they should state whcdicr tIm■ desire to travel by train or bus, how man) in the paity. mi l on what day they wish to leave New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In a world of distress and perplexity Jehovah's witnesses will rejoice in the blessed privilege of assembling ,.t the Theocratic Convention. Every one of the “other sheep ’ will look to </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Theocracy</span><span class="font4"> as the only hope and vv ill make every effort to attend this convention Evervone wdl Im diligent in trying to arrange his vacation for til’s period and will conclude his plans so that he will be at Columbus or at one of the other convention cities provided b) tin-Lord for his aid and comfort. All lovers of righteousness look to the Theocratic Convention of Jehovah’s witnesses as a provision of the Lord and will truly say as the psaimist did. “Thou preparest a table before me in the presence oi mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil , mj i-up runneth over ”—Psalm 23- 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ECCLESIASTICAL OPPOSITION ALSO IN INDIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“War conditions have not affected the kingdom work as yet. There has been a registration of Europeans, but so far no conscription laws have been put into force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The reproduction of the ‘Fascism or Freedom’ lecture has brought forth some opposition, but this has been met in the proper way and Jehovah has given us his blessing. Bangalore is a town in southern India noted for being religious. The giving of the ‘Fascism’ lecture there led to a petition, signed by 150 people, including three Catholic priests, being made to the police authorities, complaining against the ‘insult’ to the Catholic church. The local magistrate ordered an enquiry by the police. The result was that both the magistrate and the police officials had the message placed squarely before them; the complaint was rejected as groundless, with a warning that if any of the signatories interfered with or did harm to the ones operating the transcription machine all the 150 would be held responsible. Since then we have had no trouble, but police<sup>1</sup> have been on the spot each time the message has been given and both the ‘Fascism’ lecture and ‘Government and Peace’ (and others) have been given several times. The local newspapers came out with some publicity also, which helped forward the witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I have just returned to Bombay from a short tour in the Punjab. The message of truth has taken hold there amongst the simple village folk, but not amongst the more educated townspeople. I found the local missions making frantic efforts to win over these people by erecting schools for them, but the witness given during the last few years has identified many sheep amongst these simple people. I gave them the ‘Snares’ article from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> and it proved most timely. A number of village headmen, along with the more mature minds in the community, showed sensible appreciation of the warning against ‘religion’ and complete disregard for the missionaries. The inability of the missionaries to answer the questions these simple folk put to them has truly made them a laughingstock. Truly the Lord has caused the wisdom of the wise to perish in that locality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“I am sending you a booklet recently published by a local Catholic priest, entitled </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Vatican and International Policy,</span><span class="font4"> which might interest you. The last page is particularly interesting, revealing the cherished hope of the Hierarchy. I quote the following: ‘It will be a grand day for them [Catholic patriots] on which a Papal Nuncio will present his credentials to the Indian Government and an Indian ambassador will be a member of the Diplomatic Corps at the Vatican.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MAGAZINE ROUTE BY MAIL IN ONTARIO, CANADA</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Many siokly brethren can try this out and thus have a part in the Kingdom service. I have begun a route by mail. I have sent out letters to my friendly people I have kept listed, and a copy each of the magazines. I have already three permanent ones on my list of mailing, two of which take both magazines and one </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> One subscriber I had called on twice for a six-month or year subscription for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> and now I have heard from her as wishing both magazines this new way. I just wasn’t going to be left out because I was too sickly to walk around, and so I took it upon myself to try this method.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WORKING BUSINESS IN WARTIME LONDON</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;As a business-house pioneer it has been my privilege to bear witness to some of the big business houses in the city of London. Today I called on a businessman in one of the largest offices in the city and presented to him the Kingdom message, and also that the Devil’s organization (winch I fully explained) would be utterly destroyed by Jehovah in the great battle of Armageddon to make way for The Theocracy. ‘My dear boy,’ he exclaimed, ‘the sooner it is done the better.’ He further said: ‘This is one of the Devil’s palaces, and we are all here for the one purpose of making money.’ I said: ‘You have surely spoken the truth, but 1 feel sure in this building there must be some people of good will, who, if they knew of God’s kingdom, would earnestly desire it.’ He willingly gave me a contribution for a bound book and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Peace</span><span class="font4"> and said he would be glad if I would call later on and see him. Another Big Business man at first was a bit indignant that I had managed to get into his private office, but when I boldly and fearlessly told him I had come to bring him a message of comfort and hope in these times of distress, he quite changed and told me that he had been brought up to be very religious, but in face of all that is happening in the world today, he said, ‘all my beliefs are in the melting pot.’ I assured him that these books would prove God’s gracious purpose for the comfort and protection of all those who took their stand firmly for Jehovah and his King and kingdom and against all religion He also willingly took the books and wished me all the best in my work. In checking up to this point, in two and a half hours I had placed six bound books and twelve booklets right in the heart of Big Business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“By this time London’s blackout was due, practically all lights out by 4:30 p.m., and then one has to grope around the best he can. I wanted to get into St. Mary Axe and could not in the darkness quite judge the way. So I asked one of the group of four men the way, and he directed me, and in doing so said, ‘But there is no more saint left about it.’ I said, ‘You are quite right; it is the Devil’s business.’ This gave me an opportunity to give these four businessmen a brief pointed witness. They took a booklet and all promised to read it, and as they went on in the blackout sang out ‘Good-bye, old boy, many thanks, and all the best<sup>1</sup>’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Going home by train about one and a half hours’ journey from London I nearly always have the privilege of witnessing to my fellow passengers. Tonight three in train listened very attentively and each took a booklet. Arrived home a bit tired, but full of joy. This is a rather lengthy letter, but I felt sure you would rejoice to know there are many businessmen in the city of London who are anxious to know of Jehovah’s King and kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ROUTE WORK SUPERIOR IN IDAHO</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The route system of placing the individual magazines here works well and does better than the street method. In forty hours of service in the field I placed 31 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">and 60 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font4"> copies, having a route in two territories. Some have tried the street method, but not so successfully. The route gives one a better opportunity to get into the homes and thereby acquainted with the people. To my mind people would rather talk to one on spiritual things at their homes. Three children were out this month in the work, and thirteen adults reporting for this Pocatello company.”</span></p>

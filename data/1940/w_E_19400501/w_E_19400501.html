<p><span class="font2">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon It; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are bom sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH'S ORGANIZATION Is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and Is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed In the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon bls throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act Is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness In the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;A fool despiseth his father’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font4">EHOVAH lias provided for man the information pointing out the only safe course to take. Jehovah makes known to the man who desires instruction what is the right way to go. He discloses to such as seek after knowledge who are His enemies, and the enemies of man. He also informs man as to the identity of his friends. The meek seek after the right information. Believing that the Almighty God is Jehovah, the meek gladly receive information that comes from God’s Word. The person who takes a selfish course and ignores the instruction set forth in the Word of God is a fool. By his course of action he proves his motive and shows that he is a fool. &quot;The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.” (Pss. 53:1; 14:1) The fool refuses to give heed to the Scriptures. Those who today advocate religion as the means of saving the world from disaster thereby prove that they do not believe in the existence of the Almighty God. Such persons sense an approaching disaster, and do not know what it is, and they refuse to be instructed as to the truth thereof.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>2</sup> By his prophecy uttered through Zephaniah God informs mankind of the rapidly approaching calamity upon the world. By the same and other prophecies he tells the reason therefor and what will be the result. The prophecy of Zephaniah 1: 14-18 briefly summed up shows the following things and facts, to wit: That the day of Armageddon is fast closing m; that Armageddon will make the stoutest men. and particularly all of the worldly “peacemakers”, shriek in bitterness; that Armageddon will be a dreadful time, dark with terror and vengeance, a time of Jehovah’s war against the proud and lofty strongholds of Satan’s organization, and particularly the key men thereof; that all proud and haughty are spiritually blinded and are sinners against God and that all of these come to their wits’ end ; and that at the great battle the blood of all such willful sinners will be poured out and their carcasses will spread over the ground as contemptible; that this is retributive justice for all the savage and heartless spilling of human blood done by the wicked in violation of Jehovah’s everlasting covenant and because</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">of their defiance to God’s supremacy; that they will attempt to find the way of escape, but will utterly fail; that none will be able to buy deliverance from destruction with any material gain they have acquired, legally or ilk gaily, but that God will make a thorough clean-up of the entire enemy organization; and that he will bring to a terrible end all who disregard his warning message and who therefore willingly continue to hold to and support Satan’s organization. It will be quick action on the part of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>s</sup> It must have appeared to the leaders of Israel as a very “strange” work in which Zephaniah was engaged, going about among them and uttering pioph-ecy of approaching disaster. That prophet was blind to everything aside from his commission iroin Jehovah, and he straightway delivered the message that God had committed to him: &quot;The great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of the Lord; the mighty man shall cry there bitterly.”—Zeph, 1: 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>4</sup> The prophecy warns of the nearness of the great climax of the day of Jehovah, that is, Jehovah’s &quot;act. his strange act”. The fulfillment of this part of the prophecy delivered by the faithful witnesses of Jehovah in the present time, and whom Zephaniah i'oie-shadowed, warns the people that the great and tern-ble day of Armageddon is near. These witnesses inform the people that the battle of that great day of God Almighty is the act, the “strange act” of Jehovah. (Isa. 28:21) This is not a mere human guess, nor a political prognostication, nor a creepy feeling of premonition, such as religionists have. This message from the prophet is based entirely on the facts, which God gave him to utter, and which facts He brings to pass in fulfillment of the prophecy, and which lead to the Scriptural conclusion as to what is coming to pass, and such utterance is therefore authoritative. The message is the voice of Almighty God from Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’The prophecy says: ‘The day hasteth greatly.’ The call is for prompt and speedy action on the part of those who hear. There can be no delay. Speaking of the time of that great and dreadful day, Jesus </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">131</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">emphasized the necessity for haste when he uttered these words: “Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house: neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes. And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day.” (Matt. 24:17-20) That could not mean that the battle breaks out because beyond control of the Lord, but does mean that God’s appointed time has come, and God does not delay for any reason whatsoever. Having purposed it, he brings it to pass exactly on time.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>6</sup> While “the day” has come upon the world like a thief in the night, when the battle does begin it will necessarily be accompanied by a great noise: “Even the voice of the day of the Lord.” It will be marked by peculiar sounds, or awesome noises, accompanied by the operation of the supreme power of the Almighty moving to the destruction of his enemies. Thus is indicated that the battle will be accompanied by the victorious shouts of the heavenly or invisible host, and by songs of praise to Jehovah, sung by his faithful servants on the earth. In contrast to such joyful sounds there will be the cries of confusion, terror, grief, disappointment and utter dismay on the part of those who have followed religious leaders and who have refused to give heed to the instruction set forth in the Word of God. These shouts made by the two classes, that is to say, the “sheep” and the “goats”, are stated by the prophet in these words: “A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the Lord that rendereth recompence to his enemies.”—Isa. 66: 6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>7</sup> Noise is discordant and terrifying, while “a voice from the temple [of God]” is harmonious and a song of victory and praise. The enemy indulges in a great discordant and terrifying noise, while those on earth devoted to Jehovah proclaim his praise from the temple.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>8</sup> Today there are on the earth men who are regarded as “mighty men”, also “honorable men”, men of great influence and power, and this because they are in the saddle and in control of the people. Soon such men will come to bitter disappointment. Says the prophecy: “The mighty man shall cry there bitterly.” The “mighty man” mentioned includes the political dictators who now think they have builded impregnable strongholds against future violence; it also includes the commercial giants and international bankers, and it particularly includes the religious great, wise and mighty ones, such as the pope and members of the Hierarchy of Authority. These men even by their dress and actions strut about, inviting the people to regard them as unusually mighty men. Just preceding the beginning of the battle those mighty men will have seized control of the nations of the earth, and by such control will completely regiment the people and put all people in fear of them and their dictatorial power, except those persons who take their stand fully on the side of Almighty God and who put their entire trust in him and his Theocratic Government.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">• But the power of these so-called “mighty” men, their material wealth and influence, will count for nothing at Armageddon. Seeing their structures crumbling to pieces, they shall cry bitterly and will find no help and no means of escape. Everything on which they have set their heart and soul will be ruined, because God has declared it so. They will be at least convinced that it is the end and that the hand of Almighty God is operating against them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>10</sup> Take note of God’s words concerning them. “Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in hi might, let not the rich man glory in his riches.” “Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will punish all them which are circumcised [religionists who hypocritically claim to be devoted to God but who are devoted to the Devil religion] with the uncircumcised [all who openly defy God’s law] ; Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness; for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.” (Jer. 9:23,25,26) Otherwise stated, the Israelites had then become unfaithful and their heart devotion was not to Jehovah God, but to the things of the Devil’s world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>11</sup> “Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without; the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.” (Isa. 33:7) The valiant ones amongst these mighty men are those who make war and then cry for peace and assume the responsibility and the honor of bringing about peace; and concerning them the Lord says: ‘The mighty men cry there bitterly’ when they see their efforts have failed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>12</sup> The men who now think that the world has builded a civilization that shall stand forever by reason of their own efforts to bring about peace and prosperity will be wholly disappointed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>13</sup> The mighty commercial men, who transact the commerce of the world, and all their pilots amongst the people, shall get theirs, and they shall weep. “And all that handle the oar, the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land; and shall cause their voice to be heard against thee, and shall cry bitterly, and shall cast up dust upon their heads, they shall wallow themselves in the ashes.” (Ezek. 27 : 29, 30) Today all these great and “mighty” men sing hilariously and felicitate one another, while they feast upon the fat of the land and the poor lean on their shovels and wait to be fed on the crumbs; and to these mighty ones the Lord says: “And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentations ; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.”—Amos 8:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>14</sup> All such, seeing their efforts are in vain, will cry as Esau cried, but, like Esau, will receive no help. (Gen. 27: 34; Heb. 12:17) The mighty men will take no heed to the warning that is today given, but in their anger continue to persecute the humble messengers of Jehovah that bring to them God’s warning.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“DISASTER”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>15</sup> Today all persons who think readily discern that these are days of distress. The religious and political leaders say in substance: “We are going to make better times; the church must and will convert the world and bring all people under religious control; and in the very near future this world will be a fit place in which to live.” In response to the boasting and hilarious songs of the so-called “mighty” men Jehovah God through his prophet says: “That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness.”— Zeph. 1:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>16</sup> God is about to violently express his indignation against “Christendom” and all her supporters, and to ail such he says: ‘That will be a day of trouble and distress.’ The prophet Habakkuk was also given a vision of that day of battle, and it was so terrible that he prayed to God in these words: “When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he [Satan, with Gog] cometh up unto the people [of Jehovah; and is bent upon the destruction of all who serve the Most High], he [Jehovah] will invade them with his troops”; that is, God will invade Satan and Gog.—Hab. 3:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>17</sup> The peak of the “distress of nations” comes at Armageddon and will cause the nations and the people of the world to cry out in desperation. (Luke 21: 25) Where, then, will the people find the place of safety in that day? Certainly not with religious organizations or political institutions. Safety will be found only in one place, and that is under the organization of the Almighty God: “The Lord is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him. But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.” (Nahum 1: 7, 8) “The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead [that is, into his trouble].” (Prov. 11:8) “The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips; but the just shall come out of trouble.”—Prov. 12:13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“DESOLATION”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> The “battle of that great day of God Almighty” will not be one of ease and comfort and plenty, but, as stated by the Lord’s prophet, “a day of wasteness and desolation.” Jehovah’s witnesses now by faith see that this great prophecy concerning the trouble is near fulfillment, and until its fulfillment they must keep on sounding the warning and pointing the people to God’s organization as the only place of safety. That responsibility is laid upon the faithful, which they cannot escape and at the same time receive God’s approval. Not even the faithful are told the exact day and hour that the great trouble will break, but they do see that it is soon. Seeing that the distress upon the world increases, the way of the witnesses becomes more difficult and they must continue to give the witness, and they cry unto the Lord: “How long [must they continue the witness work]?” and they get the answer: “Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate.”—Isa. 6:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>18</sup> Jeremiah the prophet of God foretold what was about to fall upon Jerusalem, which disaster was typical of what is now about to fall upon “Christendom”. “This whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment.” (Jer. 25:11) The honorable or religious leaders say: “We will soon clothe the earth with the glory of our moral achievements, making it a fit place for Christ to visit.” Such conclusion is based upon the fertile minds of modern evolutionists, but such products will not be considered precious in the sight of Almighty God. On the contrary, all the wicked shall, together with their works, be completely dashed to pieces.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>J 0</sup> Furthermore the prophet says: “A day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness.” The day is dark now, but the greatest darkness will come when the battle of Armageddon is on. That darkness, no doubt, will be literal, as well as mental, and the darkness will compass all the violators of God’s law that are upon the earth: “The way of the wicked is as darkness; they know not at what they stumble.”—Prov. 4:19.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4"><sup>21</sup> In the vision which Jehovah gave his prophet Habakkuk of that terrible day the prophet was so moved by the invisible power of the Lord that he exclaimed : “The sun and moon stood still in their habitation; at the light of thine arrows [of liquid fire] they [Jehovah’s host] went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear.” (Hab. 3:11) The literal darkness surrounding “Christendom” and other nations of the earth will be made worse by reason of the mental darkness of those who have claimed to serve God but who have not. Those who now refuse to hear the warning and instruction of Jehovah will then have only blackness, foreboding destruction, about them. “To whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.”—Jude 13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>22</sup> Contrasting friend with foe, Jehovah says: “I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil. I the Lord do all these things.”— Isa. 45: 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>23</sup> As a warning of that approaching time of great darkness the alarm is sounded and God says: “Give glory to the Lord your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains. and while ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness.” (Jer. 13:16) “Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him; and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so. Amen.”—Rev. 1:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>24</sup> This warning of Armageddon was written long ago for the aid and comfort and hope of those who have devoted themselves to God, and these witnesses of Jehovah are commanded to sound such warning that al] other persons within the hearing and who may hear and who are of good will may flee to the place of safety.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TRUMPET</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>25</sup> The trumpet is a sound of alarm. Jehovah’s faithful witnesses now are sounding the trumpet of Almighty God by proclaiming the approaching day of Armageddon. When the battle actually begins, the sound of the trumpet will announce the Lord charging upon the enemy, leading his invincible host, which host will be uttering the cry of victory. “A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and against the high towers.” (Zeph. 1:16) That will be the time of both the trumpet sounding and the shouting against the entrenched forces of wickedness, against those who have convinced themselves into believing that they are secure.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>26</sup> The battle of Jericho was a type of the fight of Jehovah’s heavenly host against the enemy. Before entering into actual combat against Jericho Joshua, under the direction of the Lord, gave this instruction to his army: “And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up, every man straight before him.” (Josh. 6:5) This foreshadows the instruction which God gives to the spiritual Israelites by his great Officer, the Greater Joshua, that is, Christ Jesus. According to the instruction given to the Israelites by Joshua thev were to march around the city seven days, and on the seventh day of the march the prophecy was fulfilled in miniature. Now the witnesses of Jehovah are marching, proclaiming the message of the King, and soon the marching will be done, and then the battle of the great day of God Almighty will be on. Then will the shout and the sound of the trumpet be given as Christ Jesus, the Greater Joshua, leads his heavenly host to complete victory. It will be a shout of victory and the sound of the trumpet of triumph. That will mark the complete downfall of “Christendom” and of every part of Satan’s organization. The anointed and their companions by faith see it now</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>27</sup> In the year 606 B.C. unfaithful Jerusalem fell at the hand of King Nebuchadnezzar, whom God used as his servant to punish the unfaithful. That was another picture of the fall of antitypical Jerusalem, that is to say, modern-day “Christendom”, and this will take place at the hand of the King of the Theocratic Government, Christ Jesus, whom Nebuchadnezzar foreshadowed: “At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint battering rams against the gates, to cast a mount, and to build a fort.” (Ezek. 21: 22) As the Lord Jehovah made the picture at Jerusalem, so now he will fulfill that prophetic picture at the hand of Christ Jesus.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>28</sup> The battle of the great day of God Almighty will be a time of alarm and of shouting &quot;against the high corners” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Young)</span><span class="font4"> ; “high corner towers.&quot; (Zeph. 1: 16, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.,</span><span class="font4"> margin) The “high corners&quot; or &quot;towers&quot; of the earthly division of Satan’s organization are these, to wit: religion; the high tower and chief one of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, the pope: together with him are the “high corners”, the other dignitaries of the Roman Catholic organization. To religious “Catholic Action”, bent on- ruling or ruining the world, these are key men: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">politically,</span><span class="font4"> dictators or totalitarian chief rulers, the “high corner towers&quot; who regiment the people and control them; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">commercially,</span><span class="font4"> the mighty men or chief corner stones of the financial institutions that traffic in the products of the earth and in human creatures. These high dignitaries constitute the chief ones of the “fenced cities”, that is, the ones who have shielded themselves by their own efforts and are taking refuge now in then-entrenched organizations and are further attempting to strengthen their entrenchments, and in so doing are using all means of getting control of the people and of all the material wealth of the earth. Such organizations have fenced themselves in with laws to suit their own convenience, and by religious practices, and by such they think they are safe from attack: With the political dictators and commercial strong men the Roman Catholic Hierarchy have fenced themselves in by treaties and concordats made with dictators and with commercial traffickers, and by confederacies or alliances, by which they hope to control the earth. All of these are ably backed up and supported by the military and the “strong-arm squad&quot;. They all have their propaganda agents, and public press and magazines, and other means of publication, to sound out the greatness of the three ruling elements of the earth, and by which they hope to convince the people that these three elements constitute their only means of salvation. These combined “high towers” or higher-ups think they can furnish all the necessary things for mankind and can shield them from disaster. They are certain to be disappointed, because Almighty God has so stated.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>29</sup> Christ Jesus is the chief corner stone of Jehovah’s capital organization. He is the “head stone” and the “corner”. (Isa. 8:14; 28:16; Ps. 118:22) Christ Jesus is the Vindicator of the name of Jehovah God. At Armageddon he will lead the heavenly host against the earthly “high corners” or high towers of Satan’s organization, and also against the invisible host of Satan. All of the “high corners” the Lord Jesus will overturn, lay low, and crush to pieces: “For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up, and he shall be brought low; and upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall.”—Isa. 2:12,15.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH’S “ACT”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>30</sup> Worldly rulers and their supporters are stubborn, heady, high-minded and refuse to give heed to the warning by Jehovah, and therefore the purpose of the Most High is expressed concerning them: “And I [Jehovah] will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against the Lord; and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as the dung.”— Zeph. 1:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>31</sup> It is the Almighty God who brings this distress upon those who have refused to give heed to his warning. This he does because it is his day for squaring the accounts. He has put these rebellious ones into such a place that they cannot find the way out because they refuse to give heed to His Word. Every one of man's announced remedies for relief has failed, and these mighty prognosticators and associates will be brought to their wits’ end and be compelled to acknowledge their utter helplessness. They will become desperate and go wild and hysterical and will cause everyone to turn against his fellow creature. In their efforts to destroy one another they “walk like blind men” and fight as blind men. “They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits’ end.”—Ps. 107 : 27.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">” Blind and hysterical, the worldly leaders, who have been obstinate, brutish and foolish, will fight against one another, and all shall perish. (Ps. 49: 10) They will destroy one another as did the Midianites when Gideon and his little band of 300 faithful supporters put the enemy to flight. (Judg. 7 : 20-22) The religious, political and commercial men, who have hypocritically assumed to serve God but have done to the contrary, have broken their implied covenant with Jehovah God; so “Christendom” is in an implied covenant with the Almighty God because they have professed and announced that they served him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” No doubt there were men in the early part of “Christendom” and some all along until the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple who did serve God, but since the enthronement of Christ Jesus and his coming to the temple the religionists have gone entirely blind and devoted themselves entirely to demon-worship. Concerning such workers of iniquity God’s Word says: “The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart: and thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways; and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore, and no man shall save thee.”—Deut. 28: 28, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">REASON OF CALAMITY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>34</sup> Jehovah makes known the reason for his visiting a great calamity upon the worldly-wise, obstinate and foolish ones: “Because they have sinned against the Lord.” They have had opportunity to hear the truth from Jehovah and have willfully rejected it and are therefore “willingly ignorant” that, by the Word of God, the heavens and the earth shall be wiped out.—2 Pet. 3: 5-7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>35</sup> The blind leaders of “Christendom” and their blinded followers and supporters are headed now right into the ditch of destruction, and into that ditch they shall soon fall. (Matt. 15:14) The wisdom of the “wise” prognosticators of this world shall come to an ignominious end, and they in their last desperate state will know that the hand of Jehovah God is against them to destroy them: “Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder; for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.” —Isa. 29: 14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>36</sup> The self-constituted wise men ignore everything that God has given to his people and everything that godly men have proclaimed in their presence. These wicked ones have committed the “sin unto death”, and that beyond the hope of resurrection. The “man of sin”, “the son of perdition,” has certainly done this very thing. Such wicked “man of sin” class comprise the “evil servant” and the clergymen, who have professed to serve the Lord God but who have denied him, and these together with the principal of the religious flock and their blind supporters and hangers-on continue to sin against Jehovah and his kingdom. Such persons have had opportunity to know the truth of and concerning Jehovah God and his government and have received a warning of the approaching battle of that great day of God Almighty, which shall bring disaster upon all governments of this present world. As the Lord told the unfaithful people of Jerusalem through Jeremiah, so now he tells the unfaithful ones, those of “Christendom” who have pretended to serve him but who have not: “I called you, but ye answered not.”—Jer. 7:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>87</sup> All such have sinned against the Lord, particularly since 1918. And how have they sinned! By their open hostility to the message of Jehovah, which he has sent amongst them by his obedient and faithful messengers; and by their contemptuous indifference and unconcern toward that message relative to God and his kingdom, and which they have regarded as of no worth to them. They have preferred to hold to demonism or religion, saying, “That is good enough for us.” By their course of action they have declared that there is no Almighty God, the Creator of heaven and earth, and the sole Giver of life. “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt; they have done abominable works; there is none that doeth good. The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God. They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge! who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the Lord.” —Psalm 14:1-4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>38</sup> Those willful opponents of Jehovah and his kingdom and the message concerning the same have shed the blood of many innocents; and says the Lord God to those religionists and their supporters: ' Their blood shall be poured out as dust [that is, as a worthless thing].” (Zeph. 1:17) The religious leaders of Israel (the prototype) and their antitype, the religionists of “Christendom”, have been guilty of such lawlessness as no other creatures on earth, and to both the Lord God says: “For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that have ■'hed the blood of the just in the midst of her [‘Christendom’], they have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.”—Lam. 4:13,14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>38</sup> God’s Avenger of blood, as executioner of those who have willfully violated his everlasting covenant concerning bloodshed, will carry out Jehovah’s purpose and will bring all offenders to account. In this day of peril all who have heard of the “cities of refuge” and who have not taken themselves to that place of refuge, that is, to God’s organization under Christ, shall be slain by the avenger of blood.—Gen. 9:6; Num. 35: 9-34.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DEMON INFLUENCE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>40</sup> After the battle of Armageddon begins there will be multitudinous numbers outside of the “city of refuge” because they have held to demonism or religion. They have preferred to hold to the doctrines of demons, such'as “purgatory”, and to worship images and pray with beads and go through other formalism rather than to hear the Word of God. Because of their support given to the Devil’s bloody organization they will not be permitted then to plead ignorance of their responsibility. They will have the mark of the beast in their foreheads (mentally), if not actually in their hands.—Rev. 13: 16,17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>41</sup> The responsibility is now upon Jehovah’s witnesses and servants to take the kingdom message to all such and sound it within their hearing, even though they cannot induce the obstinate to hear and obey. The responsibility of Jehovah’s witnesses is to proclaim the truth, and this they cannot avoid. God will make a clean-up of all the enemy and supporters of the Devil; and those who refuse to give heed to the warning now being proclaimed and who persist in their service of demonism and yielding to the influence of demonism, shall die and will bear the responsibility upon their own heads.—Ezek. 33: 8, 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>48</sup> Since the year 1918 religionists in particular and their allied supporters have heaped great reproach upon the name of Jehovah and upon those who faithfully serve God and his King. Those enemies have cruelly persecuted Jehovah’s faithful servants and have shed much blood of the innocent and faithful followers of Christ Jesus. Jehovah gives his unbreakable word that at Armageddon he will square the account with all such and that this he will do by pouring out the blood of the enemies as dust and strewing about their flesh upon the earth even “as the dung”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>43</sup> Jehovah has put in the mouth of his faithful people to pray this prayer concerning the enemy, and particularly the leaders of “Christendom” who have so wickedly persecuted the faithful servants of the Lord, to wit: “Do unto them [those of ‘Christendom’ who have persecuted God’s servants] as unto the Midianites; as to [Captain] Sisera, as to [King] Jabin, at the brook of Kison: which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.” (Ps. 83:9,10) That prayer God will fully answer at Armageddon when he wipes out the enemy. This is certain because Jehovah put the prayer in the mouth of his servants as a prophecy, and wliich prophecy he will fulfill.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">“ Modern-day leaders of “Christendom” and their willing supporters treat the Word of God with utter contempt and heap great contempt upon Jehovah’s witnesses. As “Christendom” shows her rebellion against God and against his kingdom, so Jehovah shall treat them as rebels at Armageddon. He will show his contempt for “Christendom” and her leaders and supporters. Their flesh shall be strewn upon the earth as a contemptible thing. The survivors of Armageddon shall see them; as it is written: “And they [the survivors of Armageddon] shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me; for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.” (Isa. 66:24) No resurrection for such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">NO DELIVERANCE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>45</sup> The austere, selfish and arrogant professed servants of God who are leaders of “Christendom” today depend upon their own influence and their material wealth to deliver them in the day of God’s wrath; but to them the Lord says otherwise: “Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord’s wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy; for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.”—Zeph. 1:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>46</sup> Those worldly-wise men who have relied upon their own building of so-called “civilization” have laid up on earth treasures by which they hope to protect and save themselves. Thus they have heaped up their treasure for the days of evil as a kind of insurance against disaster. All the dictators have large • iinounts of money stored up outside of their respective countries from which they are liable to be chased by the enraged people. For instance, Hitler has large hank accounts or deposits in the name of agents in nine foreign countries, but none in Germany nor in the land of his fellow dictator in Italy, whom he does not fully trust. When he is compelled to flee and to seek a place of hiding and refuge he will find that his earthly treasure thus laid up will do no good for him. This is also true with reference to the other dictators and political “big shots”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>47</sup> It has been said that the Vatican, the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, has stored up a fabulous amount of earthly treasure. That great treasure of silver, gold and precious jewels has been gathered from the various countries of the earth. Even from the poor peons of Mexico as much as thirty million dollars a year was taken to the Vatican, until that institution was somewhat curbed in that land. Added to such treasure the Hierarchy have their intake from the “purgatory” racket, fraudulently operated among the credulous hangers-on. Added to the “purgatory” fees is that collected from the masses for the dead; and the hold-up collection plate, “Pay as you enter” charge for a pew in the church building; also the religious Bingo games; gambling games, and the great piles raked in therefrom; also their ill-got gains from raffles; and money contributed by the state, which has been wrongfully taken from the people in the form of taxes; also the sums that have been wheedled out of many upon their deathbed, and large sums of money collected out of the insurance policies paid by insurance companies to the widow upon the death of her husband, or some other dead relative; also the profits from numerous commercial deals and investments, such as Monte Carlo, Wall Street, liquor manufactories and breweries, and in stocks and bonds, and in grain, and in other products dealt in upon the stock exchanges; and, added to the foregoing, numerous “charity&quot; drives operated among the general public, Catholic and Protestant, Jew and Gentile, and responded </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">to </span><span class="font4">by numerous persons, all such because of their fear to go contrary to the influence of the mighty men of the Hierarchy; also great revenue derived from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">their </span><span class="font4">enslaving “houses of good shepherd”, orphanages and hospitals operated for selfish gain; Peter's pence to the “poor” pope; also from </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">the sale of candles. </span><span class="font4">beads, “holy water,” and many other things too numerous here to mention. But wait until Armageddon begins and “the dictator pigs begin to root”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>48</sup> No amount of money or other treasure can serve to bribe Jehovah and his great Executive Officer. Christ Jesus. No amount of accumulated earthL treasure “shall be able to deliver them in the day oi the Lord’s wrath”. (Vs. 18) The Almighty God will receive nothing as pay to keep that hypocritical crowd out of the shambles and to save them from destruction. “For the Lord your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward.” (Deut. 10:17) “They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the Lord; they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels; because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity.” (Ezek 7:19) Furthermore says the Lord: “Treasures of wickedness profit nothing; but righteousness dehv-ereth from death.”—Prov. 10: 2.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>48</sup> “The city of refuge,” that is, God’s organization, is the only place of security and safety. Concerning that place of protection it is written: “Moreover, ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death; but he shall be surely put to death. And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is tied to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land until the death of the priest. So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are; for blood it defileth the land; and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein [by gold and silver], but by the blood of him that shed it.” —Num. 35: 31-33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>50</sup> Further considering the destruction that shall come upon the nations of the world at Armageddon, Jehovah says by his prophet: “But the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy.” That does not mean the literal earth or mundane sphere, because it is written in the Word of God: “The earth abideth for ever.” (Eccl. 1:4) It does mean, however, the visible (that is, earthly) organizations of “Christendom” particularly and the nations round about “Christendom”. That devouring or destruction shall be an expression of Jehovah’s consuming zeal in righteousness and holiness, and he will perform this in vindication of his holy name. Jehovah’s zeal burns against and consumes the wicked organizations of men that have defied him or that have ignored him and that have followed the religious leaders of demonism. God’s zeal for righteousness will completely burn up everything of wickedness, both invisible and visible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>61</sup> The following Scriptural texts further support the foregoing conclusion that the zeal of Jehovah’s (ire, the fire of righteousness, shall utterly consume all workers of iniquity and all their wicked organizations: “For the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.” (Deut. 4: 24) “For our God is a consuming fire.” (Heb. 12:29) “How long, Lord? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire? Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.’' (Ps. 79:5,6) “And it shall come to pass at the same time, when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord God, that my fury shall come up in my face. For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel.”—Ezek. 38: 18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">QUICK RIDDANCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>52</sup> The Lord Jesus Christ, the great Judge who now sits in judgment as the High Officer of Jehovah God, is judging the nations. He is separating “the goats” from “his sheep”. (Matt. 25: 31-46) “The goats” symbolically describes all those persons on the earth who are against The Theocratic Government. That means everyone that is not for The Theocracy, because all such are against it: “He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.” (Matt. 12: 30) The Lord’s “other sheep” are those who flee to the “city of refuge”, that is, the Lord’s organization, who remain there and who joyfully serve God and The Theocratic Government. When that judgment work of the Lord is done, then the “goats” will have fully identified themselves as God’s enemies and then the Lord’s “other sheep” will have identified themselves as on the Lord's side, willingly and joyfully serving God and his government of righteousness. Then the final execution of the judgment will be next in order. Concerning the goats, that is, the enemies of God, he says through his prophet (Zeph. 1:18): “He shall make even a speedy riddance of all them [that is, all the goats] that dwell in the land”; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(R.V.)</span><span class="font4"> “make an end, yea, a terrible end, of all them.” That terrible and speedy end of the goats is stated by Jesus in these words: “Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire [destruction], prepared for the devil and his angels [that is, all demons and all those who abide under the influence and power of the demons and who act in opposition to The Theocracy].’’ “And these shall go away into everlasting [cutting-off </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Lhaglott) ].” </span><span class="font4">—Matt. 25: 41, 46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">” W’hile the separating judgment is being conducted by Christ Jesus he sends forth his anointed servants and their companions, his “other sheep”, to sound the warning of the approaching battle of Armageddon and the disastrous results that shall come upon those 'who refuse to give heed to that warning. He commands his servants to declare his Word and to tell the people to flee to the mountains, that is to say, to the kingdom of God ruled by Christ Jesus, the Righteous One. Today the witnesses for the Lord are sounding that warning. The .-tubborn and obstinate ones remain in the religious institutions and many of them say: “I will never change my religion for anything.” “I am satisfied with my religion, and I don’t care to hear about anything else.” Such are merely nominal or so-called &quot;Judeans”, claiming to praise God; but they know not the truth and do not know Almighty God, because they refuse to hear and abide by his Word. They refuse to give heed to the warning. They hang on to the demon religion, and their end will be that of the leaders of religion, and of the chief of demons, and of all other demons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ Jehovah by his prophet makes clear that the end of all who stand against The Theocratic Government shall be “a terrible end”. They shall have a troubled end, with such trouble as cannot be described in human phrase. They shall certainly not finish their days on earth in peace and ease and comfort. The religious leaders are the most reprehensible. Political prognosticators as to what they are going to do for the world are in a like class. But all who after having been warned continue to follow their'leaders and religious teachers shall meet with the same fate meted out to the hypocrites. Christ Jesus, the Greater than Solomon, will in obedience to his Father’s command do as did his prototype to Joab and Shimei: “Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.” “Now therefore hold him not guiltless ; for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood.”—1 Ki. 2: 6, 9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>55</sup> A speedy and terrible end shall come to “all them that dwell in the land”, as God states through his prophet Zephaniah. That specifically means the nominal Judeans, the religious leaders in “Christendom”, who hypocritically claim to serve God, deceive the people, and deny the Lord. Says the Lord concerning such: “I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the land, saith the Lord. I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name of the Cheniarims with the priests.”—Zeph. 1:3,4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>56</sup> In plain phrase, that prophecy means the “evil servant” class, the leaders who teach religion in this day of Jehovah, and all who induce the people to practice religion or demonism. All the inhabitants of “Christendom” who remain under the leadership of the religious combine and everyone who gives aid and comfort to the Devil’s organization are also included in that destructive judgment. Says the Lord: “I will cut off [all] the remnant of Baal from this place”; the clear meaning of which is, ‘cut off all that in any manner advocate or support Devil religion,’ even as God caused Jehu to cut off all of them that identified themselves as demon worshipers, that is, religionists.—2 Ki. 10: 22-25.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">NO DELAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>87</sup> The judgment of execution will not be delayed. When Jehovah’s time, comes execution will take place speedily. Religionists, that is, the demon-worshipers, will have fully identified themselves by that time, and the Lord finally pronounces against them his judgment, and execution will immediately follow: “Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.” (Ps. 2:5) What shall take place is indicated by the prayer which God caused to be written long ago, and such prayer is now uttered by the faithful servants of God who are now on the earth and is addressed to Jehovah and against his enemies: “So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm. Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish; that men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the Most High over all the earth.” (Ps. 83:15,17,18) That prayer God will hear, and his judgment shall be executed accordingly, because the prayer is in full harmony with his expressed will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>58</sup> The “battle of that great day of God Almighty” is not'a thing to be lightly considered, as even some who claim to be servants of God have done. The fact that Jehovah has repeatedly made mention thereof by his prophets adds to the great importance of that battle. It will be the final conclusion of the controversy between Satan, the chief of demons, and the Almighty God. It means the final end of everything that is in opposition to The Theocracy. It is made prominently to appear in the Scriptures and many times is brought to the attention of the people, because it is the last opportunity for those who now hear the message to ever get life. It is the great event that shall for ever establish the supremacy of Jehovah and completely vindicate his name. Holy angels and faithful men have for long looked forward to this great and terrible day. Now it is very near. The faithful on earth see it and rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>58</sup> Armageddon will mark the end of all the nations of the earth, because all nations have forgotten God. It will mark the manifestation of The Theocraci This is the appropriate time when Jehovah God. representatively in the temple at Zion, commands that all shall keep silent and hear what he has to say to them. It is the time when his faithful servants must sound his alarm throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>Go</sup> Who shall hear and give heed to the commandment of Jehovah from Zion? and who shall abide that terrible day of Armageddon? Neither “Christendom” nor any of the nations of the world shall abide “But the Lord is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting King; at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide Ins indignation.”—Jer. 10:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>81</sup> Satan and all the demons are called “gods”, and many people worship such. None of them shall abide, but they shall perish: “Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.” (Jer. 10:11) Who, then, shall find the place of safety and abide the day of God’s wrath? Jehovah has set forth in his Word the answer to these questions, pointing out the only means of finding protection, safety and deliverance in that day.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark7"></a>FIRST DEFEAT OF TOTALITARIANISM</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">T</span><span class="font2">OTALITARIAN rule is overrunning all the nations. “Totalitarian” means, according to Webster’s Dictionary, “of or pertaining to a highly centralized government under the control of a political group which allows no recognition of or representation to other political parties, as in Fascist Italy or in Germany under the Nazi regime.” A state or government in which all the activities of the people are within the control of a dictator, that ruling power constitutes a “totalitarian state or government”. L'nder such the people are regimented or formed into classes, and all their individual privileges are fixed by the state, if they have any at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Totalitarian rule is a monstrous thing, is a fanatical rule, and. as its treatment of the witnesses of Jehovah God proves, it denies the inalienable right of men to worship God, and openly defies God and Christ. Fanatics who are dictators insist on an arbitrary rule of the people. That great monster has put fear in all “Christendom” and has destroyed the liberties of the people of continental Europe and is rapidly advancing its power and control over all the nations of the earth. The British Commonwealth of Nations is gradually yielding to that monstrosity because of fear. In the United States of America that monstrosity, the dictator spirit which puts the state above God, is rapidly advancing and the liberties of the people are disappearing. Compulsory flag-saluting, and suchlike ceremonies, are but a means or step to force all persons to yield to the totalitarian government. Nazi clubs are now organized and operate throughout the United States and openly declare themselves for that monstrous government. Communism, Fascism, and Nazism, although different in name, are all one and the same thing, and are all against God and his Theocratic kingdom, and all put the state forward as the supreme power, and all defy Almighty God and punish those who insist on serving God according to his Word, the Rib’e, rather than man. Religionists now openly support such totalitarian or dictatorial governments, and thereby religionists belie their claims and place the organization of men above Jehovah God. The political rulers know that the position now taken by religionists is insincere and hypocritical. Religionists are afraid to say a word against that dictator rule which defies Almighty God, Jehovah, and thus religionists show their unfaithfulness to God and his King</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If totalitarian rule overruns all nations shortly, is there any rule by which we can determine whether it w ill end me and for long or go down in defeat? and by whom') Thcii is such a rule, over four thousand years old, and dating from shortly after the Flood</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is written: “Now is the judgment of this world no., shall the prince of this world be cast out ” (John 12.31, “The prince of this world” is the author of totalitarian rule. Following the Flood the first organized government was a totalitarian rule with Nimrod as dictator. That government was organized in defiance of Jehovah God. Nimrod’s government was the product of Satan, the adversary of the Almighty God. Immediately after Noah left the aik Jehovah made known his “everlasting covenant” concerning the sanctity of life. (Gen. 9: 9-11) God would have all creation to know that life is a gift from him and th,it no one can properly take or destroy life without the permission of God. The beasts of the field and the fowls of the air God has provided for man that he may use them for food as he may require. (Gen. 9: 2-4) If any man, contrary to the law of God, kills another man, the killer is guilty of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">murder and must suffer death. (Gen. 9: 6) Also the wanton and needless slaying of animals is a violation of God’s everlasting covenant. If a man kills beasts for his necessary food, such is lawful; but if he kills them merely to satisfy a selfish desire to slay or to gratify his desire for sport, that is a violation of the everlasting covenant concerning the sanctity of life. Totalitarian rule is a gross violator of God’s everlasting covenant concerning the sanctity of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The covenant having been announced, the Devil saw an opportunity to further reproach the name of God by causing man to violate that everlasting covenant. This violation began to be manifested particularly in the first totalitarian ruler, Nimrod. The man Nimrod was a descendant of Noah’s son Ham. Genesis 10:8-10 records: “And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth: he was a mighty hunter before the Lord: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.” Nimrod was ambitious, warlike and bloodthirsty, and reveled in wicked deeds, and was undoubtedly induced to do so by reason of the influence of “the god of this world”, the Devil, and his associate demons. Nimrod hunted and killed wild beasts merely to satisfy his wicked desires, and he armed and trained young men to follow him in the killing business. In the eyes of the people Nimrod became one greatly admired and worshiped because of his prowess. No doubt the Devil put that into the minds of the people, that they would show their devotion to a creature rather than to a Creator. According as it is written, Nimrod was to them a mighty hunter “before”, that is, superior to or greater than, the Almighty God. The honor, plaudits and adoration bestowed upon Nimrod was worship, and there began the practice of religion following the Flood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Religion is a form of worship bestowed by creatures upon another, the one worshiped being regarded by such creatures as superior to themselves and worthy of adoration and worship. The Devil had gained control of the mind of Cush, the father of Nimrod, and had used Cush, the son of Ham, as a ringleader in turning the increasing population of earth away from Jehovah God Nimrod, son of Cush, together with others, was trained to violate God’s everlasting covenant and to establish creature worship, and this was for the purpose of diverting the minds of creatures away from the Almighty God. By this means Satan and his associate devils defied the Almighty God and reproached his name, and thereby set up the practice of religion in the earth. Let this be remembered and kept in mind henceforth: Religion has ever been the chief instrument employed by the Devil to reproach the name of Almighty God and turn the people away from the Most High.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Politics is the means and art of organizing and governing the people and of conducting and controlling organizations of men Religion having been organized and put into operation to turn the people away from God and to the worship of creatures, it was quickly followed by politics, that is, an organization amongst men to control and rule the people. Nimrod, the religionist, took the lead in politics, he being made the ruler or king. Genesis 10: 10 notes that “the beginning of his kingdom was Babel ... in the land of Shinar”, Nimrod and his religious and political associates built cities, into which the people were gathered, and that was the beginning of trade or commerce, trafficking amongst one another. From that day to this, religion, politics and commerce have been operated jointly by the Devil and his assistants for the purpose of controlling and ruling the nations of the earth and keeping them away from a knowledge and service of Almighty God, Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With Satan, “the prince of this world,” it was anything to turn the minds of the people away from the Lord Jehovah. Being a powerful spirit creature, Satan exercised his power by influencing the thoughts of men, by injecting into their minds wicked thoughts. And this he did that he might again get complete control of the human race and turn them away from the great Theocratic Ruler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Satan’s next attempt, therefore, was to organize the people into one compact body or government, that he might with greater ease control and direct all the people according to his own selfish ways. The Scriptural record upon this point reads: “And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.” Then in furtherance of his wicked scheme to turn the people away from God and to cause them to worship creatures, the Devil and his wicked angels injected into the minds of men that their salvation depended upon the acts and power of themselves and other creatures. “And they said, Go to, let us build us a city, and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.” (Gen. 11:1-4) This was the first attempt after the Flood on the part of the Devil to organize the people into a government or world power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A “city” is a symbolic expression referring to a government; and on the occasion above mentioned Satan induced the people to conclude that now they must build a city ami a tower. They proceeded to do so. Why? To “make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad [disorganized] upon the face of the whole earth”. (Gen. 11: 4) That city was called Babel, or, at first to the natives, “Bab-il,” which means “Gate of God”, a religious name to them. The beginning of Nimrod’s kingdom was Babel. (Gen. 10:10) The Tower of Babel, builded by the people at the instance of the Devil, was Satan’s defiance of Almighty God. Clearly this was his method of planting in the minds of the people the thought that they did not need God but that by their own efforts they could provide for their own kind of worship and their own uplift, and could save themselves when it was necessary; which was another wily scheme to turn them away from the true God. The Devil has not changed his methods even to the present time. Hence Psalm 9 . 17 speaks of the nations as “the nations that forget God”. If not in words, then by their course of conduct they say. “We do not need God, nor do we need a Savior. We do not need the Bible. Our wisdom exceeds the wisdom of all men of the past. We worship power and our own ability to accomplish our uplift.” Not back to the Bible and its God Jehovah, but the politicians of “Christendom&quot; say: “What the world needs is </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">more religion.&quot;</span><span class="font2"> Thus the Devil, using the savants and self-constituted wise men, turns multitudes of people away from the true and living God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">God permitted the people of the plains of Shinar to go to the full limit of their folly. They were building this tower that they might make </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">for themselves</span><span class="font2"> a name, which the Devil had induced them to believe would safeguard them from being scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. Of course, he would expect to hold them in the vicinity of the tower and the city, and to cause it to be a mecca or place of worship to which all the peoples of earth would look for instruction; and thus he would control them through a dictator or totalitarian ruler. He had almost succeeded now in turning the minds of the people away from God that they would no longer trust Him. Satan no doubt thought that again he had won the victory over God, and that now he would hold the people in subjection to himself and have their worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Then the Lord Jehovah took action for the vindication of his name and for the benefit of creatures that believe. Seeing Satan again turning the minds of the people away from him and into subjection to a totalitarian rule and against the Theocratic rule, now the Lord God would give them a demonstration that Satan is not the true God, but a mimic god, and that the Lord God Jehovah alone could help them. The record is that God “came down”, that is, turned his attention down to earth, to see their organization and their tower. Then he changed their language. Before this, as will be noticed in the Hebrew text of Genesis 11:1, the people were all “of one lip”. (See the marginal reading.) Their lip must have been shaped in the same general manner, and they all spoke one kind of words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Lord, by the action which he now took, demonstrated his own supremacy. “And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth ; and they left off to build the city. Therefore is the name of it called Babel, because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.”—Gen. 11: 5-9</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That was the first defeat of totalitarianism. It foretells totalitarianism’s final and lasting defeat. Again totalitarianism has come to the fore, to dominate the earth, in opposition to Jehovah’s Theocratic Government and the people who support that Government. Shortly comes &quot;the battle of that great day of God Almighty”, the battle of Armageddon. Although of one mind to destroy the Lord’s people, and although allied together in their wicked conspiracy and acting in full harmony, the enemy forces will, in the beginning of that battle, be confused by the power of Jehovah God and every one of these anti-theocratic enemies will be caused to fight each the other by his side. (Judg. 7 22, 2 Chron. 20:22-24; Ezek. 38:21,22) In a similar way Jehovah God caused confusion at the tower of Babel Says the Lord God Jehovah: “I will shake the heavens ami the earth; and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, .ind I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heat lien [(A.B.V.) kingdoms of the nations] ; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.” (Hag. 2:21,22) Totalitarianism will bow to The </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Theocracy.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark9"></a>EARTH MADE FIT TO LIVE ON</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">generation passeth away, and another genera-l </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font2"> tion cometh: but </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">the earth abideth for ever.” </span><span class="font2">Not the words of a fallible geologist, but of Ecclesiastes, chapter one, verse four, written under inspiration of the Creator; “God himself that formed the earth and made it, he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">inhabited.”</span><span class="font2"> (Isa. 45: 18) Further by the mouth of his prophet Isaiah (chapter sixty-six, verse one) the Creator says: “The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool.” “And I will make the place of my feet glorious.” —Chapter sixty, verse thirteen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Perfect and glorious was the garden of Eden at the beginning of man’s existence. In that garden grew everything that was pleasant to the sight and good for food. (Gen. 2 9) Had the first man proved his complete devotion and obedience to his Creator, without doubt God would have shown man how to make the entire earth beautiful and glorious, because it is written in Genesis 1: 28 that God gave to man the divine mandate: “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth, and subdue it.” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{Roth.)</span><span class="font2"> This authority implies that God would have supplied man with a proper knowledge and means to accomplish that very thing. Had perfect man followed that course, and his offspring remained in harmony with God, in the course of time all the earth would have been finished and robed m the glory and beauty of God, and perfect man would have had something to do with it</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By reason of his own wrongdoing man lost all these privileges and blessings. Approximately 1900 jears ago God’s beloved Son, Christ Jesus, as a man on earth, shed his own blood and provided redemption for believing men Jehovah God made him “heir of all things&quot;, which includes the earth. God has made him the Executive Officer to carry into operation his will, and that includes making the eaith a glorious place as God’s footstool. Now he comes the second time, as a glorified Spirit divine with all power in heaven and in earth, to deliver men of good will toward God and to make such men a glorious home on earth Before tiie Lord will robe the earth in beauty and in the glory of God he will first destroy and completely remove the worldly structure which man’s enemy Satan and his agent-, have erected and which is unsightly and hideous to all who love righteousness. The great battle of Armageddon between The Theocracy and Satan’s entire organization, and which is just ahead, will clear the ground to make way for the erection of the beautiful and glorious structure to the good of God-fearing men and to the honor of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Clothed with power and authority to even open the graves and lift the people out of death, Jesus now comes to regenerate obedient men of good will and make them joyful of heart At Revelation, chapter twenty-one, verses four and five, he says • “And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. And he that sat upon the throne [The Theocracy] said, Behold, I make all things new.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now thorns and thistles encumber the earth, and the Devil sends an army of bugs and other pests to destroy men’s crops, but such conditions will not exist during the reign of Christ Concerning the power of the Lord then, read Isaiah 55: 13. Then the earth shall be free from the pests and will yield her increase, and the people will be glad</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Today there are millions of square miles covered with burning sands where no living thing exists. If these desert lands were watered they would produce. God will see to it that they will be watered, according to the declaration of his power at Isaiah 35: 1-7. Today the people travel oxer the desert lands and remark: “How. barren' and what a waste of land!” They will not always say that, for the Lord says: “Behold, I make all things new.” Under the Theocratic Government they will say too as now they say concerning the condition of spiritual Israel: “Tins land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden ” (Ezek 36: 34, 35) The people of earth that live will then see God’s great handiwork and will rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">God having promised to make the earth a place of glory and beauty, wherein regenerated man can live for ever, God is sure to make good that promise. By his beloved Son Christ Jesus the King he will cleanse the earth of all unrighteousness and make it a place of perfection and beauty for the good of man. Let the people learn these truths now and begin to take heed and to give honor and glory to the Almighty God, Jehovah, the Great Theocrat.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">EVIDENCE OF GOD’S GUIDANCE AND BLESSING</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">My dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All the days since the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font2"> came and was read and perused I haxe thought to write to you a letter more personal than those xvhich carry reports or ask for instructions, for I wanted to tell you of the encouragement which the report brought, and of the comfort and assurance xvhich I felt in common xvith the brethren. That so much service for the Theocracy has been done despite the difficulties of the time, the opposition of the Devil’s agents on earth, and of the Devil himself aided by the wicked spirits with him, is evidence of the blessing of our God and his King upon the arrangements of his organization. I thought of the joy of heart you would have in preparing and sending out the report, and I thanked him in heart and by voice for all this meant. That which is freshest to the mind often calls forth the remark, “The best yet”, but I think that is really the case with the introduction to the report, setting out clearly the Theocratic Government, its purpose and the place of the xvork in the purpose of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Also I had purposed to venture on your time while I told you of the encouragement got from the clear evidence of the Lord’s guidance for his people through the recent </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font2"> articles, tor the remnant, and for their companions the Jonadab sheep. ■And outstanding among these the article on Lazarus, the beggar. Now, reviewing its publication, I feel that it takes a place comparable with the revelation of the true place of the “great multitude” as an earthly company, with the “Fill the earth” opening to clearer understanding, and, to go farther back, to the true interpretation of the parable of the “sheep and goats”, each of xvhich has been as events in the Lord’s instruction to his people At the moment I do not recall any one article which gives so much light on other scriptures and sets them in what is evidently their true interpretation as this on Lazarus. As the light has increased it became evident that the interpretation of the parable given so long ago was not according to the intent of Jesus’ words; so, as in other things, one waited for the clearer light sure to come. It is now clear that the story of the rich man and Lazarus was not an illustration of the widening out of the message of truth to the Gentiles, and certainly not of the restoration of the Jews to God’s favor Now its particular intent for these last days is manifest, when the rich are brought down from their high places, and ‘the needy are lifted from the dunghill’, as Hannah’s song has it. Seeing the story as a prophecy was grand, and surely that is the key to the words of Jesus It is plain now why the interpretation was</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark13"></a>ERS</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">delayed: other truths needed to be known first Till we knew the true position of those who form the “rich man” class, and knew about the Jonadab brethren and the “great multitude”, the story could not give its meaning. The Roman Catholics shout out that xxe go to and get the “rabble”; which is not true, and they know they he in saying what they do; but the “beggar” class are certa.nlx’ getting their comfort, and their safety, and the prophecy is being fulfilled. I thought the connection made with Isaiah 26. 10-14 very illuminating: life is given to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The dogs snarl at you, and the critics and cynics sneer, and you have to bear these things, but I rejoice in the comfort of heart you get in the ministry of the Scriptures, and in realizing the blessing of the Lord on your service for him May those blessings continue for the help of those who fear him, and for his name’s sake.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">“Having just returned from a five weeks’ trip through the western provinces of Canada, I know you will be interested in learning something of the work there and the way the witnesses carry on the service although handicapped by the extreme cold. The weather generally over the winter season in these provinces drops frequently from 10 to 40 below zero. Years ago very little work was done in the cities and rural districts during the wintertime, owing to the intense cold and the roads’ being blocked with snow, the publishers being unable to use their automobiles. The publishers, being determined to witness during this season, found a way out, and about two and a half years ago began to make use of the horse with caboose or toboggan, or sleigh. Although it was not possible to cover the ground very quickly, yet the territory was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Traveling by horse and caboose is not so expensive. Practically any farmer will willingly give the horse or horses feed. It is easier witnessing this way once the publishers get to the farms, because very few persons will visit the homes under such conditions and the witnesses are made welcome and often invited to stay overnight and are supplied with food. To carry out this service effectively some publishers prepare for three or more days’ journey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Owing to the use of the horse, very few publishers consider stopping the service now in the wintertime because of the cold weather, and due to this method of working it is amazing to see that in spite of the winter season the publishers throughout these provinces, as well as in other parts of Canada, have increased. In January, 1940, a peak figure of publishers for the country was reached. Many pioneers yeais ago were in the habit of ceasing their work during the wintry weather, but now they continue on. In fact, in many parts of these provinces the company publishers as well as the pioneers prefer the winter season for the service to the summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“The back-call work under such conditions is no easy job, especially when the horse pulling a toboggan or caboose has to travel seven or more miles in heavy snow to get to the interested persons. Back-calls, however, are being made, and this work is making progress, even though it cannot be done to the extent that it is possible in the cities</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“During the past nine years there has been drought in these three provinces, particularly in Saskatchewan Practically no crops have been obtained, bringing terrible poverty and extremely hard conditions to the witnesses in many districts. During the past year it is true that conditions have been a little better and there have been some crops, but so far as I could gather, what little money has been made is being used to put their cars in order and provide for gas to be used during the summertime to get around the districts. It is also worthy of note that it is this province particularly that has yielded the most interest in proportion to the population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“There is a great increase of publishers throughout the Western provinces. There seems to be interest everywhere, and it has been reported by one zone servant that on several occasions, on being advised of interest in a district, he found on arrival at the home of the interested that the’, were already gathered together studying </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“There is also much interest in the district to the extreme north of the provinces. There is a new district now opened out north of the province of Alberta which is called ‘the Peace River District’, and the witness is being delivered now as far north as there are towns and camps In this Peace River district the temperature often drops to 60 or 70 degrees below zero. This district is alive with interest Many of the witnesses in these parts have eome to a knowledge of the truth during the last eighteen months. At the zone assembly at Edmonton, Alberta, two pioneers traveled from this Peace River district a journey of well over *2(}&lt;) miles. They came in an old Ford car, no heater, and were compelled to leave the window open all the way because of the frost on the windshield. The temperature on their journey must have been at least 30 degrees below zero When they arrived at the assembly they were overjoyed with the privilege of meeting with their brethren The biethren at all these assemblies were very enthusiastic and rejoiced greatly in their assembling with others of the same faith. In some districts the only way the witnesses could get to the assemblies was by digging themselves through the snowdrifts, but even this did not deter them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“At one assembly a witness traveled in an open ng a great number of miles, and when he arrived at the assemnly his leg and foot were frozen. He showed no signs of pain but delight was written on his face, and he said he would not have missed the assembly even if it meant having both legs and feet frozen. Another witness, a pioneer, covets his rural territory on foot, and this he does even in the coldest weather. He arrived at the zone assembly pulling a small sleigh which carried his literature and all his belongings. This faithful witness has been in Kingdom service many years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“Another pioneer reported that all his work in the rural territory is done on foot, having no means of conveyance and yet as regards funds he was not worrying, because, he stated, he had more money in his pocket now than when he started the pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“It is true to say that practically all the service that is done by the witnesses in the Middle West provinces is accomplished only through putting forth much effort Tin witnesses have zeal, warm hearts and a loving devotion to Jehovah and determination to push forward in the servie&lt; and sound the warning, no matter what the cost</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“In the western part of British Columbia the position is somewhat different. The weather in the wintertime is generally good and the publishers can work most of tl.c time. The witness work is entered into wholeheartedly, but it is very noticeable that the severe conditions in the Middle West which have to be fought by the witnesses have deu I oped in them fighting qualities, and as a result the work of Jehovah is performed, no matter what obstacles lie before them. Throughout the whole of the western provinces the witnesses are joyful and very zealous for The Theocracy and it was a great joy as well as a privilege to have some part in working with these witnesses in the interests of tin Theocratic Government.”</span></p>

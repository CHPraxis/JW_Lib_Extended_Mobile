<p><span class="font2">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH Is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power In heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon It; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION Is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus Is the Chief Officer thereof and Is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege It Is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed In the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord's next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“RELIGION’S DOOM&quot; TESTIMONY PERIOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This midsummer testimony period during the entire month of August follows closely the Theocratic contention The witness period being named “Religion’s Doom”, the testimony activities should receive particular stimulation from the convention’s nationwide public address on “Religion as a World Remedy” Appropriately, therefore, all Kingdom publishers will offer to the public, on a 25c contribution, the book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font2"> and a self-covered booklet, preferably the new booklet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees.</span><span class="font2"> Conventloners and people of good will everywhere are invited to share m this testimony. Arrange for this now through the local organized company of Jehovah’s witnesses. If not yet associated with such, write us for references. A complete report on each publisher’s field service for August should be submitted, to compile the total results.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">With especial pleasure we announce the new book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion, </span><span class="font2">released by its author, Judge Rutherford, at the recent Theocratic convention of Jehovah’s witnesses. It offers the indisputable evidence, both Scriptural and factual, that religion is opposed to Jehovah’s Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus and is therefore the mortal enemy of man, and that Christianity is the only way of escape for people of good will. The book contains 384 pages, including color-illustrations, and a valuable reference index, all bound within beautifully embossed covers in a refreshing green cloth and gold-stamped. You will prize the author’s edition, which contains an autograph of a letter in his own handwriting addressed to the Theocratic ambassadors.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. But </span><span class="font5">spectly in the light, they are discerning the “signs of the times” and will thereby learn as to the time of Armageddon. The Lord did not reveal to Paul the day or hour, but he did direct Paul as to the signs that would be present indicating the time of the expression of his wrath against all workers of iniquity. Therefore the words of Paul, the inspired servant of the Lord, addressed to the faithful followers of Christ Jesus concerning the beginning of Armageddon, are these : “For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.”—1 Thess. 5: 3.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> According to the rendering of this text by </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Rothe: ~ ham,</span><span class="font5"> the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Version,</span><span class="font5"> and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott,</span><span class="font5"> the word “For” is omitted and the text simply reads: “When they shall say.” The word “when” does not refer to the time immediately before the beginning of 1918, when the Lord Jesus first appeared at the temple, but manifestly refers to some point of time after 1918. The witness work to the name and kingdom of God was temporarily shut down at the beginning of 1918, but that work was renewed with greater activity after 1918 and that increased work occurs within “the day of the Lord”. The time approaching is in that day when the enemy will be completely destroyed. Immediately before that expression of God's wrath is the time “when they shall say”, that is, when they shall speak the message, “Peace and safety.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>5</sup> Who shall say? Certainly not the anointed ■witnesses of Jehovah, to whom the apostle is writing, because to them he says: “Ye have no need that I write unto you. For yourselves know perfectly.” Nor is it Jehovah who says to the remnant, his faithful servants, “Peace and safety.” It is written concerning the remnant that they say: “I will hear what Goel the Lord will speak: for he will speak peace unto Jus people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.”—Ps. 85: 8.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">&quot; The faithful hear what God says to them, but those who are following worldly teachers of worldly wisdom turn to folly. The Lord does not cry to the 213</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;For the turning away of the simple shall slay whoso hearkeneth unto me</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">JEHOVAH has provided a place of security for I those only who give heed to his Word and joyfully </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font5"> obey his commandments. This assurance from the Lord is of great comfort in these days of peril. All who have diligently sought to know the truth have learned during the past few months that the demons are besieging the minds of people and have taken possession of the mind of every person now on earth who does not turn himself to the Lord. The earnest student of God’s Word discerns that the climax is near and that soon Jehovah will express his wrath against all enemies of The Theocracy. The faithful are diligent now to seek righteousness and meekness that they may remain in the place of safety during Armageddon and receive complete deliverance in God’s due time.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> But how about those who have once been enlightened in the truth as it was revealed at that time but who have failed to walk in the light, those who have turned away from the leading of the Lord and held to the teachings of men that they learned years ago? Surely the words of the foregoing text apply, to wit; ‘ For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.” The simple are those who look to worldly leaders and follow worldly wisdom, and who have failed to feed upon the Word of the Lord as the light from the Lord’s presence shines upon his Word. A fool says in his heart, “There is no God”; and therefore the one who takes the course of following men, or who holds to religion, by his course of action ignores Almighty God and in his heart says: “There is no God.” Safety now is guaranteed to only those who hearken unto the Lord’s Word, and who are diligent and alert to learn and to obey.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHEN?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> Armageddon is a certainty. All persons who are now in a covenant with Jehovah and fully devoted to The Theocratic Government are necessarily looking for evidence that Armageddon is near at hand. Such being children of light aud walking circum-</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.&quot;—Prov. 1:32,33.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">“remnant” or anyone else, “Peace and safety.” It is not, then, the Lord who speaks the words that the apostle above used. The faithful “feet” members of Christ publish peace; as it is written: “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!”— Isa. 52:7.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> But it is not the faithful ones who publish peace that speak the message above written by the apostle Paul, to wit, “Peace and safety.” The word “they&quot;’ could hardly refer to the rank and file of the people, because they are asleep and give little heed to anything save their own selfish appetites. The word “they&quot;', as used by the apostle Paul, manifestly means “the ambassadors of p^ace” who are due to “weep bitterly”, as stated in Isaiah 33: 7. Such are the ones who are the leaders amongst the people and who mold public opinion according to their own desires. They are makers of propaganda for all others who are willing to hear them and who follpw earthly leaders. The word “they”, therefore, clearly refers to the persons who have a selfish desire to rule this world for their own satisfaction ami who have no use for The Theocracy, and who are against the great Theocrat and his King.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">•This is the day of the Lord Jesus Christ, when he sits in judgment and is dividing his “sheep” from the “goats”, as stated in Matthew 25; that is, he is separating the ones who are seeking righteousness and meekness and who are therefore in line to become members of his flock from those who are opposed to </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font5"> and the kingdom of his Father. The word “they” used by the apostle Paul in Thessalonians must refer only to the leaders of the “goat” class, that is, the ones who would make the people believe that they stand for God and that they have influence with God, and that they are doing God’s work, and who claim to be in position to give reliable assurance to the other “goats” as to what is the meaning of the present-day conditions. They prognosticate concerning the future, basing their conclusions entirely upon worldly wisdom, governed by selfish desire. The masses of the people believe that the opinions expressed by such mighty and professed learned leaders are reliable and authoritative; and consequently, the people being in ignorance and blindness, the blind follow the blind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’ Then, again, note that the word “they” refers to that class of persons whose “peace” has been disturbed by reason of the publication of the message of and concerning the fall of “Christendom”, the destruction of religion, and the establishment of the great Theocratic Government. “They” are the ones whose religious susceptibilities are shocked by reason of hearing the message concerning the end of the world and of the destruction of all who oppose The Theocracy. They are certainly not disturbed because of the physical force employed against them by Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions. They are frightened and disturbed, however, by reason of the message which Jehovah’s witnesses and companions declare in their presence and hearing. Being disturbed because of the proclamation of the truth concerning The Theocratic Government, “they” endeavor to unite all force that they may muster to fight against The Theocracy and the ones who proclaim it.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> The faithful servants of Jehovah who proclaim the name and kingdom of the Most High are oppressed by the combined enemies who wickedly fight against God’s servants, and concerning which the faithful servants of God pray, as the Lord directed them to pray: “Keep me as the apple of the eye; hide me under the shadow of thy wings, from the wicked that oppress me, my deadly enemies, that compass me about. They are inclosed in their own fat; with their mouth they speak proudly. They have now compassed usin our steps; they set their eyes to cast us down to the earth. He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places. Arise, 0 Jehovah, confront him, cast him down; deliver my soul from the wicked by thy sword; from men by thy hand, 0 Jehovah, from men of the world, whose portion is in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy treasure; they are satisfied with children [their so-called successors of the apostles], and leave the rest of their substance to their babes [their religious pupils in the organization whom they teach to carry on their religious action]. As for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with beholding thy form.”—Ps. 17: 8-15, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> It is not difficult to locate and identify these mighty religious leaders now, for the reason that the facts show beyond all question that the Protestant “lion” died in 1918. It is therefore the big Roman Catholic leaders that do the talking now, and those who were once Protestants follow the lead.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> “They,&quot; that is to say, the leaders of the big religious system, scoff at the published fact that the Lord Jesus has ‘descended from heaven with a shout [with the command from the Most High], with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump’, announcing the kingdom, and that the battle is about to follow and that victory for the great King is certain at Armageddon. Such great religious leaders, being under the influence and power of the demons, are in darkness, even as are the demons concerning the purpose of Jehovah God. They are the same ones as mentioned by the inspired servant and apostle of Christ Jesus who wrote: “Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.” (2 Pet. 3:3,4) The physical facts now well known furnish an abundance of evidence that it is the religious leaders who thus scoff at the proclamation of the Theocratic message and who then utter their say.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SAY WHAT?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> What they do say is prompted by their own selfish desires to make themselves believe that they have accomplished their purpose and' shall abide in their present position forever. Without a question of doubt Jehovah, by his Executive Officer, Christ Jesus, is now maneuvering the enemy into position for the battle of that great day and the enemy thinks he is about ready for the great conflict. The active agencies of Satan now operating in the various nations of the earth must come to a point where they think they have things exactly their own way as they desire them. The totalitarian rulers hate God and they hate The Theocracy and Christ the King thereof. Likewise the great religious leaders hate The Theocracy and have convinced themselves that they, together with other men. shall rule the world instead of Christ. These big religious leaders and the dictators are working together to put to silence everything or every organization that does not agree with them and their conclusions. The dictators are gaining strength every day, and the big religious leaders think that they are riding on top of that organization that is moving against righteousness, represented in The Theocratic Government. The religious leaders are all against The Theocracy, and necessarily they are opposing all who proclaim the name of Jehovah God and his government, and that his government is the only hope of humankind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> God’s people, made up of the remnant and the “other sheep” (John 10:16), will be the only ones who will continue boldly to advocate The Theocratic Government. They are doing so now under adverse conditions. It is the purpose of the religious leaders and the totalitarian rulers to silence all of those who proclaim the message of The Theocratic Government, and they are proceeding to do so upon the theory that the message of the Lord proclaimed by such witnesses is subversive. The message of God’s kingdom under Christ shocks the religious susceptibilities of these mighty leaders, and it is an easy matter for them to persecute those who proclaim The Theocratic Government. It should be manifest to all who think soberly that it is a conflict between Satan and the Lord Jehovah and his King, with Satan’s visible agents doing whatsoever they can to silence the witnesses of Jehovah, and they are looking forward to the time when they can and will silence God s witnesses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>1S</sup> The time arrives when the opposers of The Theocratic Government think that they have accomplished their purpose and they “say, Peace and safety”. Just how long they will be saying that before the battle of Armageddon begins is not definitely indicated by the Scriptures. That they will be so saying shortly before the battle is quite certain and clear. It is not a matter of 'Maybe they will say so’; but of a certainty they will be permitted by the Lord to come to the point where they feel that they have accomplished their purpose and when they will certainly say: “Peace and safety.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> To whom will they say “Peace and safety”! Certainly not to Jehovah’s witnesses and to others who are companions of Jehovah’s witnesses and who support The Theocratic Government. This is certain, because such faithful servants of Jehovah God would not listen and give heed to their saying. To whom, then, do these mighty religionists utter their saying! They will say it to one another, to all the religious leaders, and to those who follow religion, totalitarian allies and all the people who are still under the influence and control of religionists, all over whom the demons exercise influence and power; all therefore who are blind to the truth, having no understanding of Jehovah’s purposes. Their words, as spoken, to wit, “Peace and safety,” are not, in fact, for peace, so far as God’s servants are concerned: ‘For they speak not peace [to the advocates of The TurocRvnc Government], but devise deceitful words against them that have quiet in the land.’ (Ps. 35: 20) Only those who fully trust in Jehovah will be quiet in the land, looking to God for deliverance and trusting fully in him for salvation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>17</sup> The religious leaders and totalitanan rulers desire to be at peace so far as any message regarding The Theocracy is concerned, and this they desire in order that they may carry on their own selfish desires to rule the world. By such outcry of announcement of “Peace and safety” they are bidding God and Christ to come to terms with them that they may not longer be disturbed by anyone. This is illustrated by the messengers which King Joram sent to meet Jehu, whom he saw approaching, but from whom he received no satisfaction. Then the king himself (representative of the Devil) went to meet Jehu, the latter being a representative and picture of Jehovah God’s Executive Officer of the present time. This picture is recorded for the benefit and hope of those faithful servants of God now on earth, to wit: “And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously. And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel, and Ahaziah king of Judah, went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite. And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu! And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?” (2 Ki. 9:20-22) “There is no peace, saith the Lord, unto the wicked.”—Isa. 48: 22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> The crying out of “Peace and safety” by those who thus utter this message is really a false cry, because they are not in fact at peace. They cannot be at peace of mind as long as they see Jehovah's witnesses and companions in existence amongst the people. They want to rid the earth completely of such proclaimers of the kingdom message. Those who thus cry out “Peace and safety” were pictured by Haman, who thought everything was working out well for him but who still was troubled in his mind because of the existence of Mordecai. (Esther 5: 9-14) It disturbs their inwards to see anyone present who does not kowtow to totalitarian and religious rulers but who with boldness and fearlessness advocates The Theocratic Government. Although they may come to the point of putting every one of these messengers of the kingdom to silence, and say to each other, “We are at peace and safety,” yet they will be troubled in mind and heart as long as they see the witnesses of the Lord anywhere about them in the land.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SIGN</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>19</sup> Without a question of doubt we are now well advanced within “the times and the seasons” of the Lord’s presence and of his judgment of the nations and we are approaching unto the time of Armageddon, but the “sign” immediately preceding Armageddon is not yet discernible. Many nations are now at war and the democracies are rapidly disappearing. The totalitarian rule is overriding the people who love a government by the people. It appears that the time is coming in the near future when these present wars and troubles will be patched up by some kind of peace and this peace announced to the world. But let this be kept clearly in mind, that it is not peace between the nations that is referred to by the crier, saying, “Peace and safety,” written by the apostle Paul. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy is the greatest religious organization on the earth, and it is quite probable that the head of that religious organization will have much to do with bringing the warring nations to a temporary peace. But such so-called “peace” clearly is not the peace to which the apostle Paul refers in his epistle to the Thessalonians.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> The Roman Catholic Hierarchy do not look to the League of Nations or treaties heretofore made to establish peace. Rather the followers of the Hierarchy look to the .pope, the head of their religious organization, which they call the “rock foundation”. They have been taught to believe and claim that against such the gates of hell shall never prevail; but when the rule of the land is such that they think to have put to silence all the advocates and proclaimers of the Messianic kingdom, the great Theocracy, then is the time for their saying: “Peace and safety.” That undoubtedly refers to the accomplishment of conditions on earth whereby such religious leaders will no longer be disturbed by the representatives of The Theocratic Government. Certainly Protestantism will never again disturb the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and the few individuals amongst the Protestant religious organization that stand high will doubtless join the Hierarchy in her cry of “Peace and safety”. The desire of all such is to carry on the control and rule of the world in their own selfish way. The message of The Theocratic Government now being boldly declared by Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions is that which disturbs the religious leaders.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>81</sup> The Supreme Court of the United States has positively decided that Jehovah’s witnesses have the full right under the Constitution to preach this gospel of the kingdom, both by word of mouth and by distributing the printed message and by the use of the phonograph. In the face of such decision the big religious leaders try to avoid the mandate of the highest court, and now they resort to the practice of charging Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions with disturbing the peace and disorderly conduct. The only “proof” offered is that Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions go about talking to the people about God’s kingdom. This disturbs the peace of mind of the religious leaders, and hence they induce their followers to testify that Jehovah’s witnesses are disturbers of the peace. This is further proof that it is the message of The Theocracy that so greatly disturbs the religionists and the totalitarian rulers. When the religious leaders hear the Theocratic message and know that the people are hearing that same message, they are greatly vexed and their peace of mind is very much disturbed, and therefore they devise means to prevent the message of God’s kingdom from being preached. They proceed then to ‘frame mischief by law’. These facts are here cited as corroborative proof that the religionists, who do constitute a part of the totalitarian rule, are the ones that are vexed and that will cry “Peace and safety”. This was foretold by Jehovah in these words, to wit: “From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you; for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night; and it [the Theocratic message] shall be a vexation [peace-disturbing] only to understand the report.”—Isa. 28:19.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> This text, according to the marginal reading, is: “It shall be a vexation when he shall make you [scoffing opposers] to understand [the] doctrine.” Hence the preaching by Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions of the doctrine of The Theocratic Government disturbs the religious susceptibilities of the selfish, religious leaders, and the principal of their flock. The only thing that will remove that vexation to the Hierarchy and their allies is for them to come to see conditions which indicate a complete suppression of the Theocratic message and those who bear that message.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> Let it be kept in mind that religion is the instrument of Satan and the demons, employed to turn men away from Jehovah God and his government. When Jesus rode into Jerusalem after the manner of Israel’s kings he was hailed by the great multitudes of people, who cried out: “Blessed is he that coineth in the name of Jehovah.” (Matt. 21:9; Ps. 118: 26, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font5"> That disturbed the peace of the religious leaders and moved them to wrath. “The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.”—John 12:19.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2&lt;</sup> Exactly the same conditions exist today. The Pharisees and their associates were able to say “Peace” only after they had suppressed the Lord Jesus Christ. It is reasonable, therefore, to conclude that in this present time the mighty religious leaders and their allies will take a course similar to that taken by the Pharisees. In these days the “other sheep”, or “great multitude” (Rev. 7 : 9-17), are constantly increasing and their shouts are joined together with those of the remnant in proclaiming the presence of Christ the King and his kingdom; and the religious leaders, moved to anger against them, increase their endeavors in every possible way to suppress the messengers of The Theocratic Government. All this must be done before they can cry “Peace and safety”; and all the present evidence, therefore, shows that exactly these conditions exist, and hence we are approaching near unto Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>25</sup> At the present time the religious leaders attempt to suppress the Theocratic message by crying out to their political allies that Jehovah’s witnesses are intolerant, while at the same time these religionists practice the worst kind of intolerance against the witnesses of Christ Jesus. The clergy cry “Intolerance” as a camouflage in their endeavor to hide their own intolerance. They are well illustrated by the robber who steals from another and then cries out “Thief” to attract the attention of the people to someone other than himself. These religionists even induce the political and judicial representatives to take up their cry of intolerance. For instance, in the case before the Supreme Court of the United States, heard on April 25, 1940, counsel for the ones who were attempting to enforce flag saluting said, in substance: “These Jehovah’s witnesses do not grant the same tolerance to other religions that they ask for themselves.” That statement was entirely foreign to the record, had nothing whatsoever to do with the issue before the court, but manifestly was prompted and inspired by some religious leaders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> We know that the things that prevailed during the period of the Jewish nation were ensamples of what should come to pass at the present time, because the Scriptures so state. That which prevailed amongst the leaders of the Jews in the time that Christ was on earth, and when he was crucified, prevails today. In the time of Jeremiah, when the Lord through his prophet Jeremiah was warning the people of approaching disaster, the religious leaders amongst the Jews cried out: “Peace, peace”; ‘when there was no peace.’—Jer. 6:13-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2T</sup> The same religious leaders denied the message that God sent to the Jews by Jeremiah. They told the people that there was no impending danger, that Jerusalem would not fall. These false prophets said to the people: “Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine”; as it is written: ‘‘Then said I, Ah, Lord God! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place Then the Lord said unto me, The prophets prophe-y lies in my name; I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them; they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart. Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.” (Jer. 14:13-15) It is well to remember in this connection the words of the apostle Paul, to wit: “Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples; and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.”—1 Cor. 10: 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> The totalitarian state and the great religious leaders act together to suppress the message and messengers of The Theocratic Government because they see that, if The Theocratic Government succeeds, the totalitarian government cannot possibly continue to exist and hence the religious leadeis can no longer have anything to say about governments. God has emphatically declared that his kingdom shall not be left to men, that they shall have nothing to do with it: “And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.” (Dan. 2: 44) Necessarily it follows, then, that the rising of The Theocracy to complete power means the complete end of totalitarian and religious rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">” All who are not for The Theocracy are against it. Satan and his associate demons are leading the fight against The Theocracy. They have blinded all religionists and control the religious leaders and the totalitarian dictators. As Satan induced the religionists to oppose and speak against Christ Jesus and in favor of Caesar (the dictator), so now the same thing is repeated. The radical multitude, led by the religionists, went before Pilate (the totalitarian dictator) : “And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a king.”—Luke 23: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“When the religious leaders amongst the Jews were reminded that Christ Jesus was their King they cried out before Pilate: “We have no king but Caesar.” (John 19:15) Thus they voted for the totalitarian ruler as against Christ Jesus. Likewise today the big religious leaders, the counterpart of the Pharisees, declare themselves on the side of the totalitarian, dictator rulers. Jesus prophesied that exactly this condition would prevail, telling his followers that they would be opposed by the same religious element; and the facts prove the fulfillment of his prophetic words.—John 15:18-21.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>31</sup> Paul and his companions in the service of the Lord preached the Theocratic message, and the religionists haled Paul and his companions into court and said before the court: “These men ... do exceedingly trouble our city, and teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.” “And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.” (Acts 16: 20-22) Again the religionists of the Jews brought Paul and his companions before the ruler, and said: “These . . . have turned the world upside down, . . . and ... do contrary to the decrees of Csesar.” —Acts 17: 6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>31</sup> All these things are recorded in the Scriptures for the information of the faithful servants of Jehovah God now on earth, and it is to be expected that the present-day opponents of The Theocratic Government will treat Jehovah’s witnesses and companions in a like manner as they treated Jesus and his apostles. The indisputable facts are that similar action on the part of religionists is now being taken against Jehovah’s witnesses and companions in almost every part of “Christendom”. The religious leaders have convinced themselves, they must put down all persons who now advocate and advertise</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">The Theocratic Government under Christ Jesus. That is the only reason why there is such violent opposition to the message of the kingdom of God under Christ. This of itself is conclusive evidence that the religionists are under the influence and power of the demons, chief amongst whom is Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DELUSION</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>33</sup> The “man of sin”, “the son of perdition,” is composed of the religionists, their leaders and allies, including the “evil servant”, that is, those who were once in the truth and who have turned aside therefrom. All of these religionists oppose The Theocratic Government. Satan has overreached them, and under his influence and that of his associate demons such religionists have convinced themselves that they must suppress Jehovah’s witnesses and companions. Their apparent success in doing so is to them a sign or evidence that God is on their side and that therefore they are at peace with God. Thus God ‘sends them a strong delusion, that they should believe a lie’, exactly as it was in Haman’s case. (2 Thess. 2:11) The big religious leaders today profess to serve God, but are wholly given over to spiritism or idolatry; and concerning them it is written by the apostle under inspiration that God sends them a strong delusion ‘because they received not the love of the truth’. (2 Thess. 2:10-12) They love self, and hence cannot love the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>34</sup> Held under the'influence and power of the demons and being under a strong delusion, they conclude that God is on their side, and therefore have pushed on their campaign to suppress the Theocratic message and the messengers; and when they have, as they believe, accomplished that fact, then is the time they cry out “Peace and safety”. Thereby they mean that the religionists and totalitarian rulers are at peace with God and have suppressed the advocates of The Theocratic Government and that they, the religionists and allies, are enjoying peace and are safe from further hearing the sound concerning the doom of “Christendom”. They believe that they have put Jehovah’s witnesses and companions in a place where they can no longer do harm to the religionists and totalitarian rule. Their expression “Peace and safety” implies they have shut down completely on the freedom of action of Jehovah’s servants. Such was exactly the course of action taken against the apostles. There the religious leaders were against the apostles, and they induced the mob to act together with them against the apostles; and even the magistrates of the courts before whom they were being tried tore off their clothes in indignation, thus identifying themselves with the opponents of The Theocracy. Then they proceeded to put the apostles where they thought would be a place of safety. “They cast them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely.”—Acts 16: 20-23.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>85</sup> The action of the religionists against Jesus was in like manner. They concluded that they must silence him. They were not willing even to rest after he was crucified, but further made request of the totalitarian ruler that he make the tomb safe by putting a guard over it to keep Jesus from getting out. (Matt. 27: 64-66) What came to pass concerning Jesus and his faithful apostles constitutes a sure guide as to what shall come to pass upon the faithful witnesses of the great Theocracy of the present time, and especially just preceding the battle of that great day of God Almighty. We are in ..“the times and the seasons”, and the faithful are earnestly and diligently watching for the “sign”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>88</sup> When the faithful servants of Jehovah under the leadership of Christ Jesus see every avenue closed to them to actively and openly engage in advertising The Theocratic Government, and when the religious leaders and their totalitarian allies are saying “Peace and safety&quot;', that will be the sign that Armageddon, “the battle of that great day of God Almighty,” is just about to begin. Such will constitute the ‘signs of the times and season’ for the battle. Until that sign is apparent in every part of “Christendom”, and until every avenue is closed to the giving of testimony openly and boldly, the remnant and the “other sheep” of the Lord must continue to sound out the message of the great Theocrat and his government under Christ Jesus the King. This must be done to the name of Jehovah God and that those who are of good will might find the way of escape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENT CONDITIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">” It was in the year (A.D.) 1918 that Christ Jesus the King, having been enthroned by Jehovah God three and one-half years prior thereto, appeared at the temple and began judgment of the consecrated and of the nations. Of the consecrated, the approved ones were brought into the temple, anointed and commissioned, and formed into the Lord’s “faithful and wise servant”, to whom the Lord committed his kingdom interests and sent them forth to offer unto Jehovah an offering in righteousness. (Mal. 3:1-4; Matt. 24:45-47) The Lord gathered some more of his people and made them a part of the anointed class, and then afterwards began the gathering unto himself of his “other sheep”. (John 10:16) These latter ones have joined with the “remnant” to bear testimony concerning The Theocratic Government, and together they all say to the people of good will: ‘Come, partake of the water of life; flee unto Jehovah and his King.’ Before the Lord, the great Judge, the nations have been gathered, and the proclamation of the Theocratic message he has caused to be declared, and thus the Lord has invited the people and gathered unto himself his “other sheep”, who have identified themselves as supporters of The Theocratic Government, and has also caused the goats to don their garments identifying themselves as opponents of The Theocratic Government. What is the result? and what are the present-day conditions in the earth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>58</sup> The kingdom message has been declared throughout the land of “Christendom”. This has been done by the mouth of many witnesses and by the printed message in many languages widely distributed throughout the earth. More than 300 million books containing the Theocratic message, printed in upward of 78 languages, have been placed amongst the people for their information. The radio has been used to sound the Theocratic proclamation around the earth. Thousands of phonographs have reproduced the spoken message of the kingdom in the presence and hearing of millions of listeners; magazines and other papers numbering into many millions have been widely distributed amongst the people. Multitudes of the people have heard the message with gladness, even as the common people gladly heard the gracious words that fell from the lips of Christ Jesus. This message concerning Jehovah and his kingdom has magnified his name, proclaiming his majesty and his supremacy and the unchangeableness of his law, pointing out that he is the source of life and the only means of salvation. The faithful believers have declared themselves for Jehovah and his law, regardless of all opponents. They have delighted themselves in the Lord and have gladly identified themselves on the side of The Theocratic Government; and now with faith and full confidence in the Lord, and amidst great opposition and persecution, Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions together joyfully say: “My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.” (Ps. 13: 5) They know that their deliverance will come by Jehovah’s “hand”, which power shall be exercised by Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’’Jehovah has maneuvered the enemy and has made the goats identify themselves, and the great Judge has placed them on the side and in the place which Jehovah long ago provided for such. The religious leaders, always standing at the head of the “goat” class, are foremost in their opposition against The Theocracy. This is true because religion is Satan’s instrument used to deceive men and put them against Jehovah and his King. Christ Jesus, addressing himself to that class of religious goats that endeavor to draw human creatures into their snare, says: “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites ! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.’’-Matt. 23: 15.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>40</sup> These leaders have, by their practices carried on under the influence and power of the demons, succeeded in gathering many followers, and then, as Jesus says to those leaders of the “goat” class: “Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers. Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers! how can ye escape the damnation of hell?”—Matt. 23:32,33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>41</sup> Since 1926 the message of warning from Jehovah's Word telling of his purpose to destroy all opponents of The Theocracy has been sounded throughout “Christendom”. The religionists have heard the warning, but instead of giving heed thereto they have hardened their hearts against the great King and have taken their stand at the head of the “goat” class. In this the Roman Catholic Hierarchy are in the front line, and the Protestant religionists have blindly followed the lead of those of the Hierarchy. The sincere Catholics and sincere Protestants who love righteousness and who hate iniquity have fled from these religious organizations, and others likewise continue to flee therefrom and to identify themselves as on the side of Christ, the King of the great Theocratic Government. All who have thus fled to Christ are now being bitterly opposed by the religious leaders. Thus the division is clearly made between the “sheep” and the “goats”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>42</sup> Totalitarian rulers are all against Jehovah God, and have ever been against him. Nimrod, under the command of Satan, took the lead in religious organizations, and all other totalitarian rulers have followed that lead and have adopted and practiced, and continue to practice, some kind of Devil religion. The totalitarian rulers of Russia have excluded the followers of Christ Jesus and supporters of The Theocracy and closed that land to all persons who bear testimony to the name of Jehovah God. The totalitarian Nazi regime has killed many and imprisoned thousands of others of faithful servants and supporters of The Theocratic Government and has suppressed the proclamation of the message of God’s kingdom under Christ. The dictator of Germany has brought forth a religion which he has attempted to force upon the people, and which openly denies Jehovah God and Christ. In all of this wicked persecution and opposition to the Lord’s kingdom the totalitarian governments have the support, aid and comfort of the great religious organization in the earth. The “corporate state” or totalitarian rule of Italy has made it next to impossible for anyone to bear testimony there to the name of The Theocratic Government, and in this he has had the unstinted support and co-operation of the head of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>43</sup> The great religious organization, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and the totalitarian, political rulers, have now succeeded in suppressing the proclamation of the kingdom message throughout the lands of Spain, Portugal, France, Belgium, Rumania, Greece, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the Baltic states, Finland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, in fact all of continental Europe. Added to these nations are many islands of the sea, Japan, Quebec, and other places. Only a few places now remain where the message of The Theocratic Government can be proclaimed. This is not because God is not all-powerful, but because he is permitting the enemy to carry out exactly what He foretold centuries ago.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>44</sup> The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, operating what they call “Catholic Action”, and using their publications and others of the public press, without a single exception advocate the destruction of Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions and their work of bearing testimony to The Theocratic Government. Strenuous efforts are daily put into operation throughout the/United States to stop the proclamation of the Theocratic message. Magistrates, judges of trial courts, and appellate courts ignore the decisions of the highest court of the land and find some way to arrest and imprison the faithful followers of Christ Jesus who tell the people that Jehovah’s government is the only means of deliverance and salvation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>45</sup> When the religionists and their totalitarian allies have fully succeeded in suppressing the theocratic message throughout the English-speaking part of the earth, then, it is to be expected, the religious leaders will cry out, “Peace and safety.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHO SAFE?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>40</sup> The religious, totalitarian alliance are trying to convince themselves even that they are safe and that no destruction shall come upon them. Knowing the end from the beginning, Jehovah God, through his prophet, long ago foretold what they would do and what they would say, to wit: “We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us; for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves.” In answer thereto Jehovah says: “Your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.”—Isa. 28:15,18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>41</sup> Only those persons who are wholly devoted to Jehovah and his government under Christ Jesus and who stand firm and steadfast in their support of The Theocratic Government will be safe. Concerning the faithful remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses it is written that such have been “caug'ht up together . . . with the Lord” in the temple and there they are made to dwell in safety in “the secret place of the Most High”, where no harm or evil shall befall them. (1 Thess. 4:17) Note the precious promises which Jehovah God gives unto such faithful ones, and which promises are recorded in the following texts, to wit: “And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land; and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods. And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make them afraid.” (Ezek. 34; 25, 28) (See also Zechariah 14: 11; Jeremiah 23: 6; 32:37; 33:16.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>48</sup> The Lord's “other sheep” have fled to The Theocracy, and there they have the promise of being hid and kept in safety until the wrath of God is passed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4S</sup> All the evidence tends to prove that Armageddon is very near. Let those who fully trust in Jehovah and his King remain calm, steadfast, and faithful. The “sign” is certain to be made manifest in the near future. The religionists and their political supporters will then be saying, “Peace and safety,” and will try to make themselves believe that they are in safety and at peace. Then what?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(To be continued)</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark9"></a>HOW MESSIAH COMES</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">H</span><span class="font3">AS he comet If so, where is he? Do not scoff at such questions! “Messiah” means “Anointed”. Three hundred years before Christ the Seventy who translated the Greek Septuagint Version of the Hebrew scriptures used the word “Christ” as equivalent for “Messiah”. (Leviticus 4: 5) Messiah was to be a ruler, a prince. The angel Gabriel said to the prophet Daniel: “From the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks: . . . And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself.” (Daniel 9: 25, 26) Over five hundred years later a joyful Jew said to his brother Simon: “We have found the Messias”; “which is, being interpreted, the Christ.” (John 1:41) Shortly thereafter a despised Samaritan woman said to him: “I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.” The man whom she addressed said to her: “I that speak unto thee am he.” (John 4:25,26) Shortly thereafter that one called “Messiah” or “Christ” was cut off violently in death, but not for any crime of his own. As the Jewish high priest that same year said to his fellow priests: “It is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.”—John 11: 49, 50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Simon Peter was one of the disciples of Jesus who was called Messiah or Christ. He was a Jew who served the law of Moses. At the feast of weeks, or Pentecost, about fifty days after the Passover at which time Jesus was slain, Peter and the other disciples were waiting at Jerusalem; and at that time the prophecy of Joel 2: 28,29 was fulfilled in miniature by the outpouring of God’s holy spirit upon those disciples. Peter, as a competent witness, marks the fulfillment of the prophecy and then proceeds to testify; and his testimony definitely identifies the Redeemer and Messiah, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>,r</sup>Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day. Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, He would raise up Christ [Messiah] to sit on his throne; he, seeing this before, spake of the resurrection of Christ [Messiah], that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption. This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses. Therefore, being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the holy [spirit], he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear. For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font3"> [Jehovah] said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thy foes thy footstool. Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ [Messiah].”—Acts of the Apostles 2:29-36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The book of the Bible known as The Revelation is the revelation of Jesus Christ which he gave to John after Ilia heavenly glorification. He concludes it by stating: “He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly ” To this John replies: “Even so, come, Lord Jesus”-—Rev. 22:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That Jehovah God is to have a Theocratic Government of righteousness, that Jesus Christ is to be the great King of that kingdom, and that he is coming a second time for the purpose of thus reigning, is so abundantly established by the inspired sacred Scriptures that all possible doubt is removed. An important question, therefore, for us to determine is how he comes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many have supposed and yet suppose that the Lord will come again in his body of humiliation, the very body in which he was crucified and which had the marks upon it, and that such is to be visible to human eyes. The words of Jesus himself disprove that conclusion When instructing his disciples just before his death, Jesus said • “Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also” (John 14:19) Thus he establishes the fact that his faithful disciples will see him </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">as he</span><span class="font3"> is, but that the world of mankind will see him no more. And why is this true? Again the apostle Peter answers: “Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God ; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">in the spirit ” </span><span class="font3">(1 Pet 3-18, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font3"> Jesus was raised from the dead not a human, but a spirit, with a spirit organism, a divine person immortal. He now has a glorious body, which no man has seen or can look upon and live, because now Christ Jesus is the brightness of God’s glory and the “express image of his person”. (Heb. 1: 2, 3; 1 Tim. 6: 15,16) An examination of all the Scriptural evidence shows that no one of the different organisms or bodies in which Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection from the dead was his glorious body, but such bodies were created by him for the purpose of appearing to his still human disciples at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus was put to death a human; he was raised from the dead a spirit, “a life-giving spirit.” (1 Cor. 15: 45, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.; </span><span class="font3">1 Pet. 3: 18) The apostle John definitely shows that the body in which Jesus will appear is not his human body, because he says to his fellow Christians: “Beloved, now are we the sons of God; and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him : for we shall see him as he is.” (1 John 3: 2) Jesus is no longer human, but divine; therefore human eyes could not see him. He is now the express image of Jehovah God. Because he is no longer human and has not a body of flesh, but a spirit body, the apostle Paul under inspiration wrote: “Though we have .known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him [so] no more.”—2 Cor. 5:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After his resurrection Jesus was exalted and given a name above every name, and sat down at the right hand of the Father in glory and power, “angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.” (Phil. 2: 9-11; Rev. 3; 21; 1 Pet. 3:22) Of him the apostle Paul writes: “Now the Lord is that Spirit.” (2 Cor. 3:17) At the time of his baptism in the Jordan river and the descent of the spirit under the outward form of a dove upon him Jesus was begotten of the spirit of Jehovah God his Father; “and, lo, a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.” (Matt. 3:17) Thereafter Jesus explained to the Jewish ruler Nicodemus concerning a spirit, saying: “Except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and. that which is born of the spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth ■ so is every one that is born of the spirit.” (John 3:5-8) “So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest, but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.”— Heb 5: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Satan the Devil is a spirit. For many centuries he has been the “god of this world”, the invisible ruler of “this present evil world” (2 Cor. 4:4; Gal. 1:4); yet no human eyes have seen Satan, although men have felt his influence and still feel it. (Rev. 12:12) Not only is Satan the god of this world, but he is the chief one of his wicked organization of demons, which is invisible and which is called “the heavens . . . which are now” (2 Pet. 3:7), the same being composed of Satan and the other fallen angels or demons who exercise power over humans. The apostle Peter, speaking concerning Jehovah’s purpose, said: “We, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” (2 Pet. 3:13) John, writing of “things which must shortly come to pass”, said: “And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away.” (Rev. 21:1) The Theocratic Government of Jehovah by Christ Jesus is the new heavenly kingdom. This new ruling power, the Messiah, is invisible, and will be invisible to human eyes, but will establish in the earth visible representatives of his government of righteousness, to wit, the resurrected faithful prophets and witnesses who preceded Christ Jesus and whom he will “make princes in all the earth”. (Heb. 11: 35; Ps. 45:16; Isa. 32:1) None, therefore, should expect the Lord’s second coming to be in a body visible to human eyes, but should expect that he would be present, exercising his power in his own sovereign way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus a spirit may be present with human creatures and yet be unobserved. Before his death Jesus said to his disciples : “Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live alsQ.” This is proof conclusive that only those who are “changed” from human to spirit in the resurrection will ever see the Lord Jesus in his glorious body. This does not mean, however, that the world will not </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">discern</span><span class="font3"> his presence and observe the operation of his just and righteous power. As it is written: “Behold, he cometh with clouds [of the storm of Armageddon] ; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.”—Rev. 1: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No man has ever seen the Devil, but every man has had some experience with the Devil and felt the influence of his unrighteous power. No man has seen or can see God; yet God is the great Giver of every thing that is good, and exercises his power in behalf of his creatures. In God’s due time “every eye” will discern the presence of Christ Jesus, but only those who partake of the spirit resurrection will “see him as he is”. Such ones are “sown a natural body”, and “raised a spiritual body”. (1 John 3: 2 ; 1 Cor. 15-44) All members of the spirit-begotten “new creation” will be with the Lord ultimately in heaven; therefore they will see him as he is, because they will be like him. (2 Pet. 1:4) To his apostles, who form a part of the new creation, Jesus said: “I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.”—John 14:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is manifest from these scriptures, and in the light of reason, that the second coming of the Lord does not mean that he appears as a man and walks about amidst the people as he did when he was on earth as a man. His second coming or presence has to do with the affairs of men, which he takes charge of and will control for the good of mankind. As Satan the Devil has been the invisible overlord of the world for many centuries, even so Christ shall be the invisible Overlord of the-new world after ousting Satan; and although invisible to human eyes Christ Jesus shall control the affairs of the new world, which will be the organization of mankind under the Theocratic Government of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In many places in the Authorized Version Bible referring to the second coming of the Lord the word in the original Greek text translated “coming” in English is properly translated “presence”. This Greek word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">parousia</span><span class="font3"> (pronounced par-oo-see'-ah) means presence and refers to the invisible presence of the Lord. It is used in the following Bible texts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[parousia;</span><span class="font3"> presence], and of the end of the world.”—Matt. 24: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“As the days of No'e were, so shall also the coming [presence] of the Son of man be.”—Matt. 24: 37, 39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Even so in Christ shall all be made alive But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming [presence].”—1 Cor, 15: 22, 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Are not even ye, before our Lord Jesus at his coming [presence]?”—1 Thess. 2:19, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">American Revised Version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“To the end he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming [presence] of our Lord Jesus Christ.”—1 Thess. 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“We which are alive, and remain unto the coming [presence] of the Lord, shall not prevent them which are asleep. . . . The dead in Christ shall rise first.”—1 Thess. 4:15,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“I pray God your [the church’s] whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming [presence] of our Lord Jesus Christ.”—1 Thess. 5: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Now we beseech you, brethren, by, the coming [presence] of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him.”—2 Thess. 2:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming [presence] of the Lord . . . for the coming [presence] of the Lord draweth nigh.”—Jas. 5: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“There shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, and saying, Where is the promise of his coming [presence] </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">1”—</span><span class="font3">2 Pet. 3:3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Paul, exhorting the Christians to faithfulness, wrote: “Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">presence</span><span class="font3"> [parousia] only, but now much more in my absence [apoiwia], work out your own salvation with fear and<sup>1</sup> trembling.” (Phil. 2:12) “For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">presence </span><span class="font3">[parousio] is weak, and his speech contemptible.”—2 Cor. 10:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Jesus ascended on high forty days after his resurrection and his disciples stood gazing upward as he disappeared, the angel of the Lord standing by said to them: “This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner [not, in like body] as ye have seen him go into heaven.” (Acts 1:11) The emphasis here must be on the words “in like manner”. It was only a small number of people who saw the Lord ascend. It is only a small number who discern his presence for some time after his return until the battle of Armageddon. The manner of his going or being taken away was quiet, without observation, except by a few, and the testimony of these witnesses was preserved to prove that he did' ascend on high. His return is also quiet and unobserved by the eyes of the world. Those watching for his coming would necessarily be the first to observe his invisible presence. This is in exact harmony with what the apostle Paul wrote: “For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.” (1 Thess. 5r2; see also 2 Peter 3:10; Revelation 16:15; 3: 3; and Matthew 24: 43) A thief comes usually in the night-time when all are asleep, and none see him except those who are watching or those who may be awakened by his presence. Even so the Lord comes in the night-time of the end of Satan’s world, just before the dawn of the new day; and none discern his presence except those who watch and who have the eye of faith enlightened by God’s fulfilled Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Concerning his coming Jesus warned his followers that false teachers would arise and attempt to show that Christ is in the desert or in the secret chambers, as spiritists claim they have come in contact with him; but that his followers should give no heed to such advice. “For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west, so shall also the coming [parousta] of the Son of man be.”— Matt. 24:26, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus’ words cannot mean that zigzag lightning comes always out of the east and shines unto the west and that this represents his coming. What his words really mean is that the lightnings come or appear in one part of the heavens and are seen by persons at different points and that therefore the lightning is not confined to a local place. It is seen by those who are watching. The’statement recorded by Luke concerning the same thing supports this view: “For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven ; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.”—Luke W: 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Lightning originates with Jehovah, says Jeremiah 10:13. Just so all light upon the divine purpose originates with Jehovah. When he reveals his light to his anointed church he does so through the Head of his organization, Christ Jesus. No human is able to make lightning. Likewise no human is able to point to the fact that Christ Jesus is at some local spot on earth. His presence is revealed to those of God’s anointed remnant and their earthly companions of good will, all of whom look for the manifestation of his presence. In Matthew 24:27, “coming” specifically refers to his coming to the temple and his presence there for judgment of the “house of God”, which house is composed of God’s anointed and faithful ones and is not a material house of brick, wood or stone. (Mal. 3:1-3; 1 Pet. 4:17) Then Christ Jesus judges and disposes of the professed house of God, “organized religion” of “Christendom”, which is in fact a part of the Devil’s organization. That judgment is now in progress, which proves that the Lord has come and is at the temple. The coming of the Lord to his temple is soon to be followed by a time of great distress upon earth, culminating in Armageddon, which will destroy Satan’s organization.—See Revelation 16: 15,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Will Jesus be bodily present at the earth at that battle of Armageddon? It would be presumptuous positively to say one way or another, because we do not know. That he could be bodily present and directing the fight at the earth is certain, and it is also certain that he could direct it from heaven. If a general can direct other soldiers and be within fifty yards of them, surely Christ Jesus with unlimited power could direct his faithful angelic host regardless of space. He can manifest his presence in all parts of the earth, whether his glorious body be in heaven or at the earth. Armageddon is God’s fight. Christ Jesus will be the chief One in that battle leading Jehovah’s hosts. It is hardly reasonable to conclude that Jehovah will leave his throne in heaven and come to earth during that great battle. The same argument must be true with reference to Jesus. Armageddon will bring knowledge to all creation that Jehovah is God and Jesus is King of kings. The people of earth will not see Christ Jesus with human eyes; yet they will discern his presence because there will be a great demonstration of power, causing many to mourn.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark11"></a>BITTERNESS AGAINST RELIGION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9">R</span><span class="font3">ELIGIONISTS of the Roman Empire caused the aged man John to be banished to that Devil’s Island of ancient times, Patmos. And why? The exile himself tells his brethren: “I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God [Jehovah], and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.” (Rev. 1:9) It was because John was an active witness of Jehovah. Therefore John pictured the remnant of Jehovah’s anointed witnesses on earth today. The apocalyptic vision of “things which must shortly come to pass” which was given in symbol to John is now being fulfilled, and the modern-day John class see the fulfillment of the vision and, like John of old, bear witness thereto. John’s exile on the prison isle did not put a finish to his witnessing; neither did the World War persecutions culminating in A.D. 1918 write the finis to the witnessing of Jehovah’s servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Christ Jesus, “The Faithful and True Witness,” is Jehovah’s chief angel or deputy who is sent in due time to Jehovah’s spiritual temple. Malachi 3:1 foretold this event: “Behold I send my angel, and he shall prepare the way before my face. And presently the Lord, whom you seek, and the angel of the testament, whom you desire, shall come to his temple. Behold he cometh, saitli the Lord of hosts.” (Catholic </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Douay Version)</span><span class="font3"> The apostle John describes the coming of this mighty Deputy of Jehovah God thus: “And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillais of fire: and he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth, and cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: . . . And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever [Jehovah], who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time [delay] no longer”—Rev 10:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The vision discloses Christ Jesus, the mighty angel, with the “little book open” in his hand, and John (picturing Jehovah’s servant class) heard a voice: “And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth.” (Rev. 10:8) The “little book” manifestly is the revelation cf God’s will and purposes concerning his people. John the servant of the Lord responded: “And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make tiiy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.” (Verse 9) Thus the modern-day John or servant class are shown going to the Lord at his temple and asking for the book, which is delivered to them and they are told to “eat it”. The eating would signify the building up of their mind by acquiring a knowledge of Jehovah’s purpose concerning his Theocratic Government and against the enemies thereof, and by their performance of the privileges of service that would come to them by virtue of receiving that knowledge.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3">The Head of God’s servant class, Christ Jesus, now speaks for Jehovah, and therefore it was a voice from heaven, and he says to God’s people: “Gather yourselves unto me, ye my men of lovingkindness, who have solemnized my covenant over sacrifice.” (Ps. 50: 5, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham)</span><span class="font3"> At the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple in A.D. 1918 the time had come for the remnant class to receive the official portfolio of service which is outlined in the volume of the “little book”. They must now take this book and eat it, and thereby learn God’s purposes concerning them. They must now organize for service, and this they began to do in A.D. 1919.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By his prophet Ezekiel God had said: “Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house [‘Christendom’] : open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee. . . . Eat that thou findest: eat this roll [volume or book], and go speak unto the house of Israel [all spiritual Israelites and those professing to be such]. So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.” (Ezek. 2:8-10; 3: 1,2) This is undoubtedly addressed prophetically to God’s faithful people now on earth. As pictured at Revelation 3:20, the Lord Jesus knocked at the dcoe and those composing the servant class on earth opened and asked for service as witnesses of Jehovah and it was given to them. (Matt. 7 : 7) The “little book” which John saw held in the hand of the angel, being the same as the “roll” described by the prophet Ezekiel, is or contains the purposes of Jehovah, which have long been a secret or mystery, which mystery is now finished and is being made known to his faithful people. (Rev. 10:7) Their eating of that little book or roll is the revelation of Jehovah’s hidden purpbses to them, making known to the faithful ones what God requires them to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">John (the servant ciass) ate the little book as commanded, and of this he writes: “And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.” (Rev. 10:10,11) (See also Ezekiel 3:3-7.) The servant class were hungry for more spiritual food as a result of the World War experiences, and every bit of the food received was sweet, and is sweet, to them “To the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.” (Prov. 27.7) The bitterness has purgative properties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Coming to his temple, the Lord enlightened the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses by feeding them upon the Word of truth, and this was sweet to tliem. But, as The Revelation foretold, it becomes bitter to the belly. It fills God’s servant class with bitter indignation against Satan’s organization, the visible part thereof on earth being composed of religion, commercialism and politics. The faithful servant class, by eating the “little book” or “roll”, receive heavenly wisdom, which is sweet to them. The heavenly Father’s admonition to his house of sons is: “My son, eat thou honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste: so shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul: when tb.ou hast found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off.” (Prov. 24:13,14) Thus it is thov.n that the eating of this book blings know’edge and heavenly wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Properly received, this knowledge has a purgative or purifying effect. The Lord Jesus, on coming to the temple, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">254</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">sits in judgment there to purge those in line for service at the temple, that is, to “purify the sons of Levi”, to the end that these approved might offer an acceptable sacrifice unto God. (Mal. 3:2,3) No longer would these faithful ones make “their belly” or selfishness their god. (See Philip-pians 3:19; Romans 16: 18.) Seeing their privileges, they become wholly and completely devoted to God and to his service, and the prophet has put in their mouths the words: “How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth<sup>1</sup>” (Ps 119:103) “Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, 0 Lord God [Jehovah] of hosts.”—Jer. 15:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The knowledge and heavenly wisdom received from feeding on God’s revealed purposes disclosed to the faithful ones that they were commissioned to go forth as God’s witnesses They came to know what Satan had been doing and is doing by and through his agencies, particularly the religionists under the lead of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and this caused them to be righteously indignant. Jeremiah 15: 17 foretold this: “I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone, because of thy hand; for thou hast filled me with indignation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The bitter indignation, however, did not at all take away the sweetness and the joy of serving the Lord. This knowledge and wisdom disclosed to the servant class their privilege of going forth as God’s witnesses. Doing so in obedience to the Lord’s commandments has brought bitter trials upon them; but in such tribulation they rejoice, because such is an evidence or proof of God’s approval. “And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience ; and patience, experience ; and experience, hope; and hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy [spirit], which is given unto us.” (Rom. 5:3-5) These witnesses rejoice to have a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name under any and all conditions that the Lord is pleased to have eome to pass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To the “faithful servant” class the Lord Jehovah says: “I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.” (Isa. 51:16) The message of the Lord he puts in the mouth of his “servant” not merely to feed upon for his own benefit, but that it might be used in accordance with God’s commandments by proclaiming it to others. Jehovah made a prophetic example with the prophet Ezekiel, who says: “Moreover, he said unto me. Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel. So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll. And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat. and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.” (Ezek. 3:1-3) These words picture the Lord’s faithful people who were hungry for a further revelation of his Word, whom the Lord Jesus began to feed when he came to the temple of God. It took some time to fill them up and for them to digest the food before they were ready for the fight against religion or demonism, and when the time came they were made strong in the Lord and went forth in obedience to his commandments. Thus is shown God’s provision for and his preparation of his people for a campaign that shortly thereafter began, and that is now in progress, the purpose of which is to proclaim Jehovah’s name, and his King and Theocratic Government, and to announce the day of God's vengeance against the enemy at the battle of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From A D. 1918 to the fall of 1919 Jehovah’s servant class was in exile, and therefore in silence as respects the bold and fearless public proclamation of Jehovah’s kingdom by Christ Jesus. This was symbolized by John on the isle of Patmos. The servant class must be released from such exile in order to carry out the commandments prophesied by Jesus concerning the preaching of “this gospel of the kingdom”. (Matt. 24:14) Such release came in 1919. Hence the servant class, pictured by John, is told: “Thou must prophesy again before [or, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(lioth.</span><span class="font3">) against| many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.” (Rev 10-11) The indisputable facts show that from and after A D. 1919 marks the beginning and carrying forward of the witness work which was foreshadowed by the fearless testimony work of the prophet Elisha. (1 Ki. 19:16-19 ; 2 Ki 6 : 12-22) Until the year 1922 the organization of the Theocratic ambassadors of Jehovah was progressing and the work was going forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In 1922 the Lord’s remnant of faithful witnesses were permitted to have an understanding of Isaiah’s prophecy, chapter six, wherein Jehovah, as represented by his mighty Angel, Christ Jesus, is discerned in his temple, and then it was clearly seen by the remnant that there must thereafter be a great witness work concerning God’s kingdom by Christ Jesus, The Theocracy. In that prophetic picture Isaiah represents the Lord’s remnant or servant class, and concerning the witness work that is to be done the servant asks the question: “How long?” And he is answered: “Until the cities [of the modern unfaithful Jerusalem, or ‘Christendom’] be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate ” (Isaiah 6: 11) The prophet Isaiah himself did not live to see the destruction of the city of Jerusalem back there, therefore these prophetic words of the Lord must apply to God’s servant class whom Isaiah pictured, and this proves that the servant class must continue and the witness to the name of Jehovah must go on until Armageddon, when the modern unfaithful Jerusalem, or “Christendom”, shall be destroyed and the name of Jehovah shall be completely \ indicated This should not only encourage, but thrill the servant class of Jehovah God to go faithfully on with the work until 11 is due time to finish it. Also, in these last days, Jehovah hies given the servant class a great multitude of “companions” in that work, to wit, the earthly people of good will, the Lord’s “other sheep”, whom Christ Jesus the Good Shepherd now gathers to the Lord’s fold ; and, together, all these have risen up in battle against the enemy organization of religion or demonism. When Jehovah’s people sec the hideousness and wickedness of Satan’s organization these go in the heat of the spirit and with bitterness against the enemy, because the enemy is God’s enemy. Such is not a malicious hatred, of course, but is a sincere and earnest desire to see the enemy and his organization destroyed that Jehovah’s name might be exalted.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">“This was the largest and best-organized zone assembly we have had to date in this zone. Witnesses from outside companies responded well to the street work with the magazines.

Pressure was brought upon the police, and they did all they could in endeavor to have us cease our work on the streets. The sergeant of the police even came up to the hall where we met about 3:30 and asked us to call in the folks off the streets or they would arrest them. The police were told we were within our rights and if they wished to arrest us they would have to take the responsibility. The sergeant happened to be one of the ‘big shots’ in the Knights of Columbus of Yakima, so he did his best to bluff us.

<p><span class="font3">A company servant writes: “Send me 7 application blanks for pioneer service, as there are 5 or 6 more that will want to become pioneers and will be ready by the time we get the blanks. Sunday and Monday we made arrangements to start 14 Model Study meetings in two of the 172 islands of San Juan county, and from 2 to 8 attend each study. Some followed some of the workers a whole block with tears in their eyes, they were so glad we were going to start study where they could attend. We asked some if they would take their cars and pick up others and take them to study, and not one but said he would. This will make 14 pioneers from our little company [of 50 publishers] in two years. In one town the mayor came and told us we would have to stop our sound-car because it was disturbing the people. I asked for name and address of the one making complaint, so we could make a record of why we had to stop. A blank look came on his face. Then he shouted: ‘My wife, for one I’ My answer was: ‘Your wife cannot hear this; we are too far away.’ Then he shouted: ‘You stop this machine or I will get the police and have you arrested!’ and away he went. The witness helping me with sound-car, putting on records, said: ‘Shall I put this one on?’ ‘Sure!’ We kept right on, and we never saw mayor or policeman any more at all. . . . Who said, ‘Where are the great multitude’? Twelve of these 14 pioneers are Jonadabs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WATCHTOWER SLOGANS VS. RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCEMENTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Two publishers for The Theocracy on a street corner, magazines in hand. Near by a Salvation Army worker with the ‘War Cry’ magazine. He read the sign advertising </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> and in a dull voice said, ‘War fry' War Cry!’ Then a joyful voice by one of the publishers: ‘Read about The Theocracy, The Government of Peace!’ ‘War Cry! War Cry!’ with his face getting red. Then the next joyous voice: ‘Read </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower;</span><span class="font3"> learn about the snare'of religion; uncensored news; 5 cents a copy!’ ‘I’ll take one,’ saith the Salvation Army man. Soundear goes down the street announcing the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> magazine, to aid the publishers on the street. Two nuns on hearing turned to look at each other so quickly they almost bumped heads.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BUSINESS MEN'S ROUTE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Minnesota: “In carrying on the street distribution of the magazines I have as I went up and down the street or around the block stopped in at those business places where there were no customers waiting and placed a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font3">or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> with the head of the business, and this has resulted in a number of placements. So am passing this information on, thinking that some of the publishers may have overlooked this additional opportunity to distribute the magazines. It would seem to me that those publishers who are assigned business blocks or streets for work each Saturday could work up a business route in their individual blocks as well as take care of the street distribution.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A pioneer (London, England) writes: “I was wearing my magazine bag and carrying my phonograph. I stopped outside a hairdressing salon to see if there was a private way to flats above the shop. A man came out of the salon, looked at the magazine bag, and came over to me. He asked if I had a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower.</span><span class="font3"> I showed him the magazine and told him about the subscription. He took out 6/-, took the subscription offer, and away he went. I learned he had previously had a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> copy off the pavement witnessing and that he had enjoyed it. A back-call has been arranged.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SOFT ANSWER TURNS AWAY WRATH ON A BACK-CALL</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“A man answered the door. After I had told him my mission, he became furious and started using slanderous language, stating we were Communists, traitors, Nazis, and worse than rats; further, we should be kicked out of the country. He then enumerated various newspapers from which he had read the Supreme Court’s decision and stated that any man that would not salute the American flag should be killed or kicked out. There was murder in his eyes, and he proceeded to kick me out I asked the man to be gracious and permit me to explain why our people will not salute a flag. He stated he was going to go into the house and bring a flag, and if I refused to salute, he would kill me. By Jehovah’s grace, I started to explain the reason why Jehovah’s witnesses would not salute was that they had covenanted to do Jehovah’s will and consecrated their life to the Most High, and if they would violate their covenant with Jehovah it would mean eternal death After spending almost an hour with the man, explaining to him how Daniel and the faithful Hebrews refused to bow down, before I was through with the man he subscribed for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font3">and he changed his attitude. I promised to call back.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FROM A GOOD-WILL NAME FROM THE SOCIETY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Several weeks ago I called and arranged for a Model Study, and had three. Then invited those attending to go into service with me. Eight went out that day. Then we took steps to start a company in that town The zone servant was called in and it resulted in a company of twelve publishers. That was some time ago. Several days ago I was back in the town and called on a publisher. She said she was considering the ‘Pioneers’ article in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant. </span><span class="font3">Another publisher said his family of five were going to be immersed at our zone assembly, as they were all serving Jehovah and his King Christ Jesus. All this from an interested person and a ‘Good Will’ slip from the Society.”</span></p>

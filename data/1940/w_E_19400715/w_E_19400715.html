<p><span class="font3">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH Is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam's wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world ; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege It is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and Is proceeding to the establishment of God's kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">This midsummer testimony period during the entire month of August follows closely the Theocratic convention at Columbus. The period being named “Religion’s Doom”, the testimony activities should receive particular stimulation from the convention’s nationwide public address on “Religion as a World Remedy”. Appropriately, therefore, all Kingdom publishers will offer to the public, on a 25c contribution, the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies</span><span class="font3"> and a self-covered booklet, preferably the new booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees,</span><span class="font3"> if the territory has recently been intensively witnessed to with the latest book, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation. </span><span class="font3">Conventioners and people of good will everywhere are invited to share in this testimony. Arrange for this now through the local organized company of Jehovah’s witnesses. If not yet associated with such, write us for references. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Informant</span><span class="font3"> supplies full details. A complete report on each publisher’s field service for August should be submitted, to compile the total results.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">VACATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The annual vacation period of the members of the Bethel family at Brooklyn this year is from Saturday, July 20, to Sunday, August 4, inclusive. This will allow them a diversion from their regular activities at headquarters, and especially to avail themselves of the privileges of the 1940 Theocratic Convention of Jehovah’s witnesses and of the increasing opportunities for field witnessing. The normal operations of the factory and office will be suspended for that period; no books will be shipped or regular mail answered. Hence all field publishers should order sufficiently in advance that their supplies of literature to carry them through the vacation period and to the end of August may be shipped out not later than the evening of Friday, July 19 Also reserve your correspondence with the factory and office until after Monday, August 5.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘ And he (nought foith his people with joy, and hts chosen with gladness.”—Ps. 105:43.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font11">J</span><span class="font6">EHOVAH never fails those who delight to do his w ill Obedience is always rewarded with joy. In the concluding part of the prophecy of Zephaniah Jehovah puts this song of gladness upon the lips of his faithful sen ants. All who are of Zion he bids to sing out boldly. The &quot;iemnant”, together with the sti angers&quot;, that is, those who will form the “great multitude<sup>-</sup>’, he commands to shout aloud his praises. He has lifted his adverse judgment off the faithful, restored spiritual Israelites, the remnant; he has cleared out from them the hypocritical enemies and made his own faithful servant to stand out separate and distinct from all who practice religion. The faithful, appreciating the presence of the Lord at the temple* and that the great Theocrat is blessing and guiding those who maintain their integrity toward him, have full confidence that the Lord is shielding them from the assaults of the enemy and therefore that they have every reason to rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">- The prophecy shows that the violent opposition to The Theocratic Government will soon come to an all-time high point; and concerning this Jehovah bids hb faithful witnesses and all who are of good will tow ard him to cast away all fear of men and demons. He commands that fear must not paralyze them or cause them to slack their hands in the kingdom service To stiengthen Ins people Jehovah assures them that he is with them and will fully deliver them from the enemy. He makes them know that he is pleased with their faithfulness and those who maintain integrity shall be forever blessed. This full assurance causes the servants of Jehovah to sing for joy. No more shall the faithful halt between two opinions. They are blind to everything but The Theocratic Government, and hence they rejoice in declaring the name of the Most High, regardless of all opposition. They are certain to share in the victory of the Lord. Jehovah gives his Word that he will save his people; and therefore they fully trust him and will rejoice in his salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">TIME FOR REJOICING</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> By many of the prophecies Jehovah shows his faithful servants that the present is the time for re</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">joicing, and therefore he says to them: “Sing, 0 daughter of Zion; shout, 0 Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, 0 daughter of Jerusalem” (Zeph. 3:14) One of the emphatic and encouraging dramas was enacted when the Israelites under the commandment of Jehoshaphat marched out from Jerusalem to face the combined armies of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, which armies had conspired to destroy the Israelites. (2 Chron. 20:22) That prophetic picture finds its final fulfillment upon the spiritual Israelites. The visible part of Jehovah’s organization Zion, pictured by his “woman”, are those of the “remnant”, the “daughter” of Jehovah and his organization. According to Young’s translation the text from Isaiah 12:6 reads: “Cry aloud and sing, 0 inhabitant </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[(Roth.)</span><span class="font6"> inhabitress] of Zion ; for great in thy midst is the Holy One of Israel!” It is the time when the members of Christ’s body, the 144,000, both those in heaven and those on the earth, must together sing the new song unto Jehovah. (Rev. 14:1-3; Ps. 149:1,2) All the people of good will, and who therefore see and who delight to support The Theocratic Government, must join in that song of praise: “Sing unto the Lord a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof. Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar doth inhabit; let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains. Let them give glory unto the Lord, and declare his praise in the islands.”—Isa. 42:10-12.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> When the remnant discerned that Christ Jesus is at the temple the song began: “Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem; behold, thy King cometh unto thee; he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.”—Zech. 9: 9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup> This message is directed to the real followers of Christ, the faithful of Jerusalem, and not to those who are of the religious, political, unfaithful crowd, as stated in Zephaniah 3:1. The time for sanctimonious appearance and gloominess is past. (Isa. 58: 3-5; Zech. 7:3-7) The faithful now have a deep </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">211</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">and genuine joy. They rejoice because they see that the vindication of Jehovah’s name is certain to be accomplished in the near future. That was the joy of the Lord, and such joy is the strength of the remnant. They see that The Theocratic Government of righteousness is come and that now they will rejoice for evermore. (1 Thess. 5: 16) Such is the ‘time of restitution of all things’ pertaining to The Theocratic Government under Christ. It is the ‘time of refreshing’ and calls for great rejoicing on the part of all those who love the Theocrat and his government. (Acts 3: 19-21) Exactly the opposite is the condition of big religionists, that is, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and allies, the antitype of Tyre, who is singing as a harlot, and who now sings the seductive song to inveigle others into her trap. To the harlot and allies Jehovah says: “Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed virgin [because she is violated by her illicit relations with political and commercial fornicators], daughter of Zidon; arise, pass over to Chittim; there also shalt thou have no rest.” —Isa. 23: 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ Since 1922 the remnant, under the command of the Lord Jesus, began to carry on an aggressive publication of The Theocratic Government, and that has brought no joy whatsoever to religionists, and never again shall religionists have rest or joy. God’s message of truth burns and torments the religious system. Their religious susceptibilities are shocked by reason of the proclamation of the kingdom message, and they heap greater persecution upon the witnesses of the Most High.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>7</sup> During the World War the consecrated, because of fear of man, failed to do their duty, and therefore the Lord rendered his unfavorable judgments against them. In 1919 the faithful began to awaken to the real situation, and when they discerned that Christ Jesus was at the temple their joy in reality began. To the faithful Jehovah then said: “The Lord hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy; the king of Israel, even the Lord, is in the midst of thee; thou shalt not see evil any more.&quot;— Zeph. 3: 15.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">’Jehovah took away the unfavorable judgment against them, and the spirit of the Lord rested upon the faithful, and with joy they said (Isa. 12:1): “And in that day thou shalt say, 0 Lord, I will praise thee; though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me.” The “prisoners” restrained by “Babylon” were then released from Satan’s organization because the adverse judgment of Jehovah was taken away and because the faithful had repented and turned with full devotion to God and his King. (Pss. 102:19,20; 146:7; Isa. 61:1; 42:7; 49:9) The enemy was removed from God’s organization, and thereafter the rod of the wicked was not permitted to rest upon the lot of the righteous. (Ps. 125:3) Thus Jehovah delivered the captives from Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ One noteworthy event was this: that in 1928 God revealed to his people the truth concerning “the higher powers”, showing his faithful people that the “higher powers” are not the political elements that rule the world, but that Jehovah and Christ Jesus are the Higher Powers. Then the clearing out of “elective elder” bosses of the companies was another revelation that brought joy to the faithful. In the year 1938 Jehovah revealed to his people that the democratic system of government is not the rule for Jehovah’s organization, but that God’s organization is necessarily theocratic. All of these things brought joy to God’s people, and their faith and hope and comfort increase.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup> To his faithful servants Jehovah revealed that “the king of [spiritual] Israel, even the Lord, is in the midst of thee”. That king is not Caesar, nor the state, nor the pope of the Hierarchy, falsely claiming to be the official representative of Christ; but that king is Jehovah, “the King of Eternity.” By his official representative, Christ Jesus, He is present with his faithful servants. As a result of Jehovah's presence by Christ Jesus with the faithful “remnant’' gathered to the temple and made witnesses of the Theocrat, the people of good will heard the message. These “strangers” began to come from many nations, and still they come, and, coming, they join in the song because their hearts are made glad: “Sing and rejoice, 0 daughter of Zion; for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the Lord. And many nations shall be joined to the Lord in that day, and shall be my people; and I will dwell in the midst of thee; and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto thee.” (Zech. 2:10, 11) “Thus saith the Lord, I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and Jerusalem shall be called, A city of truth; and the mountain [The Theocratic Government] of the Lord of hosts, The holy mountain.”—Zech. 8:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>11</sup> No more shall the Lord punish his faithful people : “Thou shalt not see evil any more.” (Zeph. 3:15) The remnant, continuing faithful and obedient to the Lord, will maintain their integrity toward him, and therefore there will be no more occasion for Jehovah to visit evil upon them as he did in 1914 to 1918: “And there shall be no more curse; but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him; and they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.”—Rev. 22: 3,4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>12</sup> The cruel persecution that now comes upon God’s people at the hand of the Hierarchy and totalitarian allies and their tools is not any evil from Jehovah. That does not express Jehovah’s displeasure concerning his faithful ones. That persecution is evidence from the Lord that the remnant and their companions are his own people permitted to bear the reproach that fell upon Jehovah and Christ Jesus long centuries ago. Because the remnant bears the name of Jehovah and because the Jonadabs are the “other sheep” of the Lord, they are subjected to the persecution by the Devil’s organization. By their standing firm on the side of Jehovah and trusting in his salvation they are made strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. The remnant are in The Theocratic Government, and the Jonadabs are under the protection of the Lord, and hence these ‘men [of God] dwell in it [the kingdom], and there shall be no more utter destruction ; but Jerusalem [God’s faithful organization] shall be safely inhabited’.—Zech. 14:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>13</sup> The faithful servants of Jehovah know that no evil shall prevail against them, and they say to the Lord, as written in the prophecies: “But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.” (Ps. 13:5) They know that their salvation is assured. That brings much joy to their hearts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>14</sup> The “day of Jehovah” began in 1914, when he enthroned Christ as King. Therefore Jehovah says: “In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not; and to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.” (Zeph. 3: 16) Jehovah speaks through Christ Jesus, the King and great Prophet. In the year 1919 Christ Jesus, through his earthly servants and by his selected means of communication, began to say to those in the covenant with Jehovah: “Fear them not”; meaning, Do not fear any of the enemy; fear only God. (See </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> August 1 and 15, 1919, &quot;Blessed Are the Fearless.” Also </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchton et</span><span class="font6"> April 1, 1923, “Slack Not Thine Hands.”) This message of comfort and assurance is to the remnant of spiritual Israel, who are citizens of the New Jerusalem, and to the ‘strangers that are within her gates', that is, the people of good will, the Jonadabs. Both classes must observe the same law and obey the same commandments of God.—Ex. 12:49.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>15</sup> This admonition to the remnant and to the “other sheep” proves that Satan was then cast out of heaven and down to the earth, and hence after 1918 and onward would be and are “perilous times”; and that these are the &quot;last days”, and that the name of Jehovah must be vigorously declared until the battle of the great day of God Almighty begins. This also proves that Catholic Action would be organized, vigorously warring against The Theocracy, and that the totalitarian state would grab control of the earth. It also proves that these, together with the Homan Catholic Hierarchy, claiming the right to rule the earth, constitute “the abomination that inaketh desolate&quot; and that it would stand “where it ought not” to stand. Furthermore it shows that the persecution of Jehovah’s servants would increase, marking the time when all persons of good wall who have hope for salvation must flee to The Theocratic Government. (Matt. 24:15,16) From that time on those covenant people of God must not fear man or demons. Fearing only God and diligently obeying his commandments makes them safe from the Devil’s trap. —Prov. 29: 25.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">’• Zion is Jehovah’s capital organization with Christ Jesus the Head thereof and associated with him the spirit-begotten 144,000, all of whom must now be busily engaged in Jehovah’s service. To Zion Jehovah says now: “Let not thine hands be slack.” No time now for idleness or weakly refraining from the kingdom witness work. Even though the enemy challenges the legality of the witness work and heaps great reproach and punishment upon those engaged in that work, the faithful must not slack their hand. No one in Zion must fear the enemy. They must be bold as the lion, which represents justice. They must joyfully continue to obey the commandments of the Lord. God is our strength, and him only shall we fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot; Jehovah caused to be made and recorded many prophetic dramas as examples and for the encouragement of his people in this day of peril upon the earth. One of these examples was that concerning Nehemiah when he was sent of the Lord to rebuild the walls of ancient Jerusalem. Sanballat, together with other enemies, conspired against Nehemiah and raised the false charge of sedition against him and his companions. Nehemiah prayed to Jehovah: “Now therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.” (Neh. 6:1,7-9) Likewise God’s faithful servants, in doing their work since 1922, have continued to pray, and Jehovah has heard their prayers. The enemy tried the same Deviltactics when the temple was being rebuilt at Jerusalem by the faithful restored remnant of fleshly Israel: “Then the [enemy] people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in [their] building; and hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.”—Ezra 4:4,5.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>18</sup> Another example was that of the Gibeonites, who were desperately in need of help and who called upon Joshua, sending him the message: “Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us.” (Josh. 10: 6) There the Gibeonites pictured the people of good will, the “other sheep” of the Lord now being gathered, who now need help; and so the remnant the Lord commands to push on with the witness work and slack not the hand. Jehovah’s witnesses must be diligent and very active up until Armageddon, ever rejoicing in their privilege of bearing the reproaches that fell upon the Lord for His name’s sake.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">’’Why should Jehovah’s witnesses have no fear of man or demons ? The answer is given in the prophecy: ‘‘The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love ; he will joy over thee with singing.”—Zeph. 3: 17.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup> Jehovah has commanded that his name shall now be declared throughout the earth. He is in the midst of his covenant people, and he is almighty. He is Jehovah of Hosts, the God of battle, and none can successfully withstand him. The battle is his, and not man’s, and His complete victory is absolutely certain. (2 Chron. 20:15) He has appointed and commissioned his King, Christ Jesus, who is “The mighty God”. (Isa. 9: 6) To Zion, the temple mountain, Jehovah says: “Lift up your heads, 0 ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.” —Ps. 24: 7, 8.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>11</sup> Salvation belongs to Jehovah, and not to any earthly agency: “He will save [his faithful people].” That does not refer to saving from death due to Adam’s sin, but does mean salvation or deliverance from the Devil's organization, which threatens destruction to the servants of God. It refers to deliverance of God’s faithful people, both the remnant and the “other sheep”, at Armageddon. Many times have these been delivered since 1919, and complete deliverance will come to the faithful at Armageddon, and that deliverance will be for the sake of Jehovah’s name. (Ps. 106:8) Seeing that the day of salvation is now at hand, this is no time for idleness, but the time for great energy and activity in proclaiming The Theocratic Government and the deliverance it will bring.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>22</sup> The faithful children of Zion and their companions now prove by the Word of God, which he has commanded them to carry to the people, that Satan is a liar and that all religion is from the demons. God is pleased with such faithful activity in proclaiming his name and his kingdom. Therefore it is written : “He will rejoice over thee with joy.” (Zeph. 3: 17) Jehovah is manifesting his good pleasure toward his servants because of their fearlessness and faithfulness in advertising The Theocratic Government and declaring the name of the great Theocrat. Those faithful servants fear Jehovah, lest they should coine short of service and not receive his approval. They delight to do his will amidst all opposition. The words recorded by the prophet Jeremiah are now appropriately and properly applied to the faithful servants of Jehovah God, whom Jeremiah foreshadowed: “And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me. Yea, 1 will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart, and with my whole soul.” (Jer. 32:40,41) God’s favor is made known to the faithful by giving them a “new name”, the witnesses of Jehovah. (Isa. 62: 2-5; 43: 10-12) Furthermore, he says to the “evil servant” class: “And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen; for the Lord God shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name. And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people; and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying. There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days; for the child shall die an hundred years old ; but the sinner, being an hundred years old, shall be accursed.”—Isa. 65:15,19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>23</sup> Because Jehovah rejoices over his faithful people he bids them that are his witnesses on the earth to rejoice also, and they do greatly rejoice now. (Isa. 65:18; 66:10,14) Since receiving their &quot;new name” the remnant, being fully identified with the organization under Christ, joyfully sing: “I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.”—Isa. 61:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>24</sup> Furthermore Zephaniah records: “He will rest in his love.” (Zeph. 3: 17) The marginal reading is: “He will be silent in his love.” Jehovah rests or keeps silent from rebuking Zion, that being no longer necessary, because the children of Zion, the faithful remnant, are zealous and obedient to Jehovah’s commandments and are active, therefore, in his service. This is Jehovah’s attitude toward them because of his love for his faithful ones. All his acts toward them are by reason of his loving-kindness Therefore he bids his people to sing, for the reason that now is the time for them to make manifest their joy in him. Then says the Most High: “[I] will joy over thee with singing.” This he does because the time has come to vindicate his name by his Theocratic Government. The time is here for the deliverance of his faithful ones, and they are commanded to sing. Jehovah communicates to them this “new song”, and they sing: “And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders; and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.”—Rev. 14: 3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>23</sup> At the birth of the man child Jesus the angelic host of heaven sung a prophetic song, and again that song is being fulfilled : ‘And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace toward men of good-will.’ (Luke 2:13, 14, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham)</span><span class="font6"> To the people of good will, the ■‘other sheep” of the Lord, he gives commandment: “Rejoice, 0 ye nations, with his people; for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.” (Dent. 32: 43) Jehovah’s organization is now in a joyful place, because now is the time for the fulfillment of prophecy: “And the ransomed of the Lord shall return [from Babylon], and come to Zion with songs, and everlasting joy upon their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.” (Isa. 33:10) &quot;Theiefore the redeemed of the Lord shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head; they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away.”—Isa. 51:11.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ASSEMBLY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>26</sup> In 1918 Jehovah’s people were cut off from enjoying their assembly together, and this by reason of being taken away captives by the enemy. Some were actually imprisoned, and all were restrained of their liberty. In 1918 Christ Jesus came to the temple and the saints who had long been dead were resurrected and gathered unto the Lord. The captives sorrowed, waiting for the gathering to the temple on Mount Zion : &quot;And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.”-Rom. 8:23.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>21</sup> Another rendering of the text (Zeph. 3: 18) is: &quot;The sad exiles from the appointed meeting have I gathered.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font6"> Those exiled during 1918 from God’s appointed place of meeting rejoiced when they were gathered together in 1919 and when the Lord revived the work of The Theocracy. Therefore the regathered spiritual Israelites say, and continue to sing: &quot;I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord. Our feet shall stand within thy gates, 0 Jerusalem. Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord. For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee.” (Ps. 122:1,2,4,8) “My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth, for the courts of the Lord; my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God. They go from strength to strength; every one of them in Zi6n appeareth before God.” (Ps. 84: 2, 7) &quot;My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God; when shall I come and appear before God! When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me; for I had gone with the multitude; I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.” (Ps. 42: 2. 4) “0 God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee; my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is; to see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary.”—Ps. G3: 1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>28</sup> With this statement of the facts the following part of the prophecy will be appreciated by the anointed and companions: “I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly, who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden ” (Zeph. 3:18) Who are gathered! The prophecy answers: Those “who are of thee [from thee had they been </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)]”.</span><span class="font6"> Those consecrated ones had been absent from the Lord’s organization because of being in captivity or prisoners or restrained ones, held by the enemy organization during the World War. It was a burden to them to be in captivity: &quot;A burden on thee [and] a reproach!” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Rotherham)</span><span class="font6"> The consecrated had not maintained their integrity, but had slacked their hands during that period in giving testimony of the kingdom. Thus in 1918 and 1919 they had contributed to the reproach upon Jehovah’s organization. Those who were in the “evil servant&quot; class were not gathered after 1918, but were “cut off from the [holy] city”. (Zech. 14:1,2) The faithful were sorrowful, and when they were regathered to the Lord their joy really began.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>29</sup> Jehovah says to the afflicted ones who remained faithful: “Behold, at that time I will undo al) that afflict thee; and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame.”—Zeph. 3:19.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5C</sup> The first part of this text, according to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham,</span><span class="font6"> reads: “Behold me! dealing with all thine oppressors at that time”; then, following the beginning of the “strange work” by Jehovah, and in that he gives his faithful ones a part. The “strange work” exposes the hypocritical religious afflicters. In that “strange work” a series of grievous “plagues” are poured out upon “Christendom”. God produces a “famine” in their land by denying the religious meddlers a vision of his purpose. They are like the demons; they go into darkness and remain there. (Rev. 16:1-21; Amos 8:11) The religious susceptibilities of these oppressors being shocked, they begin to howl. During the “strange work” some of the oppressors and supporters appear to repent: “The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee, The city of the Lord, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.” (Isa. 60:14) Thus is described those who had been oppressors but who now turn to the Lord and seek his salvation. Thereafter comes the “strange act”, and the oppressors will never escape from Jehovah’s Executioner: “For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time, neither shall be.”—Mark 13:19.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>31</sup> Who will be saved? The Lord answers, “I will save her that halteth”; that meaning the remnant of Zion, to whom is committed the testimony of Jesus Christ. During the World War these halted between two opinions, trying at that time to obey human rulers because they believed them to be “the higher powers”, and also desiring to be faithful unto Jehovah God; but, they being of honest and sincere heart, Jehovah restored the remnant: “In that day, saith the Lord, will I assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted; and I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation; and the Lord shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.”—Mic. 4:6,7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>32</sup> The religionists watched for opportunities to rid the earth of God’s consecrated people, but the Lord saved and delivered those who were faithful to him: “But in mine adversity [halting </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">{margin')} </span><span class="font6">they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together [against the remnant] ; yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not: with hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.” (Ps. 35:15,16) “For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, say they, and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my halting, saying, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.”—Jer. 20:10; Ps. 38: 16-18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>33</sup> This halting between two opinions resulted in lameness on the part of the remnant. Jehovah gave them ci edit for being ignorant of the truth concerning the “higher powers”, and hence had mercy upon them and gathered them and restored them, in 1919, and then, later, about 1929, revealed to his faithful people that the “higher powers” are not the earthly rulers, but Jehovah God and Christ.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>34</sup> Furthermore concerning the faithful Jehovah says: “And gather her that was driven out”; that is to say, driven out of the “Holy Land” of the service, which was denied God’s people in behalf of the kingdom interests during the World War. God permitted them to be driven out because of their fear of man and because of holding to much of religion and religious ceremonies. This was foreshadowed by the fleeing of Elijah from the devil-worshiping female lepresentative, Jezebel. (1 Ki. 19:1-15) Further-moie, as foreshadowed by Elijah’s returning, by the returning and gathering of the remnant of Zion Jehovah therefore nullifies and reverses the action of the enemy against God’s faithful people. A furthei picture of this God caused to be recorded by his prophet Ezekiel: “Then he said unto me, Son of man. these bones are the whole house of [spiritual] Israel; behold, they [during 1918] say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost; we are cut off for our parts. Therefore prophesy, and say unto them. Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel [which prophecy began to have fulfillment in 1919]. And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves [a deadness as to activity in God’s kingdom service], O my people, and brought you up out of your graves.”—Ezek. 37 :11-13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>35</sup> Furthermore Jehovah says: “And I will get them praise and fame.” (Zeph. 3:19) “I will make them a praise and a name.” (R.F. and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font6"> The deliverance of the remnant from the enemy and their restoration to their own land, that is, to kingdom service, was then and has continued to be a praise to Jehovah and to the honor of his name. Jehovah has also given his faithful remnant a “new name” to his praise. All of this favor of God upon his people has brought dismay to the enemy, and particularly to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. (Rev. 11:11-13) Jehovah then causes them to be called his witnesses and to shou forth his praises and to exalt his name before othei s, and not to exalt men. “And in that day [of restoration] shall ye say, Praise the Lord, call upon his name </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[{margin)</span><span class="font6"> proclaim his name], declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted. Sing unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent things [to wit, has set up The Tueocexc'i and delivered his people from Satan's organization] ; this is known in all the earth.”—Isa. 12:4, 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>30</sup> During the World War the remnant were j&gt;ut to shame in their land. Concerning them God says: 1 will make them a praise and a name “in every land where they have been put to shame'’. God’s people were made to have a shameful appearance ; but when they were regathered by the Lord and restored to his service a different picture appears. Now in every land of “Christendom” the religionists are forced to take notice of Jehovah’s witnesses. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy at last recognizes that there is a people on the earth who refuse to yield to their inducements and who never quail before their inquisitors The faithful now are fulfilling and obeying that admonition which is written in the Sciiptures, to wit. “Only let the lives you live be worthy of the [gospel] of The Christ, in order that, whether I come and see you or, being absent, only hear of you, I may know that you are standing fast in one spirit and with one mind, fighting shoulder to shoulder for the faith oi the [gospel]. Never for a moment quail befoie your antagonists. Your fearlessness will be to them a sure token of impending destruction, but to you it will be a sure token of your salvation—a token coming from God.”—Phil. 1: 27, 28, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">” Now Jehovah turns the tables and makes those of “Catholic Action” and their allies turn black in the face. The enemy see that they are exposed, and they see that the people of good will toward Jehovah are fleeing from the demon organization and finding rest and safety under God’s organization. Jehovah foretold this day of triumph of those who serve and worship him in spirit and in truth: “But ye shall be named the priests of the Lord; men shall call you the ministers of our God; ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves. Nor your shame ye shall have double, and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion; therefore m their land they shall possess the double; everlasting joy shall be unto them.”—Isa. 61: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">TEMPLE SERVICE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>38</sup> At the temple judgment, which began in 1918, those who passed the test were anointed and commissioned and sent forth to the service of The Theocratic Government, and concerning them Jehovah by his prophet says: “At that time will I bring you again [bring you in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(R.V.</span><span class="font6">)], even in the time that I gather you; for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivitv before your eyes, saith the Lord.”—Zeph. 3: 20. &quot;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>39</sup> At the temple the approved ones were brought into the service of The Theocracy. To them the Lord committed the kingdom interests. They must now offer unto Jehovah an offering in righteousness, and this thex did when sent forth into the earth to perform their assigned work under Christ Jesus, their Head and King.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">The gathering or restoring has no reference to ■'Israel after the flesh”, because they were a typical people. The gathering here refers to spiritual Israel. It means the bringing of the spiritual Israelites, the faithful witnesses of God, into visible unity. Now God’s people have been brought into full unity as the Lord foretold by the apostle. (Eph. 4:13,14) &quot;Thus saith the Lord God, When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then shall they dwell in their land that 1 have given to my servant Jacob. And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them; and they shall know that I am the Lord their God.” (Ezek. 28.23,26) “And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them. And I xv ill plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith the Lord thy God.” (Amos 9:14,13) These scriptures show that Jehovah’s faithful servants now on the earth shall never again be scattered by the enemy, but shall continue for ever to serve Jehovah and rejoice in his salvation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>41</sup> Jehovah’s people, the remnant and their companions, are now carrying forward a campaign of publicity in full unity and solidarity. Some notable examples are these: In London, England, 193S, was held a convention of the remnant and companion:?, which convention was tied, by electric appliances, with many other assemblies throughout Great Britain, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania, Canada and America. Also in the year 1939 a like assembly, the key of which was in New York city, tied together with many other cities and radio stations. By this means Jehovah’s witnesses and companions in every part of the land of “Christendom” were gathered together and harmoniously proclaimed the name of the great Theocratic Government.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4S</sup> “For I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth.” According to Young’s translation: “I will give you [restored spiritual Israel] for a name, and for a praise, among all people? of the land.” From about 1878 Jehovah began taking out of the nations a “people for his name”. (Acts 15:14) These he put to the test at the temple judgment in 1918, and sent the approved ones forth to do his work. The Scriptures and the physical facts exactly agree and show that now is the time when Jehovah puts his favor upon those who truly love and serve him; and this proves the fulfillment of the prophecy concerning their commission. The “tabernacle of David” was typical and pictuied the kingdom. In 1914 the King, Christ Jesus, was enthroned and the kingdom set up. The commissioned remnant went forth at his command to proclaim the name of Jehovah, that is, to declare his name and his govei n ment. To this agree the words of the prophet set forth in Amos 9:11,12. (See Acts 15:14-18.) Whx was this done? The Word of Jehovah answers: “That the residue of men [a people for his name] might seek after the Lord,” and those of good will of all nations might flee to The Theocratic Government. AH this Jehovah foretold from the very beginning; and his purpose must be accomplished.—Acts 15. 14-18.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">FULL ASSURANCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4S</sup> The remnant and companions are now fully assured of what shall come to pass. They are no longer in doubt, and no longer do they fear. Jehovah has spoken, and his word shall not return to him void, but shall accomplish his purpose. Having purposed it, he will also do it. (Isa. 46: 11; 55:11) When will Jehovah do all these marvelous things? He answers: &quot;When I turn back your captivity before your eyes”; or, according to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham:</span><span class="font6"> ‘When I cause all your captives to return before your eyes.’ Jehovah has gathered his faithful witnesses in the course of action taken, that all who desire may discern and know that Jehovah is the Almighty and that now his prophecies are being fulfilled to the praise and to the vindication of his name.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>44</sup> Had all the consecrated in 1918 taken a course of idleness and never thereafter organized and carried forward the witness work in a zealous and fearless manner, no one on earth would have seen or known of the restoration of spiritual Israel and that these are the true servants of Jehovah God, who declare his name and his government. In fact, there could have been no restoration were it not for the fact that some remained true and faithful to the Lord and these constituted the “remnant”. In 1919 Jehovah’s consecrated faithful people were restored, their restraint being removed. Thus the faithful were made a praise to the name of Jehovah. Religionists, and political and commercial people, were made to realize that now there is a people on the earth who are wholly devoted to Jehovah and who without fear or hesitation engage in proclaiming his name and advertising The Theocratic Government as the only hope of mankind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>45</sup> Now the religionists realize that Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions are a people entirely out of the ordinary and separate and distinct from the religious politicians of the earth. They see that such are a peculiar people. These faithful witnesses put Jehovah and his kingdom above everything. Their testimony concerning Jehovah and his Theocratic Government fills the religionists and allies with malicious hatred of the Almighty and his kingdom, and thus the enemy openly oppose everything that pertains to The Theocratic Government. The Lord God causes the enemy to thereby fix their own destiny. They openly espouse the cause of the Devil and work in harmony with the demons opposing the Most High and all who represent Him. He makes his people a praise to his name in the earth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BE INSTRUCTED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>48</sup> The Scriptures were written that the man of God might be instructed and duly equipped to serve the Most High and his kingdom. (2 Tim. 3:16,17) The wise are those who diligently seek righteousness and meekness. They are anxious to know the will of God and diligent to walk in the way he has commanded. “And when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.” (Prov. 21:11) One who is instructed by tiie Lord and receives knowledge has an appreciation of his relationship to Jehovah and to his king. (Prov. 8: 10, 12) “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.”—Prov. 9:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>47</sup> Jehovah’s time arrives for the fulfillment of the prophecy of Zephaniah, whose name means “hidden of Jehovah”. Zephaniah pictures, first, the &quot;remnant”, and, later, their “companions”. In the temple judgment, which began in 1918, the approved ones were healed and built up into Zion. Then they were all sent forth to warn “Christendom” in particular and to give warning to all of Satan’s organization that the end had come and that the battle of the great day of God Almighty is near. Also their commission required them to proclaim the name oi Jehovah and his government to all who had a hearing ear, to the end that the Lord’s “other sheep” might be gathered. The faithful remnant immediately began to carry out that commission, and have continued to do so. As they continue thus to obey God’s commandments he continues to instruct them by revealing to them the meaning of his prophecies. In this time the Lord gathers his “other sheep”, and these are made the companions of the remnant and joined with the remnant in declaring The Theocratic Government and in sounding the warning that final judgment is about to be fully executed. Those who are wise heed the warning and receive the instructions and immediately flee to The Theocratic Government and have promise of being hidden there.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>48</sup> “Christendom” spurns the instruction from the Lord. The commercial and political and military elements join the religionists in opposition to The Theocracy, and, all together, they join in persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions In their opposition to The Theocratic Gow.rnment &quot;Christendom” and allies boast that they will rule the world in defiance of Jehovah God and his King.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>48</sup> Then Jehovah says to the rebellious ones: “Just wait for me.” But rebellious “Christendom” gives no heed to the warning. On the contrary, the religionists and allies increase persecution upon Jehovah’s servants. Will Jehovah avenge his faithful witnesses? Jesus answers: “I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?” (Luke 18: 8) Those now on the earth who have full faith and confidence in Jehovah and his King will not longer fear demons nor any of the human agents of the demons, but with boldness and zeal peculiar to the house of the Lord they will go forth in the proclamation of the message committed to their hands, declaring God’s purpose. By so doing they will prove their faith in Jehovah and in his government, and will thereby maintain their integrity toward the Most High.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>50</sup> Jehovah’s time is here to oust the enemy. Therefore let all who trust fully in the great Theocrat and his King rejoice. God rejoices over them and commands them to rejoice. Therefore let no one of the remnant or of the Jonadabs now tremble or fail to perform his full duty. Let no one of them slack his hands. Let the witness work be pressed on with everincreasing vigor. Rejoice and sing for joy, all who are privileged now to be on the side of The Theocratic Government. Victory is certain, and it is nigh. All the Scriptures and all the physical facts fully prove that the great battle will begin shortly. As Jehovah spoke to typical Israel through his faithful servant Joshua, so now he speaks to spiritual Israel and companions through the Greater Joshua, to wit: “Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed; for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.” (Josh. 1:9) Salvation belongeth to Jehovah, and he will deliver those who trust in him. Therefore as we go let us sing: &quot;My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.”</span></p>

Doubtless both of these hunters knew of the great divine promise given in the paradise of Eden concerning a coming Seed, a Deliverer of humankind, to wit: “And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; . . . and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.”—Gen. 3:14,15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Esau’s home was in the tents of his father, Isaac. Isaac was the son of Abraham, the man who was called “the friend of God”. With Abraham God made a solemn contract or covenant, in these words: “In blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed iny voice.” (Gen. 22: 17, 18) This is called the Abrahamic covenant. Note that the covenant with Abraham stated that there would be an offspring or “seed” which would bless “all the nations of the earth”. Before the blessing promised could come to the peoples of earth, the seed which was promised must first come. It was therefore expected that one of the natural descendants of Abraham would become their king and that through that king and his kingdom all the nations of the earth would be blessed according to the will of God the great Theocrat. For this reason the faithful looked forward with great expectancy to the birth of the one who was to be their king. They based their hopes upon the repeated promise by Jehovah God. Without doubt it was thought by some that Isaac, the son of Abraham, would be the one through whom the blessing would come. “And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi [the well of the Living-Seeing One].” When Isaac was about sixty years old there were born to him and his wife Rebekah two sons, twins, who were named by them Esau and Jacob.—Gen. 25:11, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To escape a famine Isaac then went to live in the land of the demon-worshiping Philistines. While there, God said to Isaac: “Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee: for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I vvill give all these countries; and I will perform the oath which 1 sware unto Abraham thy father. And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thv seed all these countries ; and m thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.” (Gen. 26: 3, 4) Thus the Abranamiv promise was renewed to Isaac Before the death of Isaac upon which of his twin sons would he pronounce his blessing, and which son wmuld thereby become the successor of ins father to the Abrahamic promise?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Under the rule of descent at that time in the Orient, the firstborn or eldest son was the heir of the father’s estate and of any other rights or privileges that went with, that estate, unless for some cause there should be an exception to the rule. Esau, having been born a few moments before ins brother Jacob, would under the operation of this rule be the successor of the Abrahamic promise and heir to his father. His birthright, therefore, would include the promise made to Abraham. But Jehovah God clearly indicated that there should be an exception to the rule in this case and that Jacob should be the heir, and not Esau When it was known that Rebekah the mother would bear offspring, and just before the time of the birth, she inquired of the Lord concerning the expected offspring, and the Lord said unto her that two sons would be born to her and that the older should serve the younger. “And the Loid said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.” (Gen. 25: 22, 23) This definitely shows that it was God’s purpose that Jacob, who was born last, should be the heir and successor to the Abrahamic promise</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These two sons grew to manhood’s estate Esau became a great hunter and loved the outdoor sports ; while Jacob was a plain man, remaining quietly at home. Esau showed that he did not appreciate the birthright, namely, the Abrahamic promise, even if it were his, which in fact it was not, since God had foreordained that it should belong to Jacob As the inspired commentator thereon writes: “And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac; (for the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God, according to election, might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;) it was said unto her. The elder shall serve the younger. As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.” (Rom. 9:10-13) Esau thought more of his own selfish, immediate comfort than of anything that might come to him by reason of the Abrahamic promise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Came the day when Esau was in the field hunting. He returned hungry and faint. He found that Jacob had prepared a pot of lentils. When Esau smelled this appetizing food he said to Jacob: “Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage, for I am faint.” Then Jacob, not out of line with the decree of Jehovah God, said to Esau: “Sell me this day thy birthright. And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die; and what profit shall this birthright do to me ? And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.”—Gen. 25: 27-34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Genuine, real right and title to the birthright was now Jacob’s for two good and sufficient reasons: (1) because it was so ordered by the Lord before Jacob’s birth, as above stated ; and (2) because he had bought it in an open and fair transaction with his brother Esau. Jacob and Esau were then men, both capable of entering into a contract; and they made a contract which was binding upon both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Notwithstanding these two good reasons why Jacob was justly entitled to the birthright, Esau attempted to deprive him of it. The birthright carried with it the privilege of the special blessing from their father Isaac. Isaac waxed old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see; and he knew that the day of his death might be near. (Gen. 27 :1, 2) He directed his son Esau to go into the field and take some venison and bring it to him that he might eat, and give Esau his blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bible does not clearly show that Isaac knew God had foreordained that this birthright should belong to Jacob, nor does it show that Isaac knew Esau had sold it to Jacob; therefore the old father can be excused for thinking it was his duty to bestow his blessing upon his son Esau. It was when Isaac was 131 years old and his sons Jacob and Esau were men of mature years, each 71 years of age, that Isaac bestowed the blessing. Rebekah the mother, knowing of both the reasons why Jacob was entitled to the birthright, knowing that Esau did not appreciate it, and knowing of his wrongful intent to deprive his brother Jacob of the privileges and blessings incident to the birthright, advised Jacob what to do in order to protect his own rightful and proper interests. The mother, therefore, was carrying out God’s will in this respect. She was doing what all honest persons should do: try to protect the rights and privileges of those that are near and dear to them. She therefore directed Jacob to slay two kids of the goats and bring them to her and she prepared some savory meat, while Esau was away hunting. Then, in order that the blind father might not obstinately refuse to aid them in carrying out the divine purposes, and in order that he might think he was blessing Esau, the mother Rebekah fastened upon the arms of her son Jacob the skins of the kids and also put the skins about his neck that he would appear as a hairy man like unto his brother Esau.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jacob then came in before his father and presented the savory meat. His father kissed him and laid his hand upon him and gave to Jacob his blessing. The old father then spoke in prophetic phrase, evidently under the direction of the Lord, saying unto his son Jacob: “Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother’s sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee; and blessed be he that blesseth thee.”—Gen. 27 : 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Almost immediately Esau returned from the field and found that Jacob had received his father’s blessing and that he (Esau) had been unsuccessful in carrying out his purpose of defeating the open and fair transaction which he had made with Jacob when he sold him his birthright. Esau hated his brother Jacob and determined to kill him as soon as his father Isaac was dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It seems rather strange that many religionists have severely criticized Jacob and his mother Rebekah, in this transaction. It has evidently been due to the fact that thex were ignorant of the record. No part of Jaeob’s action in connection with the birthright is reprehensible. Jehovah God later showed that Esau prophetically pictured the peoples of earth who are Christians in name only, but nut in truth and in fact, and who are hypocritical, and who persecute the true Christians; while Jacob pictured or loiesh.idowed the true followers of Christ who have been misrepi esented and persecuted by the merely so-called “Christians’, (tod showed his approval of the conduct of Jacob and his molhei Rebekah, and showed that it was his purpose that Jacob should receive the blessing going with the birthright. Jacob had shown his great desire for the birthright, which was merely a promise; while Esau had despised it. Hence later the apostle warned Christians 'fiest there be any fornieatoi. or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright. For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected for h-found no place of repentance [on God’s part), though h&lt; sought it carefully with tears”.—Ileb 12. 1G, 17</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Acting upon the advice of his mother, Jacob now lied from the wrath of Esau; but before going Isaac called Jacob and again blessed him. (Gen. 28. 1-5) As Jacob went away, he lay down and slept at a place situated not th of the present site of Jerusalem and which afterward Jacob named Bethel, which name means “House of God” There Jacob had a dream, in which God signified his approx..1 of Jaco:) and pronounced a blessing upon him The faithful record reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“And he lighted upon a certain place, and tairied there all night, because the sun was set: and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep. And he dreamed, and, behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and, behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it. And, behold, the Lord stood aboxe it, and said, I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou hest, to thee will 1 give it, and to thy seed; and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth; and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south • and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee m all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land. for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.”—Gen. 28:11-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Whom God blesses and approves all others should approve Be assured, then, that Jacob was blameless before Jehovah God in this transaction. It shows how carefully Jehovah was guarding his promise and the seed which would spiing from it ultimately and through which the families of the earth should be blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some years later God showed his further favor to Jacob by changing his name from Jacob to Israel The name Israel means “He will rule as God”. (Gen. 32:27,28) “And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be cal'cd any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel. And God said unto him, I am God Almighty : be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins; and the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land” (Gen. 35:10-12) But what about Esau the hunter?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The nickname of Esau was Edom: “Esau, who is Edom.” (.Gen. 36:1) The name means “red”, and is a reminder of Esau’s failure to appreciate God’s favor toward him concerning the Abrahamic birthright, which Esau sold for the paltry sum of a mess of pottage, that his selfish appetite might be appeased. Genesis 25:30: “And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom”; that is. &quot;Red” (Marginal reading) Esau married outside of Abraham’s family relation. Esau took his wives of the demon-worshiping daughters of Canaan, the cursed one. (Gen. 9: 25) It was therefore impossible for the Edomites to be God's holy nation. Esau was the firstborn of Isaac and apparently had the first elaim to the Abrahamic birthright, hut it was God’s will that it should be otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The descendants of Esau, that is, the Edomites, must therefore represent a class of persons who are apparently the firstborn and in line for the kingdom of God. More specifically they stand for and represent that class of men who have organized and carried on religion in the name of (tod and Christ, but who in truth and in fact have been and aie the representatives of the Devil, and hence a part of the Devil’s organization. That clearly shows that modern-day Edomites are made up of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their Protestant and Jewish clergy allies who have used the Word of God for a selfish purpose. Today Protestantism is dead; those clergymen who carry on the so-called “Protestant religion” are joined together with the Roman Catholic Hierarchy; and it has been true since the World War, at and since which time this combined crowd has sought the death of the true followers of Christ Jesus The clergy of the Catholic and so-called “Protestant” organizations are vigorously working together at this day to destroy the true followers of the Lord Jesus Christ, who, like him, are witnesses for Jehovah God. Esau joined the Devil’s organization, and all who follow that course become a part of Satan’s organization and are put in the class of the Edomites The clergy are the antitypical Edomites and are the most deceptive and reprehensible part of Satan’s visible organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Abrahamic birthright privileges were claimed by the clergy because they have always claimed to be the ones favored of God. Jehovah God foreknew that they would be unfaithful and would fall away completely to the Devil, and therefore he foretold such in this prophetic drama The Abrahamic birthright privileges as held out and claimed by the clergy, Jesus foretold would be taken away from them because they failed to bring forth the fruits (the truth) of the kingdom of God. (Matt. 21.43-45) That Abrahamic birthright pertains to the foretold “seed of Abraham” through which the blessings would come to humankind, and which seed is Christ Jesus, the Theocratic King. It is only the clergy that have tried to compete with Jehovah’s true saints for the kingdom privileges. This corresponds exactly with Esau’s rivalry toward Jacob for the birthright of his father. Esau tried to kill Jacob, and the modern-day Edomites likewise now try to kill and destroy Jehovah’s true witnesses, pictured by Jacob Those once in line for the birthright blessings of Jehovah God m connection with his Theocratic Government under Christ, and who dishonor the Lord, become Edomites ; and the Lord appoints their end with the hypocrites and puts them into outer darkness as to his purposes and takes away from them all the kingdom interests Those interests are given to the faithful witnesses of Jehovah foreshadowed by Jaeob —Matt 21: 43</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark11"></a>DEAD WITNESSES REVIVED</span></h3>
<p><span class="font11">E</span><span class="font4">ND of the World War in 1918 found them dead, killed. A “beast” did it. Their enemies gloated and said they would never live again and bother them. “And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.” (Rev. 11:8) Not in literal ancient Egypt, but in the world, or Satan’s organization as symbolized by Egypt, was where our Lord Jesus Christ was hung on the tree, and in the same place the work of witnessing as conducted by Him through his faithful followers on earth was overcome and killed. The small bodies of men and women who were devoted to the Lord and forming the witnesses of the Lord on earth were now silent as death. Their work seemed to be completely done. As mute evidences of the injustice, fraud, lying and cruelty practiced against them by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and its religious allies, and as proof of the violation of liberty of speech, and, above all, as evidence of the defamation of God’s Word and name, the witness work of the faithful followers of Christ lay dead in the streets, not lying in state, but in the streets and in disgrace and exposed to the gaze of the religious mockers, and considered ‘as the filth of the world, and the offseouring of all things’. (1 Cor. 4: 13) “Their careasses were as dung in the midst of the streets ”—Isa. 5: 25, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">They were not given an honorable burial, but were left exposed in the city (of Satan, whieh is called Sodom and Egypt, where Christ Jesus was murdered). The faithful witness work, which compared with the prophet Elijah’s work and which Jehovah God had caused to be given to the world particularly since A.D. 1878, was now made a stench in the nostrils of all the onlookers. The clergy and their allies, from their pulpits and through the public press, made this stench as detestable as possible. They pointed to Jehovah’s servants who had been giving testimony and to their work as worse than the worst enemies of the land. It was in the Broadway of so-called “Christendom”, but which the Lord has named Sodom, that this witness work lay. In that wicked organization wherein, as in ancient Sodom, there was “pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness” and cruelty, God’s witness work had been killed and exposed as a detestable thing. In that religious organization which is in fact anti-God and anti-Christ, under the control and rulership of Satan, whose ministers claim to be Christian, the real witness work was killed and the people turned away from the true God. The clergy were chiefly responsible for this condition. They will be the principal ones to suffer in the complete downfall of Satan’s organization; and this is indicated by the names Sodom and Egypt, which suggest the manner of the destruction of Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those acts of cruelty to God’s people and insults to Jehovah have not been done in a corner, but openly before all the nations of the earth. The common people will bear witness to the fact that during the war of 1914-1918 Jehovah's consecrated servants were only telling the people why the war had come, that Satan’s “world” or uninterrupted rule had ended, that God’s kingdom was at hand, and that these were the evidences of the approaching blessings, and that their good work was ruthlessly stopped by the agents of Satan’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The clergy seized upon the war as a pretext to stop the witness work concerning God’s Word because they had contempt for God’s kingdom. The Devil had completely gotten control of them and their allies and they were bent upon doing everything possible in opposition to the kingdom of the Lord, whieh they now trod down under foot. To be sure, Jehovah foreknew and foretold this through Christ Jesus, saying: “And ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.” Furthermore Jesus said that this shall be used against them as a witness.—Matt. 24:9; 10:18; Mark 13: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“And they of the people, and kindreds, and tongues, and nations, shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.” (Rev. 11:9) Those “three days and an half” do not seem to be either literal or symbolic time, but merely a time sufficient to cause a dead body to putrefy. In this we are reminded that when Jesus’ friend Lazarus died and Jesus came to the grave and directed the stone to be taken away, Lazarus’ sister said to him: “Lord, by this time he stinketh, for he hath been dead four days.” (John 11:17-39) The embalmed body of Lazarus stank in four days. An unembalmed body exposed three days in the open streets would become a terrific stench and cause the people to turn away their heads. That is exactly what the clergy and the Devil desired to accomplish, to wit, to make the common people look upon God’s witnesses as the most detestable things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In a short time after June 20, 1918, when the witness work was completely killed, the public press and the preachers had many things to say about the witnesses, then commonly known as “Bible Students”, which sayings made them like a stench in the nostrils of the people Press and dergv said, in substance: “The Bible Students aie done for ever.&quot; One paper had this to say about the book which the Govern ment confiscated to stop the work: “The finis of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Finished Mystery</span><span class="font4"> has been given.” This stench, symbolized bv the putrefying bodies, would furnish the unmistakable evidence as to the deadness of the witness work, as dead as the headless John the Baptist and as the prophet Elijah caught away in a fiery trouble. Exposing such to shame would cause putrefaction as would raise a great stench and make it a detestable thing, and such is symbolized as a thing that stinks.—Compare Exodus 5:21, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">margin;</span><span class="font4"> 1 Samuel 13:4 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">margin;</span><span class="font4"> Psalm 38.5, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No honorable burial was allowed the bodies svmboli/cd by God’s “two witnesses”. (Rev. 11:3) The United States, contrary to the spirit of the fundamental law of the land, and particularly due to the now “extinguished'’ papal “Knight of St. Gregory the Great”, refused to allow the officers of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society bail pending an appeal of their case, but kept them m ]&gt;rison and thus increased their ignominy and caused their Clinstian brethren on the outside to be shunned. These also were exposed to ridicule and made to appear destestable in the ev c&gt; of the people. The ruling powers did not bury John the Baptist, but “when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb”. (Maik 6 29) Thus ended a witness work which was long ago foreshadowed by the work of Elijah and John the Baptist The enemy, to wit, Satan’s agencies on earth who des]used Jehovah’s kingdom by Christ, had brought about that condition</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And so, as indicated in Revelation 11:10, the elergv and their allies rejoiced over them and made inerrv and felicitated one another because “these two piophets&quot; that had “tormented them” were, in their opinion, done for and their work ended. No human power or influence could ae.un revive the witness work of Jehovah’s servants, and the clergy had no thought that God would give a helping hand Therefore these religionists reasoned that ‘this pcstilerous crowd is dead and they are done for for ever’ That was thi cause of their exultation, and they felicitated one anutl ci and swaggered about, rejoicing in what thej had accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During that World War many consecrated voung men were held in the army camps and were severely abused and brutally punished because they declined to disobev God and kill their fellow man. The clergy made no protest against such inhuman treatment inflicted by the government officers, but, on the contrary, exulted over it. In manj places throughout the country religious clergymen incited and encouraged mobs to do violence to Jehovah’s servants A great array of testimony giving the names of these persecutors and their atrocious deeds was set forth in No. 27 of the magazine </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> (now </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation)</span><span class="font4">. No clergyman raised his voice in favor of religious ireedom or the right to speak truly the Word of God. They had completely made themselves a part of Satan’s organization. It was a holiday for these agents of Satan on earth and they exchanged congratulations because they had been instrumental in bringing about the death of God’s “two witnesses”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some of those who had to do with destroying this witness work of the Lord were even knighted or decorated by the pope for their “valiant” deeds This the Lord foretold by his prophet in these words: “In mine adversity they rejoiced. and gathered themselves together; yea, the smiters gathered themselves together against me, . . . they did tear me, and ceased not; with hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.”—Ps. 35:15,16; .4)11. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rev. Ver.,</span><span class="font4"> margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">However, God’s spirit is not inactive for long toward his servants. He would not permit his work of his witnesses to ‘lie dead’ bejond the time it served his purposes. Therefore it is written: “And after three days and an half the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet.” (Rev. 11: 11) Manifestly this also refers to another short period of time sufficient to let the clergy and their allies put Jehovah’s servants out of their minds. The excitement of the war and their many duties in getting young men into the trenches to be killed drew the attention of the clergy away from these faithful witnesses of Jehovah God, who they' supposed were done for ever. But all the time the faithful ones outside of prison walls, as well as those inside, were seeking some way to witness to the name of the Lord. Shortly' after the incarceration of the Watch Tower Society’s officers God’s witnesses, or rather His witness work, “stood upon their feet,” not suddenly, but gradually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On March 26, 1919, the prison doors were opened, by the Lord's grace, and in September of that same year thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses assembled in an international convention at Cedar Point, Ohio. At that time those faithful ones saw for the first time that the “Elijah work” was done and that there was another great work to be done, which was foreshadowed by Elijah’s successor, the prophet Elisha, and therefore the remnant of Jehovah’s witnesses on earth must do this work. It was then clearly seen that Elisha was anointed in the place and stead of Elijah to finish the work of witnessing to the name of Jehovah. (1 Ki. 19.16) Note is here taken of a company of certain ones claiming to be followers of Christ, and yet who claim that since A.D 1918 and the end of the World War the Lord has had an entirely different society or class of people to represent him, and that none of the above faithful ones have since been engaged in his service. The Scriptural proof set forth above completely nullifies the claim of those who separated themselves from the faithful, and shows that, since Elisha was anointed to take Elijah’s place, the Lord himself raised up the same company of men to do his work, and that the organization is God’s, a Theocratic organization. and is one and the same organization. God raised up the same body, therefore proving that the same faithful persons who finished the Elijah work were used of the Lord in beginning the Elisha work of God’s remnant of witnesses. It was God who revived the witnesses, as stated in Revelation 11 • 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Matthew 14: 1, 2 states that when King Herod, who had John the Baptist beheaded, heard of Jesus’ miracles he thought that John had been raised from the dead, and</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">dates will be July 24-28 inclusive. This final announcement is made in order that Jehovah’s witnesses and all people of good will may be reminded to arrange their affairs so as to be at Columbus, Ohio, or other cities tied in by direct wire communication and loud</span><span class="font4">doubtless was much alarmed. Likewise, the assembling of Jehovah’s people at Cedar Point, Ohio, in September, 1919, and the sudden reviving of the Lord’s work, struck fear into the clergymen and their allies and caused them to tremble. Hence it is written: “Great fear fell upon them which saw them [the revived witnesses].” (Rev. 11:11) It was a fearinspiring surprise to the clergymen and their supporters. —Compare Psalm 48 : 2-6, 12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Doubtless the clergymen saw that they were in for a “trimming” before the people when they beheld Jehovah’s witnesses boldly coming forth and declaring the message of Jehovah’s Theocratic Government and notifying the people to come and hear them tell why the clergy had stopped the witness work of the Lord’s people in 1918. Instead of hiding the fact that their officers had been imprisoned, as the clergy expected Jehovah’s people to do, these witnesses placed full-page advertisements in the papers throughout the country calling attention to the fact that those officers had been sentenced to eighty years in prison for telling the truth and would now explain to the people why. Great crowds flocked to hear, and did hear, and the witnesses’ work was quickly revived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the Cedar Point convention in 1919, and in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font4"> many scriptures were produced supporting the conclusion that the Elijah work ended in the fiery trouble of 1918 and that now the Elisha work of God’s remnant must begin. It was a voice from heaven, because it was Jehovah’s voice through his Word. “And they [God’s faithful witnesses] heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven m a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.” (Rev. 11:12) Here was the invitation from the Lord to his covenant people to “gather yourselves unto me—ye my men of loving-kindness, who have solemnised my covenant over sacrifice’’. (Ps. 50: 5, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham)</span><span class="font4"> The Lord was gathering unto himself those who had been cast out by the religionists (Ps 147:2) The Lord was now gathering his witnesses to himself to become a part of the “new heavens” and to do his kingdom witness work. Isaiah’s prophecy (52: 2,1, 60.1, 2) then applied: “Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, 0 Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, 0 captive daughter of Zion. Awake, awake; put on thy strength, 0 Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.” “Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘Ascending up to heaven in a cloud’ pictures the fact that God’s servants, rising out of the dust of humiliation and deadness, were lifted up to heavenly privileges of service, this being attended by the glory of God, and they were given a part in His heavenly kingdom work, to witness for the Theocratic Government of Jehovah God by Christ Jesus. And their enemies now behold them thus engaged.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">PIONEERING IN CALVERT COUNTY, MD.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“So many people are interested that we make 8 to 9 back-calls a day. We are playing the lecture records now, and next week will start on model studies. In many little communities we find 90 percent sheep. They are taking their stand now. We hardly have to instruct them, they seem to be waiting for us to come around and they welcome us with open arms. Many are all ready to take over model studies, so that we will be able to move on to other parts of the county and stimulate more who are interested. Many are already publishers to a limited extent, as the privileges of service in rurals are not as abundant as in urban sections. One Cephas has been reading the literature and left the ‘church’ on that account. One night he went back and thought he would go to prayer meeting for the last time. As he entered the church, everyone looked around in amazement, as the whole congregation knew why he had withdrawn and absented himself for two months. The preacher, thinking Cephas had repented, and knowing once any member left as one of Jehovah’s witnesses he would not return, asked Cephas to come up on the carpet and give account of himself. Cephas stalked up front and boldly declared he had come to say good-bye: ‘I’se been reading for myself in the Bible and I know this here preacher ain’t telling us what he should! The Lord is setting up his kingdom now right here on earth [quoting Daniel 2:44] and I can read with my own eyes, and the Lord has enlightened my mind and I don’t have to support that lazy preacher any longer to know what the Lord wants each of us to find out for ourselves.’ With that he walked out of Babylon never to return. Whole communities are progressing rapidly in the truth, and, in fact, the Lord is away ahead of us. Especially in the colored sections do we find them hungering and thirsting for righteousness. They are being satisfied and filled, and even before we mention living upon the earth they </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">tell us </span><span class="font4">that they know the Lord will permit them their earthly home. Surely the great multitude is increasing' One man offered to set up a large tent on his farm, so that we could invite all the interested in that community to hear the talks and study together. In the last six years the county has been rather thoroughly worked.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">NOT A MESSAGE OF HATE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The lady started in saying Jehovah’s witnesses ought to be shot for spreading hate against the Catholics. I said: ‘We don’t hate the Catholics, but they hate us. If we hated them we wouldn’t </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">call</span><span class="font4"> on them.’ She then invited me in and, after hearing a lecture record and my explaining that we were doing people a favor to call on them with the truth, she took </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Refugees.</span><span class="font4"> When getting this territory it was stated that no one in it was interested, yet I found all I could handle in one block of it. The police have tried to get me to quit doing sidewalk magazine witnessing in four out of seven towns. I refused, telling them I ought to obey God rather than men ; to which one laughed and said ‘All right!’ another said ‘O.K ’, and another said I was stubborn, and the last one made a lot of threats, while all four were bluffs. One way to encourage publishers to take part in sidewalk magazine witnessing is to show them in Acts 17:17 that Paul witnessed around the market places and while we are on busy street corners we are giving witness to people going to market to shop. At a home, after observing palm branches, crucifix and religious pictures on the walls, I figured they were just dull, irresponsible Irish Catholics. I buried myself in the phonograph speech, and when the Catholic religion was mentioned I never took a chance to look at them. The talk over, I asked: ‘How did you like it?’ You could have blown me down with a feather when they replied: ‘It’s the truth. The Catholic church want to own and rule everything.’ They were ready to give me a line-up on how big a racket the Catholic religion was They wanted to come to the next </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> study.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">H-YEAR-OLD MINNESOTAN GETS ACTIVE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“A model study was held in his home. He did not pay much attention at first, but later began to sit in and take part. When he learned about the magazine work he wanted to have part. He reported for field service one Saturday morning and went with the publisher to the first house. When he saw how it was done, he said, ‘That’s easy. I want to do it myself.’ So he took a supply of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Refugee</span><span class="font4"> booklets and went from door to door by himself. In the afternoon he reported again for street-corner witnessing with magazines in the downtown business. His first day’s report 7 hours, 1 book, 28 booklets, 13 magazines, 2 sound attendance. He has gone in the service at every opportunity since that day, and has attended </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study, service meeting, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> study regularly. He took careful note of evenings announced for back-calls. One of the publishers who had a model study arranged to take him along. After a week or two his Sunday-seb&lt; ol teacher missed him and went to see his mother about why he was not coining. His mother made the excuse he did not have any good pants Later the teacher came back with a new pair of pants for the boy. His mother said: ‘Now you will have to go to Sunday school to show your appreciation for the pants.’ He said: ‘I don’t want to go to Sunday school; I want to go to the Kingdom Hall, because that’s where God wants me to go. I would rather give the pants back than go to Sunday school.’ So he went out in the service instead. Next day he brought his mother along to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font4"> study. The same week she went out in service herself, and now has decided to give the pants back. His first month’s report as a publisher, starting with the 13th day of the month, shows: 40 hours, 111 booklets, 28 magazines.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ON SIDEWALKS OF NEW YORK (LOWER MANHATTAN)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Thursday evening before service meeting. A stranger walked into the hall. He related how he had gotten a magazine on the street corner because he saw it was </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> On examining the magazine he noticed the folder which directed him to Kingdom Hall. After a brief explanation, he agreed to stay. During meeting the record ‘Instruction’ was mentioned, and its importance during </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">campaign. After meeting this man requested hearing the record. A back-call was immediately arranged for this. After playing ‘Instruction’ and ‘Government and Peace’ at the back-call, he readily subscribed for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4"> He has started coming to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> study and thinks the method of study is excellent. The street-corner work ads as a beacon light in the stream of humanity, guiding the righteous to safety.”</span></p>

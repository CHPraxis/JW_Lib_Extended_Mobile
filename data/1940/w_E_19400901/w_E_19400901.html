<p><span class="font2">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation, and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power In heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man willfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for obedient ones of mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION Is a Theocracy called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ, which has now begun ; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom the people of good will that survive Armageddon shall carry out the divine mandate to “fill the earth” with a righteous race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">With especial pleasure we announce the new book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Religion, </span><span class="font2">released by its author, Judge Rutherford, at the recent Theocratic convention of Jehovah’s witnesses.

The book contains 384 pages, including color-illustrations, and a valuable reference index, all bound within beautifully embossed covers in a refreshing green eloth and gold-stamped. You will prize the author’s edition, which contains an autograph of a letter in his own handwriting addressed to the Theocratic ambassadors.

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark7"></a>'TIMES AND SEASONS’</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 3</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.&quot;—Ps. 2: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH THE GREAT THEOCRAT has enthroned his King Christ Jesus. He has given to his King all the nations of the earth for a possession. He specifically has commissioned his King to take action against those who have conspired against his anointed witnesses, who have been diligent in giving testimony concerning Jehovah's name and his Theocratic Government. These truths are clearly and forcefully stated in the Second Psalm. These words express Jehovah’s purpose, which purpose is absolutely certain to be carried out, because, God having purposed it, he will certainly do it; and everyone who believes on Jehovah and believes his Word will rely upon it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> The religionists and totalitarians not only have conspired against The Theocracy but have at the present time committed many overt acts against Jehovah’s representatives. This they have done within “the times and the seasons”, that is, from the time of the enthronement of Christ Jesus in 1914 until the present hour. Thus they have openly demonstrated their opposition against Jehovah God and his King. The conspirators have repeatedly provoked Jehovah, and now there is rapidly approaching the climax, and their wickedness has become more apparent every day. They have suppressed the kingdom message in almost all the earth, and it appears that within a very short time they will have completely suppressed the witness work. That will mean that Jehovah’s “strange work” is completed according to his will. It will also show that the conspirators have deliberately, and with malice aforethought, performed their wicked part against Jehovah and his witnesses. The closing of the witness work will certainly be the occasion when the religionists and allies will boastfully say: “Peace and safety.” This text, according to other versions, is rendered, “All’s well and all is safe.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Moffatt)</span><span class="font3"> That will be the “sign” or proof positive that Armageddon is about to break. The action of human creatures under the influence of demons follows a like course at all times. Judging the immediate future, therefore, by the past, the proclamation by the religionists and allies that “all’s well” will be the occasion for them to begin to congratulate and felicitate one another. In the midst of their drunken revelry they will say amongst themselves and to one another: ‘Peace and safety; we are all right now.’ That will be an occasion for feasting amongst them as in the case of Samson, when he was made the object of sport in the temple of Dagon. —Judg. 16: 23-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>s</sup> The apostle Paul, informing the faithful servants of God what to expect, leads up to this climax and tells them, when they see this sign, that is, when the proclamation of peace and safety is being made by the religionists and allies, “then sudden destruction cometh upon them.” This appears to mean that “the battle of that great day of God Almighty” will begin suddenly, like a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. The Greek word here rendered “sudden” is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">aiphnidios, </span><span class="font3">and means “not apparent from the outward surface of things”. Under the influence and power of the demons, and therefore in darkness as to God’s purpose, the opponents of The Theocratic Government will be taken entirely unawares. The Lord Jesus, speaking to his hearers of that very battle of Armageddon, said: “And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares [suddenly </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Diaglott,</span><span class="font3"> interlinear)]. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.” (Luke 21:34-36) Also Jesus said: “Watch ye therefore; for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning; lest coming suddenly, he find you sleeping. And what I say unto you, I say unto all, Watch.” —Mark 13:35-37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">* The “drunken” ones are asleep as to what is Jehovah’s purpose. The faithful ones who trust in God will be fully awake and know what is about to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“ That “sudden destruction”, which proceeds from Jehovah God, by his Word is called “his act, his strange act”. (Isa. 28:21) Christ Jesus will execute Jehovah’s judgment because to him is given the authority. (John 5: 27) “And to you who are troubled, rest with us; when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ; who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power; when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.” (2 Thess. 1: 7-10) Thus the Lord discloses to those who believe and obey him what will be the end of the opponents of The Theocratic Government. Jehovah’s enemies will suffer the same fate as that which came upon the firstborn of Egypt.— Heb. 11:28.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>6</sup> Armageddon, when once begun, will continue until every part of Satan’s organization is destroyed, and that beyond any hope of possible recovery. “For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.” (Matt. 24:21) That battle will mark the final end of the enemy. In the hour of proud, exulting self-security of the religionists and allies sudden destruction shall come upon them all because of their opposition to the great Theocrat. That “sudden destruction cometh” from Jehovah by Christ Jesus. “There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy.”—Jas. 4:12.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“THEY SHALL KNOW”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> The Scriptures emphatically declare that “they shall know that 1 am Jehovah”. (Ezek. 35: 15; 3G. 38; 38:23; 39:7, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Bev. Ver.)</span><span class="font3"> Hence it must be concluded that, when destruction is upon the conspirators, they will know that it is the execution of the judgment of Almighty God against them. The religionists could not well proclaim “Peace and safety” unless they had the co-operation of the political, commercial, judicial and other elements of Satan’s visible organization. Then together they will take bold action against Jehovah’s witnesses and companions. It would seem, therefore, that, when the battle of Armageddon begins, there will be a quick turning of the secular element of Satan’s organization against the clergy, that is, the religious leaders; because it is written: “God hath put [it] in their hearts to fulfil his will.”—Rev. 17:16,17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> It is reasonable that Jehovah will cause some supernatural demonstration, striking terror into the minds of the politicians, and commercial and other elements of humankind, and cause them to realize that they have been woefully deceived by the prognostications of the clergy, their religious leaders; therefore they will turn suddenly upon the religious leaders and destroy them, and thus unseat the old “whore” from their backs. (See Habakkuk 3:14.) A plain and unmistakable picture of such was made when Ammon, Moab and Mount Seir together marched to the assault of the covenant people of Jehovah God at Jerusalem and when the Mount Seir-ites, representing the religionists, were first destroyed, and the others destroyed each other. (See 2 Chronicles 20:20-23; and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> August 15, 1938.)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">BOASTERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">’ The Scriptures say that it is the religious leaders that first begin to brag and swagger about and say “Peace and safety”, and then “sudden destruction cometh upon them”; (according to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Moffatt</span><span class="font3"> rendering of the text) ‘destruction comes instant upon them’. The religionists, having reached the high point of their self-security, become reckless in their words and actions. They conclude that by their foul means they have accomplished their objective and that now they are free both from Jehovah’s witnesses and from the wrath of God himself. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, Protestant leaders, and Jewish rabbis, and all like religious chief ones, appear to be included in this class who say to each other: “All’s well now; we have things the way we wish them.’’ It was so in Jerusalem; which pictures what now is about to befall “Christendom”. Without a doubt Jerusalem was a type of “Christendom”, and what God through his prophet Jeremiah uttered concerning Jerusalem and her priests and prophets now applies with stronger force to the reality, that is, the priests and prophets of “Christendom”; as it is written : “For from the least of them even unto the gieat-est of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace ; when there is no peace. Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush; therefore they shall fall among them that fall; at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the Lord.” —Jer. 6:13-15.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> All fair-minded persons can here well understand that this publication is not for the purpose of holding up individuals to ridicule and scorn. The purpose is to call attention to what Jehovah God declared long ago and what he is certain to perform in completeness in the very near future. This publication of warning is for the benefit of those persons who are of good will toward God, and now published that they may learn what is the will of God concerning them. When they see the picture or type and then discern the fulfillment at this time, such enables them to determine what is their only proper course. The clergy today wrongfully charge Jehovah’s witnesses with intolerance toward Catholics, Protestants, and Jews. The facts are that Jehovah’s witnesses are intolerant to no one. They hold that every one has the right to freely express himself, and also that the teachings or doctrines put forth by any person or system may be properly and freely criticized. In no other way can the people learn just now which is correct. Jehovah’s witnesses proclaim the truth as it is written in the Scriptures, and which God commands all of his covenant people to proclaim at the present time. Those who have a desire to learn and who therefore have an ear to hear will give heed to what is published. No others will give heed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> It is the Lord God who spoke the things below against the religionists that oppose The Theocratic Government. Jehovah’s true servants on earth merely proclaim the message which God himself gives. The nation of Israel fell under the influence and power of the demons. The religious leaders forgot their covenant and their obligation to God and turned to religion. In that they made a picture, and the reality is now being fulfilled by the religionists of “Christendom”. For this reason it is written in the Scriptures that the things that came to pass in connection with the religionists of Jerusalem constitute types or ensamples for the instruction of those now upon the earth. (1 Cor. 10:11; Rom. 15: 4) Let those persons of good will therefore mark well the following texts, which texts of Scripture apply at this time to all those who oppose The Theocratic Government. “Wherefore their way shall b§ unto them as slippery ways in the darkness; they shall be driven on, and fall therein; for I will bring evil upon them, even the • year of their visitation, saith the Lord. And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err. I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing; they commit adultery, and walk in lies; they strengthen also the hands of evil doers, that none doth return from his wickedness; they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah. Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts concerning the prophets, Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land. Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you; they make you vain; they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord. They say still unto them that despise me, The Lord hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you.” (Jer. 23:12-17) “Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none. Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients. The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled; I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the Lord.” (Ezek. 7 : 25-27) “And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies; they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord God. Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace, and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and, lo, others daubed it with untempered morter; say unto them which daub it with untempered morter, that it shall fall; there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, 0 great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it. Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it J Therefore thus saith the Lord God, I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones, in my fury, to consume it. So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered morter, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I am the Lord. Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered morter; and will say unto you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it; to wit, the prophets of Israel, which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, saith the Lord God.”-Ezek. 13:9-16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">&quot; Jerusalem became idolatrous by adopting the traditions of men and yielding to religion, and in that Jerusalem pictured “Christendom”, which in like manner has become idolatrous at the present time. The leaders in religion of “Christendom”, being now under the influence and power of the demons, are in a condition exactly like that which existed in Jerusalem immediately before its destruction. God caused to be written concerning idolatrous Jerusalem what should suddenly come upon her, and this foretells what shall suddenly come upon “Christendom”. “Christendom” is a burden to all people that hold fast to her religious doctrines and practices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">TRAVAIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">” The World War brought great pains upon “Christendom” likened unto the beginning of birth pains, concerning which the Lord Jesus said: “All these are the beginning of sorrows.” (Matt. 24:8; Mark 13: 8, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font3"> For four years the World War raged; then the Lord cut short those pains in order that “this gospel of the kingdom” might be preached to the people before the final end. (Matt. 24:14, 21, 22) The period of time following 1918 until Armageddon is a period in which the Lord uses his witnesses to gather unto himself his “other sheep” that shall form the “great multitude”. (Rev. 7:9-17) When Armageddon begins, that trouble, declare the Scriptures, will be like “travail upon a woman with child”. That travail shall be far worse than spiritual Jacob’s trouble in 1917 and 1918. During 1917 and 1918 particularly God’s covenant people on earth, pictured by “Jacob”, endured great affliction. God’s covenant people were saved out of that trouble, and concerning that trouble it is written: “Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child! wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness! Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it [in the previous history of spiritual Israel]; it is even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he [Jehovah’s faithful servants, composing the ‘faithful and wise servant’ class] shall be saved out of it.” —Jer. 30: 6, 7.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> In “Christendom’s” approaching great trouble, which is called travail as of a woman giving birth, “Christendom” will not be saved out of that, but shall die with no possible hope of ever being revived. By way of illustrating such trouble Jesus said: “A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come; but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.”—John 16: 21.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>1S</sup> When the battle of Armageddon begins the cries of those who have opposed The Theocracy will be like the travail of a woman in the death throes. (Isa. 42:14) The result will be, as stated at Genesis 35:16-18: “And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath; and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour. And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also. And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died,) that she called his name Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin.” </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">An</span><span class="font3">other apt illustration is found at 1 Samuel 4:19, 20 concerning the daughter-in-law of Eli. She was with child and about to be delivered, and when she heard of the battle of Shiloh and the result she “travailed; for her pains came upon her”, and she died. That was a picture of Jehovah’s “strange act”, which seemed strange to Israel in that Jehovah God would permit the Philistines to be victorious in a war with Israel. There Israel pictured unfaithful “Christendom” because Israel had been unfaithful, and the Philistines were God’s executioners. At Armageddon there wil_l be no “twilight sleep” to benumb the pains of “Christendom” giving birth to what she had hoped to be her own government. Her pain will end in her complete destruction. “Christendom’s” degeneracy will make her pains all the more intense. This is fully supported by the words of the text: “And they shall not escape.” (1 Thess. 5: 3) The word “not” here used translates the double negative in the Greek, and hence the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Version</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font3"> render it in this manner: “In no wise shall they escape.” According to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott:</span><span class="font3"> “They shall by no means escape.” When the religionists begin to sing, felicitate and hail each other as having accomplished their purpose, and when they say to each other, “Now we are all fixed, we are in peace and safety,” sudden destruction shall fall upon them from the hand of the Lord, and by no means can they possibly escape.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> All totalitarian rulers and religious supporters are enemies of The Theocratic Government. None of the enemies of God shall escape, because he will get all of them. Armageddon will be a clean-up oi everything that has opposed Jehovah in the establishment of his government of righteousness. The hand of the Lord will not miss any of the enemies, no matter where they seek to hide: “Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies; thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.”—Ps. 21:8.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">” The clergy of various religious organizations have assumed the position of shepherds of their respective flocks, and they have readily and gladly answered to the title of shepherd or pastor. They have made the political and commercial prominent men the principal ones of their respective flocks, and con cerning all of these, when Armageddon is on, the Lord through the prophet Jeremiah says: “And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.” (Jer. 25: 35) That means complete destruction of all opponents of The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> The following scripture written long ago is clearly appropriately applied to the day of Armageddon : “I saw the Lord standing upon the altar [place of ‘Christendom’s’ false or demon worship]; and he said, Smite the lintel of the door [entrance into ‘Christendom’], that the posts </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[(Revised Version) </span><span class="font3">thresholds; the way or path of the clergy] may shake; and cut them in the head, all of them </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[(Revised Version)</span><span class="font3"> and break them in pieces on the head of all of them]; and I will slay the last of them with the sword; he that fleeth of them shall not flee away [escape (R.J<sup>7</sup>.)], and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered. Though they dig into hell [Sheol; that is, dig holes in the earth to shield them from the bombs of airplanes and gas attacks], thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven [take to the air in planes to escape from the trouble], thence will I bring them down; and though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel [rocky caves in the mountains], I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea [in submarine boats], thence will I command the serpent [the bringer of evil and calamity], and he shall bite them [destroy them]; and though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword [Christ, the Executioner of Jehovah's commands], and it shall slay them; and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.”—Amos 9:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> Again God caused his same prophet to write concerning the opponents of The Theocracy : ‘‘Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself; neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself; neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself. And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked [the shameful coward] in that day, saith the Lord.”—Amos 2:14-16.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> Neither Gog, nor Hitler, nor any other leaders of the opponents of The Theocracy will escape the wrath of Almighty God. Jehovah’s Executive Officer will strike down all the opponents. God’s wrath will be upon the prince of darkness and all the demons (Eph. 6 :12), and upon all human creation that holds to or remains under the influence and power of the demons. All such are in darkness as to the purpose of Jehovah, and all are openly opposed to The Theocratic Government ; all of such are enemies of Jehovah God, and all shall perish. That battle will mark the final end of wickedness. Not one of the wicked will find the way of escape.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">LIGHT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> “Light is sown for the righteous.” Righteousness is given only to those who are fully trusting Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, and who continue to devote themselves entirely to The Theocracy. All such love Jehovah God and joyfully serve him. For the comfort and hope of those faithful servants Jehovah has caused to be written these words: “Ye that love the Lord, hate evil; he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked. Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart. Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.” —Ps. 97 :10-12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> Now the entire world lies in the wicked one. (1 John 5: 19, A.R.l<sup>7</sup>.) The faithful servants of Jehovah are no part of this wicked world. (John 15: 19) Darkness covers the earth, the ruling elements, and gross darkness the people, who follow the worldly leaders. (Isa. 60:2) In contrast to those who are held in chains of darkness the apostle says to those who are the faithful anointed servants of the Lord Jesus words of consolation: “But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.”—1 Thess. 5:4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">” These words of the apostle apply to the remnant now on the earth and who remain true and steadfast in their devotion to God. These are the ones mentioned in the preceding chapter by the apostle in these words: “We which are alive, and remain unto the coming of the Lord . . . Then we which are alive and remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord.”—1 Thess. 4:15,17.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> The ones here who are with the Lord are the ones who are in the temple and therefore in the light, and since the coming of the Lord to the temple the light of God shines upon Christ Jesus at the temple and that light upon Christ Jesus is reflected upon those of the temple company. (Rev. 11:19) All who remain in the temple are in the light and are duly informed of God’s purpose. All who flee to Jehovah’s organization under Christ receive light and protection if they continue faithful in their devotion to The Theocracy and in obedience to the rules thereof. Thus the Lord has given assurance to the remnant and to their companions of his protection and blessing upon them during the period of the expression of his wrath.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>25</sup> It was in 1926 that the Lord began the pouring out of the fifth vial upon the city of the wicked organizations that rule the world, and concerning which it is written: “And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain, and blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds.” (Rev. 16: 10,11) The earthly, religious leaders have been in darkness since, and they continue to blaspheme the name of Jehovah God by claiming that they will rule the earth instead of the great Theocrat through Christ Jesus.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>26</sup> Since 1918 Jehovah’s great ‘Elect Servant’, Christ Jesus, has brought the faithful out of darkness and into the full light and has used them to proclaim “this gospel of the kingdom” and to declare the name of the Most High. Those persons in the religious organizations who desire righteousness, and who have come in contact with this kingdom message and heard it and believed it, have fled to the Lord; and concerning them it is written: “To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.” (Isa. 42:7) The Lord has said to those thus held in prison by the religious institutions: “Go forth; and to them that are in darkness, Shew yourselves.” (Isa. 49: 9) Until 1918 the fully consecrated were in a large degree held as prisoners by religionists and they were in a measure of darkness, but then when the Lord came to his temple he brought these faithful ones out of darkness into the marvelous light. (1 Pet. 2:9) “Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son.” (Col. 1:13) All such faithful ones who continue in the light must continue to show forth the praises of Jehovah God and his King. “God is light, and ... if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship,” partnership, with him and with one another; fellowship with God and Christ and with all the members of Zion. (1 John 1:5-7) This fellowship or partnership means that all of the remnant are walking obediently with their God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>27</sup> All those who are of the light, and who continue in the light, will not be in doubt as to what is the purpose of Jehovah; hence the apostle adds: “Ye . . . are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief.” At the beginning of the “day of the Lord” that day did come upon them as a thief, and it was not until 1922 that these faithful ones knew the Lord had come to his temple, but there is no need now for them to be in darkness in that part of “the day” when “the sign” is made manifest. When that sign does clearly appear to the faithful, and sudden destruction comes upon the enemy, no one who tells the truth will be in doubt. At the climax of the day of the Lord the faithful are not deceived by the religionists’ cry of “Peace and safety”, nor are they in darkness, and that time of “the day” does not come upon them as a thief. They see it clearly. According to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font3"> this is the meaning of the text: “That the day upon you as upon thieves should lay hold.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> The practice of thieves is to come in the night, when darkness envelopes everything. God’s law is that if the thief is caught breaking up or into the house in the nighttime he may be killed with impunity and without violating the everlasting covenant. (Ex. 22: 2) Mark how this law of God applies to the opposers of The Theocracy. The religious leaders and the principal ones of their flock, and including the “evil servant”, are enveloped in gross darkness, and in the darkness they attempt to steal the peoples’ devotion, faith, worship and service from the Lord God and cause the people to follow men as leaders, and to that end they cry out: “Peace and safety!” That cry is false. Immediately then they are slain by the hand of the Lord. First there comes upon them the judgment or “curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth; for everyone that stealeth shall be cut off”; and “it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name”.—Zech. 5: 1-4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> This judgment, long ago entered, will be executed at Armageddon. The thieves thus breaking in the great Executioner, Christ Jesus, will destroy. Note that the scripture above quoted from Zechariah 5 uses these words: “Him that sweareth falsely by my name.” That could mean none other than the “evil servant”, that is, those who once made a covenant with God to do his will and who have since violated that covenant by turning to the world and against God and joining with other religionists to oppose The Theocratic Government and to aid the religionists in stealing the devotion of the people away from Jehovah. That is exactly what the “evil servant” is now engaged in and has been for a time, and, addressing them, Jehovah by his prophet says: “When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers. Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue fram-eth deceit. Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother’s son.” —Ps. 50:18-20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>80</sup> Those who were once enlightened but who became unfaithful and have since consorted with religionists have observed the religious leaders stealing the people away from The Theocratic Government and join such thieves in saying: “Where is there any evidence of The Theocracy?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>81</sup> This they have done instead of giving the alarm against the thief. They have therefore become partakers with the thieves. All the thieves who attempt to steal the people away from The Theocratic Government willfully and deliberately violate God’s law, and, while in the act of stealing, Jehovah, by his Executioner Christ Jesus, slays them. Sudden destruction comes upon them, and no one shall find a way of escape.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>82</sup> Is there any reason or excuse for anyone of the faithful remnant to now be in doubt about the purpose of Jehovah? Not the slightest. The apostle emphasizes this fact by saying: “Ye are all the children of light [(Z?.F.) For ye are all sons of light], and the children of the day; we are not of the night, nor of darkness.” (1 Thess. 5: 5) “God is light, and in him [there] is no darkness.” He is “the Father of lights”. (Jas. 1:17) By Zion, his “woman” (organization), God has brought forth and acknowledged as his sons the members of the temple company and these are ‘all taught of God’. (Isa. 54:13; John 6:46) Hence such are not in the darkness, but are the sons of God, the sons of light. To such Jehovah reveals his light and makes known to them in this time of darkness his purpose and what is his immediate purpose concerning the wicked.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>33</sup> With the coming of the day of the Lord great darkness came upon the religionists and political leaders. They had looked upon the earth and said in substance: “This earth is ours, and we will take it and hold it for ourselves.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>54</sup> Religionists mixed up with the political, dictatorial selfish leaders, and are therefore guilty, according to the Scriptures, of spiritual adultery. (Jas. 4: 4) Concerning spiritual thieves and drunkards the Lord says: “They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof. The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief. The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me; and disguiseth his face. In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselvbs in the daytime; they know not the light. For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death; if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.” (Job 24:13-17) Such persons, being extremely selfish, hate The Theocratic Government, and they love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil.—John 3:19.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“THE SIGN” NEAR</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>35</sup> All those of the faithful remnant now clearly see that religion is the instrument by which Satan has blinded the leaders and the people and has caught them all in his snare. They see that all nations have fallen under the influence and power of demons, Satan being the chief thereof, and for that reason all such are against God and against his King and they are against everyone who announces The Theocratic Government. There cannot be the slightest doubt that the nations have suppressed the truth of and concerning The Theocracy and have restrained the witnesses of Jehovah, and they have done so at the command of Satan and his horde of demons. Almost all the countries of Europe have fallen under the power of the totalitarian rule. The spirit of arbitrary rule is rampant in every part of the earth. That arbitrary totalitarian rule is against The Theocratic Government and violently opposes all who proclaim Jehovah and his King. What does it mean? It is “the sign” that Satan with his horde of unclean spirits has gathered the nations for “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”, and now only do we await the “sign” when the battle shall begin.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>36</sup> The witness work for The Theocracy appears to be about done in most of the countries of “Christendom”. This does not disturb the faithful servants of Jehovah God, for the reason that they know that the witness work is God’s work, “his strange work,” and that it must come to a close before God’s “strange act” begins. They also know that it could not come to a close until God’s due time. Jehovah, by his Servant and Vindicator, Christ Jesus, is carrying out Jehovah’s purpose. He makes no mistakes. Nothing can come to pass without the permission of God and his King. Therefore we know that all things are working together for-good to the faithful who love God and who are called according to his purpose. (Rom. 8: 28) The faithful followers of Christ Jesus, therefore, rest in peace of mind, anxiously and watchfully waiting for the appearance of the sign for the battle to begin.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3T</sup> Many of the nations of earth are now at war. But that war is not a part of the battle of Armageddon. When “the battle of that great day of God Almighty” begins the nations of the earth will be done. It is quite probably before that time that the nations will have patched up some kind of peace arrangement amongst themselves. Now the totalitarian rule has suppressed the Theocratic message, and it should be expected that when they quit fighting amongst themselves all the totalitarian rulers will turn their attention to the complete suppression of everything pertaining to The Theocratic Government.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>38</sup> What, then, does it mean that The Theocratic Government is now suppressed in many nations? It means that the hour is rapidly approaching when the “sign” of Armageddon will be clearly revealed and ail who are on the side of Jehovah will see and appreciate it. That “sign” will be the announcement “Peace and safety”; which sign cannot fully appear as long as this world-wide witness work of The Theocracy is carried on in the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>39</sup> Shall any of God’s people now sigh and cry because they see that the witness work is coining to a close? Not at all. On the contrary, the faithful will rejoice. They know that it is God’s work. Their trust is entirely in Jehovah and in his King. Therefore, instead of being sad and in despair, the faithful will continue to say: “But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation. I will sing unto the Lord, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.”—Ps. 13: 5, 6.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">‘“Jehovah stopped the time of trouble or World War in 1918 that the opportunity might be afforded for his servants to proclaim his kingdom and his name throughout the earth. Since then Jehovah’s witnesses have enjoyed a blessed season of activity in the service of proclaiming the kingdom. “This gospel of the kingdom” has been preached throughout “Christendom”. God’s warning has been sounded, and the faithful witnesses have observed that Christ Jesus the great Judge has been gathering unto himself his “other sheep”, the “multitude”. That multitude is one without definite number, and it embraces those of good will who shall seek the Lord prior to the breaking of the battle of Armageddon. When the great Theocrat and his King see fit to close the witness work completely, then all who love God and his King will rejoice, because they know that deliverance is very near. Every one of the faithful will now be watching for the “sign”. We know that we are now within “the times and the seasons” when the kingdom of God is being put into power. All the physical facts in the light of prophecy prove this is the correct conclusion. “The signs of the times” have been and are clear, and next we shall see the sign that Armageddon is about to begin and deliverance is very near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ADMONITION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>41</sup> The apostle, under the direction of the Lord, writing to the church, then directs the faithful as to the proper course of action for them to take. The apostle who wrote those words is now in the spirit with the Lord. The remnant are in the earth with the Lord. The admonition to the faithful on earth is: “Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.”—1 Thess. 5: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">*<sup>2</sup> Although the opportunity for world-wide witness work is closing, that will furnish no excuse for any of the consecrated to sleep or be indifferent. All the servants of God must now be alert as to their privileges of service and perforin that service as they have opportunity. Also they must be alert to the fact that the Vindicator of Jehovah’s name is directing and carrying forward God’s purpose, and that the vindication of Jehovah’s name is the all-important thing, and each one of the faithful will greatly desire to have some part in that great event. They must be awake and alert as to the movement of the enemy and be able to quickly discern the sure “sign” that the battle is about to begin.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>43</sup> Therefore the apostle continues his admonition: “Let us watch and be sober.” Such must abstain from sleepy dullness and be on the lookout for the kingdom interests and for the resistance of the enemy at all times. Drunkenness, resulting from the wine of Satan’s policy, brings on a stupor. Avoid such. Drink freely of the wine (that is, the joy of the Lord) now in the kingdom. Rejoice that we are privileged to be on the Lord’s side, fighting for The Theocratic Government. That wine does not produce a stupor, but rather sharpens the outlook of God’s people and thrills the heart. That wine enables us to appreciate the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Of course, the word “wine” here is symbolically used and means the joy of the Lord.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>44</sup> Since the faithful servants of Jehovah are “of the day”, they must deport themselves accordingly. Concerning this the Scriptural admonition is: “For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night. But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.”—1 Thess. 5:7,8.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">*’ The light of this day of the Lord is too bright to permit anyone of the faithful to do wrong particularly toward his fellow Christians and get away with it. The Lord looks upon the motive, that is, upon the heart. To be sober means to be calm, and keenly awake, serious-minded, steady, and very courageous, and fully trusting in the Lord. Thus the faithful will be strengthened for whatever comes to pass. Know this : that the will of God shall be done on earth as in heaven. Rely entirely on the Almighty, the Most High, and upon his Executive Officer, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>46</sup> To be properly equipped the apostle’s advice is: ‘Put on the breastplate of faith and love.’ That means the complete heart devotion to The Theocrat and his government, full confidence and reliance upon the Lord, and an unfailing devotion to God and Christ. The “breastplate” symbolizes the heart condition, which means an unqualified devotion to Jehovah. The great fight is about to take place, and the faithful must be equipped. “And for an helmet, the hope of salvation.” Be sure that the mind is fed upon the Word of God as he now reveals the meaning thereof to those who love him. “Study to show thyself approved unto God.” (2 Tim. 2: 15) Confidently rely upon the Lord God, with full expectation that he is certain to deliver those who love him; therefore let the heart rejoice in his salvation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>47</sup> The vindication of the name of Jehovah is certain and sure. Salvation to all those who remain faithful to God is likewise sure. It appears that salvation may include the preservation of some of the remnant through the battle of Armageddon and their remaining for a time on the earth beyond Armageddon. Having a knowledge of Jehovah’s purpose, and walking in the light, is a safe guide for the head or mind and keeps one in the right way. The helmet fitting over the head illustrates this. Having on the helmet, which is also a symbol of war, means that those who have it on will be properly guided in the right way and have the mind at all times set upon the things pertaining to The Theocracy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>44</sup> It is absolutely certain that quite soon God’s wrath against all enemies will be forcefully expressed, but that wrath is not against those who love him: “For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.” (1 Thess. 5:9,10) The willful opposers of The Theocracy are designated as “brute beasts, made to be . . . destroyed”. (2 Pet. 2:12) Jehovah has been long-suffering with such “vessels of wrath”, fitted for destruction, and now the day of reckoning is near when he will clear out the enemy. But that wrath is not for his faithful servants. Instead, God has provided salvation for those who love and serve him.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>48</sup> It is now the day of the Lord Jesus Christ. He “died for us”, and all those who remain true and steadfast in their devotion and service to him have full assurance of salvation and deliverance. All those redeemed and who died faithful in Christ are now on the other side of the veil, while the remnant faithful are yet on the earth; and so within the meaning of the Scripture all such shall for ever be with the Lord. —1 Thess. 4:14-17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">COMFORT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>50</sup> Without a doubt the inspired words of the apostle were recorded long ago for the express benefit of the faithful servants of Jehovah now on the earth. These are “perilous times”; and this fact all thinking persons discern. Those who are against The Theocracy know nothing for their comfort. Like the mad flood of the swollen Jordan, they are rushing on to certain death. God’s faithful people now on the earth see the great sorrow and distress upon the people, and it is their privilege and duty to faithfully bear witness to those who will hear, telling them of The Theocracy, and that such is the only means of escape to safety and life. It is also their high duty and responsibility to comfort and edify one another by speaking together of the great truths which Jehovah through Christ Jesus now reveals to those of this day. All the servants of Jehovah who are yet in the organism of flesh are weak in themselves; but they are strong in the Lord, if they rely entirely upon him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>51</sup> The mission of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> is to call attention to the gracious provisions which Jehovah has made for those who love him and to continue to sound the warning within the hearing of those who desire to learn the way of righteousness and life. In obedience to the Scriptural admonition by the Lord study classes are maintained and well attended by those who love The Theocratic Government. All such will keep their mind and heart fixed upon the great Theocrat and the blessings his government will bring.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>52</sup> For many centuries the lovers of righteousness have centered their hearts and hopes upon The Theocratic Government. By their lifeblood they have borne testimony to their faith in and devotion to that blessed government. Now the great Theocracy under Christ the King is here, and his rule of righteousness shall endure forever and shall fill the earth with joy and with a people to the praise of the Almighty God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">” There are still opportunities of service, and none of the faithful will neglect to avail themselves of such. We may be sure that to his people who are sober and watchful the Lord will make clear the “sign” immediately preceding the beginning of the battle of that great day. Constant vigilance and watchfulness are very necessary now. Complete and entire trust and confidence in the Lord also are necessary. “Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee; because he trusteth in thee. Trust ye in the Lord for ever; for in the Lord JEHOVAH is everlasting strength.” (Isa. 2G:3, 4) When the “sign” of Armageddon does clearly appear may it not then be that the Lord’s promise applies to his people, to wit: “Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee; hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.”—Isa. 26: 20.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>54</sup> All who love Jehovah and his King and kingdom will be delighted to “comfort one another with these words”; which he has caused to be written aforetime for their admonition and hope: “Blessed are all [the people] that put their trust in him.” (Ps. 2:12) “Blessed be the Sovereign Lord! day by day he car-rieth a load for us; God himself is our salvation.” —Psalm 68: 19, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark9"></a>DESIRE OF ALL NATIONS COMES</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come; and I will fill this house [temple] ^““^with glory, saith the Lord of hosts.” Although it is about 2,500 years since those words were delivered through the prophet Haggai (chapter 2 verse 7), the words have not failed. Today all nations are ashake. The shaking began in 1914. Likewise the “desire of all nations” has come. The coming is to the real temple, which is the “house of prayer for all nations”. The people of good will have a real desire for the coming of the true Messiah and Deliverer; but till now they have not been able to discern him, because of the blinding influence of the enemy Satan and his demons. Therefore Christ Jesus primarily must be “the delight of all nations&quot; when the people of good will know him, because he is God’s representative. He has come to the temple as the vicegerent of Jehovah God. He is the “Seed” of the promise: “In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.”—Gen. 22:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It appears to be clearly settled that Jehovah God will not permit the nations to bring about their own peace and safety and mend their conditions. (1 Thess. 5: 3) The shaking financially and politically continues to increase each day, and all over the world the rulers are in perplexity and the distress of the people increases. The shaking of the nations constituting Satan’s organization on earth continues, and it will continue until the final destruction. All things made by Satan and which come under the control of Satan must go down to destruction, as proved at Hebrews 12: 26, 27. Nothing shall be able to stand in this time of shaking except those who are in the “secret place of the Most High”, abiding under the shadow of his protection, and those who place themselves under the protection of his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. He is now at the temple for judgment of all nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the final struggle between the Jews and the Romans, in A.D. 70, the temple built by Herod at Jerusalem was destroyed. This was the temple to which Jesus came a few days before his violent death and out of which he drove the religious thieves with a whip made of cords. “And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves; and said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.”—Matt. 21:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The first temple built at Jerusalem was by King Solomon and it foretold the building of the real temple or royal house of Jehovah God by a Greater-than-Solomon. The temple later built by Governor Zerubbabel, and that built by King Herod, took the place of Solomon’s demolished temple and served the same purpose. In the last temple Jesus taught the people. “And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him, and could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.” (Luke 19:47,48) That this temple was prophetic of the real temple of God is shown by Jesus’ words at that time: “Take these things from hence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise. . . . Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things? Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days? But he spake of the temple of his body [the body of Christ, which is the church of which Jesus is Head]. When therefore he was risen from the dead, His disciples remembered that he had said this unto them: and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.” —John 2 :15-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus himself is the Chief Corner Stone or Head Stone of the royal temple of Jehovah God. He told the Jewish clergy as much: “Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes? Therefore say I unto you, The Kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken ; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.&quot; (Matt. 21: 42-44) This is fully corroborated by the apostolic words addressed to the faithful followers of Christ Jesus who are made members of “his body”, the church. (See Ephesians 2:18-22.) Compare now certain things in connection with that ancient prophetic temple with what Jesus, the Head of the real temple, does.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Solomon the anointed king prepared the stones and other material for the temple builded by him, and brought them together and erected the building without a great noise “And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither; so that there was neither hammer, nor axe, nor any tool of iron, heard in the house while it was in building.” (1 Ki. 6:7) The real or royal temple of God is made of “living stones”, that is to say, living creatures represented by stones, of which the Lord Christ Jesus is the Chief Stone. “If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious. To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious, ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I [Jehovah] lay in Sion [Jehovah’s organization] a chief corner stone, elect, precious [Christ Jesus as anointed King] : and he that bc-lieveth on him shall not be confounded.”—1 Pet. 2 -. 3-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The temple made of these living stones constitutes the royal house or royal priesthood and holy nation of Jehovah God. (1 Pet. 2:9,10) These living stones were in course of selection and preparation from the day that Jesus selected his disciples until the time of his coming to gather together unto himself those who constitute the temple class These living stones, which constitute the real temple, are brought together and erected into a building of God without noise or ostentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The holy temple is the building of Jehovah God. The coming of Christ Jesus to that temple is first marked by his appearing and gathering unto himself those who have been the faithful followers of Christ Jesus. Those who had died prior to his coming and who had been faithful unto death would be the first ones gathered to himself, being resurrected from the dead. Then the remnant, the faithful ones remaining alive on the earth, would be gathered, being brought into a unity of understanding and faith and action as witnesses of Jehovah and under the headship of Christ Jesus Concerning this the apostle writes: “Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him.”—2 Thess 2:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Solomon was enthroned, and in the fourth year of reign he began work on the temple, in the spring of the \ ear In A.D. 29 Jesus was anointed with God’s spirit to be the King in Jehovah’s Theocracy. In the fourth year after he was anointed to be King and Head of Jehovah’s temple class, to wit, in the spring of the year 33 (A.D.), Christ Jesus, the Greater-than-Solomon, offered himself as King and as the Chief Corner Stone in the temple of God and was rejected by the Jews and shortly thereafter was killed It was three and one-half years, therefore in the fourth year, after his anointing, that he thus in a small way fulfilled the prophecy made by Solomon in connection with the beginning of the prophetic temple. The greater and complete fulfillment of this prophecy must be after the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During his last week before his death the disciples came out of the temple of Jerusalem with Jesus. They were talking to him about the temple. “And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? Verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.” (Matt. 24:2) Evidently in this same conversation Jesus had told them something about raising up the temple of his body at his second coming. It was then that they propounded the question to him: “Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign [proof] of thy coming, and of the end of the world?” (Matt. 24: 3) The answer of Jesus then given is important in fixing the date of his coming. Jesus told his disciples what would be the sign of the “end of the world”, which event would mean the end of Satan’s rule without interference and would mean the beginning of the rule of Christ Jesus, earth’s rightful King. He said to them that the first sorrows that would come upon Satan’s organization would be the World War, followed by famine, pestilence and earthquake; that then there would follow distress of nations, with perplexity. The end of the world would necessarily mark the time when Jesus would be placed upon his throne and interference with Satan’s rule would begin from heaven. That which Jesus told his disciples concerning the end of the world began to have its fulfillment, as is well known from the facts, in the latter half of A.D. 1914, with the beginning of the World War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No doubt the disciples were familiar with the text of the prophecy of Ezekiel, even though they did not understand its meaning. They knew of the text of Ezekiel 21 • 25-27 concerning the overthrow of King Zedekiah, especially that part which declared: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“I</span><span class="font3"> will overturn, overturn, overturn it [the typical kingdom of the Jews] ; and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.” Naturally they would be looking forward to the time when this prophecy would be fulfilled and when ‘He whose right it is would come’. They would know that in some future time this prophecy must be fulfilled. The decree of Jehovah pronounced against Zedekiah the last king of Jerusalem was enforced in the year 606 B.C., when the temple built by Solomon was destroyed. Then began the “times of the Gentiles”, the typical theocratic kingdom being suspended. (Luke 21:24) Other scriptures show that from 606 B.C. until the coming of the real Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus would be a period of seven symbolic “times”, each “time” being of three hundred and sixty literal years, or a total period of twenty-five hundred and twenty years; and therefore such period of time would necessarily end in A.D. 1914. (See Leviticus 26: 18; Daniel 4 • 16, 23, 32 ) Such is further proof that in the autumn season of 1914 is the correct date for Christ Jesus to take his power and to begin to exercise it over things pertaining to the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The primary purpose of the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ is the vindication of Jehovah’s name, upon which name the Devil and all his organization have brought great reproach. When Jesus was raised from the dead by the power of Jehovah and exalted into the heaven no doubt he was then anxious to begin immediately the work of vindicating his Father’s name. He was then told by his Father he must wait until God’s due time in which to begin his work of vindication; as prophesied at Psalm 110:1: “The Lord [Jehovah] said unto my Lord [Jesus], Sit thou at my-right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.” Hebrews 10:12,13 comments on this prophecy concerning Jesus, saying- “But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.” The end of that period of time of waiting must of necessity be the same as the end of the time of waiting mentioned by the prophet Ezekiel (21-25-27). Both of these prophecies would mark the time when Jehovah would send forth his King whose right it is to rule, concerning whom Jehovah says: “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.”—Ps. 2: 6, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The taking of power by Jehovah’s King Christ Jesus is the taking of power by Jehovah God over things pertaining to the earth. The Lord gave further evidence, at Revelation 11:17,18, as to the time when Jehovah, by his King, would exercise power over things pertaining to the earth. The faithful servants of Jehovah there speak: “We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come.” It was in A.D. 1914 that the nations became angry, which was further proof of the fact that Christ Jesus was then placed upon his throne. Revelation 11 then follows the above prophecy with the statement that “the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament”. (Verse 19) In 606 B C the ark of the covenant was removed from the Most Holy of the temple and was never recovered and put back there The ark of the testament or covenant symbolically ropresmts the presence of Jehovah God and is therefore proof that His chief representative Christ Jesus had come to the temple and hence Jehovah himself was representatively present. —Mal. 3:1-3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As Solomon began the erection of the temple in the fourth year of his reign, and as Jesus at his first advent came and offered himself three and one-half years after his anointing as King, we should expect that the coming of the King Christ Jesus to the temple of Jehovah would be in the fourth year, to wit, three and one-half years after the beginning of his reign in 1914, and that therefore the time lor his coming to the temple of Jehovah would be in the spring of A.D. 1918. This date is further and strongly corioborated by the events that came to pass in 1918, and whnii faits exactly fit the prophecy, proving that then “Ilie desire of all nations&quot; came to the temple and was laid as the Chief Corner Stone in Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was God’s express will that Christ Jesus should do a preparatory work before coming to his temple, described as ‘preparing the way before the Lord’. Jehovah had used Elijah the prophet to do a work. His work foreshadowed a like work to be done by Jehovah’s people during the period of time designated as the time of ‘preparing the way before the Lord'. Elijah’s work was a vindication work and foreshadowed the restoring of truth to the people of God which had long been hidden by the practice of Satanic religion Jesus spoke of what may be called ‘the Elijah work’ to be done by his faithful followers, at Matthew 17: 11. Christ Jesus directed this work. The facts show that the magazine </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> began to be published in July, 1879, and that for forty years prior to 1918 there was a work carried on by the people of God within the realms of “Christendom” which work restored to God's people those fundamental truths which had long been hidden from them by religion. During that period of time the members and true followers of Christ Jesus forsook Satan’s organization, particularly &quot;organized religion”, and devoted themselves entirely to the Lord God. This was the work of Christ Jesus in preparing the way before the Lord, which work must be done before his coming to the temple of God, as prophesied, to wit: &quot;Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me; and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in; behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts.” (Mal. 3:1) This shows he was the delight and desire of Jehovah God’s “holy nation”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The purpose of his coming to the temple of Jehovah is to execute judgment as the great Judge. This must take place before the coming battle of Armageddon; and since all the members of the true temple class must be judged by him, it must take place before the last “living stones” are taken from the earth. The Lord’s coming must be while some of the faithful temple class are yet in the flesh. During the time that Jehovah’s Messenger, Christ Jesus, was preparing the way before Jehovah the interests of God’s kingdom were committed to those who had made a covenant to do God’s will and who had been invited to a place in the kingdom. As to their faithfulness in giving attention to these kingdom interests the Lord must consider the facts before choosing and approving them. &quot;Judgment must begin at the house of God.” (1 Pet. 4: 17) That judgment would determine the faithfulness of God’s people on earth up to that period of time. The judgment is a time of fiery tests, that is, tests that try one as though by fire. As foretold: “But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth ? for he is like </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ sope: and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.”—Mal. 3:2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All the “sons of Levi”, or Levites, belonged to God and served at his temple in Jerusalem. The Levites picture all who are begotten of God’s spirit and who are in line for the priesthood, the “royal priesthood” under the High Priest Christ Jesus the King. It is quite clear from the prophecy that the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple would be marked by severe trials resulting in separating the disapproved from the approved, in order that the approved ones might render a faithful service unto Jehovah God in righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Events that came to pass in the spring of 1918 exactly corroborate the other testimony that 1918, in the spring of the year, marks the time of the coming of the Lord Jesus to Jehovah’s temple. At that time there came upon the consecrated people of God a fiery trial. These had been for some time doing the work of proclaiming the truth In 1918 the work designated “the Elijah work” was killed due to action by the enemy religionists. Many of the Lord’s witnesses throughout the land were at that time imprisoned, and many others were restrained of their liberty of action as to giving testimony in the name of the Lord. Many false brethren arose who had professed to be followers of Christ Jesus but whose love then grew cold and they turned against others who were serving God and his kingdom. It was in that time that God’s people were hated of all nations because of their faithfulness to the Lord, as Jesus had foretold would come to pass after the end of Satan's v.oi Id began. Matthew 24: 9,10, 12: “Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you; and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake. And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall h.de one another. And because iniquity shall abound, the line of many shall wax cold.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These prophetic utterances, together with the events that have come to pass from and after 1918 and that fit the prophecy and show its fulfillment, prove that the Lord must come to the temple of Jehovah for judgment, and that “the desire of all nations” did come to the temple in the spring of 1918. Now the judgment of the nations is in progress, and the people of good will from all nations show that Jehovah’s King Christ Jesus is their “desire” by choosing him and taking their stand on the side of Him and his kingdom.—Matt. 25: 31-40.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark11"></a>SOON PEACE WITHOUT END</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">’’T </span><span class="font3">MAKE peace, ... I the Lord.” (Isa. 45:7) Long </span><span class="font6">I </span><span class="font3">ago Jehovah God gave his word that he would set up a righteous government that would rule and bless all people of good will that live. The battle of Armageddon, now near, will clear the way for the uninterrupted operation of that glorious Theocratic Government. Soon all the selfish governments of this world shall perish. Monarchies, democracies, aristocracies, papism, Fascism, Communism and Nazism, and all suchlike efforts to rule, shall pass away at Armageddon and will soon be forgotten. Those abortive attempts at government will not be remembered by the survivors of Armageddon, because they will have other things to think about. God’s government of righteousness under the King Christ Jesus shall have full sway and shall be justly administered and bring boundless blessings to all who do right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The anointed King or Messiah is the beloved Son of Jehovah God. Nineteen centuries ago Jehovah sent him to the earth to tell the truth concerning Jehovah’s name and government. The Messiah, Jesus, was put to death, and Jehovah caused his death to operate as the price of redemption for all men who believe on and serve him and who worship Jehovah God in spirit and in truth Now Christ Jesus, no longer human, but again spirit in heaven and with all power in heaven and earth, has come to vindicate his Father’s name, which religion has misrepresented, and to rule the world in righteousness and to administer blessings to the people. Concerning him Jehovah by the mouth of his prophet (Isa. 9: 6, 7) says: “The government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">lie shall be called “Wonderful Counsellor” because his counsel will always be wise, perfect and infallible, and those who follow it shall never die, as stated at John 8:51. He is called “The mighty God” because into his hand is committed all power in heaven and in earth and all creation is commanded to serve and obey him. (Matt. 28:18; John 5: 22-27) He is called “The everlasting Father” because he is the Life-giver to man by commandment of Jehovah God and there is no other way to obtain life. (Rom. 6:23; Acts 4.12) He is called “The Prince of Peace&quot; because under his righteous government there shall never be another war. (Matt. 24:21) Soon all the great multitude of persons of good will who survive Armageddon and live shall know that peace has come to stay for ever; concerning which it is written (Isa 2:4) : “They shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The peoples of earth desire peace, and not war, and for this reason the League of Nations has to many been like a straw held out to a drowning man. Jehovah has expressly declared that the League of Nations, and the combination of totalitarian powers, is a fraud and a snare and shall be completely destroyed. (Isa. 8:9,10) Selfish men ruling the nations in a selfish, imperfect manner can never bring peace to the people. Everlasting peace can come only by and through The Theocracy of Jehovah under Christ. Concerning that blessed peace, which shall proceed from the government of the Lord, Psalm 72: 4,7 reads: “He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor. In his days shall the righteous flourish ; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.” Every man who tries to do right, but who because of inherent weakness needs mercy, will have mercy extended to him by the Lord. Under his righteous government no one shall be permitted to deceive or mislead others, but, always, the truth shall be spoken. Then in the language of God’s prophet all the people that live shall sing (Ps 85: 10-12) : “Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from tieaven. Yea, the Lord shall give that which is good, and our land shall yield her increase.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Neither “New Deal” nor other man-made scheme can bring lasting prosperity to the people. Prosperity cannot be brought about by employment of unjust and unrighteous methods. God’s commandment is that every man shall love his neighbor, which means he must deal honestly and justly with his fellow man. Work is a blessing to man, because God has so declared. When all men work and receive the just fruits of their labor they shall all be prosperous Under the government of the Lord, the people “shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth [children] for trouble” (Isa. 65.23, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ruth</span><span class="font3"> ) Under the rule of the righteous Governor of the earth the land shall be free from pests that destroy the crops and shall produce abundantly and plentifully and for all, as it is written (Ps. 67:6) : “Then shall the earth yield her increase.” Says Jehovah’s Word: “When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice.” (Prov. 29:2) God’s government will be wholly righteous, and under his government “shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined”. —Isa. 25: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All sane persons desire life everlasting in peace. With all the boasted power and strength of the present-day governments and the various other organizations on earth, with all the braggadocio and boast of the Devil and his agents, and with all the “organized religion”, none of them can give life to any creature. Life is the gift of God through Jesus Christ our Lord, and there is no other way to get life. (Rom 6: 23 ; Acts 4:12) Said Jesus in prayer to God: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” (John 17 : 3) When the terrible battle of Armageddon is raging, then many who have been deceived and who have preferred to believe a lie will be made to know that Satan is the great liar and that Jehovah alone can give life. Those who survive Armageddon will be the ones who now hear the Kingdom message of truth and who give heed thereto and seek righteousness and meekness, and to such Jehovah promises that they may “be bid” in that time of distress and woe. (Zeph. 2 2, 3) Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, gave his life as the redemptive price for as many as believe and serve him. (Matt 20: 28 , John 10:10; Heb. 2:9) Under The Theocratic Government the people will be granted full opportunity to obey and live. Furthermore, those who have died and now sleep in the grave shall be brought forth unto the resurrect ion of judgment and be given an opportunity to obey and live. Jesus gave assurance thereof in these words 'All that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth ’ —John 5: 25-30, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment. And the work of righteousness shall be peace, and the effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance for ever. And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places.”—Isa. 32: 1,17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is concerning the destruction of the oppressive rule of Satan, and the gracious and righteous government of Christ Jesus and the blessings to the people thereunder, that Jehovah’s witnesses are now commanded to go and tell to “men of good will”. It is because they are telling these great and wonderful truths that Jehovah’s witnesses stand accused before the courts of the various governments It is for bringing this message of consolation to the people that many of Jehovah’s witnesses today languish behind prison bars. At Armageddon the Lord will remember the indignities now being cast upon his name and people</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Though being the worst of times with respect to the nations of the Devil’s organization, this is the most blessed time yet when men have been on earth, because Jehovah’s Theocratic Government is now in operation , and it is now the blessed privilege of all persons of good will who hear the message of God’s “government and peace” to take up that glad song and pass it on to others. All you who are of good will toward Jehovah and his kingdom, therefore, continue to grow in a knowledge of the truth and tell it to others, and, doing so, you shall receive the boundless blessings of Jehovah’s government; as written: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good will.” —Luke 2 : 14, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Douay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">IN FRONT OF THE LONDON BRANCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Scene: A bright sunny morning at 34 Craven Terrace. Two of the boys loading 40 cartons of books onto the truck drawn up alongside the lift that conveys the cartons from the stockroom below Kingdom Hall to awaiting trucks, to be carted to various companies. Along Craven Terrace every morning comes a mixed stream of folk on their way to the near-by station on their way to business. On this particular morning a very well-dressed ‘someone in the city’ came along, watched the cartons being loaded for a bit, and then in a very polished Oxford accent declared: ‘If these were bombs instead of Bible tracts we might stand a chance of winning this war.’ The two witnesses continued their task without comment, being more or less used to varied comments by all sorts of nosies that pass. Our well-dressed friend, evidently anxious to bring this state of affairs to the attention of someone who would comment on his ‘words of wisdom’, went up to a near-by street sweeper, a little man that has the task of keeping Craven Terrace and surrounding territory in a clean and wholesome condition. Exactly what our ‘someone in the city’ said we cannot say, but we observed him speaking somewhat heatedly to the street sweeper and pointing significantly in our direction. From his attitude, whatever he was saying was not very complimentary. The Sweeper, however, quickly showed whose side he was on by saying to our Oxford hero: ‘No, not this lot, Guv’nor; they’re a good lot. II everyone saw things as they do and stood as firmly for what they believe, we wouldn’t have men like Hitler carrying on like the devil he is.’ Our ‘wise guy’ then, finding no sympathy at all for his ravings, stomped off down to the station, where we hoped he missed his train for his pains. The sweeper, however, came over to us as we continued loading, and said: ‘Did you hear that, boys? properly trying to line you all up ’e was. What ’e wants is five minutes with the judge, then he’d soon get put in ’is place. But still the likes of that lot won’t see sense, will they?’ It appears this little sweeper had heard Judge Rutherford at Albert Hall on the last occasion he addressed us there. A ‘sheep’ and a ‘goat’, eh?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PROPER PROCEDURE BY LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“During my appointment at Shelby, Idaho, Tuesday evening, June 11, at 10:30 p.m., a group of men came to our trailer looking for me, among them the American Legion, county sheriff, local police, state police, and a G-man from Idaho Falls. The commander of the Shelby Legion post inquired as to what kind of meetings I was holding in Shelby, and asked if it were all right if I would demonstrate at the Legion hall the next evening exactly the kind of meetings we hold at private homes, how Jehovah’s witnesses got in touch with the people, etc., and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> articles. The result was that a fine opportunity was made available for a good witness to all the authorities of Shelby. ‘Government and Peace’ was reproduced on the sound equipment and a model study demonstrated. AH twelve officials attending marveled at the information given by Judge Rutherford; and the American Legion commander stated: ‘Everyone should obtain that kind of information, which is real American.’ All the officials expressed their appreciation to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> for the co-operation of its representatives, extending a welcome to witnesses who worked the territory.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“A WORD IN SEASON,” HOW GOOD IN CANADA!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“We were witnessing in the northern wilds of Saskatchewan, and were feeling quite discouraged with the bad roads and the opposers living by it, when my twche-\ear-old daughter and I came to a house where a group of people were gathered. I explained who I was, and proceeded to play ‘Instruction’ for them on the phonograph. I noticed some took an instant dislike for it and started criticizing the judge and his opinions. I told them what I had to say, and then one man jumps up, clasps his fist against his palm and says: ‘By golly, I’m with you ; you Jehovah’s witnesses ha\e done more good work in this community in three years than the ministers in thirty.’ Imagine my joy at this declaration of his. The others were dumfounded. Then I said to this person of good will: ‘It’s people like you that shall find God’s protection at Armageddon.’ I left some literature with him, and we went on our way rejoicing; all the discouragement fled.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A FRIEND’S REPORT STIRS UP INQUIRY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“A friend, an actress in Brooklyn, introduced me over the telephone to a colleague in New York. The latter desired some information in professional matters and remarked she would also like to hear from my own mouth about those startling things made known by Jehovah’s witnesses and related to her by my friend. I saw the lady. She manifested remarkably good will, listened attentively to Scriptural and factual evidence and seemed to believe every statement without voicing a single contradiction or even an utterance of doubt or hesitancy to accept. Apparently my eyes could not conceal my wondeiment. Reading my thoughts, she remarked smilingly: ‘No, I’m not credulous, not at all Why should I not readily believe what you tell me? Didn’t you prove it to be true?’ Her reason for accepting only the book </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font3"> was again out of the ordinary: if she took all the books, etc., at once she would become so absorbed in the reading that she would do nothing else and neglect her work, which she cannot afford to do at present; the safer procedure, therefore, would be to acquire one publication after the other and to give me a ring when ready for another. Yesterday she called up, informing me she has loaned the book to a gentleman and has just received word from him that in his esteem </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font3"> is a book of extraordinary interest. ‘He is very rich (how generous, I do not know;, and I hope he will support your work.’ I interjected ‘But we are not after the people’s money.’ ‘I know that,’ she replied, ‘but I am very much interested that he use some of his wealth to further your work, as long as money has not lost all value. May I arrange a get-together of us three?’”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">MODEL STUDIES BOOST COMPANY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“One publisher is conducting seven model studies each week in private homes besides attending three studies of the Nashville company, and earning his living too. This activity makes sixty hours a month easy for this publisher. The result is that the company he is associated with is growing fast, due mainly to the model studies of this one publisher These model studies have made this publisher very familiar with the Bible, and therefore make him more efficient in the door-to-door work of witnessing.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Roosevelt’s Ambassador to the Pope</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(In Two Parts—</span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Part 2)<a name="footnote3"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark29">3</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font19">T</span><span class="font13">HE most astounding piece of business thus far perpetrated by any elected servant of the American people is Roosevelt’s presumption in sending a personal ambassador to the pope. The sinister implications of this act have been considered at some length in the first part of this article. The second part takes up some incidental aspects of the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Humbugging the American People</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The president of the United States, entrusted as he is with the greatest gift in the power of the people to bestow, ought to be above the humbugging of them, and it is a shame and a disgrace that Franklin D. Roosevelt, in sending his ambassador to the pope, pretended<sup><a href="#bookmark29">3</a></sup> that it was done for the general benefit of mankind and in the cause of peace. It was nothing of the sort. The deal was all cooked up long ago. The Catholic journals were in on it and the stories that they published before Roosevelt made the appointment give the lie to the reasons alleged at Washington as to why the appointment was made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The following story appeared in the London </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald</span><span class="font13"> of November 24, 1939, 29 days before Roosevelt summoned Spellman to Washington. It is obviously true, which is all the ihore remarkable because it emanated from the Vatican. The Catholic press can now point with pride to the fact that on this matter, and in advance, they told the truth about something of which the president of the United States, a professed Protestant, told a story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN THE VATICAN AND U.S.A.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">From Our Own Correspondent</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Vatican City</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Holy Father has recently received in audience Cardinal Gasparri, Prefect of the Apostolic Signatura.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It is possible that the Pope discussed the prob- <sub>: </sub>able renewal of diplomatic relations between the Vatican and the U.S.A., which were interrupted in 1870. Cardinal Gasparri went to America some time ago to study, it is believed, the juridical status of such relations in the event of the re-establishment of diplomatic relations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It is well known that the Holy Father is extremely desirous of seeing these diplomatic relations resumed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FAVOURABLE TIME</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This is a most favourable time for the success of such relations, because Roosevelt and his supporters have promised their renewal several times. Though the administration never kept these promises in spite of pressure from Cardinal Mundelein, the 1940 presidential elections make the chances greater because Roosevelt may have to obtain Catholic votes. The situation is favourable also because the Jews in America are now on good terms with the Church and the Communists have of late been less active.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The message sent by President Roosevelt on the occasion of the fifteenth birthday of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal,</span><span class="font13"> the well-known Catholic weekly, indicates the interest of the President in the Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&quot;At all hazards,” said the President in his message, “we must preserve our liberties and above all else liberty of conscience. God speed you through the years in your determination to affirm the Christian conception of the dignity of the individual man.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">All Agree Except Liberty-Lovers</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">After Roosevelt appointed his personal ambassador to the pope, and invited the president of a Jewish theological seminary and the president of the Federal Council of Churches to sanctify the appointment, the Jewish representative, Dr. Cyrus Adler, made the statement, “We are all in agreement.” What he meant was that four persons are satisfied, Pacelli, Roosevelt, Buttrick (of the Federal Council) and himself. They speak for nobody else. The general secretary of the Baptist</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">World Alliance, Dr. W. 0. Lewis, issued a -statement that “American Baptists oppose any possible combine of the United States Government with the Vatican’', and there are more than four persons among those Baptists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It has been repeatedly drawn to Roosevelt’s attention that law-abiding American citizens have been attacked by subjects of the pope to whom the president is now doing obsequious homage. These attacks have been carried out under the direction of the Hierarchy’s priests. Instead of doing or saying anything to protect his fellow citizens in their rights as against this bunch of foreign racketeers, he insults them by glorifying the head of this camorra, every principle of which is contrary' to the American Constitution, to Christianity and to common decency and honesty. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">An example of the riotous assaults characteristic of the pope-controlled part of the population follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Unofficial Papal Representatives</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The police of Saco, Maine, sincerely and honestly desire the. destruction of the American form of government and have done and are willing to do all that they can to reproduce in this country the identical conditions that prevail in Germany. Instead of preserving order, or even trying to preserve order, they have encouraged anarchy in its most vicious form- - the breaking up of assemblies of orderly Christian people, met together to study the Word of God. For thus breaking the oaths they have taken to preserve the liberties and the lives of American people, engaged in the exercise of their lawful rights, they deserve long terms of imprisonment behind bars—the usual American penalty for malfeasance, misfeasance and nonfeasance in public office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Sunday evening, October 1, 1939, a widely advertised meeting of Christian people was to have been held at Red Men’s Hall, Main street, Saco, Maine. The police knew all about the purpose of this meeting, and conspired to have it wrecked. Before the meeting began, a ra.dio shop next door to the hall turned on several radios and sound apparatus, with the volume as high as they could get it, and with no other possible objective than to interfere with the meeting advertised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This conspiracy to interfere with a Christian assembly (illegal in every state in the United States) was supplemented by a mob of at least twenty men and youths who hooted, whistled, shouted and stamped their feet, trying to gain entrance after the meeting had started. Two personal visits to the police headquarters were made to draw the attention of the officers of the law to these facts. On the second trip the officers, engaged in playing cards, indicated that they resented being disturbed in their Sunday evening pastime. A third visit, more insistent, was made that steps be taken to protect the rights of the audience in the hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Thereupon one officer walked by on the sidewalk, asked the disturbers on the sidewalk to cross the street, which they did, but he did nothing about the disturbers in the hallway on the second floor, nor did he linger to prevent the throwing of missiles from across the street, which began at once.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As soon as the officer had departed, the man</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19400403_files/g_E_19400403-3.png" alt="" style="width:412pt;height:155pt;">
<p><span class="font13">Christian assembly room in. Saco after of police visited it. No arrests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">friends</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Friends of Saco police invade a law-abiding Christian man’s living room. Nobody arrested.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">that conducted the radio shop disturbance led the mob to the attack on the hall, showing the gangsters'which windows to break and which not to break. He manifestly tipped them off that they had nothing to fear from the police, and events showed this to be correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Nonfeasance of Police</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Practically every window in the hall was smashed in the riot that </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span class="font13"> followed, and for which riot the Saco police are directly respon-&amp; sible, and can blame no one else. An automobile drove up loaded with missiles of all kinds; not only stones, but the usual vegetables and other accompaniments o f those who have no other arguments with which to answer the truth. The number of the a u to m o b i 1 e is known and recorded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A mob to the number of more than 1,000 collected. According to the Biddeford </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Journal </span><span class="font13">the police, mentioned by their official name ten times in five paragraphs, understood their duty very well, inasmuch as “neither the police nor county officers could find any law which would prevent the group from meeting”. The law does not specify in detail that police, paid by the taxpayers, shall stop playing cribbage on Sunday evening to protect</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19400403_files/g_E_19400403-4.png" alt="" style="width:200pt;height:253pt;">
<p><span class="font11">&quot;Without benefit of clergy—and strictly unofficial”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">Christian people from assault by mobs formed with the knowledge and consent of their higher-ups. The most hopeless moron knows that, whether they like to have their cribbage game interfered with or not, their duty is plain. That duty the Saco police definitely dodged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Encouraged to do so, the mob went about its work after the pattern so well laid down in Germany, and now understood at all four corners in America. All that is necessary is connivance by the police and it may happen anywhere, and will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The mob stoned the hall. Practically every window was smashed. Stink bombs were thrown into the hall. The worshipers were driven into the street. While this was going on several police and a deputy sheriff were outside encouraging the mob. One was sitting in a. ear, laughing and talking with some of the mob. Jehovah's witnesses know the leaders of the mob, and so do the police, but no arrests were made, and none intended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The w<sup>r</sup>ork of destruction ivcnt on. Everything in the hall was smashed. The light fixtures were torn from the walls. Even the plaster on the ceiling was torn off. The equipment of Jehovah’s witnesses was destroyed, a phonograph and many records. Territory maps were annihilated, but the stock of literature of the Kingdom w'as missed, by God’s grace, for at the last minute one of the witnesses threw the master switch of the electric system, plunging the hall into darkness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The work of destruction went on in the darkness. The mob forced its way into the living quarters of the company servant and pioneer, actually breaking the intervening door into halves. In these living quarters everything was upset. Beds were torn apart, the alarm clock was broken, some of the clothing was ruined and destroyed and the rest of it was thrown all over the place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Saco Gestapo out in their car were well pleased. A better job could not have been done in Germany. Now they can go back to the “Reverend Father” O’Whatshisname and get his “blessing”, but if they think that what they started in Saco will stop there, they do not know Jehovah’s people and least of all do they know Jehovah himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The meeting which was held in Saco was held in honor of Jehovah’s name. The Biddeford </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Journal</span><span class="font13"> used as its scarehead the words “Saco Hall Wrecked in Protest Against Jehovah’s Meeting”. It was not a bad headline. It was just that. It was Jehovah’s meeting. It is not ended yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">One woman, a Christian woman of good will, fainted in the police-encouraged riot. How do you Americans like that? And, now that you have put almost all of your police officials under the direction of the pope of Rome, where do you think you and your children are going to get off, presently, when you </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">try </span><span class="font13">to exercise some of the rights for which your ancestors came to America ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">America is in for it, and no mistake? There can be only one end, Armageddon, and thank God that in that holocaust every subject of the pope will </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">perish.</span><span class="font13"> It is the only solution; it is Jehovah’s solution. And if you want to be on the safe side you should get on Jehovah’s side now. It is either His side or the side of the Devil—the pope’s side. Take your choice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Slip at Newburyport &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The pope slipped on something more substantial than a banana peel at Newburyport, Massachusetts. Jehovah’s witnesses held an orderly meeting on a recent Sunday morning. Then the Papal heat was turned on and the owners of the building called the police to eject Jehovah’s witnesses from the building on the ground that there was “going to be a riot”. Witnesses thereupon called the state police, who told them to stand by their rights and bring charges of assault against any persons, regardless of badges or uniforms, who laid hands on them. When the city police arrived the witnesses were having a Bible study, which is not yet illegal, even in Newburyport. Nobody but the “old Harlot” knows who thought there was “going to be a riot”. </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font13">Newburyport police never squawked as to who sent them on their wild-goose chase; and now half of Massachusetts is laughing at them. The pope slipped. Mayor Gillis’ own paper, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Liberator,</span><span class="font13"> took a double-column crack at the police of his own city; and as Gillis is himself a Roman Catholic, this discloses him as a man of more than usual moral courage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Conspiracies Against Faithful Employees</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Conspiracies against faithful employees who are Jehovah’s witnesses seem to be recurring with ever increasing frequency, and the information in each case shows the </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">reli</span><span class="font13">gious animus at the bottom of it, as is always found to be the case where violence has been shown against the Kingdom message. This is all regular. It is a part of the training of priests to skillfully stir up a mob of hoodlums, and, after they have done their will, to then pose in the papers and before the courts as the ones who stilled the tempests which but for them would never have arisen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In the mails the other day was the story of one of the witnesses in a malt extract establishment. He lost his job through malicious and false testimony against him by a group of Catholic employees. The shameless lies that they told are, of course, all forgiven in advance by their priest, or certainly afterward at the confessional. The remedy is in Armageddon, when all the conspirators will be destroyed together and for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In today’s mails is the story of another one . of Jehovah’s witnesses, a railroad man. A religious fellow employee tried to get this man fired after twenty years of faithful service. The morning of the hearing the witness visited several interested families; two of them invited him to call again. Then came two hours of grilling before four railroad officials, all Catholics, but all honest men. The accuser did not get to first base. He admitted he had called the witness a Communist, which charge was proved to be false. Every other charge he made was also disproved. The result was that the witness was told that he would be given a day’s pay and no charges would be held against him. Since then, the man who made the charges has gotten into trouble himself, not once, but twice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Conspiracies Against the Children</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It is a conspiracy against children to insist that priests or others must teach them traditions of men which are entirely contrary to the truths of God’s Word. In the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Guild</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Teacher</span><span class="font13"> (New York) Abraham Lefkowitz says on this subject:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Recently, several church leaders have given </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font13">new impetus to the movement for the introduction of religion into the schools in direct violation of this cardinal American tradition. This has not been attempted by a frontal assault, because these intelligent persons realize the futility of such a campaign. Instead, the approach has been more indirect. Thus far, it has taken a seemingly harmless form such as the right to excuse children during</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">school hours for religious instruction,—the segregation of children along religious lines and sending them under teachers of their faith to their respective religious institutions. That this movement cannot be lightly regarded is obvious by the recent action of the state of Maine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The legislature of Maine enacted a Jaw providing that the school committee of each town may authorize a survey of the religious affiliation of pupils attending the public schools and have the consent of guardian for moral instruction. Pupils may be excused one hour weekly to attend their respective places of worship to receive instruction according to their faith. More recently, the National Catholic Alumni Federation adopted a resolution to bring about the enactment of legislation to include religious education within the public schools to be given by qualified teachers of the child’s own religious faith and upon the request of the parents. Such legislation has already been introduced into our own state legislature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The natives in Africa and other countries are to a considerable extent children. They are trustful of the whites until they learn that the whites are unreliable. The missionaries are as ready as others to tell lies. The London </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Universe</span><span class="font13"> (Roman Catholic) says, in effect, that it has a missionary contributor in Liberia who makes the charge that persons distributing the literature of Jehovah’s witnesses in that country are also distributing Russian Communistic literature. This is a 100-pcrcent lie. Jehovah’s witnesses are forbidden to enter Russia. The lie of this missionary was told before the Roman Catholic Hitler opened his arms and Stalin fell into them. The latest information just at hand is that Stalin and Pacelli are dickering for a re-establishment of religion in Russia, which plainly shows the Pa e el li-Hitler-Stalin conspiracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Also (and it is a mighty interesting thing), weeks before the Russians invaded Finland all the Roman Catholic nuns in that country were taken out of the land. Why was that? How did the pope know they would be safer somewhere else? And if they are so eager to do something worth while in the world, why did they not remain in Finland to aet as nurses ? There can be no adequate answer. It is evident that the pope was in on it and probably directly counseled the attack on Finland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“No Surprise”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">John J. Saunders, writing in the London </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald,</span><span class="font13"> states that the pact between Hitler and Stalin was no surprise to any reader of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Herald,</span><span class="font13"> which may well be believed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">APRIL 3, 1340</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">He also described Italy, Spain and Portugal as the Latin Fascist bloc. There should be no surprise ifa that either. The Roman Catholic Church is the wet nurse of the entire totalitarian idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It is an old story that you must toot your born if you want to sell any fish; and so it is reasonable, even, though it is funny beyond words, that the pope has the nerve to refer to his “spiritual authority” and to tell the world by radio that when they listen to him they “hear through our voice-the voice of that Christ”, etc'., etc. He went on to say, “We are armed by nothing more than the word of truth,” and, “We speak in the name of God.” No bigger lies were ever told on earth. The Papacy is the child of the Devil and speaks in his name only.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A dispatch from Rome that “Monsignor Cesare Orsenigo, papal nuncio to Berlin, called at the chancellery at noon and was received immediately by Adolf Hitler” shows several things quite plainly, the outstanding ones being the good understanding between Hitler and the Vatican, the reverence of Hitler for the Vatican, and Hitler’s anxiety to find some way to use the pope so that Germany can work out a peace that will enable her to keep what she has so far obtained until she is ready to strike again, in her aim at world</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">A dispatch from Rome, published in the New York </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Herald Tribune, </span><span class="font13">states that while the usual income of the Vatican is at least $50,000,000 a year, yet during war time fall to as low as $30,000,000. The dispatch makes the very truthful observation that Cardinal Innitzer of Vienna “was the first to welcome the Nazis when they took over Austria”. The United States is the Vatican’s chief contributor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Acting under guidance of its Rome-controlled State Department, the United States performed one of the worst series of acts in its career in the way it treated the Spanish Republic. Nothing was done for the Republic, but Franco the Butcher was financed to the extent of $14,000,000 worth of cotton which will be used to compete with American textiles on the world market. The loan will never be repaid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">One of the first acts of the “government” of the Butcher was to provide for the annual appropriation of $6,200,000 a year for the support of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">7 </span><span class="font13">which placed him in the saddle and them,back in power as iiis overlords.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Claims of the Hierarchy</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">1. Under the pretense that he is God’s vicar on earth, the pope claims that every soul on earth is a subject of the church, regardless of whether they are members of it or not.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">2. When any question arises in which the pope and the civil government cannot reach an agreement, or in which there is a question as to which authority shall have jurisdiction, the decision of the pope shall he final. The head of every government shall he bound by the superior authority of the pope, but the pope is not bound by any authority on earth. True, the church contends that its decisions are infallible only in matters pertaining to “faith and morals”, but the word “morals” can he so interpreted as to include practically anything. Cardinal Manning said: “Politics are a part of morals. What the moral law of the Ten Commandments is to the individual, polities are to society. Politics are nothing more than the morals of society, the collective morality of Christian men united together under social law—polities are morals on the widest scale.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">3. The pope claims the right to use force, if necessary, to punish or exterminate non-believers or to force them into the church. Each government shall recognize this right and it is their duty to assist the church in enforcing this dogma.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">4. Regarding dissenters or non-Catholics: they need not be treated with justice and humanity, nor accorded the elemental rights of human society. The pope claims that non-Catholics live in error and error has not the same right as truth; that inasmuch as their very existence is an offense to God, they are not entitled to the right of free speech and freedom of worship which the church demands for its subjects. Therefore the existence of any individual, or sect, or the dissemination of any fact or opinion which does not agree with Catholic doctrines shall be suppressed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">It is utterly impossible to believe these doctrines and at the same time believe in tolerance, free speech, and free press and religious freedom. To any one who believes in this medieval conception of human rights, democracy just does not make sense. Yet, every member of the Catholic church knowingly or unknowingly gives assent to these and other doctrines of similar un-American content, sueh as those concerning civil and mixed marriages, divorce, separation of church and state, the right of the (de ctor ate to choose how and by whom they shall be governed, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In Question and Answer form, these doctrines are printed in the text hooks used in Catholic schools and instilled into the minds of Catholic youths; yet Churchmen constantly plead that government should be used to support the schools where these un-American Catholic doctrines are disseminated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Very little attention has been given to the fact that the Roman Catholic organization is a dictatorship, identical in spirit and form with the modern' Ea.scist dictatorships, for which it has served as the prototype.—</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The. Truth Seeker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The President’s Objective</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">What can be the president’s objective in appointing a personal ambassador to the Vatican, making that ambassador out of a former head of the steel trust, and dragging the spokesmen of the Protestants and Jews into the scheme? It is not to make peace. The attitude of the British speaks plainly enough on that. Quite possibly the pope knows that Adolf is licked and wants to help him find a way out; but a much more likely thing is that Jim F ar ley and Roosevelt want the combined influence of Big Church, Big Business and Big Polities to say that it is quite all right for America to take orders hereafter from the pope, which means, in essence and in fact, the stopping of the proclamation of the message of God's kingdom, if that can be accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As to the Protestants, it is inevitable that their bishops should be blind. The very fact that they are religious bishops makes them that way. So none should wonder that, when the “Right Reverend” Henry St. George Tucker, presiding bishop of the Protestant Episcopal church, New York city, said in a sermon that future ages would look back to the twentieth century as one of the dark ages in the history of mankind, he followed that truthful statement, with the proposition that “we must endeavor to establish a Kingdom of God on this earth” and thus “co-operate with Jesus Christ in bringing a kingdom of righteousness and justice to this sorely beset world”. If the politicians, the preachers and the plutocrats have progressed no farther in some 6,000 years than to make the world the bedlam that it is today, when would the same crowd produce on earth a condition where God’s will would be done as it is done in heaven? The answer is, Never; and religion, the Devil’s substitute for The Theocracy, must go into oblivion, where it belongs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Myron C. Taylor, former chairman of the United States Steel Trust, selected by Roosevelt as his personal ambassador to the pope, was bom with a silver spoon in his mouth and became the head of the steel trust by reason of that fact. Like Roosevelt, he is a professed Episcopalian and, according to Roman Catholic theology, eould be put to death as a heretic for believing the same things Roosevelt is supposed to believe. But nobody need suppose that Taylor will be in any danger at the Vatican. He lives much of the year in Italy and is well acquainted with Pacelli and other higher-ups in and out of Vatican City. Besides that, he is said to be extremely, religious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Jehovah’s people have been taught by the Lord, through </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> (1938), that the conspiracy (2 Chronicles chapter 20) between the Moabites, Ammonites and the inhabitants of Mount Seir against the land of Judah pictured beforehand the conspiracy of the deeply religious Big Business crowd, the group of hypocritical politicians and the group of conscienceless religionists against The Theocracy. These all have as their objective their continued dominance of the world and the hindrance of the Kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It must not be supposed that Roosevelt selected Taylor particularly because he is very religious, but because he is a shining representative of Big Business, and, for that matter, he is still a director of the United States Steel Corporation and an open and unblushing admirer of Mussolini and Fascism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Big Business and Peace</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">«&amp;Big Business, especially the steel business, is not interested in peace; ft it i<sup>g</sup> interested in the biggest busi-i^^As^ness of all, which is mass murder. BBKfl Petty hold-ups are impractical and unpopular. The money cost of the World War was sufficient to build a $2,500 house containing $1,000 worth of furniture, on five acres of land worth $100 an aere, for every family in the United States, Canada, Australia, England, Wales, Ireland, Scotland, France, Belgium, Russia and Germany. The war slew ten million soldiers (one-fifth of all who went into it), and 28,000,000 civilians died of war-born starvation, disease and massacre. The munition makers made the most of the opportunity and are now secretly smacking their lips over the profits of the new war. All can remember Morgan’s interest in the war of 1914-1918.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Some thirty-odd years ago J. Pierpont Morgan, Sr,, patron saint of the Steel Trust, pumped the New Haven Railroad so full of water that it oozed out at every joint. The New Haven bought steamboat lines, trolleys, hotels and other things at fancy prices, and just as they had arrived at the place where they no longer yielded a profit. Since then the stock of the road has been waterlogged and now the Interstate Commerce Commission </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">ad</span><span class="font13">vises that the best thing to do is to wipe out all the preferred and common stocks, because the corporation cannot pay anything on them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">During the World War there was a big difference in the price of eannon fodder. Uncle Sam paid the highest price. His soldiers received wages almost three times that paid the British soldier, ten times that of the </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">German, </span><span class="font13">twenty times that of the French, and twenty-five times that of the Italian. But, even then, his soldiers were expected to lay down their lives to make the world safe for democracy for only $1 a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A review of 3,421 years of human history shows that in that time there have been 268 years of peace. All the remaining years were years of war in which some 8,000 peace treaties were broken to smithereens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A front-line veteran who was in every battle from Chateau Thierry to the Argonne says that he saw men with their stomachs torn open by shrapnel and with their bloody and muddy hands trying to gather their entrails out of the mud and stuff them back in place again, mud and all. He sees the same old propaganda now under way as he swallowed, hook, line and sinker, in 1917.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The British understand clearly that the United States Neutrality Act had as its objective the helping of the Allies to win the war against Hitler without coming into the open and saying so. The Germans understand the same thing. United States Senator Wm. </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">E. </span><span class="font13">Borah made the statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Bill is, in fact, legislation providing in effect for intervention in a great European struggle for power, in the hope by some, and the belief of others, but not all, that we will be able to take part in this struggle under such terms and conditions as will enable us to escape the more serious sacrifices of war.—In the Manchester </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When the armistice came of age, 21 years after it was declared, the thing to celebrate was not that the world had been made safe for democracy, but that it was spending six times as much for armaments as in 1913, and was well into the second world war. Moreover, instead of “open covenants openly arrived at” the world witnessed an era of shameless double-crossing unequaled in history. None of the objectives of the first world war were attained; every solemn promise to the people was broken, as was, of course, to be expected. This generation seems to think loyalty to any trust whatever is a weakness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">About fifteen million tons of ice—enough to make six hundred million 50-pound blocks —are used each year by the railroads to keep freight and passengers cool.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Cooled ears for the transportation of perishables were first used in 1857, when one railroad insulated some of its boxcars and, after loading, placed ice in the doorways.</span></p>

In the six years there was actually a large increase in the New York, consumption of fruits and vegetables. These figures give some idea of the way in which, the trucks are cutting into the business of the railroads. An odd feature, however, is that many of the railroads are nutting into their own business and buying truck lines which carry their freight all the way by truck instead of part way by rail.</span></p>

So she bought a 73-foot ketch in England and made a start. By the time she had arrived at the Suez Canal she had discharged four skippers and decided to navigate the boat the rest of the way herself. In another two years she visited Australia and New Zealand and recently rounded Cape Horn, after more than 5,000 miles across the open ocean. Some skipper!</span></p>

This new area is surrounded by a retaining structure forty-two feet thick. The inner edge is wooden sheeting. The outer edge is of concrete, and the interior of riprap. A channel 650 feet wide surrounds the new piers, providing 35-foot draft at low water. Fifty of the 160 acres are expected to provide transit facilities for 2,500,000 tons of freight annually, and 110 acres will be available for industrial sites.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">♦ October 28, 1939, information march advertising “Government and Peace” at the Courthouse park the following day. Some 200 listened to the lecture. Sixty booklets and a number of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font13"> books placed with audience. Some 75 witnesses participated in the march in the afternoon, and 60 in the evening. No opposition. One storekeeper seeing three people going back and forth was somewhat disturbed, and remarked, “They are taking the whole block,” although the three men were of ordinary size. One gentleman walked along a little with a witness and said, “I am with you folks! I mean I am with Jehovah, Christ, and Judge Rutherford.” Some could not tell whether this was for religion or against it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">October, Visalia, California. Some 100 were in the march. The police said there was “an ordinance against it”; when the crowd marched they “couldn’t do anything—too many of them”. Following a march there, while we were witnessing, a woman spoke to one of the witnesses: “Do you kpow those who marched here? Are you one of them?’’ The witness replied, “I was one of them.” Then she said, “Do you know that ybu people are stirring up the people ? The preachers here are fighting among themselves, and one of them has left town.” This woman took literature and is interested. A pioneer plays a German record, “Enemies.” The woman then remarks, “Is dat Hitler?” Before getting a reply, she says, “I want that book.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Hanford, California. A march took place advertising meeting at the park. It was reported that a priest was at the lecture, “Government and Peace,” but left when he had heard all the records except the last two. Too bad! Too bad! Fresno witness reported that at a back-call the lady, feeling her responsibility, ordered ten </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font13"> books.

<p><span class="font13">What causes a sigh ? The Bible tells of some people who ‘sigh and cry because of the abominations’ in the land, and some who ‘sigh and groan’ under great trial. (Ezekiel 9:4; Psalm 102:19,20) There is another class that sigh because of the truth being told. At a funeral held in California, when the one in charge announced that for ten minutes Judge Rutherford would be heard on “Dead” and “Resurrection”, a deep sigh went out of a woman who was present and such sighs continued throughout Judge Rutherford’s talk when the “clergy” were mentioned. It seems strange that the mention of the name “Judge Rutherford” almost kills some people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“Ham and Eggs.” For months California has had one of the biggest campaigns for and against the “thirty dollars a week” retirement plan. Thousands of poor people and old people sent in their thirty cents per month to headquarters and leaders of the movement. Discussions could be heard everywhere, in meetings, in the parks, on buses, and elsewhere-—“Thirty Dollars a Week”—“the biggest thing that ever happened, and when it passes here it will spread all over.” Wholesalers poured forth their view's to businessmen, warning them that under no circumstance would they ever accept “warrants” for merchandise. Banks fought in their way, accusing the movement as being “Communistic” and leading to “dictatorship”, and pictures illustrating such views on billboards everywhere. Ham &amp;&nbsp;Eggers were organized and had districts with their captains. Many people who have read Judge Rutherford, not appreciating the situation fully, were strongly for “Ham &amp;&nbsp;Eggs”. Over the radio fine arguments were presented to show how this movement could kick out the banks, etc., etc. Letters from Canadian Government purporting to show how prosperous they are there with warrants or similar things were spread everywhere. The other side had their letters from Canada showing there had been a failure. At the meetings here it was told by “Ham &amp;&nbsp;Eggers” that the audience would be asked first of all to salute the flag. It amounted to a religious frenzy and to a belief that “this is beginning of God’s kingdom”. Ham &amp;&nbsp;Eggers w'ere absolutely certain this time they would win. Well, yesterday was November 7, and this morning papers report in big headlines, “Ham &amp;&nbsp;Eggs Defeated 2 to 1.” They say the fight is not ended; and evidently it is not. But a great disappointment ! Some who claim to be of the truth, and pretty good people, too, and who are associated with the work, more or less, were urg-</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">ing others to register and vote, and possibly these who did the urging voted. It seems such should see that the Jw’s are ‘‘neutral” as to ham and eggs, even as we are about other worldly schemes. We hear some say that Governor Olsen talked favorably before aljout It and “got in” on that, but now is unfavorable toward the scheme. Governor Olsen has done some good things, but, of course, it is hard to be a public man and please everybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Because many of these readers of our books were “Ham </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">&amp;&nbsp;Eggers”</span><span class="font13"> the witnesses here have had considerable difficulty in interesting “interested” people to come to our meetings, and since it has hopped for the present, these people may have greater interest in the Kingdom. These “Ham &amp;&nbsp;Eggers” are not all poor people, nor jobless either. But they are for it because they think they are doing great good for the aged. 'Witnessing to some they say, “When ham and eggs fails, then Ell read Judge Rutherford.” A year ago, while in Oakland giving out circulars for “Face the Facts”, an old gentleman took a circular and, looking at Judge Rutherford’s picture, remarked with considerable emphasis, “If that man is not, for Thirty a Week, he’ll neveh git in 1” Only the Kingdom will thoroughly solve the “old age” problem, because the obedient will remain young and have plenty and need never retire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Religion. An undertaker reported to the writer that at a certain Catholic funeral the “solemn high mass cost $60”, and was paid. It takes three priests one full hour to perform “solemn high mass”. The poor cannot all get for their hard work even 20e an hour, but these priests earned $20 apiece per hour without giving real consideration therefor. It is a great racket and there are some people who “love to have it so”. If these people had obtained the little booklet </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Uncovered</span><span class="font13"> for only 2c, and believed the Bible as therein quoted, they would have saved $69.98.—D.

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>“Justice” in Hubbard, Ohio</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">♦ Hubbard, Ohio, is in a bad way. Christian people cannot peaceably walk on the streets of that burg in an information march without going to jail for it. There was such a march on a day last summer. Tillie Williamson, Margaret Atsberger, Grace &quot;Ragin and Arthur G. Saylow testified that they saw certain people going down one side of the street and up the other, peaceably, without guns, without knives, without blackjacks, without clubs, without, sh.il-lalahs, without shouting, without singing, without drums, without cymbals, without tambourines, without rocks, without bricks, without peculiar dress, without vile or profane language, without speech-making.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The witnesses could all remember well that the marchers had borne slogans reading, “Religion is a snare and a racket,” but seemed to have to have it drawn to their attention that they also bore the exhortation “Serve God and Christ the King”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Counsel made it clear to the court that the ordinance is illegal. Under it the crowd emerging from a theater could be arrested for not having a parade permit; the same for children emerging from school; the same for persons emerging from churches or Sunday schools; the same for funerals ; the same for vehicles of the fire department; the same for the Grand Army; the same for the Kiwanis, the Rotary, and the Boy Scouts ; but all in vain. The bonehead oii|the bench fined McLcnne S25 and costs or a sentence in jail, and McLenne was in the same situation as Christ before Pilate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Of course, the real Judas in the case kept out of sight, but Tillie &quot;Williamson. Margaret Atsberger, Grace Eagin and Arthur G. Say-low and the police and magistrate of Hubbard, Ohio, probably know perfectly well who it is. Judas finally died with a peculiar collar around his neck. In the end it choked off his wind. The Judas in Hubbard, no doubt, has a peculiar collar, too.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">♦ The car had broken down, and another one was loaned to the publisher to get to an adjoining town to wait for a ear part to come from a larger city by bus. The time waiting for the part to come was spent in making back-calls in the town, and playing the “Government and Peace” lecture. At one place where a publisher had previously received am invitation to come back, the interested one listened to the lecture with the keenest interest, and at the conclusion, when Judge Rutherford called for all of those who are in favor of God’s kingdom to say “Aye”, the person of good will shouted out “Aye” and tears of joy filled her eyes. She readily took the book </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation</span><span class="font13"> and the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Gove mm ent and Peace </span><span class="font13">booklet, and asked that arrangements be made for her to be baptized. This was done, and on my turning to leave she said, “Don’t leave until you have left me some of the books and booklets so that I can go in the service around my home. Even though I am crippled, walking on crutches since I was three year’s old, I can go two or three miles.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">Since the .Lord, the King, Christ Jesus, is invisible to man, He being now a divine spirit impossible for man to see and live, His second coming is invisible. He said to His faithful apostles: “Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more.” (John 14:19) Therefore proof of His coming to the true temple of Jehovah God must be made by evidence other than that which can be seen with natural eyes. Also the time of His coming must be determined by the evidence of related physical facts, based upon God’s revealed Word of prophecy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When God took away from His typical theocracy (the nation of the Jews) the right to rule He stated then that this would be for a fixed time, until the coming of the One whose right it is to rule, and that to Him He would give that right and power. At Ezekiel 21 : 27 He announced concerning the rulership; “I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.” Although the Lord Jesus possessed all power and authority from the time of His resurrection, it would seem to be inconsistent for Him to exercise that power against the enemy’s organization of the Gentile nations on earth until the “times of the Gentiles” expired, as marked by a world war. —Luke 21: 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In harmony with this one of the King’s supporters wrote: “But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; from henceforth expecting [waiting] till his enemies be made his footstool.” (Hebrews 16:12,13) King David of Jerusalem had written centuries before that: “The Lord [Jehovah] said unto my Lord [Christ], Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.”— Psalm 110:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Bible proof is that the “times of the Gentiles” should continue 2520 years, from Jerusalem’s first destruction, in B.C. 606, and ended in the autumn of A. D. 1914. That should mark the time when Christ Jesus assumed His power to reign, in fulfillment of prophecy. At that time He must become active in the midst of His enemies, as foretold at Psalm 110: 2. Then the Gentile nations would become angry and a great world war would follow, attended by famines, earthquakes, „ pestilences, and thereafter “distress of nations, with perplexity”.—See Revelation 11: 17,18; Matthew 24 7-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The events that took place at His first coming as a man find a parallel in the events of His second coming as a divine spirit, invisible to human eyes, to oust Satan the invisible “prince of this world”. The Scriptural evidence is clear that the Lord Jesus was anointed as King and began preaching the Kingdom in the autumn season of A.D. 29. In the spring of 33, or three and a half years after His anointing to the Kingdom, Jesus presented himself to the Jews as their King but was rejected by them as King. At the same time He entered the temple at Jerusalem and began to cleanse it. (See Matthew 21:1-13.) About the same time God, through Christ Jesus, formally east off that nation and its house of religion.—Matthew 23 : 38,39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Gentile Times ended in the autumn of A.D. 1914. The evidence is quite conclusive that here the Lord Jesus Christ, in obedience to God’s command, stood up and began to exercise His power. (Consult Daniel 12:1;</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Psalm 110:1,2; Revelation 11:17-19 ^Matthew 24: 3, 7, 8.) If we are warranted in applying the rule of parallel events, as to features and time, then we should expect the Lord to come to the great spiritual temple of God three and one-half years after assuming the Kingdom, to wit, in the spring of A.D. 1918. If this is true, then we should expect also to find evidence that the Lord there began to cleanse that antitypieal temple; and that shortly thereafter “Christendom”, which is the modern counterpart of unfaithful Jerusalem, would be completely rejected by the Lord as doomed to destruction at the battle of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In the autumn of 1914 the nations became angry. The World War came, followed quickly by famine, pestilence and earthquakes. Then occurred persecution of Christians, the people of Jehovah God, and other events foretold by the Great Prophet as marking the end of Satan’s world or uninterrupted rule. That was the time, as shown by the inspired Scriptures, when the new world’s King would take His power and begin His reign. The date parallels exactly with the time when He began His royal ministry at His first coming. Three and one-half years after the autumn of 1914, to wit, in the spring of 1918, there came upon the consecrated people of Jehovah God a great fiery trial at the instigation of religionists who used the World War as a timely occasion against those true Christians. This came exactly in harmony with the prophecy of Mala</span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">chi </span><span class="font13">as to what would occur when the Lord Jesus as the great Messenger of Jehovah God comes to His temple.—Read Malachi 3:1-3; also Matthew 24: 9-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In harmony with this the apostle Peter says that judgment must begin at the house of God, His temple. -(1 Peter 4:17) The real purpose </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font13">the judgment is that the ones who are found approved and cleansed or refined should thereafter offer unto the Lord God an offering in righteousness by serving as witnesses for Jehovah and for His Theocracy by Christ Jesus. The trial that came upon those connected with the temple of God in the spring of 1918 was a very severe one. Some of God’s consecrated ones were arrested and east into prison. Some who had been engaged in the Lord’s service, professing full consecration to Him, conspired with the religionists as enemies of the truth and betrayed their' brethren, even as Jesus foretold would be done. (Matthew 24:10) In the face of the World War conditions and persecutions others became fearful and fled from giving an open witness to the </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord. </span><span class="font13">Others separated themselves into sects claiming to be followers of Christ Jesus, yet refused to have any further part in the service of announcing Jehovah’s Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Thereafter when the political and commercial powers brought forth the League of Nations, then the professed temple of God or organized religion became the advocate of that League and hailed it as &quot;the political expression of the Kingdom of God on earth”, and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy climbed up on top of the arrangement and reined in its actions, as in the case of Japan’s attack on China, and the Italian conquest of Ethiopia, and the overthrow of the Spanish republic by the Fascists and Nazis. Thus they denied the coming of the Lord and His theocratic kingdom to bless the people of good will on earth, and openly allied themselves with the enemy ■ Satan’s scheme. Thus organized religion of “Christendom” is proved to be a snare and a racket, and is doomed to everlasting destruction at the battle of Armageddon, just as Jerusalem was destroyed not long after the King Christ Jesus rejected the Jewish nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">There are many other facts in proof, </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font13">so far as the facts cited appear they conclusively meet the requirements of the prophecy. These facts are known by all people of good will to be true, and known to be in harmony with the prophecy. Therefore they may be taken as competent and reliable evidence establishing the fact that Christ Jesus, as the Representative of the great Theocratic Ruler Jehovah, came to His temple in the spring of the year 1918. Armageddon now impends, and it is time for all people of good will to hear and attend unto the Kingdom message. “But the Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.”—Habakkuk 2:20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;______</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Half the World’s Chemicals</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">♦ Dr. C. M. A. Stine, in an address at Miami Beach, Florida, before a prewar committee of one hundred leading industrialists, scientists and publicists, declared that the United States is today producing half the chemicals of the world, can take its own nitrates from the air, manufacture a substitute for rubber that is better than rubber itself, make its own camphor, and shortly will have a silk, nylon, that will be equal to that produced by nature.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">♦ A new metal, within two-tenths of one percent as hard as diamonds, the hardest known substance, has been produced by a Pennsylvania metallurgical chemist. The new metal is composed of tungsten (used in electric light filaments), titanium (used as a pigment in white paint), and carbon. With this new metal alloys have been made so hard that they withstand pressure of three hundred thousand pounds a square inch. The new metal has been used to make valves for deep oilwell pumps where there is tremendous wear. Two such valves have been driven together by a pneumatic hammer 600 times a minute, at 25 pounds for each blow, without showing appreciable wear after an hour and 45 minutes of hammering.—Australian </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation. .</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">.♦ Such advances have been made in America in the cracking of oils that in 1938 the demand was filled with less than half of the crude oil that would have been required under previous treatment. There are now being recovered from once abandoned oil fields greater amounts of oil than the fields originally produced. Even though the treachery of United States militarists did put American engines into the German planes, Germany has not at present either the oil supply or the aviation experience available in the western world, accessible to Britain.</span></p>

Cannonading will occasionally shake doors and windows 200 miles away and be unnoticed fifty miles nearer the scene of action. Probably the sound waves strike the electrical ring surrounding the earth at such an angle as to be reflected more readily to distant points than to those nearer the point of origin.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark77"></a>“The Holy Souls”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">♦ If you did not know the truth that “the dead know not any thing”, that when a man dies “his thoughts perish”, and that there is no hope for any except in a resurrection of the dead, you would be considerably impressed by the way in which texts that have no possible relation to the state of the dead are strung together to support-the “purgatory” racket.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A little book on the subject, 24 pages, put out by the Paulist Press, says that “the souls in Purgatory, the Church suffering, constitutes one great division of the Universal Church of God. It is the realm of darkness and suffering”. Match this with the Scripture statement that “Neither work, nor reason, nor wisdom, nor knowledge </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">shall</span><span class="font13"> be in hell, whither thou art hastening”.—Ecclesiastes 9:10, Roman Catholic Douay Version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It says, “No one on earth can love God so perfectly as these Holy Souls now love Him, because none see Him so clearly.” What a horrible idea, that Almighty God gets any satisfaction out of seeing poor creatures that love him so “perfectly” suffer more than here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">If they are perfect in love, then why must they remain in “purgatory” ?-l John 5:18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It also says, “The Catholic Church does not teach us anything definite, either about the nature or the duration of the pains of purgatory.” Then why be so fresh about selling indulgences with a hundred days off for this, and a hundred for that ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The little book refers to “the angelic purity and patience which they display in the midst of their pain” and that these “are all insufficient to ward off one drop of that fiery torrent”. How come the writers to know all this?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">There is a hint that ‘when God gets them into “Purgatory” ’ the only ones that can do anything for them are the priests; for “all their patience and love are without the slightest merit in the sight of God: the little things they once did were precious before God, but the great things they now suffer are as nothing”. How did they find that out? Did God tell them so on the side ?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark78"></a>The Misused Texts</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">The misused texts are Revelation 2:23, “I will give unto every one of you according to your works.” This has no reference to “Purgatory”. God is not waiting to “give” it to somebody when He gets them where they cannot help themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Malachi 3:2: “He is like a' refiner’s fire” ' applies now (since 1918) and in this life, not in a “purgatorial” existence. The same text says, “He is like fullers’ sope.” Most certainly the people in “Purgatory” have no use for soap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Hebrews 10:31: “It is a fearful thing to , fall into the hands of the living God” and to thus go into destruction. This has no reference to “Purgatory”,</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Matthew 12:36: “Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall render an account for it” does not mean that it will be fried out on a hot griddle. There is no question that most men decide their eternal destinies by their words, their expressions, what use they make of their knowledge of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Hebrews 12:6: “He scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.” The scourging is in this life, not in “Purgatory” hereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Luke 12:47,48: “Beaten with many stripes” or “beaten with few stripes” also takes place in this life, not in the hereafter. Men are responsible for the use they make of their knowledge. They are also responsible for unwillingness to acquire the knowledge they might have had. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;।</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">1 Corinthians 3:11-15: “He himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire” is also a reference to experiences in this life. This has no reference to “fiery experiences” beyond this life. The meaning is that it is hard to frankly admit mistakes. Thus, it was a great mistake to suppose and to teach that one man was “the faithful and wise servant”. It led to fiery trials for many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Psalm 41:2-4: “My tears have been my bread day and night.” This refers to experiences of sorrow in this life, not in a future one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Matthew 5: 25, 26: “Thou shalt not go out from thence [the prisoh] till thou repay the last farthing,” That is merely another way of pronouncing the judgment of everlasting destruction. The debtor will never be able to pay, and will remain forever in death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Matthew 7:2; “With what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again.” This takes place in this life, not in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Thus all the “Purgatory” texts disappear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“Purgatory” is not mentioned in any of them. There is no such place. It is all a terrible hoax and a racket besides being a horrible blasphemy against God’s holy name.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>La Guardia’s Eyes Opening</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">♦ When it was first suggested to Mayor La Guardia that many New York policemen are members of “Reverend Father” Coughlin’s “Christian Front” organization, committed to taking over the United States Government by bullets instead of ballots, he made light of it, but at length was pressed into sending out 16,903 questionnaires to members of the force to find out where they stood. Six refused to answer, 27 admitted they were still members, and 407 admitted that they had been members, but stated that they had withdrawn. In a subsequent statement the mayor said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The immaturity of the young men arrested, their visionary plan to overturn the government, all indicate that some master mind, or minds, not yet disclosed, were working on these young men and the membership of these various organizations, encouraging and inducing them to wrongdoing, disloyal and criminal acts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Mayor La Guardia knows perfectly well the “master mind, or minds,” back of the attempted breaking up of the huge Christian assembly in Madison Square Garden on June 25, 1939. The newspapers of the time admitted it, and 1,000,000 copies of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font13"> No. 4 were circulated in New York city, particularly calling the attention of Mayor La Guardia to his own remissness and that of his Roman Catholic police in not protecting the speaker and the audience on that occasion. But his administration arrested and prosecuted those that actually did the work the police were requested to do, and which it was their duty to do, and which they flatly refused to do. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Big Advertisement for Lourdes</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">♦ It was a big advertisement for the Lourdes grotto when it received Fred S. Suite, Jr.-, and he was immersed in the cold water for a half hour. But it would have been a bigger one if he had been healed, which he was not. All the papers could say was that he had found “peace and spiritual strength”. That is a simon-pure evasion. He went to Lourdes in his iron lung and came back in it. If the Lord were doing the healing at Lourdes nobody would go there a helpless cripple and come back in the same condition as when he went. The Lord does not do things that way.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>Can Hitler Conquer America?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">♦ Pierre Van Faassen; one of the best-posted newspapermen in the world, born in The Netherlands, but a British subject, thinks it quite possible that Hitler can conquer America, and has put his reasons in a remarkable article in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Liberty</span><span class="font13"> magazine for February 17, 1940. He looks for Germany to get all the wheat and oil it needs from Rumania and Russia; for Japan to seize the Dutch East Indies and thus obtain its own supply of oil and other necessities; for German forces to march through The Netherlands and Switzerland for the conquering of France by land while Britain is to be destroyed by air. German and Japanese aviators would destroy the Panama Canal, and the rest would be easy. Van Paassen does not mention the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in this world-plan, but that is really the key to it. It will be observed that the objectives are the few remaining Protestant countries, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Britain, and the United States, and that the combine against them would be Germany, Italy, Russia and Japan, all objects of tender Vatican solicitude.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark81"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark82"></a>The Japanese “Holy Year”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">♦ On February 11, 1940, the Japanese government inaugurated a “Holy Yea ri’, after the manner of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy’s “Holy Year” of 1933, later extended to 1934. None of these years have been or are holy. They have all been and are as full of the spirit of the Devil as an egg is full of meat. The Japanese emperor wanted all his subjects to “answer to the divine spirits” of his imperial ancestors. It is just too bad, hut his imperial ancestors did not have any divine spirits; they are dead; they know not anything. These are the teachings of God’s Word. They contradict* the teachings of the Japanese emperor and of all other religionists, including President Roosevelt and Myron C. Taylor and the pope.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark83"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark84"></a>Priests Use This Argument, Too</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">♦ Said Manton, in his appeal to the United States Supreme Court, from the decision which found him guilty of selling decisions of bis courts to litigants who could assist him financially:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">From a broad viewpoint it serves no public policy for a high judicial officer to be convicted of a judicial crime. It tends to destroy the confidence of the people in the courts.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark85"></a>“Approved in Principle”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">♦ No one can deny that when President Roosevelt sent Myron C. Taylor as his personal ambassador to the ]&gt;ope it was in all essentials a union of church and state, for the reason that Taylor is to bo paid out of public funds. When representatives of the Baptist, Lutheran and Seventh-Day Adventist denominations called on the president and stated that they objected to any union of ehurch and state he told them that he appreciated their position and approved in principle their position. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Truth Seeker</span><span class="font13"> says caustically that this statement is mere Jesuitic demagoguery and “so might a swindling merchant caught in weighting his scales reply that in principle he approves of sixteen ounces to the pound”.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark86"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark87"></a>The Madonna of Bourguillon</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">♦ Maybe you have never heard of the Madonna of Bourguillon. But it seems that she is a person of considerable prominence in Switzerland; so important, in fact, that the “Mast Reverend” bishop of Geneva recited the following prayer to the lady. It seems that this business of praying to women is widespread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“We beseech thee, O Mother, to protect our country once more unci to obtain from thy Divine Son the peace of which we have such. We place ourselves in thy hands and promise thee absolute fidelity. We consecrate to tins* all those who are dear to us, our living and our (lead, ourselves, our families, our parishes and our army, the sentinel of our independence and of our liberty.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark88"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark89"></a>How Come?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">♦ A </span><span class="font13">dispatch from Washington states that “of the white workers in the Chicago stock yards 98 percent are members of the Catholic church”. That may be true, and in view of the fact that only 20 pewent of the American people arc Catholics one wonders just </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">why </span><span class="font13">it should be true, and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font13"> it is that people who eat no meat on Friday should have a virtual monopoly of preparing the meat for others who eat less fish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Coughlin Losing Influence</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">♦ “Reverend Father” Coughlin, once designated by his friends as the “Savior of America”, seems to lx* losing influence. At one time his followers could deluge Congress with telegrams and letters and seriously affect legislation. Now it is all in vain. The last time it was tried (on the embargo question) the influence exerted by the usual sheaf of telegrams was almost nil, and the result actually so.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>Coughlin’s “Christian Front”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">♦ In the July 31,1939, issue of his paper “Social Justice” “Reverend Father” Coughlin carried screaming headlines “Christian Front Carries Fight Into More States”; and. in the August 7 issue of the same paper, said, “The place for you, as a Christian, is on the Christian Front.” In </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Commonweal</span><span class="font13"> (Catholic weekly journal) appeared the admission:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Father Coughlin, The Brooklyn Tablet, Social Justice and their many abettors and sympathizers must bear the direct responsibility for the plight of these 17 young men. For months The Tablet’s correspondence columns have been the free public forum for the national director of the group, John F. Cassidy.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark92"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark93"></a>None Out and None In</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">♦ The Brooklyn </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Tablet</span><span class="font13"> is authority for the statement that—</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the four centuries of its existence, the Protestant church has failed to produce even one “saint” in any of its numerous branches, and the same will be said after another 400 years if the Protestant church still exists, because the Catholic church has a monopoly of “saints”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">♦ What is all this story from Rome about the pope’s losing things? First he loses one of his cuff links. It dropped off; one of his devotees swiped it, and then sent him anonymously' a 1,000-lire ($52.62j) bill to recompense him. And the next story is that only a few days later he lost his so-called “Ring of the Fisherman”. It dropped into the mitt of another devotee who had just kissed his hand. The po]&gt;e missed it, and a few minutes later the man gave it back. Good boy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">♦ The London </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Universe</span><span class="font13"> tells how “The Cure d’Ars” informed a woman whose husband had suicided that her husband had repented between the top of the bridge and the water into which he plunged, and so had landed in “■Purgatory” all O.K.

<p><span class="font13">♦ The history of the last thousand years tells us that wherever the Church of Rome is not a dagger to pierce the bosom of a free nation, she is a stone to her neck and a ball to her feet, to paralyze her and prevent her advancement in the ways of civilization, science, intelligence, happiness and liberty. Though not a prophet, I see a very dark cloud on our horizon. And that dark cloud is coming from Rome. It is filled with tears of blood. It will rise and increase till its flanks will be torn by a flash of lightning, followed by a fearful peal of thunder. Then a c.vclone, such as the world has never seen, will pass over this country, spreading ruin and desolation from North and South.

In Ontario, in the same year, there were, in proportion to the population, almost five times as many in jail. Those trained in parochial schools would not even know how to figure out these proportions.</span></p>

At one point, in their congress in New York city, Gael Sullivan (guess his “church”), assistant to Mayor Edward J. Kelly of Chicago (guess his “church”), made a dramatic address boosting the man in the White House and orating against political and civic corruption. When he had finished, a young man from Brooklyn rose and suggested that he was shocked that advice of this kind would come from Chicago, where corruption is even more advanced than in New York.

<p><span class="font13">♦ At Montreal the relatives of a woman who had been out of the Roman Catholic sect for seven years entered her home, after her death, and attempted to work the old gag that they had a paper signed by her before her death that she had turned Roman Catholic. They demanded her body, so that it might be buried in Roman Catholic ground, and thus the “church” would get the usual rake-off. In this instance the husband called the police and the noisy relatives had to beat a retreat. The funeral and interment were conducted according to his wishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Vatican Propaganda in Britain</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">♦ The idea that Germany, or at least Westphalia and possibly the Rhine provinces, will shortly have a Catholic monarch who will build up a new and more truly “great” Germany is held by a number of people who have read (at great risk of severe punishment) a cyclostyled circular recently issued in the West of the Reich.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This circular contains a set of verses originally issued from the Monastery of Kollin, in Brandenburg, in the twelfth century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">These verses are of a prophetical character and foretell that in the latter days a great war shall arise. The Kaiser shall leave the land.

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Spanish Inquisition Progressing</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">♦ The Spanish Inquisition is progressing nicely. With the same high-minded disposition as Torquemada, Franco required every person who was loyal to the Spanish Republic, and served in the Spanish army, to appear before a military tribunal to explain why he was loyal, instead of disloyal, like Franco himself. The same rule applies to all civil servants of the government, and even concierges of apartment houses. Naturally, the cowardly squeal on others and the results are all that even Hitler could wish. Armageddon will settle it all for ever. In the meantime Spain is short of wheat, olive oil, dried vegetables and sugar, which are the principal foods of the common people. The British Catholic who started all this by illegally flying a plane to Franco, so he could start the rebellion, merits contempt equal to that of Franco himself;</span></p>

Think of a church praying for the safety and success of its members as they sneak out of filthy dugouts at night bent upon a murdering expedition, and crawl through rusty barbwire entanglements and drop into slimy hell holes to throw deadly “iron pineapples” at other church members, who have been similarly prayed for in the army of the enemy.

<h3><a name="bookmark138"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark139"></a>Report on Spiritism</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">• About three years ago the dignitaries of the church of England, faced with an agitation raised by hundreds of the clergy who had dabbled with spiritism and had fallen victims, saw themselves under the necessity of taking some action. As this church is not a totalitarian organization like the Roman church, the parsons could not be arbitrarily silenced in their demand for liberty to adjust the prayer book rule of service to their new ideas. The archbishop of Canterbury appointed a committee to investigate &quot;‘spiritualism”. The commit tee took two years in its investigation, and reported its findings a few months ago. The two archbishops, Canterbury, and York, and 24 bishops considered these findings, and have decided they shall not be published. The plain reading of that decision is that these men have bumped against something they don’t want to talk about. Naturally the spiritists are jubilant, though, so sure are they that the committee has met with evidence in favor of their claims, they would Ixs better pleased if the report were published. The Roman Catholic church has always set itself against spiritism, and in this has conformed to the Scriptures; but not for love of the truth, </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">nor </span><span class="font13">that it might be a true supporter of the Scriptures, for its claim is that the Scriptures arc given to it for use in support of its church. The fact is that, if it is possible to talk with the dead, as spiritists claim, the dogma of “purgatory” “goes with the wind”, and “purgatory” not only is one of the props of tlie Roman Catholic church, but is, perhaps, the most profitable of its rackets. It is easy to see why spiritism is anathema to the Roman Hierarchy. The church of England has not got its dead on its hands, and it does not know where they are; but the phenomena of spiritism has proved itself too strong for these hundreds of parsons and they have fallen to this deception of the Devil. Forsaking the light of the Scriptures, they go into the dark, to spirits that “peep and mutter”, and get their proof (!) of their dogma of human immortality from them. (See Isaiah 8:1.9.) If the archbishops and the bishops had the light of the Scriptures in them they would have dealt with this deflection of the clergy in a very different way. The fact is, of course, that they all are in the dark: the archbishop of Canterbury says, “It is not proposed to publish the report at present, as further investigation is required.” Just so! And in the meantime the demons, who are now particularly active, will get the better of them all, and will lead them into further darkness and then to destruction. These great church systems not only have ignored the instruction of the Word of God, the Scriptures, but have used them for the purpose of building up their organizations. They have played tricks with the holy Scriptures, picking out passages to support tbeir dogmas, perverting plain meanings, and, as in the case of the Roman church, have made the sayings of their own supporters to be accepted on equal authority with the words given by the spirit of God. Sometimes some of these principals of the flock speak candidly of their position: they know they are wmndering about as in a fog, uncertain of their steps and lacking anything to guide them on their way. One of these w<sup>r</sup>rote recently, “Moreover, bow can we speak of the Trinity as a divinely given &quot;truth of revelation’ when we know well that it has been hammered out by generations of human thinkers and still remains incomplete ?” Jehovah’s witnesses, enlightened with the truth which Jesus brought, and faithfully following His words, know that the dogma of a trinity of gods—-which is what that dogma really amounts to—is Satan’s masterpiece of deception fastened on the churches.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark140"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark141"></a>Romanizing of England</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">• The &quot;&quot;Hierarchy of Authority” in Rome has set itself the task of bringing its church into great&lt;!r prqpiinence in England. What it is doing behind the scenes is known only to those in the Hierarchy’s cabinet in the Vatican; but its public works and intentions are openly stated in the Roman Catholic newspapers and journals. No doubt the present troubled situation is considered as providing an opportunity specially favorable to this purpose. The antagonistic attitude of Russia towards Britain since its pact with Hitler'has made it easy for the British hierarchy to throw in its support for the Allies. To them it is a fight against its dreaded enemy Communism, which, of course, has no use for religion, and which in power in Europe would clear all organized religion out of its way, as its chief enemy to its progress. The black outlook in Europe for the in* crease of the power of the Vatican is, no doubt, a very good reason for its endeavor to get a greater hold in Britain, and England in particular. The Roman Catholic newspapers under the urge of the Hierarchy and with its “blessing” are combining in a set purpose to get their journals into the homes of all the people. A systematic drive is being organized, so that every house shall be visited, and newspapers canvassed for, and leaflets—apparently free from any propaganda for the church— shall be left, for the moral and spiritual uplift of the people. To give a “spiritual” backing to this purpose the pope ordered that prayers should be made by all Roman Catholics for the conversion of England, and their saint Mary has been specially invoked to Attend to this matter. That church wants to have the worship of Mary—better described as mari-olatry—fastened on England as it was in preReformation days. The Hierarchy tells its people that England is particularly dear to Mary, for it was in England, in the days when the Papacy held rule, that the newly fashioned dogma of the immaculate conception of Mary, the mother of Jesus, was most firmly held and taught. That Minding piece of darkness has been of the greatest service to the Roman church, for by it the Papacy got its chief aid in the exaltation of Mary into worship of her as if she were as exalted as the Scriptures tell of Jesus. And by this newly 'fashioned dogma the Devil got fastened on that church his older scheme of getting men to believe that the power of God was held in a trinity of father and son and mother. This old pagan doctrine, from the time of Nimrod and the rise of old Babylon, became one of the most prominent features of “Babylon</span><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>-</sup> the Great, the mother of harlots” (Revelation 17: 5) ■ and this is what the Roman Catholic church seeks now to fasten on England. The so-called “Protestant” churches no longer protest against these blasphemous dogmas; rather they look to Rome as the chief means of keeping religion—and themselves—from being swamped by the floods of ungodliness, and of apathy towards religion which they now see threatening it and them.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark142"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark143"></a>Jehovah’s witnesses</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">• Undoubtedly there are some among the ranks of the English churches, and throughout Britain and northern Ireland, who view with alarm this revival of Roman Catholic energy to increase its hold on Britain; but for the most part they are silent. Some raise their voices, but to them it seems like crying out to the incoming tide to stop its waves. But not so with Jehovah’s witnesses. These are not Protestants: they are witnesses to Jehovah, of His truth, of His purpose in the establishment of His kingdom, and His witnesses against this evil thing that has been fastened on men and has blinded their eyes to the glory of the Living God as revealed in His Word. Their witness makes the hierarchies in the various countries exceedingly angry—the “Hierarchy of Authority” has not yet publicly manifested itself, and these do not cease to speak evil against the witnesses, nor refrain from molesting their persons as occasion may arise. In the meantime faithful men and women go to the people with the message of truth, and thousands are being enlightened to the honor of God and are worshiping Him according to the truth revealed in the Scriptures—Jehovah’s witness to himself.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark144"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark145"></a>Renewing the Attack</span></h3>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">• In a recent reissue of one of their old attacks on the publications of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society there is no lessening of the bitter spirit of the first publication, nor any less lying either about the literature or those who are responsible for it. These men, blinded by their perverseness, have learned nothing from the manifested blessing of God upon the labors of His people—thousands have been brought into the light of the Word of truth, and are serving God in knowledge and understanding, and with a zeal which only faith. and knowledge can bring. These know that they are giving the witness which Jehovah purposed should be given at this time, and which Jesus said should be given in the last days. (See Matthew 24; 14.) A main feature of the religion of the Plymouth Brethren is that of “preaching the Gospel” each Sunday evening. Their morning is reserved for their fellowship meeting. But the “preaching of the Gospel” by the Plymouth Brethren includes and invariably stresses the preaching of eternal damnation for all nonbelievers. This 'gospel of damnation’ to eternal torment is their own addition to the message of Christ, for the Gospel of Jesus, the Gospel of the Kingdom, knows nothing of that blasphemy against God. Nor have they any warrant for it in the Scrip-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">tures: the apostles never preached it. In the degenerate days of Israel the Jews set abominations—the idols of the neighboring nations —in the temple, and professed to serve Jehovah through them. To complete their worship they sometimes went out of the city to the valley of Tophet (Gehenna) to offer young children in sacrifice to Molech, placing the young in the extended arms of the idol, heated by tierce fire. Rebuking these wicked hypocrites Jehovah repudiated them ahd their worship, and declares their practices ‘neither came into my mind’. (See Jeremiah 19:5.) The preaching of the dogma of eternal torment is a magnifying of the enormity of the blasphemy of the Jews when, by that means, they professed to show their great fear towards God. Those who hold the dogma of eternal torment can hardly be expected to be free from its evil influence, or to have any compunction about speaking evil of the Truth and its messengers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Jehovah’s witnesses are separate from all the religious sects and systems, and apparently they are hated of them all. This, from a human viewpoint, is natural enough; for the truth held to and witnessed exposes the perversions of the Scriptures by which the religions of “Christendom” support themselves, each sect and section picking out its own texts for that purpose. The Truth is anathema to all of them, from Roman Catholics at the head to the Plymouth Brethren at the tail. The Plymouth Brethren are the descendants of a company of men who met in Plymouth, Devon, and who saw clearly that the priestcraft of </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font13">churches was entirely contrary to the purpose of Christ and to the' teaching and example of the apostles. They increased in numbers and the name Plymouth Brethren got fastened upon them, though they dislike it as much as the Roman Catholic church dislikes the' word Roman. They are fairly numerous in various parts of Britain and northern Irelandbut now they are divided into sections, split because they do not agree about their own manner of meetings. While separating themselves from religious practices they retained the orthodoxy of the systems, and made themselves champions of its main dogmas, that is, the dogma of Trinity, of human immortality, and the terrible dogma, of eternal torment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">These two sections of religion, the head and tail of orthodox religions, have been and are the most active of them all in crying out against the witness to the truth of the Scriptures which Jehovah is sending forth by His witnesses: they are the readiest of all in speaking evil of it and its servants. From the violence of some of the pamphlets it may be supposed that had they an organization such as Rome has they would follow its methods in trying to stop the witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The Plymouth Brethren pamphleteer is so rabid as to prevent himself from allowing that the literature of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society can possibly have been published except for an evil purpose, certainly not with any desire of honoring God, and Christ. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">He calls that which scores of thousands of consecrated men and women know is the truth of the Word, by which they have been enlightened, and by which they serve God in understanding, a “vicious counterfeit”. He can say nothing better of it than “It is a concoction made up of ingredients from all the heresies that have attacked the true gospel of God”. He proceeds to lie, thick and fast, saying, “It is an insidious attack on the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ; it robs him of his preexistent glory with the Father . . . rejects his resurrection, and degrades him to the level of a mere magician playing tricks upon his disciples ... it destroys the blessed hope of the church.” It would be difficult to get more malicious lies into so small a compass; but the pamphleteer seems to have enjoyed his task, for he rounds it off with the favorite text of the Plymouth Brethren when they want to say something strong, for with the backing of a text (though misused) he says the witness to the honor of Jehovah is a damnable heresy. (See 2 Peter 2:1.) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Both the writer of the pamphlet and its publishers (an old Plymouth Brethren firm) know perfectly well that this diatribe perverts the truth. They know that Jehovah’s witnesses are faithful disciples, seeking to follow the Lord, and they bemoan the loss they sustain when now and again one of their number finds the light and follows it. They will take their place with the opposers of the truth. One who had been enlightened by the truth told how he had been accosted by a Roman Catholic priest, known to his family a long time. After the usual greeting, the priest said, “How is your brother?” “Well,” was the reply, adding, “but he has joined the Plymouth Brethren.” “Glory be,” said the priest; “he is not far from us.” What the priest meant is self-evident.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Worse than Native Shanghai</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">♦ The Ministry of Health report on tuberculosis conditions in Wales brings to light conditions which are described as in some respects worse-than the native quarters of Shanghai. </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font13">particular offender in Wales is what is styled the &quot;old-fashioned Celtic house”. It is not much of a house. The technical description follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The height to the eaves is about 8 feet. The house is divided into two rooms by a thin partition, one a living room and the other the sleeping chamber. The floor is of earth, or mud and lime, or stone or slate. Often, to provide further sleeping accommodation, boards have been put across from wall to wall called the “grog-loft”, whose height at ite apex is 5 or 6 feet, tapering down to nothing at the ■ walls; sometimes it has a skylight. In some of these houses there is </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font13">puddle made originally as s well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“Frequently, the tuberculosis patient is placed in the ‘grog-loft’, and, unless he is moved to a sanatorium or outside shelter, there he lies in stifling conditions until he dies. It is impossible to disinfect such a place, and after the patient dies someone else occupies the bed—too frequently it is occupied by young children.”—-London </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Express.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Why the Increase in Furs</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">♦ London, now the center of the world’s trade in furs, notices a great increase in the demand. As an example, ten years ago the number of fox furs offered was about 96,000. Last year it was nearly 1,000,000. The explanation offered is that central heating has abolished heavy underclothing, and motorcars have made it necessary' to have warm outer garments. Result: Less underwear is sold, and more furs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Why So Many Refugees?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">ALL NATIONS there are now many</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">-*■ REFUGEES seeking a place where they might abide in security and have a reasonable opportunity to enjoy some comforts. That the number of REFUGEES is certain to increase in the near future must be conceded, and this fact alone increases the distress of many among the people who now have a measure of peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“You are among those who seek the best information obtainable as to why so many .sorrows have come upon the people.

<p><span class="font13">“The indisputable proof is that all the nations have forgotten God and have yielded entirely to wicked demons, and therefore the nations are wicked.

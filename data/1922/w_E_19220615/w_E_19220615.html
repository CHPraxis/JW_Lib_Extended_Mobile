<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">T0IS JOURNAL AND ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HIS Journal !s one of the prime factors or instruments in the system of Bible instruction, or </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Seminary Extension”, now being </span><span class="font7">presented in all parts of the civilized world by the Watch Tower Biblb &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, chartered A. D. 1884, “For the Promotion ot Christian Knowledge”. It not only serves as a class room where Bible students may meet in the study of the divine Word but also as a channel of communication through which they may be reached with announcements of the Society’s conventions and of the coming of its traveling repiesentatives, styled “Pilgrims”, and refreshed with reports of its conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our “Berean Lessons” are topical rehearsals or reviews of our Society’s published Studies most entertainingly arranged, and very helpful to all who would merit the only honorary degree which the Society accords, viz., Fe?b» </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Dei Minister</span><span class="font7"> (V. D. M.), which translated Inlo English is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Minister of God’8 Word.</span><span class="font7"> Our tieatment of the International Sunday School Lessons is specially for the older Bible students and teachers. By some this feature is considered indispensable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thu journal stands firmly for the defense of the only true foundation of the Christian’s hope now being so generally repudiated —redemption through the precious blood of “the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ransom</span><span class="font7"> [a corresponding price, a substitute] for all”. (1 Peter 1:19; 1 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Timothy 2:6)</span><span class="font7"> Building upon this sure </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">foundation the gold,</span><span class="font7"> silver and precious stones (1 Corinthians 3: 1115; 2 Peter 1:5-11) of the Word of God, its further mission is to “make all see what is the fellowship of the mystery which. . .has been hid in God, ... to the intent that now might be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of God”—“which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed”.—Ephesians 3:5-9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It stands free from all parties, sects and creeds of men, while it seeks more and more to bring its every utterance into fullest Bubiection to the will of God in Christ, as expiessed in the holy Scriptures. It is thus free to declare boldly whatsoever the Lord hath spoken—according to the divine wisdom granted unto us to understand his utterances. Its attitude is not dogmatic, but confident; for we know whereof we affirm, treading with implicit faith upon the sure promises of God. It is held as a trust, to be used only in his service; hence our decisions relative to what may and what mav not appear m its columns must be according to our judgment of his good pleasuie, the teaching of his Word, for the upbuilding of Ins people in grace and knowledge. And we not only invite but urge ouc readers to prove all its utterances by the infallible Word to which reference is constantly made to facilitate such testing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the church is “the temple of the living God”, peculiarly “his workmanship” ; that its construction has been in progress throughout the gospel age—over since Christ became the world’s Redeemer and the Chief Corner Stone of his temple, through which, when finished, God's blessing shall come “to all </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">people”, and</span><span class="font7"> they find access to him.—1 Corinthians 3:16, 17; Ephesians </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">2:20-22; </span><span class="font7">Genesis 28:14; Galatians 3 : 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That meantime the chiseling, shaping, and polishing of consecrated believers in Christ’s atonement for sin, progresses ; and when the last of these “living stones”, “elect and precious,” shall have been made ready, the great Master Workman will bring all together in the first resurrection ; and the temple snail be filled with his glory, and be the meeting place between God and men throughout the Millennium —Revelation 15.5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the basis of hope, for the church and the world, lies in the fact that “Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">every </span><span class="font7">man,” “a ransom for all,” and w ill be “the true light which lighteth </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">every man that cometh into the world”,</span><span class="font7"> “in due time”.— Jleorews 2:9; John 1.9 ; 1 Timothy 2:5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the hope of the church is that she mav be like her Lord, “see him as he is,” be “partakers of the divine nature’,’ and share his gloiy as his joint-heir.—1 John 3.2, John 17.24, Romans 8:17; 2 Peter 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the present mission of the church is the perfecting of the saints for the future work of service; to develop in herself every giace , to be God’s witness to the world , and to prepare to be kings and puests in the next age.—Ephesians 4 .12 ; Matthew 24: 14; Revelation 1:6; 20:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the hope for the world lies in the blessings of knowledge and opportunity to be brought to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font7"> by Christ’s Millennial kingdom, tha restitution of all that was lost in Adam, to all the willing and obedient, at the hands of their Redeemer and his glorified church* when all the wilfully wicked will be </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">destroyed.—</span><span class="font7">Acts 3:19-23; Isaiah 35.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark16"></a>VIEWS FROM THE WATCH TOWER</span></h3>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">B</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">IG </span><span class="font10">BUSINESS and the politicians are approaching the frantic in their endeavors to save themselves and their prestige. Having “propaganded” the world into the war that they might make huge profits, they have been vainly endeavoring to propaganda it back to a condition of docility and recognition of their leadership. The wails of woe coming from the Genoa Conference have been bitter indeed. Their first hope was to catch the people with the slogan “to end war and make the world safe for the common people— Democracy”. Second, the late lamented League of Nations failed to bring forth to the birth. Third, the Washington Disarmament Conference was an abortion. Thus hope after hope vanished like the will-o-the-wisp before the rising sun. With one accord their hopes were centered in the Genoa Conference. But their cries of pain have been louder than before. The world refuses to respond. They are like the boy who played with his fellows by crying “Wolf! Wolf!” in order to see them run to his assistance. But he played the game too often. When the wolf did come, his companions refused to believe him and he was left to fight his own battle. So these have been crying “Peace! peace!” and their fellows have followed them. But the people have no further faith in them, and they are left to follow their own schemes, which are surely leading into the ditch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In order to lead the world to adopt the League of Nations, the cry was made that the failure of it would ‘break the heart of the world’ if it were not adopted. As each succeeding hope was offered, it was painted in dark colors and lugubrious terms that if the world should fail to adopt it, the result would be certain destruction. They mean, of course, the destruction of their own leadership, precedence and opportunities for the shearing the sheep. God is left out of their plans entirely. Thus, he is permitting them to demonstrate their own foolishness and weakness. The duplicity and hypocrisy of those who engineered the disastrous Treaty of Versailles have been brought to light and the public has lost confidence in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Few politicians are sincere; they have no intention </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">taking the common people into their confidence; and all of their utterances must be considered with </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">proper allowance for the fact that a politician rarely </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">says </span><span class="font10">what he thinks, and that his words are framed with the purpose of enlisting public opinion for some intended later action. With an understanding of the fact that there are many last hopes to come, and that the British money power and bankrupt Europe cast envious eyes upon America’s financial resources, the expressions of Lloyd George are interesting. As reported in the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font10"> Mr. George says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">PERILOUS TIMES HAVE COME</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“ ‘I wish America were here. . . . America exercises a peculiar authority. . . . America could exercise an influence no other country could command. She could come heie free and disentangled; and with the prestige which conies from her independent position, she would come with the voice of peace. But America is not here; so Europe must do her best to solve the problems in her own way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“ ‘We triumphed in the war, but our triumph will not last forever. If our victory develops into oppression, vengeance will follow, just as Germany’s action which started the World War, was followed by vengeance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“ ‘We must be just and equitable and show strength. We must realize that Europe is not on good tei ms, and that storms are arising which we must deal with We had hoped that the end of the great war meant the end of brute force, but unless Europe’s problems aie solved, there is no assurance that force has given way to light</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“ ‘You are here,’ he continued, nddiessing the Confeience, ‘to instruct, to sustain, to guide, and I beg of you in the interests of the woikl’s future, not to add to the obstacles which are in the way, but to use your influence to help in the solution of difficulties which are full of peril.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“He compared Europe,” says the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font9"> “to seething racial lava, which like the earth’s crust was seeking a proper level This adjustment was full of peril He emphasized that Europe must take cognizance of hungry Russia, which would be equipped by an angi y Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Mr. George gave it as his opinion that the disorganization of Europe would affect the entire world, including the United States. He w<sup>r</sup>as amazed at people who ignored the portentous fact facing Europe today. Unless Europe reorganized—in other words, unless the Genoa Conference succeeded in arranging a compact of peace-—he was confident that in his own life, certainly in the life of the younger men present, Europe would again welter in blood ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The two-homed beast of Revelation — British imperialistic business, church and politics — beholds itself challenged by the antitypical Chaldeans of the land of the north. Its hitherto sole power imperiled from without and undermined by discontent from within, the beast growls out forebodings for others that are especially for itself; for imperialism is one of the fea-</span><span class="font9">179</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">turos of the empire of Satan, and is close to its end. The fall of imperialism will mean a prodigious step toward liberty for the common people, but the forebodings of the imperialists are set forth as those of the people. Soon light will dawn upon benighted Christendom, and all will behold these matters in their right, the divine aspect.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">An ancient prophecy finds fulfillment in a modern electro-magnetic device. Ages ago, contemporaneously with Abraham, Jehovah asked the prophet Job: “ Can st thou lift up thy voice to the clouds? . . . Canst thou send lightnings [electricity] that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are?” (Job 38:34, 35) Today, forty centuries after Job, the Lord has enabled puny man to perform something like this wonderful feat. The story of how the message of present truth goes forth broadcast, on the wings of the lightning, is related in the following account from the Philadelphia </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Record </span><span class="font10">for April 17, 1922 :</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Radio Tells the World Millennium is Coming. Judge Rutherford’s Lecture Broadcasted fiom Metropolitan Opera House. Talks into Transmitter. Message is Carried Over Miles of Bell Telephone Wiies to Howlett’s Station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The millennium sets in in the jeur 1925, human woe will then start to vanish, and disease and sickness, and death itself will be no more, was the message pronounced thiough a ladio-transmitter by ex-Judge J F. Rutheiford, of the New York City Bar, standing on the platform of the Metropolitan Opera House yesterday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The house was packed from oichestia to roof, and these thousands weie but a mere handful to the many thousands moie who heard the Judge’s voice broadcasted for miles around. It was the first time, for most of those present, to be confronted by a public speaker holding an instrument to his lips and constantly changing it from side to side because one arm after the other would get too tired to keep it up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Judge Rutherford delivered his lecture, ‘Millions Now Living Will Never Die’. His voice was picked up by a supersensitive microphone transmitter and transferred to the local private wires of the Bell Telephone Company, located on the stage, through a system of voice amplification. Having thus transferred the highly amplified voice waves to the local telephone wires it was canned electrically to the radio telephone broadcasting station of WGL on North Broad street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The highly amplified voice signals passed through the Bell Telephone exchange and out over three to four miles of wiie, and proceeded on until it arrived at the radiotelephone broadcasting station and there again passed through a system of voice amplification similar to that at the opposite end of the line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">VOICE WAVES CHANGE THEIR NATURE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“These ultra-amplified electrical voice waves were then transferred over to the transmitting circuit of the radio telephone broadcasting equipment and there were changed from an electrical nature to an electro-magnetic nature of an extreme high frequency, oscillatory in action. The voice waves were then passed on to the antenna, where they were discharged out into atmospherical space in the form of electro-magnetic waves having a wave length of 360 meters. It was this 360-meter electro-magnetic wave, having a frequency of approximately 875,000 oscillations per second and travelling over the earth’s surface at the race of 300,000,000 meters or 186,000 miles per second, carrying with it the voice signals, that the radio enthusiasts received on their receiving sets during the course of this lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“This radiotelephonic feature was made possible by the cooperation of the managing and engineering executives of the Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania, working in conjunction with the high-power radiotelephone broadcasting station operated and controlled by Thomas F. P. Howlett, at 2303 North Broad street, working under supervision of H C. Kuser, radio telephone expert, representing Judge Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">WARNS AGAINST FAKERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Mr. Kuser recalled that recently the newspapers published an article compiled by a prominent minister and scientist, which stated that possibly on Easter Sunday, yesterday, some of the angelic spirits of the celestial realm would communicate with mankind through the system of radio telephony. He said such a thing is far beyond reason and belief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Any individual or company or coiporation oilering ladio telephone equipment for sale 1or the puipose of communicating with the spirits of the depiuted is a farce, lie said, and people should not look upon the radiophone as anything but a practical, woi kaday invention on a par w ith wire telephony and wire telegraphy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">MANY LISTEN IN AT HOME</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Many persons in this city who have vvneless sets in their homes called up Mr Howlett on the icgul.u telephone alter the lecture to compliment him on the clearness with winch they heard Judge Rutherford's nddiess transmitted thiough the air by means of his bioadcasting station. All said Unit theie was a little difhcultj in healing the Judge's voice distinctly for about five minutes after he started, but that after the wire trouble was rectified the iest of the address for an hour and a half came as clear and distinct as if they were seated in the front seats in the Metropolitan Opera House and they could easily distinguish eveiy intonation of his voice. Mr. Howlett claims that his apparatus will transmit the human voice through a space over a radius of 1200 miles.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is estimated that fully 50,000 people living in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware thus heard the lecture over the wires while sitting in their own homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">MILLENNIUM NEAR AT HAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At the time of the Lord’s birth ‘all men were in expectation of him’, but at his coming as Messiah to his people only the few Israelites indeed still maintained their immediate hope of the promised One. In dispen-sational parallel there was a world-wide expectation of Christ’s second presence fostered by the Miller movement of 1844; but at the present time when the revelation to the world of the second presence is imminent, few proportionally speaking look for him soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Among those that look for his appearing is Frederic Booth Tucker, commissioner of the Salvation Army in India, who is reported in the Pittsburgh </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Press</span><span class="font10"> as saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“No real peace can come unless someone holds the ‘big stick’ of authority. There is no earthly pow’er big enough fcr this, but Christ will come and come soon. Orders then will be given from Joi ir-.ilein, anil it w ill bring the only kind of peace po-^ibk', :i peace which will be cleaned by everj body, a peace w iihoui jv.ilous.v, for lie will be supieine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mr. Tucker expressed the belief that the beginning of the Millennial Age, the 1,000 jcais of Christ’s reign to bring in the perfect peace foretold in the Scriptures, the actual second presence of Christ is near at hand. He added some remarks about the devil worshipers of India which arc in accoidance with the Scriptures (1 Corinthians 10: 20) :</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Talking of Ins work the last thirty-nine yean. in India Commissioner Tucker told some veiv inteiesting things. He sa.is m.mv of the natives are given to ‘devil worship’, and quite louic.illv They «.iy the.v need not worship good gods, for tliov won't hurt them. The natives worship, or rather propitiate, evil spoils. They say “What is the use of being a god it one is not evil? There is no fun in being a good god. Then if the gods are evil, then priests are the same, and Ihe people may as well be like Ilie priests.’”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">An old adage says, “Like pnest, like people,’’ and Mr. Tucker tells of criminality as the profession of large numbers of the people of India. He says nothing, however, about the chai actor of the ctei nal-torture God whom the Salvationists teach, but he does touch on the character of those bi ought up under such teachings and believers m such a God:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Commissionei Tuckei savs the Christian religion in India . &nbsp;. would glow moie i.ipidly if it were not for</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">some Christi,ins J’lie natives sav. ‘you pioach jour Christ; yet the Cinistians get iliunk. lie. steal, dance, male and female togeihei which is an abomination. In what are they better than we?’”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“MILLENNIUM BEFORE 1924,” SAYS WATTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A Maivland evangelist. Reverend D. L. Watts, is reported in the Pittsburgh </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Dispatch,</span><span class="font10"> as saying that the Millennium will dawn before 1'12-1:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“All the indications are that &lt;&nbsp;.'hint's second coining is only a mattei ol a lew vein's Indeed leading theologians agree upon it 'The Biblical piopheeies are being fulfilled to the letter. I doubt veiy much it another President of the United States will be elected. ... If some morning we should awake to find, Unit Christ had come, business and social lite would stop with the suddenness of a tram collision. Spring stv les would he the least of woman’s cares. The stock ni.uket would not inteiest a single man. Salvation then would be uppermost in the minds of all.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is doubtful whether Reverend Watts has considered the economic and social effect of such a coming of Christ as he and other “orthodox” clergymen speak of. The stoppage of business and industry for only a week would result m extieme difficulty m starting it up again, and might plunge the world into chaos. Jehovah’s infinite wisdom, as icvealed in the plan of the ages, and in the manner and purpose of the Lord’s return, has provided a kindly and merciful order of events connected with the Lord’s second advent. Some day, a not distant day, the clergy vv ill awaken to the fact that the Lord has come, and that the second advent has been an accomplished fact since 1874; and then they will echo the question one to another, “Why are we the last to welcome back the King?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SECOND ADVENT FEARED AND DENOUNCED</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The hope and belief in the imminent coming of the kingdom of heaven is stirring some of the clergy to renewed zeal and others toward a repressive attitude toward their more wide-awake brothers. Those that look for an early second advent are teaching that it will be characterized by scenes of the utmost bloodshed and horror. In this they are partially in accoi d with the truth on the subject; but they look for tribulation which will practically eliminate humankind from the earth, to a far greater extent that the Scriptures indicate. This teaching is known among their opponents as “fundamentalism” and is vigorously opposed by those of the clergy that have lost much of their faith in an inspired Bible and are advocates, rather, of the pseudo-science of evolution higher criticism, and materialism, or in some instances of a “spiritual” application of the Bible along lines not unfamiliar to New Thought and other doctrines akin to spiritism. One of the opposers of “fundamentalism” is Reverend Albert C. Dieflenbach, editor of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Christian Register,</span><span class="font10"> who, according to the Baltimore </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">News,</span><span class="font10"> spoke as follows at the Arlington .Street, Boston, Unitarian Church:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Teaching of a second coming of Christ ‘in the blood of his foes’, which he said was contained in books being distributed ‘by the thousands’ in this country by certain Bible institutes, was coi oiniied by Dr. Albert C. Dieffeubach. . . The doctrine &lt;d the second coining of Christ as a spiritual hope is one thing, in which many good men believe,’ he said, ‘but the ITussian militarism of these teachers who delight to call Jesus ‘Kaiser Jesus’, slaying and destiojing the world, is another thing. A religious conviction is the most powerful thing in the world. This belief w ill lead people to act Let tins preaching of the second coming continue, and the doctune of ‘trampling the bodies of men will assuiedly lead the believers under powerful fanatics lo go foi th on a nuuderous career against men, women and childien. I call for the flaying of this monstrous iniquity which threatens even our colleges and gathers fienzy with its proof-texts.’”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is part of a propaganda against truth, and things resembling the truth, to create an evil impression against the believers in “fundamentalism”, which appeals to be separating the more sincere believers in the Bible from the tares. The papal-empire press readily takes up the sword against the truth about the early downfall of their system and publishes the foregoing item under such headlines as: “Christ Will Not Come in Anger, Editor Asserts,” “Bloody Outbreak of Fanaticism Feared, Boston Divine Warns Against Lurid Teachings,” and so on. No mention is made in the press dispatches whether Reverend Dieflenbach and other clergy now taking a stand against bloodshed, took an active part in the 1917-1919 campaign for all the bloodletting possible, and thus helped on the fulfillment of the veiy catastiophe they now profess to fear. The clergy as a class are under the contiol of big business. When the war-whip ciacks they pi each war; and when the time comes for unctuous platitudes, they favor peace. War on a huge scale is for a certain class the most profitable line of business possible, but it has resulted in a condition where the great financiers are experiencing the utmost difficulty in patching up a badly splintered world. Some of the “higher” clergy consciously obey and abet the financial interests, but the majority are doubtless deceived and blindly follow whatever propaganda may be current from Threadneedle or Wall Street. The financiers, however, in their war greed have loosed the dread powers of commotion that are destined to bring to an end the existing order of things, and that cannot be halted by the opposition of the clerical partners of big business. Jesus foretold the time of trouble due at the end of the world. Christians will not participate in such trouble, but will continue to point the people to the great Prince of Peace who will bring order out of chaos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">THE CHURCHES IN POLITICS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The polluting power of politics is only too well known by those at all acquainted with politicians. No person, however high the character to begin with, can enter politics without experiencing a progressive deterioration culminating in moral degeneracy more or less marked. Yet through a mistaken theory about the kingdom of God the church systems have all gone into politics. The Roman Catholic system is adept in the matter, and is openly or secretly m politics according to the temper of each particular com tiy The Piotestant daughters of Romish perverseness (Revelation 17 4-6) boldly proclaim their presence in the political world, little reckoning on the libei tv-loving cla^s that is determined that in America at least there shall be permitted no union direct or indirect of church and state</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At the hands of lovers of freedom the prophetic words are soon to be fulfilled upon all religious sWcms. Papal ai d Protestant alike, that have intruded upon the domain of the state: “A mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea |&quot;present-da\ turbulence], saying, Thus with violence shall that groat city, Babylon, be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all”. (Revelation 18:21) Nevertheless, in spite of warning voices, the Protestant churches in the United States are blatantly publishing the fact that they are in politics and propose to enter that field more and more. This is illustrated in an item in the Pittsburgh </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette Times:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Participation by adult Bible class members in political affairs, especially those having to do with tlie coming primaries in Pennsylvania, was urged by the three principal speakers at the afternoon session of tbe annual conference of the Adult Division of the Allegheny County Sabbath School Association in the Smithfield Street Methodist Episcopal Church.... All organized Bible classes were urged in resolutions to form a committee to see that members of the classes were properly qualified as voters, and to see that those so qualified go to the polls and vote.... The church and state were declared to have a common object, the well</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">being </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">et</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> the people, In an address by </span><span class="font9">Dr. Urmy. They may differ somewhat in motives and methods, but churchman-Mnp and cm/enship are allied forces in a great and common can<sup>1</sup>-!' Tlie cliuidiman must prove himself a good citizen, or deny his religious faith.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Editorials in church magazines have long since declared that the Anti-Saloon League is nothing more nor less than the Protestant churches in politics. Qualified observers have pronounced this League the most efficient political machine operating in the United States. That this organization is the political arm of these apostate systems is evident from the political activities of temperance men in chinch gatherings. Confirming this, Reverend Doctor Urmy said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The enforcement of the prohibition law is an outstanding issue in the coming election, both from the standpoint of the church and the state. Every Christian voter must see to it that the moral judgment, conscience, and faith of the church are registered definitely and with conviction both at the primaries and the general election.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Wily politicians are not slow to strike attitudes calculated to draw a constituency, and in a speech at the foregoing gathering Repiesentative John AV. Vickcrman, speaking on ‘The Crisis on Our Commonwealth’, emphasized something he perhaps did not intend to stress, namely, the existing union of church and state engineered by the Protestant churches:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The people of Pennsylvania who are members of organized Bible classes must get behind a program which is for the best of our state. I am glad that we have tlie women to help us in tills. We need an outraged public sentiment against violators of tlie Eighteenth Amendment. We need to demand of the motion picture industry a constructive progiam of proper amusement'’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Thus does icligion in politics meddle in things that Christ and the apostles would emphatically reject as none of the church’s business; for a union of church and state is unscriptural and unnatural, and is a perversion of the proper function of the church of God to keep itself unspotted from the world. (James 1:27) The daik-age union of Romanism with the governments resulted m a millennium of misery; and the well-intended religious regulations of the Pilgrim forefathers of America had their outcome in the brutal burning of “witches”at Salem, Massachusetts, during Colonial days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">However, there is great hope in the statement by H. \V. D. English at the meeting that “more than fifty-one percent of the population was indifferent or opposed to the church as shown in the church-membership census recently made”. It augurs well for religious and political liberty that this percentage is rising as the American people gain a growing understanding of the determined effort being put forth by both Papal and Protestant political machines to control the country and make the rest of the people bow to the will of fanatical religionists. The time has almost come for the religious politician to forever cease his operation of another dark age or another burning of witches under governmental authority.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark17"></a>SEVENTY YEARS’ DESOLATION (PART II)</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Them that had escaped from the sword carried he [Nebuchadnezzar] away to Babylon, where they wen servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia: to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths; for as long as she lay</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">desolate she kept sabbath to fulfill threescore and ten years.”—2 Chronicles 36: 20, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font10"> FEW of our readers have been somewhat confused in their understanding of present-truth chronology by the claim that it does not agree with ancient secular history. This carries the inference that the chronology cannot be correct unless it is in agreement with secular-pagan history and chronology, and that this agreement is desirable and indispensable. We present some considerations from which the reader may judge whether it is desirable to attempt to rely upon prehistoric pagan records derived from gentile “history'’ and from the inscriptions on Assyrian monuments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">EARLY PAGAN “HISTORY” UNRELIABLE</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A change was made some two hundred years ago from the ancient and true belief in seventy years’ </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">desolation </span><span class="font10">of the land to seventy years’ </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">captivity.</span><span class="font10"> This was done by ecclesiastics to make the Bible record agree with pagan records, and was in thorough harmony with the spirit of compromise that has possessed ecclesiasticism since the time (325 A. D.) when Constantine, under demon influence, transformed the independent true church of God into a servile religious department of the pagan government—which it is today. It is nothing to be surprised at that a churchianity composed largely of pagans and demon worshipers, should prefer pagan and demon influenced records to the straightforwaid and truthful records of the Word of God and of Jewish history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The pagan historical records, especially of date as early as the seventy years’ desolation, are extremely obscuie, contradictory, and unreliable, so much so as to fall outside the domain of history into the realm of surmise, guesswork, hearsay, and conjecture. It is upon such a secular prehistoric basis that the error rests that the seventv years began nineteen years earlier than they actually did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We wall illustrate the unreliability of early pagan records concerning affairs prior to Cyrus, 536 B. C. Milman in his “History of the Jews” (Volume 1, page 460) speaks of “the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">intricate and inextricable labyrinth </span><span class="font10">of Assyrian history and chronology”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The uncertainty of those early pagan records cannot be shown better than by giving the facts about the sources of information. The entire so-called pagan “history” of antiquity is a mass of guesses, and furnishes no sound basil for so important a step as discrediting the divinely-made prophecy and the divinely-recorded fulfillment of the seventy years’ </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">desolation.</span><span class="font10"> Tl i three ancient pagan “historians” from whom data aie taken are the Greek writers Herodotus (450 B. C.) and Ptolemy (150 A. D.) and the Chaldean writer Berosus (260 B. C.). Concerning Herodotus as a “historian” the facts are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the article on “Medes” “Smith’s Bible Dictionary” says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“That the chronological elates [of Herodotus] are </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">improbable,</span><span class="font9"> and oven </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">contradictory,</span><span class="font9"> has been a frequent subject of complaint. . . . Recently it has been shown that the whole [Herodotus] scheme of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">dales</span><span class="font9"> is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">aitiflcial,</span><span class="font9"> and that the very names of the kings, except in a single instance, are unhistorical. . . . The Median kingdom did not commence so early as Herodotus </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">imagined. . . .</span><span class="font9"> The Deioces and Phraortes of Herodotus are removed from the list of historical personages altogether.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Dr. Francis Brown, D. D., of Union Theological Seminary, comments thus on the relative accuracy of the unconscientious Greek “historians” and the writers of the Bible:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The Greeks told fairy-tales that entertained their readers, but were largely </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">untrue</span><span class="font9"> The Hebiews, with their nearer position, and more frequent memorable contact, had also a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">conscientiousness</span><span class="font9"> and skill in annalistic writing which made their evidence in regaid to the history of their neighbors important and trustworthy.”—&quot;Assyriology: Its Use and Abuse,” p. 50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">GUESSES OF “AUTHORITIES”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When almost any bit of “history” of the prehistoric pagan events of the seventy years is traced to its origin it is found to be a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">guess or conjecture,</span><span class="font10"> based by “authorities” (well-paid guessers) upon some scraps of uncertain tradition. The ecclesiastically-received history of Babylon of this period originated in a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">guess</span><span class="font10"> by an “authority”. This appears in the article on “Belshazzar” in McClintock &amp;&nbsp;Strong’s “Biblical Cyclopedia,” and shows the uncertain and conflicting tales on which was based originally the now discredited notion of seventy years “captivity” beginning in 625 B. C. First in the article are given the differing and contradictory accounts of Babylon’s fall as recorded in the Bible, in Xenophon, a Greek writer (400 B. C.), in Berosus, a native '‘historian”, and in Herodotus; then “it appears” so and so from the Assyrian monuments; and finally a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">conjecture </span><span class="font10">is made by a modern “scholar” (guesser), which is the basis of the present utterances of “authorities” (highest-salaried guessers) on the pagan history of the seventyyear period. There are, indeed, other quite different ancient records, but these are resolutely ruled out or ignored by the “authorities”—as liable to let the common people into the fact that the matter is largely a guess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The history of Babylon, as published by the “authorities,” includes a certain definite list of kings, but other</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&quot;authorities” guess that there </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">may</span><span class="font10"> have been other kings who failed to get into the history or into the inscriptions </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font10">the monuments. How the “authorities” differ is illustrated in the article on “Belshazzar” in McClintock &amp;&nbsp;Strong’s “Biblical Encyclopedia”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“A </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">totally different view</span><span class="font9"> is taken by Marcus Niebuhr, who </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">considers</span><span class="font9"> [guesses] Belshazzar to be another name for Evll-merodach, the son of Nebuchadnezzar. ... He </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">considers </span><span class="font9">[guesses] that the capture of Babylon described in Daniel was not by the Persians, but by the Medes, under Astyages (l.e. Darius the Mede), and that between the reigns of Evll-merodach, or Belshazzar, and Neriglassar, we must insert a brief period during which Babylon was subject to the Medes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Thus the “authorities” disagree in their </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">conjectures </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font10">even the number and list of these prehistoric kings of Babylon. Not even the names of the Babylonian kings are certain, as appears in another extract from the same article:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Belshazzar (Hebrew and Chaldean Belshatstsar) is the name given in the Book of Daniel to the last king of the Chaldeans. . . . Herodotus calls this king, and also his tether, Labynetus, which is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">undoubtedly</span><span class="font9"> a corruption of Nabonnedus, the name by which he was known to Berosus in Josephus’ ‘Contra Apion I. 20 ’ Yet in Josephus (‘Antiquities’ X, 11: 2) Ibis stated that Baltasar was called Naboandel by the Babylonians. Nabonadius in the Canon of Ptolemy, Nabo-nedus in Eusebius, and Nabonnidochus in Eusebius are evidently other varieties of his name.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Ptolemy, ancient Greek “historian”, made up a list called “Ptolemy’s Canon” like a chronological table, which has been much used. This list, however, is unreliable in the dates of all events except those marked by an eclipse or other astronomical phenomenon which can be checked as to date by astronomical calculation. It was not compiled for 600 years after 485 B. C., and is highly inaccurate. For example, it says that Xerxes reigned twenty-one years. He actually reigned eleven years. It makes the date of Artaxerxes’ reign nine years too late—465 B. C., when it was 474 B. C.—the pagan record thus supplying an inaccurate date from which to calculate the “seventy weeks” of the Jews. Comparing Daniel 9: 24, 25 and Nehemiah 2:1, it is seen that the twentieth year of Artaxerxes was 454 B. C. His first year was 474 B. C. It is upon Ptolemy’s Canon, and not upon the Bible, that the prevalent chronology of the seventy years is based. The “authorities” here attempt the impossible of transmuting guesses into certainties—and any Bible student is unwise to follow their leadership instead of that of the inspired Bible writers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SUPPOSITIONS, THEORIES, CONJECTURES</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The obscurity of pagan records and “histories” of those ancient times prior to 536 B. C., and their unreliability as a basis for belief, appear also in the following brief excerpts from articles in “Smith’s Bible Dic</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">tionary”.

<p><span class="font9">“It is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">perhaps</span><span class="font9"> most </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">probable</span><span class="font9"> that the Assyrian organization was continued by the Medes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“This </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">seems</span><span class="font9"> certainly to have been the case in Persia.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The conquest of the Medes by . . . the Persians ... is another of those </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">indisputable facts</span><span class="font9"> [What is a disputable fact?] of remote history, which make the inquirer feel that he sometimes attained to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">solid ground.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“According to some writers [Herodotus] there was a close relationship between Cyrus and the last Median monarch.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“According to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Herodotus,</span><span class="font9"> the Median nation was diiided into six tribes, called Buste, Paretaceni, Struchates, Ari-zanti.

<p><span class="font10">From the article on “Persians”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“There Is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">reason to believe</span><span class="font9"> that the Persians were of the same race as the Medes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The religion . . . </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">seems</span><span class="font9"> to have been of a very simple character.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Neither do they </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">appear</span><span class="font9"> to have had any priests.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“They were </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">probably</span><span class="font9"> brought into contact with a form of religion very different from their own.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Herodotus</span><span class="font9"> tells us that the Persians were divided into ten tribes, of which three were noble, three agricultural, and four nomadic.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“In remote antiquity </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">it would appear</span><span class="font9"> that the Persians dwelt in the region east of the Caspian or </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">possibly</span><span class="font9"> in a tract still nearer India.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The first Fargard of the Vendidad </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">seems</span><span class="font9"> to describe their wanderings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“It is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">impossible to determine the period</span><span class="font9"> of these movements ; but there </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">can be no doubt</span><span class="font9"> that they were anterior to B. C. 880, at which time the Assyrian kings </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">seem</span><span class="font9"> to have come in contact with Aryan tribes east of Mount Zagros.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“It is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">uncertain</span><span class="font9"> whether they are to be identified with the Bartsu or Partsu of the Assyrian monuments.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“If so,</span><span class="font9"> we </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">may</span><span class="font9"> say that from the middle of the ninth to the middle of the eighth century B.

<p><span class="font9">“The leader of' this last migration would </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">seem</span><span class="font9"> to have been a certain Achferneries.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Very little is known</span><span class="font9"> of the history of Persia between this date (B. C. 700) and the revolt and accession of Cyrus the Great nearly a century and a half later.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Of the circumstances under which this revolt took place we have </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">no certain</span><span class="font9"> knowledge.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">BOASTFUL, LYING INSCRIPTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Considerable reliance is placed by modern higher-</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">critic </span><span class="font10">“authorities” on the inscriptions on pagan monuments and on Assyrian clay tablets to help them correct the inspired Word of God!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The inscriptions were made by men, and are no more reliable than the men themselves. The degree of trustworthiness of even the modern oriental aristocrats and monarchs is generally estimated at a low figure. Who, for instance, would take the unsupported word of an oriental sultan on anything today, or of an occidental diplomat? The ancient sultans were even less trustworthy; their word could not be depended upon. A statement was a means to an end; a lie was as good as </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">truth, if it accomplished the desired purpose. Pagan monarchs were universally the tools of demons and, almost universally, children of their mental- and characterfather the devil, the inventor and perpetuator of lies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Assyrian inscriptions were made by demon-controlled devil-worshipers, and are just as trustworthy as might be expected under the circumstances; for in unreliability they closely resemble the ancient pagan “histories” v ritten by men of like character with the rulers. Occasionally these “histories” tell the truth, but generally speaking they relate a mass of fairy tales; and the monuments are first cousins to the histories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Most of the inscriptions considered of historical value by the “authorities” (guessers) are the boastful statements of pagan kings—worshipers of the heathen gods Bel, Nabu, Marduk, etc. Cyrus was used by Jehovah to help the Je\\«, and may have been better than some, but the following extract from a monumental inscription serves to contrast this best of the boastful pagan rulers with David, the best of Hebrew kings:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“I am Cyrus, king of the world, the great king, the mighty king, king of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad, king of the four quarters of the world, son of Cambyses, the great king, king of Anshan, grandson of Cyrus, the great king, king of Anshan, great-gi andson of Teispes, the great king, king of Anshan ; and everlasting seed of royalty, whose government Bel and Nabu love, whose reign in the goodness of their hearts they desire. When I entered in peace into Babylon, with joy and rejoicing I took up my lordly dwelling in the royal palace Marduk, the great lord [through the priests] moved the understanding heart of the people of Babylon to me, while I daily sought his worship. ... To Ashur and Susa, Aeade, Eshmunak, Zamban, Meturnu, Deri, to the border of Gutmin, the cities beyond the Tigris, whose sites had been founded of old—the gods who dwelt in them I returned to their palaces, and caused them to settle in their eternal shrines. . . . And the gods of Sumer and Akkad, whom Nabonnid, to the anger of the lord of the gods, had brought into Babylon, at the command of [the priests, who wanted a monopoly] Marduk, the great lord, I caused in peace to dwell in their abodes, the dwellings In which their hearts delighted. May all the gods, whom I have returned to their cities, pray before Marduk and Nabu for the prolonging of my days, may speak a kind word for me and say to Marduk, lord of the gods, ‘May Cyrus the king,’ ” etc. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">~-Bai ton’s</span><span class="font9"> “ Archaeology and the Bible”, pp. 385,386.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The superstitious </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Cyrus evidently wished to propitiate all the gods within sight, and his desire to please also </span><span class="font10">Jehovah the God of the Hebrews .may‘have occasioned his unexpected leniency to the chosen people. But the contrast is sharp between the foregoing and the reverential meekness of the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to He down In green pastures; he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restore th my soul; he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou prepares! a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; thou anolntest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.”—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">David in the Twenty-Third Psalm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This brings out in the sharpest possible contrast the difference between pagan demon-worshipers and the servant of Jehovah. Which is the more trustworthy—Cyrus or David? It is to the records of the former that the advocates of the new and improved chronology appeal. We continue to rely upon the inspired Word of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">RECORDS FALSIFIED BY KINGS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The pagan kings did not hesitate to falsify the monumental inscriptions. They left out whatever did not suit them, and altered the record of facts when that pleased their arrogant boastfulness. Two kings reigned together, but the inscriptions are written as though the reigns were successive. Some of the inscriptions make boasting claims as to the lengths of reigns—thousands of years to a reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">An inscription exists in which in boastful language Sennacherib describes his disastrous campaign against Hezekiah (2 Kings 18:19; Isaiah 36,37), but he says not </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">word about the miraculous obliteration of his army by th® destroying angel. “Assyrian kings,” says Dr. Brown, “never record their failures; but Sennacherib’s admission that he did not take the city was held to be confirmation of 2 Kings 19: 35-37, which describes a great destruction of the Assyrian army and a signal deliverance of Jerusalem”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The entire reigns of kings are omitted in the inscriptions at the option of succeeding monarchs. After the fall of Babylon in 538 B. C. the city was ruled by the “Darius the Mede” mentioned by Daniel. (Daniel 6: </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">9, </span><span class="font10">11) Darius is considered to be Cyaraxes II, a king </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">the Medes, who reigned at Babylon for two years until succeeded by the boastful Cyrus, but the inscriptions are silent regarding his brief reign. His reign was the fulfillment of Daniel’s vision of the Medo-Persian empire to the effect that the Medes would reign first and after them the more powerful Persians. (Daniel 7: 5; 8: 3, 4) Those that rely on the monuments for the facts will never know anything about “Darius the Mede” or his two-year reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Take the new Cyrus inscription,” says Dr. Francis Brown, himself an interpreter of the Inscriptions. “I mention only one of the points of difficulty which arise when these inscriptions are compared with the statements In the Book of Daniel. They sem to leave no place for &quot;Darius the Median.* . . . The Darius who from Daniel 5:31; 6:1-28; etc., would appear to have followed the last Babylonian king, and preceded Cyrus, seems not to exist, according to the Inscriptions.”—“Assyriology; Its Use and Abuse,” pp. 37,38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The fact is that Cyrus the braggart simply left Darius out of his inscriptions; but Dr. Brown takes the prehistoric pagan record seriously and continues in a way calculated to throw </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">a little doubt</span><span class="font10"> upon the Bible:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">‘‘Now here is a historical problem of the first order. It needs no amplification. The issue is clear. I do not know what adequate solution can be offered for the difficulty. Theie is some solution, under which the Bible will suffer no damage, I am sure, but </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">who can tell us what it isf”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A footnote throws </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">a little more doubt</span><span class="font10"> upon the Bible by suggesting that the whole book of Daniel is a legend: </span><span class="font9">&quot;A current answer [by a clergyman, of course] affirms the legendary chaiacter of the book of Daniel. But this is not enough The origin of the legend is still to be explained.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Extracts like these display the fact that &quot;authorities”, who have invested much in their training to read difficult inscriptions and whose salaries depend on great reputations, prefer to regard the monumental inscriptions as more reliable than the Bible. Such are some of the “defenders of the faith” in the modern theological seminaries, and it is under their leadership that are unwittingly enrolled those that doubt’ the Scripturally and historically well-proved chronology of present truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">UNTRUSTWORTHINESS OF ARCHAEOLOGISTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Dr. Brown, however, is more cautious than some of the more ardent Assyriologmts. In an address to young theological students he, though a teacher of Assyriology, warns the students against the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">misuse of archaeology. </span><span class="font10">We quote snatches of his address:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Scientific, advance is through guesses, more.or less rash. . . . Assyriology has its guesses. . . . Great and infectious enthusiasm, but a sad lack of cool judgment and scholarly patience. . . . Overhaste in its employment. . . . The As-syriologists themselves have been guilty of many sins of excessive haste.- . . . The Biblical scholar has not only, to his own undoing, taken the hasty conclusions of the specialists, and worked them into his expositions, but he has himself drawn hasty conclusions from them. . . . There has been in some quarters an unseemly voracity; everything has been swallowed ; the simplest rules of critical inquiry have been forgotten. There has been blind trusting to authority, without weighing it, and an assumption of fact upon the mere say so of some presumably honest scholar . . . There Is a wide difference between expecting a discovery and making one . . . The Assynologists, it must be admitted, huse rather a slender basis for their date. . . . The blameworthy thing is that there has been no adequate care to guard against mistakes. . . A constant and enforced shifting of ground. . . . Conclusions must not be jumped at. . . . He must not treat the hypothesis as an established fact, and build a dogmatic exposition upon it. . . . They ought to demand that fact be sharply distinguished from guess; that definite and intelligible leusons be assigned for opinions. ... A complete list would give us a secure chronological basis for Assyrian history. In fact, we li.ive no one complete list, but six or seven partial lists overlapping each other. ... A respectable number of chronologists have assumed a break of forty-six years. . . . The vice of this method of handling the inscriptions lies here: that it involves a playing fast-and-loose with well-attested historical documents ; hailing them eagerly when they say at once what you want them to say, but discrediting them with all your might when their utterances are troublesome to you. . . . unwilling to wait. . . not courageous enough to be candid,” etc.—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Brown’s</span><span class="font9"> “Assyriology: Its Use and Abuse”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The foregoing are some of the varieties of unreliability in the presentation by “authorities” of the monumental records of antiquity. They could not be much worse. The Bible student following them is in a maze. He cannot tell what is true and what false in the inscriptions themselves, nor can he tell whether the “authorities” are dealing honestly and conscientiously with him in their presentation of what in their opinion they </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">guess</span><span class="font10"> at or carelessly or willfully misrepresent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">DOUBTS, AND MORE DOUBTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">An ancient king once built a great labyrinth of intricate passages, and tradition has it that when he wished to get rid of someone he would have him turned loose in some remote corner of the labyrinth. So confusing were the passages that practically everyone starved to death without finding the way out. Prehistoric pagan chronology and “history” are a mental labyrinth in which the believers of any other than present-truth chronology find themselves. Every step of study brings new problems which take long study for solution, if thej' can be solved at all, and the unfortunate student finds himself “ever learning [something], and never able to come to a knowledge of the truth”.—2 Timothy 3: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As Dr. Brown says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Assyriology is not a mere key to unlock doois. It olt’eis a i.ist and complicated series of facts. It tbiows clear light on some things, and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">paitial light</span><span class="font9"> on others, and repeals </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">dun outlines</span><span class="font9"> of yet others. If we put ourselves in that light, we must be </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">willing to see all it shows us.</span><span class="font9"> Assjuology is not simply an interpreter that stands outside and explains our Bibles to us. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">It makes its way into our Bibles,</span><span class="font9"> and even while it smooths over some of the.old difficulties, it sometimes </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">unearths new. ones no less troublesome.</span><span class="font9"> It is the imperative duty of those who study—most of all those who teach, or expect to teach—the Bible, to recognize these new problems </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">in all their gravity and far-reaching import. . . . </span><span class="font9">We ought to be looking forward to a time, and preparing for it, when the average membership of our churches shall have a faith so full of living nerves and muscles that it will hold itself upright </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">beneath even such searching inquiries [doubts] as these. . . .</span><span class="font9"> Whosoever undertakes to make use of Assyriology in behalf of the Old Testament </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">cannot shun them</span><span class="font9"> [the doubts thus created].”—“Assyriology: Its Use and Abuse,” pp. 29, 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This ideal of a church is a congregation of university graduates all learned and wise (1 Corinthians 1: 26-29), trained m archaeology and able to overcome the doubts raised weekly by their pastor and, for salvation from unbelief, trusting in the mental prowess of the infidel wolf in the pulpit before them. Bible students should not begin studying matter based on pagan records, without seeing how far their course will lead them and being willing to go all the distance into unbelief and to pay all the price the crown of glory for the faithful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But why should faithful believers, who have much </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">service yet to render to their Master, worse than waste </span><span class="font10">their time on “science [knowledge] falsely so called” (1 Timothy 6: 20), when God has provided </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">a chronological bridge,</span><span class="font10"> over the indecipherable pagan chronology of the prehistoric period in question, in the shape of prophecy and fulfillment of “seventy years’ desolation”? It is another divinely-furnished bridge like that over the period of the Judges. (Acts 13:19-21) It would be </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">foolish waste of time to attempt to work out the detailed chronology of the Judges; and it is equally wasteful to cast aside the di\ inely-given bridge over the seventy-year period of desolation and to try to establish connected, detailed facts from pagan sources; for that, in fact, is what is implied by reliance upon the currently accepted notions about the chronology of Babylonia copied in all encyclopedias and reference works from the same unreliable source.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">FURTHER PROOF OF PRESENT-TRUTH CHRONOLOGY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is a well known law of mathematics called “the law of probabilities”. Applications of this law are frequent in exeryday life in settling matters of doubt. In a fainih of children, if a certain kind of mischief is committed, the probabilities— indeed, the certainty— are that it was done by a certain one, and that the others assuredly did not do it. If some peculiar damage is done by night to a single house, then by the law of probabilities it may have been a pure accident; if done to two houses in the same manner it probably was not accidental but by design of some person; but if done to three or more houses in the same manner it passes out of the possibility of accident into the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">certainty</span><span class="font10"> of design.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The chronology of present truth might be a mere happening if it were not for the repetitions in the two great cycles of 1845 and 2520 years, which take it out of the realm of chance and into that of certainty. If there were only one or two corresponding dates in these cycles, they might possibly be mere coincidences, but where the agreements of dates and events come by the dozens, they cannot possibly be by chance, but must be by the design or plan of the only personal Being capable of such a plan—Jehovah himself; </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">and the chronology itself must he right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the passages of the Great Pyramid of Gizeh the agreement of one or two measurements with the presenttruth chronology might be accidental, but the correspondency of dozens of measurements proves that the same God designed both pyramid and plan—and at the same time proves the correctness of the chronology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The agreement of the chronology with certain measurements of the Tabernacle and the Temple of Ezekiel further stamps the chronology as true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is on the basis of such and so many correspondencies—in accordance with the soundest laws known to science—that we affirm that, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Scripturally, scientifically, and historically, present-truth chronology is correct beyond a doubt.</span><span class="font10"> Its reliability has been abundantly confirmed by the dates and events of 1874, 1914, and 1918. Present-truth chronology is </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">secure </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">basis on which the </span><span class="font10">consecrated child of God may endeavor to search out things to come.—1 Peter 1: 11,12; John 16- 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is not necessary to show how if a change of 19 xears were made in the chronology the time from Jacob to Jesus would become shortened from 1845 to 1826 years, and the entire system of dates based on the “Jewish parallels” would collapse; how the jubilee system elates would fall out of place from its present symmetry; how the 2520-year parallels would disappear; how the entire system of dates would be scattered; how there could be no foundation for faith in the resulting chronological jumble; and how there could be no sound reason for believing in the presence of the Lord, the place and work of Pastor Russell, the end of the age, the harvest work, or in any of the literature published by the Society. Many years ago all these matters were deeply considered by Pastor Russell, and he declared, m an article which we will soon republish, that a change of one year would destroy the entire system of chronology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">PRESENT-TRUTH CHRONOLOGY IS CORRECT</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We haxe fhown that the present-truth chronology is correct and others are incorrect because:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">(1) It is based squarely on inspired prophecy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">(2) The fulfillment is recorded in the Bible and in the history of God’s chosen people, the Jews.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">(3) The seventy years are all years of desolation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">(4) There was no captivity and no vassalage of Judah in 625 B. C. from which to count the seventy years captivity ot servitude.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">(5) Pagan “history” on the subject is unreliable.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">(C) The opinions of “authorities” on this pagan “history” are guesses and conjectures.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">(7) The monumental inscriptions are untrustworthy because of the untruthfulness and unreliability of the demon-worshiping and demon-controlled pagan monarchs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">(8) The inscriptions omit some important facts and falsify others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">(9) The archeologists are not conscientious ot honest in presenting the inscriptions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">(10) Reliance upon pagan history or archeology leads through worse doubts and ever more of them, into infidelity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">(11) Present-truth chronology is correct beyond the possibility of a doubt.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Present-truth chronology is based upon divine prophecy and its Biblical fulfillment, that the seventy years were years of desolation, not part desolation and part captivity. The chronology stands firm as a rock, based upon the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is a matter of faith in Jehovah and in his inspired Word. (2 Timothy 3:16) Those that lack faith in God’s Word and cast about for needless help from admittedly lying pagan records, will doubtless receive according to their lack of faith. Those that stick closely to the Word will receive according to their faith.</span></p>

The friends will have exclusive use ol the grounds and buildings for the entire period of the convention, and will gather apart as one great family of the Lord’s people for the rest and refreshment peculiar to these great conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">'there ncvei had been such an assembly of the consecrated as that in 1919 at Cedar Point, when seven thorn and came Irom all parts of the country and from Canada and foreign countries. By every method of transportation the consecrated quietly stole from their daily tasks, and for </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">week enjoyed a blessed fellowship that stands out in the memory of all’as a time when the Lord was very close to his assembled dear ones. All felt the influence of the spirit as they listened to words of encouragement, instruction and inspiration, and as they walked and talked about the things of God, or quietly enjoyed the beauties of surroundings that bespoke the goodness of God and the sublimity of his arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is a special reason whv many desire to be present at this particular gathering Never before has the world been so threatened by impending perils at home and abroad—the perilous times have come. Great and earnest efforts have been made by earth’s leaders to bring order out of the chaos created by the World War and the ensuing revolution and unrest. Publicly and privately the great are assembling to devise plans for the quieting of the disorder and the allaying of the worse things that begin to appear in every direction. But the League, the Disarmament Conference, the association oi the nations, and the economic conference at Genoa have only displayed the impossibility of humanitv settling its own troubles. The situation grows more difficult continually until it seems certain that the next few years must behold a crash mightier and more disastrous to the present order of things than anything yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The policy of the Society had been guided in the direction of holding general conventions only once every three or four years, and local conventions in many places at frequent intervals between. It costs more to come to a general convention than to a local one, and it has not been thought wise to unduly burden the Lord’s people with the expense of too frequent large gatherings. Railroad, boat and electric transportation rates are still very high, the cost of living stands at a high percentage above pre-war figures, and wages are low and work often unsteady, though better things are in prospect for a little while at least. But so beneficial are the general conventions that it was decided not to postpone one beyond this year, and to give ample time for preparation for even the most distant friends in this and foreign countries. In the meantime the friends are asked to put off local conventions until after the 1922 general convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The state of the world is such that a catastrophe may take place at any time in the not distant future. If the collaji.se that threatens is not promptly averted, it is quite liable to conic within the next three years; and if this should happen, it is not difficult to see that so disturbed might a flairs become that it would not be feasible to hold another general convention. The gathering at Cedar Point m September will be pervaded by the blessed thought of the imminence of the deliverance of the church out iiom all touch with the kingdom of darkness and into the heavenly phase of the kingdom of God, and indeed into the actual and very presence of our Lord and our God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The little disadvantages of the last general convention hav e been carefully gone over with a view to their elimination this time. Ariangcmcnts for the securing of rooms and food wnll be much better than m 1919. It is planned that the long wait for assignment to rooms will be entirely avoided, and that persons complying with the system to be followed will be advised m advance concerning the exact rooms they are to occupy and will be able, by a card, or other directions, to proceed directly to the proper room immediately on arrival. This will be highly appreciated by all that saw or experienced the trial of the prolonged wait of some in 1919 while they were being assigned rooms in the' customary manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The delay and inconvenience imposed on the returning friends m connection with the railroad' certificate plan will also be avoided. Each person proposing to attend will be required, if he is to enjoy reduced fare, to make due request in ample time beforehand for an identification certificate, which will be issued by the Society to all applicants. The mere presentation of this certificate at the local ticket office, where the trip is begun, will entitle the person to a round trip ticket at a reduced rate, probably a trip and a half. It is requested that all use the certificate plan no matter how near they may live to Cellar Point, m order that the number of tickets required to entitle all the friends to the special rate may be fully reached and much exceeded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Rates for reom and board will be uniformly two dollars a day. Congestion at meals will be avoided by a plan such as assigning each person a certain seat at </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">ceitain time in the dining rooms. Observance of some such simple arrangement will make unnecessary any crow ding or prolonged standing in line while waiting for a chance to get to a meal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In every way that can be devised in advance, it is hoped to make the 1922 general convention, in a physical sense, the best one ever held. As a period of spiritual rest and the building up of the new creature, too, it is hoped that it may be a memorable occasion in the minds of the thousands of friends that will be present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Lord, with joy we greet the day That announced the narrow way;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Day which marked thy coming birth—</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Day which brought thee dow n to earth . . And proclaimed the coming King, Praises unto whom we sing!</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">IDENTITY OF BELSHAZZAR--GREATNESS OF THE CITY OF BABYLON--VANITY AND SACRILEGE — SERVICE WITHOUT STIPULATION —■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A REMARKABLE CORROBORATION.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;God </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">will bring every work into judgment, with every hidden thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.”—Ecclesiastes 12: H.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">F</span><span class="font9">ROM time to time the higher critics, who according to their own estimates of themselves are wiser than the Scriptures, meet wilh a rebuke at the hand of the Lord, as lie causes some apparent inconsistency between the Bible record and the records ot secular historians to be cleared up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">IDENTITY OF BELSHAZZAR</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Such an item has arisen inspecting. King Belshazzar, the Chief hgure in the events of oui lesson. For years the higher critics claimed that there was no such man ; that the uionu-ments showed that the last king of Babylon was Nabonidus, whom the Bible does-not mention ; and that this wa's evidence that Daniel was mistaken. Now they have stopped saying anything, about this item because an inscription has. been brought to light wln&lt; li shows tlmtiKing N.ibonidus did hare a son by the name of Belshazzar;- and while this particular inscription does not specifically state that Belshazzar was king ot the city and the province- ot Babylon, under his father Nabonidus, who was king over the whole Babylonian realm, yet the inference-is fully justified, because the inscup-tion al hand does show that Belshazzar was a man of great wealth, a money-lender and landlord on a large scale, a wholesale dealer in wool. These activities are such as might be expected m connection with a ruler of the peiiod, or, indeed, of any period where big business was allied with big politics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">THE CITY OF BABYLON</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Babylon, at tins time, from all descriptions must have been by tar the most wonderful city ot the world up to that time, and in some particulars has had no rival since. It was a very wealthy, luxurious city, not only enriched by the plunder of the palaces and temples of the nations conquered round about, but further enriched by the tributes paid by those nations year by year and by its mercantile traffic with all the nations of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It was not only the largest city in the world but had the strongest fortress. The great plain on which it lay, a paradise of fertility and cultivation, was intersected by countless canals, both small and great, serving alike for irrigation and navigation. Babylon, built on this fertile plain, was said to be fourteen miles from north to south and fourteen miles fioni east to west, and the walls surrounding it 350 feet high. It had one hundred gates. The river Euphrates flowed through it, and was banked high on each side tlie stream with solid massive walls and intersected with water gates made of bronze. The historian says: “Babylon was the stiongest fortress in the world. Even a small force of brave men could, have held it foi years” It would be the natural effect of having such riches and strength under liis control to make King Belshazzar proud and self-confident.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At the time of our lesson the army of the Medes and Persians under the command of King Cyrus was besieging Babylon. This was the Cyrus who the Lord through one of his prophets declared should set free his people, the Hebrews. To all human appearance his besieging of the city of Babylon would be a hopeless task, a failure, so strong was that fortress. Yet the Lord had timed tlie fall of Nebuchadnezzars empire, and no doubt providentially guided to the accomplishment of the matter at the tune Intended. While Belshazzar and the people of Babylon were holding high revel, banquets, etc., convinced of the security tlie impregnability' of their city, Cyrus and his army were building a trench above the eirv into which in due time tlie waters of the Euphinles liver vvcie turned, and then, in the darkness of the night, the soldiers were inarched through the bed of the iivi-r and gained an entrance to the city while its unsuspecting delenders were banqueting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">VANITY AND SACRILEGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On this same night the king gave a banquet m his chief palace to a thousand of Ins nobles and louis and ladies of the empiie residing in the city The enemy was little thought of. On the contrary, Belshazzar boasted ot the impregnability of the toilless and’ de&lt; la-ied that the gods of the Babylonians were supenor to all others He pointed to the snbiect nations suriounding as evidences of tins, and in dension called for the holy vessels that had been brought by his grandlather Nebuchadnezzar from the Jewish Temple, that he and Jus lords might drink from these to do honor to the gods of Babylon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It was in the midst of tins blasphemy and profanation of the holy vessels of Jehovah's Temple that a hand appeared and wrote m letters of fire upon the wall of the palace the words, J/</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">cue, Meric, Tckel, Uphaism.</span><span class="font9"> The king, his counsellors, Ins nobles, the aristocracy of the world, were astounded and miinlied. The apparition convinced them at once that some due calamity impended. It was recognized as being of supei human oiigm. The wise men, the astrologers, etc., weie sent lor to give an explanation and interpretation. They came, but failed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The king's mother remembered Daniel and his relationship with Nebuchadnezzar. She had probably heard of the wonderful interpietation of Nebuchadnezzar’s vision by Daniel when all others had failed. The Prophet was evidently well known, and not far oft, probably still engaged in some department of the government service and near the palace. He soon appealed, and liis courage on tins.occasion is worthy of remark. He had a most painful duty to perform toward his superiors; for the king, as an autocrat, had the power of Daniel’s life at his tongue’s end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The king had offered both wealth and honor to tlie wise man able to give the meaning of the remarkable writing, but the Lord’s prophet showed that he was not mercenary and that his interpretation was not influenced by any such considerations. His answer was: “Let thy gifts be to tliy-self and give, thy rewards to another; nevertheless I will read the writing unto the king and make known to him the interpretation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">SERVICE WITHOUT STIPULATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We may stop here long enough to learn a valuable lesson, to the effect that all who would be the mouthpieces of the Lord, and speak forth liis Word, should, like Daniel, do so without stipulation of compensation. Only from this standpoint can any hope to be entirely free and untrammeled in speaking words of truth and soberness which may be very distasteful to those who inquire the mind of the Lord. Had Daniel thanked the king for the promised gifts, and thus accepted them as a reward for his service, he would have felt obligated to the king to such an extent that it might have waiped his judgment, or have weakened his expression 189</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">of the Lord’s message. And the king In turn would have felt that, having paid for the information, it should be a smooth, favorable message. And so it is with some of the Lord’s servants in mystic Babylon. They have the oppoilunity presented to speak the Lord’s Word; yet many of them are handicapped by reason of having received honors and robes, and are more or less inclined to hide and cover the message now due to Babylon in this its Laodicean epoch. They are bound by the chain of gold around their necks.—Revelation 8:14-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The aged Prophet displayed gentleness as well as fearlessness in the delivery of his message. It was stated as kindly as the truth would permit, but the truth was not withheld by reason of fear He recounted to the king his father’s exaltation to power, and ascribed it not to the god of Babylon, but to the God of Israel. He reminded him of how pride had been his father’s downfall, resulting in his degradation to bestial conditions for seven times (seven years in this instance but apparently calling attention to the seven times, or 2520 years, of gentile dominion). He reminded Belshazzar of how in the end his father, Nebuchadnezzar,had acknowledged the God of heaven as the real ruler amongst men, and then he charged home to the king that instead of profiting by this expeiience, of which he well knew, he had lifted up his heart in pride, had ignored the only true God, and had even brought what he knew were the sacred vessels of Jehovah’s service, to profane them in the worship and aloritication of idols—“gods of silver, gold, brass, iron, wood and stone, which see not nor hear nor know.” He pointed out to the king that he had thus dishonored and dolled “the God in whose hand [power] thy breath is [the God of all life—Acts 17:28,29], and whose are all thy wavs [who has full power to control your course].” This true God he had not glorified, but dishonored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">By thus kindly but plainly showing the king the truth, the Prophet prepared the way for the exposition of the fateful words—“Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A REMARKABLE CORROBORATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Students of the Hebrew declare that their records and traditions show that what was written (in Aramaic characters) was from the top down and from right to left (Hebrew custom), and that only the consonants were given, as is also Hebrew custom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The king was helpless to interpret this; but Daniel, understanding Aramaic, recognized at once the components of the words Mina - Mina - Shekel - Half-mina, a reference to Hebrew coins, which we will explain shortly. To Daniel these consonants also stood for the words “Mene,” signifying “numbered,” “Tekel” meaning “weighed,” and “Peris” meaning “divided.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Daniel was expecting the overthrow of the Babylon empire by the Medes and Persians; for 75 years before he had interpreted Nebuchadnezzar’s dream as recorded in the second chapter. That was in the twelfth year of Nebuchadnezzar, 613 B. C. and this was in 538 B. C. two years before the first year of Cyrus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Without doubt also Daniel was divinely guided to understand these characters and without doubt the Lord has just-, now brought to light their numerical values. See the letter entitled “A Remarkable Confirmation” contained in our issue of January 1, 1919. We quote from the 1&lt; iter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin, are Chaldaic terms taken from the Babylonian table of weights, and being translated from the ancient cuneiform in which they were written, would read: A mina, a mina, a shekel, a half mina. The table of weights is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">20 gerah — 1 shekel</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">50 shekels — 1 mina</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A mina therefore equals 1000 gerahs. Hence ‘a mina, a mina, a shekel and a half mina’ or two and a half minas plus a shekel, reduced to gerahs, yields the highly significant number 2520.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Thus, when Daniel pointed to this handwriting on the wall and said unto the gentile monarch: ‘God hath numbered thy kingdom and finished it; thou art weighed in the balance and art found wanting; thy kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians,’ we know he alluded not alone to the literal kingdom of Babylon, nor to the literal Mcdo-Persian empire, which succeeded it. Rather, he was prophetically declaring, ‘After 2520 years of supremacy the gentile lease of power will expire, and the rulership of earth will then be divided and broken up and given to a twofold empire’—the heavenly and the earthly phase of the Messianic kingdom. Gentile supremacy began, as we all know, with the overthrow of Israel’s last king, in 606 B. C Just 2520 years later, or in 1914 A. D., the process of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">dividing </span><span class="font9">began, in exact accordance with ‘the handwriting on the wall.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“It is further observed that this number 2520 is distinctive in that it is the least common multiple of all the digits in our system of numbers; that is, it is the least possible number into which 1, 2, 3, 4, .5, 6, 7, 8, 9 may each and all be contained. Tims in a special sense it is an all-comprehensive number. No other number could be more appropriate for spanning the whole period of gentile lease of power; and it is, at the same time, exactly </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">seven</span><span class="font9"> symbolic years in duration. Who indeed could doubt but that our chronology is correct! And do not present world events corroborate it in every sense? We now behold the dividing of earth’s kingdoms. It began exactly on time. The Messianic kingdom is the next thing in order after the present dividing wotk is complete. Let us be patient a little while longer, and soon we shall see the salvation of the Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The poet Heine has pictured the scenes of the lesson as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“In the monarch’s cheeks a wild fire glowed, And wine awoke his daring mood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">With daring hand, in his frenzy grim, The king seized a beaker and filled to the brim, And drained to the dregs the sacred cup, And foaming he cried as he drank it up, ‘Jehovah, eternal scorn I own To thee. I am monarch of Babylon.’ * * •</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The jelling laughter was hushed, and all Was still as death in the royal hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And see! And see' on the white wall high The form of a hand went slowly by, And wrote, and wrote, on the broad wall white, Letters of fire, and vanished in night”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">WE OWN THY PRESENCE</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font9">Now, with glory undefiled, Reigns as King that lowly child; Takes his own, his righteous power, In the world’s most troubled hour, —Lord, we own thy presence sweet, Shining o’er earth’s mercy seat!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font9">Help us hold thy loving hand Till we reach that golden strand Let us love thee more and more. And thy gracious name adore, Till thy blessed face we see Throughout all eternity!</span></p>

Even though I know- how valuable is join tune, yet I have felt constrained to wiite to you, just to express appreciation to the Lord that he is still fulfilling his promise of Luke 12:37; and th.it his people are still receiving the meat in due season by those whom he has appointed as a channel of his grace and love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Pai ticulai ly have I found the articles very helpful and stimulating regarding the journeys and experiences of our beloved brother Paul; and I am reminded of our dear Pastor’s words in Vol 1, p. 234: “The crown will be won when we, like our faithful brother Paul, have fought a good fight mid finished the course, but not sooner. Until then, the flame and incense of our sacrifice of labor and service must ascend daily—a sacrifice of sweet odor unto God, acceptable through Jesus Christ our Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The dear Loid continue to uphold, strengthen, and bless you, that the same glonons message which our brother Paul preached concerning Jesus and the resurrection, the Re-deemei and his kingdom, ransom and restitution (Acts 17: 18; 28:23,31), may still go forth, and the standard of the Lord be lifted up before the people. “The kingdom of heaven is at hand<sup>1</sup>” Hence “millions now living will never die”! With fervent love in the Lord, in which Sister Spackman joins, I am</span></p>

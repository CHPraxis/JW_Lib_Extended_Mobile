<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">/~\F COURSE the clergy know that war is wrong; everybody knows that it is wrong; and in times of peace the “Reverends” are always opposed to the murder of their fellow men by this means. Thus the Board of Methodist Episcopal Church Bishops announce officially: <sup>,f</sup>We earnestly hope that America may be a leader in allaying the passions engendered by war”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Some of these bishops were present in Pennsylvania in the Spring of 1918, when 400 prominent Methodist Episcopal clergymen memorialized and petitioned Congress and the President of the United</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">EDITORIAL NOTE</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font9">HE </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Banner-Herald,</span><span class="font8"> of </span><span class="font9">Athens, Georgia, in </span><span class="font8">its issue </span><span class="font9">of September 21, 1921, </span><span class="font8">contains </span><span class="font9">a half-page advertisement </span><span class="font8">bearing </span><span class="font9">the above caption, indorsed by the announcements of the ten principal churches of the </span><span class="font8">city, </span><span class="font9">all denominations.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">States to inflict the death penalty on all violators of the infamous Espionage Act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">General Bell of the United States Army afterward stated that the specific object in view </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font10">the time that resolution was engineered by the clergy and the military was to procure the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">death of </span><span class="font10">prominent executives and workers in </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">International Bible Students Association, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">their friends and associates. Did those bishops and clergymen, who no doubt claim to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font10">followers of Christ, and in their positions samples of His teachings, thus plan the death of the officers and prominent members of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I. B. S. A.? </span><span class="font10">If so, why? The answer is written </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in the </span><span class="font10">skies. Wherever they go they lay bare clerical hypocrisies. War is a good time for </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">“Reverends” to “stand in” with the authorities and to “get” those who expose their duplicity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">At present the bishops are all for peace, but not because there has been any change whatever in their views. During the war they were the </span><span class="font10">strongest “rooters” for war in </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the whole </span><span class="font10">country. They love peace but hate pacifists. Now they are for peace because their master, Big Business, is temporarily sick of war and, they know it. They “hear their master’s voice”. One can judge, therefore, how genuine is </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">principle back of the following resolution adopted at </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">World’s Methodist Conference at London, September 12,1921: </span><span class="font8">“On behalf of millions </span><span class="font9">of youths </span><span class="font8">who suffered and died; on behalf </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font8">millions of homes broken by bereavement; in the name of the silent multitudes who still suffer, we </span><span class="font9">insist </span><span class="font8">that our leaders find a way for the settlement of international </span><span class="font9">differences by </span><span class="font8">other than arbitrament of arms. </span><span class="font9">We repudiate </span><span class="font8">the doctrine that war is </span><span class="font9">a </span><span class="font8">necessity. Justice, </span><span class="font9">not force, </span><span class="font8">must be the final arbiter of right. Differences must </span><span class="font9">be </span><span class="font8">settled by reason, not by human slaughter.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Why did the Bishops wait until the Fall of 1921 to say this? \\ by did they not say it in 1914, or 191.1, or 1916, or 1917 or 1918? Every body knows the reason why. They did not want to go to jail and lose their titles and their respectability. Bishops have always been </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">against </span><span class="font10">war in general, but </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font10"> each war in particular. For we must love our enemies, except during this particular war “for a just cause!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then there is the Reverend Karl Reiland, Rector of St. George’s Church, in the City of New York. In a sermon published in one of the organs of Big Business entitled </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Commerce, ami I'iname</span><span class="font10"> he said recently:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“A little reflection should convince us </span><span class="font9">that we cannot </span><span class="font8">improve this world by paying ignominious tribute </span><span class="font9">to </span><span class="font8">Mars, whose altars have been wantonly </span><span class="font9">drenched in human blood, and we might try, even with hesitancy, paying tribute to the Prince of Peace and the brother-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">hood ef sum. Whoever </span><span class="font8">talks </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Mars </span><span class="font8">instead of Messiah </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font8">speaking not for the brotherhood of man and the Bation's destiny, but for the blood of man and the nation's death. He is advocating for our youth not an </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Ideal of </span><span class="font8">national character, but the idea of a national </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">eemetery. </span><span class="font8">He </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font8">not </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">patriot, but </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">parasite. Christianity cannot be reconciled to war any more than a gentleman can be to a philosophy of brute force. I admit that we have had to fight, and may yet have to fight, a war. But the point I make is that war should be an accident, pardonable if necessary; but peace, and </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">scientific, educational, cultural preparation for peace should be the supreme purpose.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Reverend Reiland writes very well down to the word “I”, so well that one might even feel disposed to test his genuineness by asking him which one of the cell-houses he occupied at the Atlanta Penitentiary and what were his range and cell numbers and his convict number during the war. For he would have gone to prison, had he spoken thus when it was dangerous to do so. But every one knows and must know who reads the rest of his article that during the war he stood foursquare for war the same as all the other clergy have always done in every country and in every war, and that his whole essay is / o*nly a tickling of the ears of those who like to have their ears tickled, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then there is Reverend Dwight J. Bradley, Pastor of the First Congregational Church of Webster Groves, Missouri. We know that he is against war now; for in a leaflet dated November 6, 1921, he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>&lt;r</sup>In our age there has arisen a mastering belief that war is no longer tolerable. The intelligent men and women of the world are almost universally of this opinion.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">An</span><span class="font10">d we feel like asking, Where did yon, &quot;Reverend” Bradley, stand on the war question in 1914, 1915, 1916, 1917 and 1918! When did you get i/our mastering belief that war is no longer tolerable! Why didn’t you say it in 1917! And wAen did “the intelligent men and women of the world” who are now almost universally of the opinion that war is intolerable reach that opinion! It must have been very recently. It certainly was not in the piping days </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">1917-1918, when Big Business was deliberately trying to force the country into war; and you know it, Reverend Bradley. They were for </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">war, </span><span class="font10">and we think you were too; for we do not remember seeing you at Atlanta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We come now to the words of some of those who </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font10">openly and outspokenly for war </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">we shall see how they are floundering now </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font10">all the brutal, bloody and beastly facts </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">are oonb&gt; </span><span class="font10">ing to the light/ Take for instance </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Reverend </span><span class="font10">William T. Ellis, the so-called “Religious </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Ram</span><span class="font10">bler”, famous during the lifetime of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Pastor </span><span class="font10">Russell for his persecutions of that godly </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">man;' </span><span class="font10">On June 15, 1918, in the Philadelphia </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">American,</span><span class="font10"> Reverend Ellis made use of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the fol*</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">lowing blasphemous language:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;Reverently, many soldiers know in their deepart hearts that they are following in His footsteps </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">wheo^ </span><span class="font8">they fling their lives into this ministry of </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">mankin</span><span class="font8">d. All the countless battlefield crosses that point </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">backward </span><span class="font8">and forward and upward with their arms of faith </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">testify </span><span class="font8">to a fresh appreciation of Christ and Him crucified^ offer up all for the sake of others, and of principle^ is the act that links man with God, and that </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">reldUii </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">■Calvary to the Somme.</span><span class="font8"> Two great words of ScriptuH^ are often found in my mind during these days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">is </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">‘without shedding of hlood there is no remission^ sin*.</span><span class="font8"> We .perceive how war’s unmeasured sacrifice </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Sf </span><span class="font8">purging </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">the nations of grossness and tvil.</span><span class="font8"> The </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">price </span><span class="font8">that is being paid should free us from our national, sins. Somehow in ways we cannot freely understand^ God is fulfilling the sacrifice of His Son in </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">this</span><span class="font8"> great hour. All who serve and suffer vicariously in this hour of crucifixion are </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">sharers</span><span class="font8"> tn </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">the travail and triumph ef the patient Christ!*'</span><span class="font8"> [Italics ours] ' . . ' -■&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is evident that this statement was made by Reverend Ellis to herd the boys into the trench^ es and to receive the plaudits of his ally, Big Business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If any worse blasphemy was ever uttered </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">By </span><span class="font10">one of the “Reverends” since Christ hung oM the cross to atone for the sins of mankind, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">wj </span><span class="font10">have never heard of it. How the nations hoy* been freed of grossness and evil at the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">hand! </span><span class="font10">of profiteers is a matter of history. And as </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">the holy calling of murdering one another, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">let </span><span class="font10">the Reverend Ellis himself in the same Philadelphia </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">North American;</span><span class="font10"> under date of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">May </span><span class="font10">24,1919, tell the effect that it had on the holiest of all, namely the Reverends who accompanied the American Expedition to France:'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;So widely had preaching become a profession, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">withr </span><span class="font8">out the divine spiritual passion, that many clergy</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">man^ </span><span class="font8">instead of being leaders and prophets, have </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">themselves, </span><span class="font8">maintained </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">conventionally correct mode of life </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">&lt;wfly </span><span class="font8">by circumstances. They followed the code </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of their call</span><span class="font8">ing, because it was difficult and dangerous to do </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">other</span><span class="font8">wise. Many of these men went to war from </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">varying </span><span class="font8">motives; and some avowedly to escape the tedium' </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">&lt;x </span><span class="font8">their </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">distasteful</span><span class="font8"> round of ministerial duties. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Of tide </span><span class="font8">number </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">percentage, small, and yet too large io </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">hi ignored by conscientious people, suffered a moral lap*</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With the greater number of these latter, the failure was merely a relaxation of their standards of speech and of ■uch practices as wine-drinking. Others went utterly </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">bad, </span><span class="font8">sinking into sensuality and even crime. I know whereof </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font8">speak: I am hot exaggerating the occasional instance, such as the minister in Y. M. C. .A. work, who became a confessed and convicted, thief in France. My information comes at first hand and on the spot, from </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">officials who knew all the details/'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Let </span><span class="font10">us take another illustration, touching some of the same points. The Reverend Thom</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">as B. </span><span class="font10">Gregory is a well-known contributor to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">press, his articles being widely published </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font10">the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">World</span><span class="font10"> and other periodicals. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font10">1916 the United States conducted a general election, which was won by a college president because “he kept us out of war”. Air. Gregory </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">was on </span><span class="font10">the side of this president at that time. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">He was </span><span class="font10">against war with Germany. He was </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font10">continuing the maintenance of neighborly treatment of all nations and discussed the sub</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ject as </span><span class="font10">follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;The successful preacher of today is the one who&quot; </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">talks </span><span class="font8">about the things of today: without </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">wasting his precious time</span><span class="font8"> talking about things that are supposed </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font8">have happened thousands of years ago—things that </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">are ef </span><span class="font8">no particular importance whether they happened </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">tor </span><span class="font8">did not happen. Of more importance to us than the 'Abrahamic Covenant* is the covenant that we make to</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">day </span><span class="font8">with our neighbors that we will be neighborly and </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">treat </span><span class="font8">each other with justice and good will.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">- This statement shows that this man is absolutely devoid of knowledge of the religion of 'Jesus Christ. Inasmuch as the Scriptures show </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">that the </span><span class="font10">Abrahamic Covenant states that in Abraham’s seed, which is Christ, all nations, kindreds and families of the earth shall be </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">blessed </span><span class="font10">during the Golden Age, Reverend Greg</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ory’s speech </span><span class="font10">is almost as blasphemous as that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of Reverend </span><span class="font10">Ellis. But it is not for that we </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font10">quoted it. We want you to compare its spirit and its apparent principle with the spirit </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">principle of the same gentleman’s utter</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ances a </span><span class="font10">year later, when the president that kept </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">us out </span><span class="font10">the war was busy trying to get us into </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">it and </span><span class="font10">the twenty-five press hounds bought with </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">British </span><span class="font10">Gold — bought for the purpose </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font10">Big </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Business—</span><span class="font10">were busy laying the foundation of lies upon which the war structure was subsequently erected. Hear him in 1917:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;How souls are thrilled by the spontaneity and joy with which so many millions of human, beings are </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">giving </span><span class="font8">themselves up to save the world, to rescue free</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">dom </span><span class="font8">and civilization from its would-be assassins, and contribute by their devoted and unselfish servioe to the welfare and happiness of those who are yet unborn. Thank God for the spectacle. It heartens us; it makes us proud and glad to witness such nobility of ideal and action. This is the most terrible emergency that' humanity has ever been called upon to face; and yet, Heaven be praised, it is being met with courage and ' with faith, in the firm conviction that out of every bit of sacrifice, out of every duty bravely attended to, out of sacred agony and every noble task for the Brotherhood’s sake, there shall come the flower and fruit that shall gladden all the coming generations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All men now know that the flower and fruit of the war are revolution, famine, bestiality, disease, and death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Other church officials that were outspokenly for war: James M. Gray, Dean of the Moody Bible Institute, said in a letter to the Chicago </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span><span class="font10"> in October, 1919, “I favor universal military training because it is the duty of citizens to defend their country and sometimes defend other countries, as in the late war with Germany”. Reverend Francis Kelley, Papal-empire chaplain of the American Legion, said in a speech at Cleveland: “A nation is to be judged worthy of existence as a. nation by its ability to fight, and the aim of America should^ be not to be loved but to be feared”. Former Field Marshal Von Hindenburg is a deacon in the Lutheran Church at Brandenburg; and the miserable outcast in the House of Doorn, Kai- ' ser Wilhelm, was one time a regularly ordained minister of the Lutheran Church, and head of the Lutheran Church of Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some of the Kaiser’s crowd persecuted the International Bible Students because they were unwilling to slay their fellow men. At last accounts Dean Gray of the Chicago Moody Bible Institute, it was alleged, was encouraging the Moodyites to offer persistent prayer for the destruction of the Bible Students—because they will persist in telling the truth and exposing the hypocrisies of the clergy business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is a matter of history that the French gov-eminent awarded the Cross of the Legion of Honor to the president and the secretary of the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font10">erica as a mark of recognition both for the part played by the Federal Council in the winning of the war and for the personal services of its president and secretary. This shows well enough where the clergy stood during the World War. They proved the ma</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">xim</span><span class="font10">, “We -have no king but Caesar”. They gloried in war and considered it fine, wonderful, spiritual!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Else why did the same Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America, on October </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">7, </span><span class="font10">1920, award to President Wilson a chaplain’s war medal “as an expression of appreciation by the churches of his distinguished services </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">to the church</span><span class="font10"> and to the world through his leadership in winning the World War”? Now the same men are seeking to perpetuate Mr. Wilson’s un-American attacks on the United States Constitution (which demands that church and state be kept forever separate) by forming a Woodrow Wilson Foundation which shall continue his policies indefinitely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Judged out of Their Own Mouths</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">ET the clergy now acknowledge who were responsible for the World War; for we</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">will give a number of citations, so' that all may be convinced. First comes Rabbi Wise. Addressing recently the Free Synagogue congregation in Carnegie Hall, New York city, he said: . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Failure of the churches and synagogues to maintain leadership over the people was the cause of the present war. They have enthroned a war devil in the place of God. The church is muzzled and throttled into submission. It is like a dumb dog, old and toothless, that can no longer bite. Hany of us looked to the Socialist* to avert such a war as this; but we never looked to the churches, mosques, and synagogues to prevent war. None of us expected such a thing from them, and we know what would happen to any leader in the Church of England who would dare raise his voice against his country's part in the present strife* And when the nations were preparing for this war they never consulted the churches because they knew that, just as they relied upon their ambulance corps and their commissaries, they could rely upon the churches to uphold them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The next witness is the Reverend '■Doctor George H. Combs, of Kansas City, Missouri. Dr. Combs, addressing the Detroit Pastors Union, at its monthly meeting in the Y. M. C. A., in November, 1919, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Ijeather-lunged, intemperate proclamation of the ‘gospel of hate’ during the war has brought the pulpit into contempt and caused the preacher and preaching to lose ground. In the name of patriotism the pulpit was converted into a soap-box, and we are now paying the penalty for it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The third witness is the Reverend H. M. Chworowsky, evangelical minister at Oconto, Wisconsin. At that place in October, 1920, he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The church has suffered more than any other institution from the cant and casuistry of the war spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the beginning of those days, when we refused to be-believe that a general return to pagan principles etf thought and action still were possible, there were many voices that stood out for that pacificism that is not only compatible with but the logical and moral complement of Christian ethical truth. Then as nation after nation entered the conflict, church after church performed that-amazing psychological somersault, changing from sistent attitude of opposition to wars to the ineompi*^ hensible stand of not only submissively acquiescing iikj the national demand for militaristic enterprise bat *et; openly and publicly defending wars, and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">this</span><span class="font8"> war entirely ethical and Christian. Then arose that wav*’ of open hypocrisy and .shameful duplicity in religion, barely hiding the abject moral cowardice it was mfeanA to cover, when from pulpit and religious press fhert issued forth those turbid streams of vituperation and; ghastly slander that rivalled the hysterical ravings </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">dt </span><span class="font8">a perverted patriotism.’” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">a</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The fourth witness does not give his nanje, but states that he is a clergyman. He writes iff </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Nation,</span><span class="font10"> March 6, 1920: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The record of the war activities of the churched while very ample, is. simple. Practically every pulpit in the land was a source of patriotic inspiration. Every/ clergyman labored day and night fostering the moral# of the army and the people. At home the dergy preadh-cd atrocities, and in the camps they fired the sdldiei# with a holy zeal to attack and kill the enemy. Briefly^ the record shows that both here and abroad each of tto; ordained spokesmen of Christianity justified and coM&amp;k crated the action of his own people in resorting to arm#<sup>1 </sup>His nation was fighting God's battle, and a5J who wished-to be friends of God must help to the fullest extent </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">'dt. </span><span class="font8">their powers. Thus a composite photograph, as it of all the Christian preachments reveals to us the doir trine of the man in the street, the doctrine of those whd' believe it to be their highest duty to be ready to die for their country whether right or wrong.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The fifth witness is Doctor Edward A Steiner, a converted Jew. a Congregational minister,, occupant of the chair of Applied Christianity in Grinnell College, Iowa. He writes in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Tke Independent</span><span class="font10"> of his impressions of Europe, obtained after several months which he recently spent there: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- ■ '</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“All through Europe I found a feeling, freely expressed, that at a critical moment in the world’s history, organized religion failed to fulfill its claims as a bringer </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">df </span><span class="font8">peace. The hopes mankind placed in it were not rgftluaed; for the churches failed to function except as an amen to the reactionary Pagan state. The church gave its </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">all to </span><span class="font8">Csesar; even that which was God’s; the folds of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">flag </span><span class="font8">obscured the moss, and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">the great sacrifice. of Calvary seemed in vain.</span><span class="font8"> Sermons now are full of assertion </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font8">militaristic force is futile in settling quarrels </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">between </span><span class="font8">nations, that besides being un-Christian it is imprafr Heal; and not only ministers say it, but also professors, essayists, political economists, sociologists. However, they are saying it between wars, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">when it is safe to say it. </span><span class="font8">If the church or its ministry were faithful to the spirjt and teachings of Jesus during one war; if the state knew that it could not use the church as a recruiting rtation, and as a laboratory for the culture of fighting morale, it might be less w</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">illin</span><span class="font8">g to rush into war- Of Bourse the church would suffer martyrdom: but there is an outspoken, demand that Christianity manifest itself In its full power, by accepting the consequences of its teachings, or </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">cease its pretense of being the bride of Christ when it is only the concubine of Cossar.&quot; </span><span class="font10">_ The sixth witness is Reverend William Aus</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ten </span><span class="font10">Smith, editor of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The</span><span class="font10"> [Episcopal] </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Churchman:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;Churchmen at conventions talk very solemnly about Christian leadership. Where, in God’s world, can bishops, clergymen and laymen exercise finer leadership in this war-stricken world, than by preaching the Christian doctrine of peace on earth? Will the clergy lead in this Brusade, the greatest since Christ was born? Or will they fold their hands and say: 'It is a problem for experts, for statesmen and cabinets’ ? God pity us. Statesmen, cabinets and experts have been leading us, and • leading us by the nose, in this war-morality for generations. Can we do worse if we follow Christ? If the churches cannot trust Him, who then will? If the Christian Church could raise up in England, France ^and America a thousand ministers who would be will; Jug to suffer martyrdom to end this business of war, there could never be another war. Governments cannot Make war without the consent of the churches. The Christian Church has never tested its power. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The clergy Consented unto this wicked thing!</span><span class="font8"> How much longer are we going to do it?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">/-*: The same writer (we wonder if he has read ^“The Finished Mystery”) at an address before t </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">Episcopalian ^ministers at a congress in tJew York said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">' &quot;To my mind it was a serious blunder that the church appeared to confuse patriotism with religion throughout the war. Only a few voices in the churches made clear the teachings of Christianity that war is a loathsome, </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">dia</span><span class="font8">bolical disease; that it kills romance and compassion, and </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">finall</span><span class="font8">y slays the very soul of justice. I think it heartless, un-Christian and indecent for clergy and philosophers to glow over the spiritual benefits of a war </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">tha</span><span class="font8">t laid seven million boys in their graves, starved and maimed from twenty to thirty million human beings and bathed the world in hate and darkness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Again,-the same writer, in the issue </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Churchman</span><span class="font10"> of November 12, 1921, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;The churches among all the warring nations, shared the sins of their governments during the war. We hated M our governments bade us hate. We spread lies about our enemies as those lies were meted out to us in official propaganda. We taught unforgiveness even as our rulers and diplomats inspired us to do.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The seventh and final witness is Reverend John Alfred Faulkner, who gives expression to the following sentiments in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Epworth Herald</span><span class="font10"> of November 6, 1920:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;The church is partly responsible for the great war. She has taught on exaggerated and false patriotism. No war was ever waged but that </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">the clergy have either incited it or praised it</span><span class="font8"> when once started. What if between 1871 and 1914 every synod, conference and clergyman in Germany had spoken out against that militarist regime and those militarist ideals of which the Great. War was the logical consequence—what would have been the result? I think the only man who did thus speak out was Liebknecht, the Socialist, and he was in prison for two years. Men who sinned in a </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">simil</span><span class="font8">ar way in ' America were sentenced to twenty years, more or less; and what Church has asked for their release ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Oeorse </span><span class="font10">Bernard Shaw is not a clergyman, but he sized up the situation very well in the Fall of 1919, when he was asked to send </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a mes-. </span><span class="font10">sage to the Protestant Episcopal Church of America—the same church that, when the Right Reverend Paul Jones of Utah declared himself a real Christian, opposed to war, “accepted” his resignation because of the “impaired </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">use</span><span class="font10">fulness of Bishop Jones under the present conditions”. Well! Mr. Shaw wrote the gentlemen a letter long to be remembered. It is couched in his usual witty but forceful and cutting language:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“If the blood of millions of their fellow creatures did not move the Protestant churches to protest, nor the Catholic churches to proclaim that in the kingdom of heaven there are no frontiers, can you suppose that </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">few drops from my ink bottle would have any effect on them ? I am duly flattered by your assumption that the -men who would not listen to Christ would listen to Bernard Shaw; but the churches have come out of the war so badly that if they did listen to me now I should ask, like the Greek orator, 'What foolish t</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">hin</span><span class="font8">g have I said ?’ All the men and women in America to whom anything I could say would be likely to appeal seem to be in prison, where my words cannot reach them. If </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">any </span><span class="font8">of the few who were faithful to </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">religion which I, being only a connoisseur and not a devotee, do not profess, are still at large,' I can only congratulate them* I can hardly congratulate the churches on having missed a supreme opportunity; for </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">I am afraid that supremo opportunity may prove to have been their last chancel*</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Henry Newmann is not a clergyman either, but he says some things that fit in very well with those of Mr. Shaw. In an address delivered October 5,1919, before the Brooklyn Society for Ethical Culture he said in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;Perhaps I am too biased; but it looks to me aa if in the main the conduct of the churches during the war revealed a fundamental defect in their beliefs. To put it bluntly, I think that what most of the churches have done has been of a sort *to inflame the world's illness ‘ rather than to heal it. Have not the churches outdone even the newspapers in preaching hatred and vengeance ? Certain young men, called to take up arms; replied, ‘We believe that the war lust js found not only in Prussia but everywhere. We find it in ourselves. We will not kill There is a better way of driving out violence than to repeat the enemy's evil.’ These young men went to jail. Some died there. Did the church, custodian (as we thought it) of the sanctities of conscience, plead for them? Did it raise its voice in behalf of a , • juster treatment than they have received ? In the main 'With but a few honorable exceptions, it joined the pack in hunting them down. As George Bernard Shaw says, the churches resisted the invasion of the Prince of Peace more fiercely than that of the Kaiser. Few things have been more distressing than the way in which everywhere ministers of religion have been the most intemperate in reviling the enemy, in extravagantly lauding their own people, in confusing justice with sheer vengeance.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A clergyman in New York, catching the first faint glimmerings of what is coming, made the naive statement, “It was too bad we stepped on the conscientious objector so hard during the war ; it is so difficult to explain now”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">During the war the young men were encour</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">aged </span><span class="font10">to rush headlong into death by those who </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font10">ordinary times would have offered them no </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">hope </span><span class="font10">of God’s favor except by compliance with many and heavy ecclesiastical rules and expensive masses. It is well known that the R^man Catholic religion holds out no hopes of dodg</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font10">purgatory for hundreds of years even to the popes and cardinals; but Cardinal Mercier, of Belgium, imbued with the usual spirit of the clergy in war time, said in his Christmas pastoral in 1914:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;I am asked what I think of the eternal salvation of a brave man who has consciously given his life in defense of his country's honor, and in vindication of violated justice. I shall not hesitate to reply that without any doubt whatever Christ crowns his military valor, </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">a-n</span><span class="font8">d that </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">death accepted in this Christian spirit assures the safety of that mans soul.</span><span class="font8"> Must we suppose that God requires of j^he plain soldier in the excitement of battle the methodical precision of the moralist or the theologian ? Can we who revere his heroism doubt that God welcomes </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font8"> with love?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">But if the souls of those who died in battle</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">were safe, what about </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the souls of those who<sup>: </sup></span><span class="font10">went through the same </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">battles unscathed! Are; </span><span class="font10">not they safe, too; and if not, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">why not! But </span><span class="font10">anyway, Canon William Chase, of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">New York, </span><span class="font10">says they are not. He said </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">at Washington, January 14, 1921: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>A</sub> </span><span class="font10">' <sup>:</sup>-'<sup>-</sup>7</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;Our men did not come back spiritually uplifted, we had hoped. They have not gone into the churches/,? they have not brought any new spiritual force to hearj in our national life. Many of the veterans of the wai| show a cynical disregard for the higher life, rather than $ an awakened moral conscience.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is pitiful to see the work that some </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of these:] </span><span class="font10">clericals perform in trying to make their Christian conduct agree with their </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">professed': </span><span class="font10">Christian religion. The Protestant </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Episcopal </span><span class="font10">Church of America held a convention </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in Newl; </span><span class="font10">York City in Ma^, 1919, and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The World morrow</span><span class="font10"> in its June issue of that year said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;But perhaps the most significant of all was tlfe-con^ fession of Bishop Rogers Israel of Erie that throughout? his entire service at the front he was haunted with question. ‘Should we have met might with might, hor^ ' ror with horror, slaughter With slaughter?'

<p><span class="font10">Some go a step farther’and admit that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">they'?, </span><span class="font10">are sick of war. Note Jhe belated conviction </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ol </span><span class="font10">Reverend J. H. Hopkinson, vicar-of Holy </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Trin</span><span class="font10">ity Church at Colne, England, as reported </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font10">the New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Globe,</span><span class="font10"> May 7, 1920:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;We have learned that war is not a matter of flutter* ing banners and clashing swords and beating drums, but merely a sickening and dirty butchery of lads in water-logged or fly-infested trenches. We shall be less ready than we were to compare the movement of the church to that of a victorious army. Hymns that we could sing unthinkingly before the war have become • lying blasphemy. Who would now sing, Take a mighty army moves the church of God’?” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">An Episcopalian pastor, writing in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Statesman</span><span class="font10"> magazine goes still farther. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font10">says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;I for one will step down and out of my pulpit </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">if </span><span class="font8">there is any Japanese war. I shall not play hanky-pank with the word or gospel of the Prince of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Peace </span><span class="font8">and turn the House of Prayer into a recruiting station . for gassing off yellow men. I did it in the World War, want over seas and received a decoration. But I’m through. They may call me a pacifist, clap me into jail or anything else. But no more of it for this laddie. I will preach the flag of Christ’s Cross, but I will be hanged if I will preach any other kind of flaggery. Never again I At least I’ll be a Christian, whatever the results may be. And churches could stop another war. They could and can preach the Prince of Peace, and follow peace.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">-That there were some clergy that actually did keep a people pacific during the World War (without taking into account the motives that led them to take such a step) was brought out by George Fentrick, writing in The New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">World,</span><span class="font10"> September 7, 1921. Mr. Fentrick said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;When, during the World War, England passed the Conscription Act for Ireland, the Irish priests called their congregations together one Sunday morning and asked the people to raise their hands and swear that they would not obey this law. Now this of course was -treason. But since they could not execute 3,500,000 people, the law went by default. This shows what the church can do when it takes concerted action.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">* The magazine </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Unity,</span><span class="font10"> writing of the responsibility for “the next war”, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">‘ “To our way of thinking, the situation calls for nothing less than a vast international conference of all the churches in all countries, which shall solemnly pledge Christians in the name of God and Jesus Christ: (1) not to pay any taxes to any government which supports </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">separate and competitive army and navy, and (2) not Co fight in any war under any circumstances, and which shall organize machinery in every country to educate ' people to the acceptance of these pledges, and put them into effect.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Papal Empire has come out of the war ■ with greater gains than any other of these institutions calling themselves churches and presided over by “Reverends The Empire is after the almighty dollar, and takes a long look into the future to see what can be done with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Sons and Daughters of Washington, with headquarters at 101 South Manning Boulevard, Albany, New York, are memorializing Congress demanding an investigation of the Knights of Columbus, an accounting for the many millions of dollars collected, from Protestants mostly, under the supervising hand of the United States Govermept and turned over to them by the Tumulty government in the latter part of 191S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">They wint to know why this money, extorted from the American people under the pretense that it was to be used for the benefit of sick and wounded soldier boys, is now being kept by this religio-political organization, while thousands of those jaame soldier boys are without food and have no place to lay their heads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">They demand to know why it is that $1,000,-000 should be sent to the Pope at Rome to help destroy the Y. M. C. A., and to break up the work of the Methodist Church in Rome, and why $1,000,000 is set aside for the rewriting and perversion of the History of the United States, so that the minds of the youth of America may be corrupted at the fountain by Roman Catholie school books before they get old enough to have them corrupted finally by a Jesultized press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mr. John B. Kennedy, director of the publicity’ department of the Knights of Columbus, claims that there were only $8,000,000 left and that this is being used in hospital and educational work. He states further that the gifts to the Pope and for the purposes of rewriting American text-books came from private Knight of Columbus funds. But sometimes such things are mere matters of book-keeping, such as any clerk could do on a moment’s notice.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font10">N OCCUPATION to which the clergy are . particularly well suited is that of spies; and the governments associated with the Papal Empire and with the various Protestant sects have always made large use of them for this purpose, especially in time of war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We have already alluded to the effort made to secure the death penalty for Judge Rutherford and his companions at the hands of a gang of Methodist Reverends in Pennsylvania; they were representative of the clergy, in general, as we have pointed out in The Golden Age Number 27, wherein we narrated more than one hundred cases of mob violence, all or nearly all of which are known to have been incited by men engaged in the clergy business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">During the hysteria of the war period there was an opportunity for the “Reverends” to get at innocent people of differing religion. That they made full use of their opportunities is evident from the following extracts from affidavits by Bible students who were persecuted on false charges of sedition. In all centuries political Reverends have utilized the civil powers to settle grudges against persons of other beliefs than their own. Big Church, Big Business and Big Politics—an unholy alliance—travel hand in hand and stop at nothing. There was no law in the Constitution, the State Constitutions, the State statutes and the local laws concerning freedom of religion that was not violated by a class of men preaching a devotion to law and order. Some of the outrages by Reverends are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;At Weyser, Idaho, two colporteurs were taken before the Chairman of the Council of Defense, and charged with selling seditious literature. The Chairman, not being versed in religious matters, called in a local minister to pass judgment on the books [&quot;Studies in the Scriptures”] and the latter remarked that if he had the power he would stop the distribution of all those books, not only until after the war, but permanently”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Winnsboro, Texas, the victim states: &quot;The city lock-up, where I was taken, was an apartment of the city toilet, which had no sewerage connections whatever, thus making it the filthiest place imaginable. My arrest was instigated by one of the Methodist preachers of Winnsboro, who assisted the officers in my arrest and examination held at police headquarters.” r</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;At Celeste, Texas,” another victim writes, &quot;two clergymen to whom we handed copies of 'The Kingdom News/ demanded of the city marshal that he arrest us. The marshal refused and attended the lecture that same evening in Celeste; and expressed himself as well pleased with the talk. However, the clergymen stirred up the people, who phone(Dthe marshal demanding our arrest. The marshal called up the County Attorney, Mr. Frank Kemp, and Mr. Kemp told him to put us in jail regardless of character and sex. This the marshal, Mr. Brewer, refused to do. . . . Later, when the marshal, accompanied by ourselves, appeared before the County Attorney, the Cotfnty Attorney said we had not violated any law, and ordered our release, although six hours before this he had instructed that we be jailed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;I was warned by prominent members and deacons of the Baptist Church here [Post Oak, Mo.] that unless I bought bonds, etc., I would get into trouble. On May SOth, 1918, several churches met to pray together. That night my automobile was stolen from my garage, taken to Leeton, Mo., painted yellow, and left in the street-The next morning, while I was inquiring about my car, the Reverend G. L. Newkirk, Pastor of the Providence Baptist Church, called me over the telephone and told me my car was in Leeton, Mo. When I arrived in Leeton, I noted Reverend G. L. Newkirk, dressed in common clothes, so as not to be noticeable, standing near the automobile, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">together with</span><span class="font8"> a large crowd. ... I was later informed that the crowd was prepared to paint me yellow in case I made any remarks about my new car being damaged.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Denison, Texas, &quot;We were called German propagandists, anjJ Mr. E. J. Smith, head of the War Council, told us that he was 'against us and our d—d religion’, and that his recommendation as head of the W ar Council would be to </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">lin</span><span class="font8">e us up, both men and women and children, against a brick wall, and shoot us, and not stop until all of us had been killed in the whole country... A committee waited on J. R. May and told </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font8"> that the persecutions which he received were not given him because he did not buy bonds, ‘but because </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">-of'</span><span class="font8">his d—*4, religion’. . . . The clergymen of this city formed part, of the local War Council.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At New London, Ohio, &quot;We distributed a special’ edition of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The National Labor '(ribune,.</span><span class="font8"> The $hen£; and deputy, with a crowd at their heels arrested we were about to board- the train to return home; and] charged us with being Bolsheviks. The crowd yelled^ 'Lynch them’. We were taken to the sheriff’s office*. The Mayor of Wellington, Ohio, vouched for our chiaipr acters. They could find nothing whatever wrong witlT the paper, and were willing to release us. But the.mofr outside, stirred by two clergymen, was growling. KI nally a friend of ours took us back to Wellington automobile.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Garfield, Washington, &quot;While distributing *King-J dom News’ . . . the sheriff detained Donald Main in? his hotel. A clergyman questioned him in the hotel;;: and said to him</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">: ‘If</span><span class="font8"> you fellows don’t stop putting oiitj your literature, you will find some of your people strung' up to a telegraph pole, and I will be one of the first to-, pull the rope’. . . . The same night he was called before^ a judge, and although it was late in the night, a Bap-; tist minister was present as a spectator. . . . The Courts in Spokane, after investigating the copies of 'The King*^ dom News’, stated they could see nothing wrong in.it*”^</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Chetonak, Oklahoma, “The Council of Defense^ consisting of Walter Brumley, W. C. Canterbury‘anfo A. 0. Johnson, called on me and told me to either’; change my attitude or leave town immediately. I lefV town with my family on the first train. My case camej up in July and no bill was found against </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">me/ I</span><span class="font8"> have.] since learned.that our'persecution was instigated by the’’ clergy, and came at the end of »a four-weeks union' meeting of the churches, during which our beliefs were ' made the subject of attack two nights of each week.**&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At Miami, Texas, Mr. and Mrs. R. A. Bayless swear: ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Reverend J. C. Stalcup, Secretary of the Council of Defense and Baptist preacher, took a copy of the paper from Mrs. Bayless and gave her to understand that he would read it over and notify her to cease distribution if he found anything wrong in it. He did not notify ua. . . . . About a week later ... we were arrested. . . .We were . . . arraigned before U. S- Commissioner A/A/.1 Brown, with Reverend J. C. Stalcup ... as the only complaining witness .... When comlnitted to prison, ’ our two Bibles, some copies of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font8"> and two sets of 'Studies in the Scriptures’ were taken from us and never returned, though we repeatedly requested them. While we were in jail in Muskogee the Council of Defense of Miami, Texas, entered our house and ransacked it, taking our hymn books, volumes of ‘Studies in the Scriptures’, issues of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font8"> and paper and tracts. . . . The Federal Grand Jury met at McAlester, Oklahoma- Reverend </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Ji</span><span class="font8"> C.

<p><span class="font10">Says Charles J. Crews, of Little Rock, Arkansas:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;I received frequent warnings from the Baptist Minister, Reverend E. D. Cameron, of Checotah, Oklahoma, saying that if I didn’t give up 'that belief’ I would be sent to the penitentiary”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The foregoing are only a small fraction of the instances that might be related of how, when conditions are right, the Reverends “get” people that diffej from them in belief. How long will these white-walled monsters of iniquity be permitted to darken the land and fill it with violence ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Right Reverend Theodore S. Henderson, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">the Methodist Episcopal Church, in a sermon </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font10">Detroit in the summer of 1918, after referring to the fact that he had been accused of be</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font10">partly responsible for the mob which did </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">death the innocent Prager at East St. Louis, falsely accused of being a German spy, went on record as saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;If any man or women accused of sedition or disloyalty, and after process of trial by jury should be found guilty, such traitor should be taken out and shot.” The Bishop then went on to laud the Espionage Act, stating that &quot;the passage of this act makes it possible for the legal punishment of all violators, without any resort by the citizens to take the law into their own hands”. [See how narrowly he misses advocating mob violence]</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Reverend John G. Still, pastor of the People’s Church of Louisville, Kentucky, trimmed the bishops in good shape for the part they </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">' played </span><span class="font10">in upholding the infamous and unconstitutional Espionage Act, whereby the liberties </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">the American people were taken from them </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">vested </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font10">the Preachers, Profiteers, and Politicians. In a sermon delivered in February, 1920, he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;Remember what part you played—you bishops and priests and churchmen? Remember how you stood in your pulpits—and how you raised your voices to cry aloud with prophetic power that the God of Israel hath said, 'Thou shalt not kill’? Remember how you went up and down the land urging, pleading, imploring, demanding that there shall be 'peace on earth and good will amongunen*—remember that ? Of course you don’t. For that isi^’t what you did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;This is what you did. You converted the churches of Christ, the Prince of Peace, into Temples of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">War God. You fanned the fires of hell and hate into the consuming flames of war. Stand here with me, and tell me this: Tell me what crimes did ’Gene Debs commit? Why, you say, he violated the Espionage Act. . You hypocrites 1 And only yesterday, when I stood in one of your pulpits you told me that religion has nothing to do with politics! What business have ywn to talk about Espionage Acts? To judge by the tone of the Christian church one might </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">thi-nk</span><span class="font8"> that Christ said, 'Well done, thou good and faithful servant—thou hast obeyed the Espionage Act—enter into the joys </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">if</span><span class="font8"> the Lord!' No, sir. You can’t </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">get</span><span class="font8"> by with that. We demand that you tell us in the eternal terms of right and wrong, not in the terms^of transient politics, what crime is it for which this man goes ten long years behind prison bars ? And there is just one answer, ’tis his own, made before his judge, when he said: </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">'I</span><span class="font8"> admit it. I am opposed to war, all wars) and this war, too. And if I stood alone I should nevertheless be opposed to the war-’ That 10 the crime in the terms of your Christian religion—he was opposed to war—in the language of your own orthodox theology—he is guilty of standing by the cross of Christ, the Prince of Peace, in time of war 1” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Reverend Still hit on a sore spot when </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">he -</span><span class="font10">mentioned Mt. Debs. The clergy know that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">they </span><span class="font10">are responsible for having this </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">man locked up and </span><span class="font10">having him kept locked up; </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and yet-here </span><span class="font10">is a man who loves his fellow men sa much that he has been known to give the overcoat off </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font10">back to a total stranger, in midwinter, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">without </span><span class="font10">asking the stranger’s name, merely </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">because he </span><span class="font10">saw that the man was suffering </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">with the cold. </span><span class="font10">This man was locked up and kept locked </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">up, so </span><span class="font10">that he would not, in some strange </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">way, take </span><span class="font10">away the liberties and the happiness of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">108,</span><span class="font10">000,000 people that inhabit this broad </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">land 1</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">As respects this matter of spying upon </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">liberties of others and trying to take away </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">rights of minorities, Wendell Phillips </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">said in </span><span class="font10">1860:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;Governments exi$t to protect the rights of minorities. The loved and the rich need no protection—they have । many friends and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">few</span><span class="font8"> enemies. We have praised our Union for seventy years. This is the first time it is tested. Has it educated men who know their rights and Hare maintain them? Can it bear the discussion of a ' great national sin, anchored deep in the prejudices and Interests of millions? If so, it deserves to live. If not, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">sooner it vanishes out of the way the better. The ' time to assert rights is when they are denied. The men' </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font8">assert them are those to whom they are denied. The । bommiinity which dares hot protect its humblest and * taost hated jhemb'er in the free utterance of his opinions,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Bo matter how false or hateful, is only a gang of slaves?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Prohibition of Liquor</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">THE Anti-Saloon League is composed of cler-</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">' .&quot; A </span><span class="font10">gymen and was the instrumentality used in , bringing about the prohibition of the liquor J traffic in the United States. The League has ' I been forceful, efficient, and ably managed; and</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">] it has produced the results it sought. The Pro; hibition Amendment is a part of the fundamen-j tai law of the land; and if anybody in power I in this. country paid the least attention to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&lt; I Constitution, prohibition would be a reality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I . Since the Prohibition Amendment and the ; [Volstead Act were passed, the clergy have been ; trying to have the law upheld. Reverend G. E. j Richter, of Stamford, Connecticut, is one ofi - these. Prohibition gives the<sup>4 4</sup> Reverends ’' some</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">! thing fresh to fight about. The New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">World </span><span class="font10"><sup>:</sup> Credits him with having given expression to the following utterances on this subject in the Fall </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Of </span><span class="font10">1920:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">*1 am not afraid of God, or man, or the devil, or the baptism of eggs that has greeted my efforts to purge</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">’ these communities of low gambling and drinking. And I shall carry a gun, no matter what the officials of Darien may say.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After being denied a permit to carry a revolver Mr. Richter said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">*If I had a revolver I would discharge it into the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">sir, </span><span class="font8">and then my friends would rush out. I see no reason</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">• why I should not have my constitutional rights. And I you I will have a revolver, and I will fight for my rights in this community!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The-clergy of the Episcopal church are accustomed to greater personal liberties than those of most other Protestant denominations, and they do not take well to restrictions of their own liberties or spying upon the liberties of others in this matter of prohibition. In January, 1920,’Reverend Doctor Henry Davies, rec- tor of Christ Episcopal Church, Easton, Md., replied to an invitation of Darnel C. Roper. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, in such a way as to imply that Mr. Roper had wanted his assistance in the enforcement of prohibition in the vicinity. He said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“In this church we are not accustomed to such intrusion into private morals and conduct of its members, which looks, on the surface at least, too much like </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">secret service, or worse, spying. Moreover, I believe that my people would not be so low as to be informers.'’’; .7-4;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Sometimes, when there is no war, the “R^ erends ’ ’ think some laws should not be obeyed} The Dean of St. Paul’s, London, says thatit is all right to cheat the government by. gling in liquor, if the government Exceeds it* rights in prohibiting some harmless act”. On® can hardly help wondering just who are the; people that are to determine when the government has exceeded its rights and how they ar®, to go about the enforcement of their opinion^</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Reverend B. S. Bouchier, vicar of St. Jude<sup>1</sup>* Chureh, does not have a high opinion of pro-5 hibition in America. At a prohibition meeting; in Hampstead Gardens Free Church,’London,' in May, 1920, he startled the supposedly prd^ hibition audience by saying:</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">As soon as prohibition went into effect, in September, 1919, Chicago churchmen opened</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">i? </span><span class="font10">church saloon, at 884 South State Street, witS% a Reverend for a bartender. The bar and the &quot;&nbsp;fixtures are of the regular, old-fashioned, rumhole variety. A picture published in the Chicago </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Herald and Examiner,</span><span class="font10"> September 23,. 1919, shows six men, one behind the bar and five lined up in front of it. Of the latter, three have their feet on the bar rail as if it were a familiar position with them, and four have glasses of Some <sub>z </sub>kind of drink in their hands. All but one of the seven men in the picture are stated to be Rev- :• erends—three of them Presbyterians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">“It is evident that some of the city churches propose to be fortified with the proper amount of wine for sacramental purposes, as it came to the attention of thedocal Federal officials, yesterday, that the official board of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">Los Angeles church has invested in 300 gallons of wine to be used in the ministrations of the body* As there are BOO members of the congregation that means a halfgallon for each one of the communicants.

<p><span class="font10">KRISTIANS are not under the law of Moses, but under the law of love. The seventh day of the week, upon which the Jew was required to rest, represents the great seventh-thousand-year day of human history, the Golden Age, during which the world of mankind will recover from the toil and travail of the six thousand years of sin and death that are now in the past. To the Christian that seventh Klay—our Saturday — typifies or pictures the rest of heart into which he enters when he enters into Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is a general impression among Christians that in some way they are obligated to a special observance of Sunday, but the Scriptures enjoin no such rule or even hint at it — rather the opposite. Real Christians are glad that by custom there is a day in each week available for restand worship, but it makes no difference to them what that day is, nor have they any wish to push their preferences upon others by onerous and unnecessary laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">' In revolutionary days there was a strict Sunday (miscalled Sabbath, for Saturday not Sunday is the Bible Sabbath) law in all the colonies, namely, the Act of Charles II, which provided that:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">’ &quot;AH and every person whatsoever shall every Lord's Day apply themselves to the observation of the same, by exercising themselves thereon in the duties of piety . and true religion, publicly and privately”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The law forbade all unnecessary travel and stipulated that:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;No tradesman, artificer, workman, laborer, or other person whatsoever shall do or exercise any worldly labor, business, or work of, their ordinary callings^*.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At present there are no Sunday laws whatever nr the District of Columbia or in California ; nor have there been any in Oregon since -1918, when the people got -tired of them and threw them out. Sunday labor and amusements are perfectly legal in Colorado, Illinois, and New Mexico unless they disturb church congregations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the good old days in the city of New Ha</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ven, </span><span class="font10">Connecticut, they had some pretty strict laws. No one could vote unless converted </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and a </span><span class="font10">member </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of. </span><span class="font10">some one </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">churches allowed, </span><span class="font10">within the city; food or lodging </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">could not bo-</span><span class="font10">offered to a heretic; no one eouid </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">cross a river </span><span class="font10">on Sunday except an authorized </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Reverend; no </span><span class="font10">one could travel, cook victuals, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">make beds* </span><span class="font10">sweep houses, cut hair or </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">shave, or kiss hi* </span><span class="font10">children on Sunday—and the day </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">began at sun</span><span class="font10">down on Saturday. No one could </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">wear clothes </span><span class="font10">trimmed with gold, silver, ribbon, er </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">lace worth , </span><span class="font10">over </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">shilling </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">yard without </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">incurring a fino of </span><span class="font10">$1,500. Bringing cards or </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">dice into the city </span><span class="font10">was punished with a fine of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">$25. It was illegal </span><span class="font10">to eat mince pies, dance, play cards, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font10">play </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">any </span><span class="font10">other instrument of music than the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">drum, trum</span><span class="font10">pet, and jew’s-harp. No one </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">could court a maid </span><span class="font10">without obtaining the consent </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of her parents* </span><span class="font10">under penalty of $25 for the first </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">offense, $50 for the second offense, and imprisonment for </span><span class="font10">the third offense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Many of the Reverends, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">encouraged by their </span><span class="font10">success in the prohibition </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">crusade are pressing </span><span class="font10">hard toward the passing of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">laws for a strict </span><span class="font10">Sunday observance the country </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ever. Rever</span><span class="font10">end Noah W. Cooper, Chairman </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of the Metho</span><span class="font10">dist Central Sabbath Crusade </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Committee, rep</span><span class="font10">resenting nineteen southern </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">conference* of that </span><span class="font10">denomination, recently appeared </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">before Con</span><span class="font10">gressional Committees and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">presented a pro</span><span class="font10">posed national Sunday observance </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">biU, together </span><span class="font10">with a lengthy petition, both </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of which were in</span><span class="font10">troduced into the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Congressional </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Record</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> of July </span><span class="font10">13, 1921. The proposed national </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Sunday law </span><span class="font10">and the petition urge Congress </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to prohibit the </span><span class="font10">publication and circulation of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Sunday news</span><span class="font10">papers, the operation of Sunday </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">trains and all </span><span class="font10">interstate traffic, the prevention </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of all profes</span><span class="font10">sional and other labor, likewise all </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">amusements </span><span class="font10">of every character that are </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">conducted for profit </span><span class="font10">on Sundays. Mr. Cooper claims that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">1,500,000 ' </span><span class="font10">constituent members of the Methodist </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Church </span><span class="font10">South are backing him up in this </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Reverend Cooper is not the only </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">one that is </span><span class="font10">pressing for drastic Sunday legislation. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">An</span><span class="font10">other is Reverend Harry L. Bowlby, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">D. D., head of </span><span class="font10">the Lord’s Day Alliance, an </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">organization </span><span class="font10">representing in an official capacity </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">sixteen re</span><span class="font10">ligious denominations. In the Philadelphia </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Public Ledger,</span><span class="font10"> of November 28, 1920, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Doctor </span><span class="font10">Bowlby made the following </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">statement of ths </span><span class="font10">intentions of his organization:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;We propose by legislation, to make it easier for people to go to church. In other words, we shall try to dose the baseball pSfcks, the golf links, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the motion pio-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">hire and other theatres, the concert halls, the amusement parks, the bathing beaches, and so on. We shall fight all amusements where an admission fee is charged. We shall oppose golf, tennis, baseball, and other sports, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">even </span><span class="font8">if purely amateur and void of financial cost to those taking part, because they set bad examples for children who otherwise might be content to go to Sunday school. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">We </span><span class="font8">shall seek to restrict the sale of gasoline for pleas</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ure </span><span class="font8">yachts, automobiles, and urge other measures that will stop Sunday automobiling and joy riding. This will not bring the old-fashioned horse and buggy back, because we believe that the Lord's day should be a day of rest for man and beast. Excursion steamer rides on Sunday will be opposed by us on the ground that th<sup>,i</sup>y are unnecessary to the moral welfare of Christian America.’ No, I see no reason why the public libraries or the art galleries should remain open on Sunday. Wc shall seek to eliminate the huge Sunday newspapers, and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">establish a censorship</span><span class="font8"> [Italics ours] over the stuff that gets into them on other days. Of course, we shall back no law that would compel a man or a woman to attend church. But we believe that if we take away a man’s motor car,’ his golf sticks, his Sunday newspaper, his </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">x* </span><span class="font8">horses, his pleasure steamships, amusement houses, and parks, and prohibit him from playing outdoor games or witnessing field sports, he naturally will drift back to the church.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">- - The New York </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">World</span><span class="font10"> seems to think that there is a good chance that the united efforts of Reverend Cooper and Reverend Bowlby will succeed. It says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The same elements that brought about the Eighteenth Amendment [prohibiting the sale and manufacture of liquor] and the Volstead Ijaw [enforcing that ‘ Amendment] are back of the proposed Sunday-observance amendment, and the political influence of these elements can hardly be overestimated.' It is not too much to say that the Anti-Saloon League alone is now the best organized and the most powerful agency of government in the United States. If this lobby now sets out to write the Puritan Sunday into the Constitution of the United States, there is no reason to assume that its campaign will be anything but triumphant.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Sunday-observance movement is spreading. The Reverends of the city of London have united in a refusal to conduct Sunday funerals, as they need the rest. They did this after the ’ various common councils had refused to make</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Sunday funerals illegal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is just possible that some disappointments await some of these enthusiasts who favor closing everytlftng but the churches on Sunday, as Judge Burnell of Los Angeles, California, has ruled that a collection taken on Sunday is virtually an admission fee to thjrSunday services. If everything's closed up that charges an ad</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">mission fee the collection box will have to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">go.‘-</span><span class="font10">The stock argument set forth as the. reason for a strict Sunday observance was voiced by Reverend L. S. Barton, at the Boston-Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church, Tulsa, Oklahoma^. Preaching upon the Ten Commandments </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">^hich: </span><span class="font10">God made the basis of’ His law covenant Israel, Reverend Barton laid stress on the oifti] calling upon the Jews to “ observe the Sabbatjr day and keep it holy”. He said in part: ery law of right or wrong has its basis in these^ commandments, and it is the enforcement of ] these laws that the ministers of today stibulcT derhand”. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Reverend Barton does not pause to considet’-j that if his statements are correct then </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">practi**s </span><span class="font10">cally every minister in America is guilty of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">mur^ </span><span class="font10">der; for during the World War nearly </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">every^ </span><span class="font10">one of them completely ignored the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">command?;' </span><span class="font10">ment, “Thou shalt not kill”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Many of the clergy seem to think that they have the right to tell all tlffe other peoplerjust?; what they can do and cannot&quot; do. Reverend^: John Roach Straton'states the matter grand^j iloquently: “The religious forces have both the^ right and the duty to influence the state in the^ enactment of enlightened ideals into righteouM^ laws”. We can find plenty of statements just-J like that, made by the Popes in the days of the? Inquisition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Noting the threat of the Reverends of HasZ tings, Nebraska, to precipitate a fight for </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the? </span><span class="font10">closing of the Sunday amusements of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">that city, ? </span><span class="font10">the Hastings </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span><span class="font10"> said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' _ ‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;This is a bold threat of the most brazen kind. The ’• ministers should remember that the laymen also have &lt;&nbsp;a right to organize to fight for what they deem is their . prerogative. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span><span class="font8"> does not believe that the jnin* •• istors have any more right to say how things should be conducted within the corporate limits of Hastings than ’ has any other body of good citizens. The people, and the people alone, have the right to say how the city of -Hastings should be run.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hore and there is a man in the clergy business that sees the injustice of trying to force ■ everybody into one groove. Reverend Roy V. Harp, pastor of the Christian church at Fair-, view, Oklahoma, and a representative in the legislature of that state, is a broad-minded, ; sensible man. He said on this subject : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“1 am dead square set against the blue Sunday laws?' I don’t want to legislate people into theHringdom of heaven. It can’t be done. If the church cannot compete with the world, I will quit preaching.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Now let </span><span class="font10">us observe a few'instances of the enforcement of Sunday laws in various states. At White Plains, New York, in March, 1921, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">man was arrested for striking another man on </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">Sunday. On the same day he was convicted for the offense and sentenced to six months in prison. A higher court set the verdict aside Because, it had been given on a Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A lady writing from London, Ontario, Canada, under date of June 12, 1921, gives us the next to the worst case of Sunday idiocy that has been brought to our notice. Her letter says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“AU Sattfffiay night and Sunday till half past twelve we witnessed the greatest storm that any one in this part of the country had ever seen. In some places the water was fifteen feet deep, and traffic was blocked on public streets until the foUowing night. Some families were compelled to move out of their homes on Sunday, furniture and all, because the foundations of the house were: being washed away. -This caused the Lord’s Day Alliance to have, summons sent to them for breaking</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">: the </span><span class="font8">Sabbath.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Gneother illustration, however, is still, worse. - It shows what may happen anywhere when fools pass laws which are entrusted to fools to execute ; and certainly no one dare trust a Sunday observance law in the hands of a class of men .who have declared that bootlegging is as bad as murder, and that the offending, bootlegger should be slain at sight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On Tangier Island, in Chesapeake Bay, there is a law in effect requiring all persons to either attend church services or else stay at home while the services are going on, One lad elected </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">stay at home and took a seat on his father’s front porch until the services should be over. A constable came along and order him to go into the house; he refused, a struggle ensued and the constable shot the boy in the stomach. This is what a country gets for giving up its </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">rights </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">a lot of fanatics and <sup>u</sup> Fools Who Go to Church”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In Iowa, in 1917, when an attempt was made there to revive some of the ancient and ridiculous blue laws, the proposed legislation was laughed out of existence by the circulation oil the following poem composed for the occasion by a wit of state-wide renown:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ON SUNDAY, ANYMORE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">BY MAL ROSE</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FOREWORD</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">URING the past thirty years, with increasing frequency, the public has been subject</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ed </span><span class="font10">to curtailment of industry with consequent financial loss as well as inconvenience as a re</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">sult </span><span class="font10">of the threatened or actual tying up of transportation facilities because employer and Bmployes have been unable to adjust differences arising between them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">; Transportation is of foremost importance to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Dur </span><span class="font10">country. Without it agriculture, manufacturing and other activities would be useless and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font10">would degenerate to the status of the aborigines. Being, as it is, a public necessity, noth-</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">, ing </span><span class="font10">should be permitted to come in the way of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">its </span><span class="font10">continued service.</span></p>

No doubt much testimony could be brought forth by either party to the controversy in proof of the fact that the other party is guilty. It is also quite true that both parties are not guiltless; rhowever, it is not the purpose of the writer to open up a discussion on those lines, but rather </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">offer a solution of the present difficulty in erecting a platform on which the three warring </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">elements </span><span class="font10">can be brought'together in </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">program </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">progress to the end that our transportation Systems can be made to serve more adequately </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">public whose creatures they are.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">That the principles of the Golden Rule as out- &lt;&nbsp;lined in the following plan can be successfully applied to the Transportation business is ap- &gt;&nbsp;parent when fully understood and put into op-' eration.<sup>1</sup> The writer is firmly convinced that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font10">could, with open-minded support, successfully inaugurate the plan on any road or group </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">roads within eighteen months from the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">time the^ </span><span class="font10">job is undertaken.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CAPITALIZATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The fundamental essential to the successful </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">operation </span><span class="font10">of any business is a proper coordina</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">tion </span><span class="font10">of money, brains and brawn, neither of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">which </span><span class="font10">can, alone or in combination of two’s, produce satisfactory results. It requires a well-balanced ratio of all three elements. With this fundamental tact in mind it is apparent that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">•ne </span><span class="font10">of the first steps necessary is a reorgani</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">sation </span><span class="font10">of the capitalization of our railroads </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">which </span><span class="font10">dairies with it a new and progressive </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Idea, </span><span class="font10">to wit, Capitalizing the brain and brawn </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">effort </span><span class="font10">as well as the money invested in the transportation business, to the end that only ■uch an amount of each as can be economically </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">utilized </span><span class="font10">is included.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">If </span><span class="font10">the A&amp;erican roads were to be capitalized </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font10">these lines it would appear somewhat as fol-</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">knri:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Capitalization</span><span class="font8"> $75,364,000,000 Money Capital (Plant &amp;&nbsp;Equipment)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I. C. C. Tentative figure_____$18,900,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Brains Capital (Executive Class)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">22,873 officers_____________________ $2,150,000,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Brawn Capital (Employ^ Class)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">1,838,820 $54,314,000^000</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Thus it is noted that upon capitalizing each of the three classes of “investors” we have a total capitalization of $75,364,000,000 made up of money capital, represented by plant, equipment, and working funds, equal to $18,900,000,-000, a figure tentatively established by the Interstate Commerce Commission under the 1920 Transportation Act; brains capital, represented by the executive class, comprising some 22,-873 general and division officers whose annual compensation averages $4,700, the equivalent of an income of 5 percent on $94,000; hence a total — of $2,150,000,000 worth of brains are invested — in the business and matched against the stockholders who have invested only money in the 2 enterprise; last, there is the brawn capital, represented by the worker class, under the leadership of the executives, comprising some 1,838,-820 employes whose average annual compensation is at present $1,485, equivalent to an income of 5 percent on $29,700 each; hence a total of $54,314,000,000 of brawn capital is matched against money and brains. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>z</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The above figures indicate the approximate total capitalized money, brains and energy invested in the American Class 1 railroads at present. Perhaps there is over-capitalization in one or more of the three classes represented; if 30, a means should be provided for reducing the total capital invested to an amount that can readily be absorbed by the business without saturation. There is no doubt but that some of our Class 1 Roads have more money capital than necessary, while others are suffering for a lack of money with which to get the properties in proper condition adequately to serve the public. Stock issues representing money capital should be called in and new stock issued in lieu thereof carrying a proviso that the corporation reserves the privilege at any time after one year from date on any dividend-paying date of cancelling same at $102, and accrued dividend, thus eliminating unnecessary money on which dividend must be earned. Likewise the “stock” issued representing brains and brawn should carry a proviso that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">at any </span><span class="font10">time necessary any employe could be dispensed with; his stock taken up and cancelled upon payment of $2 per share. Thus in times of business depression, when the demands upon transportation lag, the corporation can free itself of the liability for having to pay dividends on unnecessary capital represented by money, brains, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font10">effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CAPITALIZED BRAINS AND LABOR</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To illustrate the method of capitalizing the “Executive” and “Employe” classes let us consider one capable of earning the average compensation of each class on basis of present salary or. wage payments. There are approximately 22,873 officers whose average annual salary is $4,700,. which amount is equivalent to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font10">income of. 5 percent on $94,000. Hence each officer has invested in the business- executive &quot;&nbsp;ability of the same value as an investor who has- contributed $94,000. That officer then be-_ comes a. <sup>4</sup>‘stockholder” to that extent. Many corporations in the industrial, wo rid are organized along, lines, where part of the stockholders contributemoney, and others property, and still others real estate, all of which is capitalized on the basis of. the dollar value. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Why not brains or energy contributed!! A mechanic’s or- clerk’s energy may also be capitalized in like manner.. The average wage compensation paid employes is at present $1,485, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">equivalent of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">5 </span><span class="font10">percent on $29,700. There-</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">. fore-</span><span class="font10">that mechanic or clerk is contributing the equivalent of just that total dollar value of energy. It might be said that an average salary of $4,700 to an officer or $1,485 in wages to the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">average </span><span class="font10">employe is excessive, based on compensation for like service in other lines of business. Surely a superintendent or a machinist </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font10">economically worth more to a railroad than to a steel plant, shipyard, or shoe factory. Hence his capitalized value should be determined in accordance with a survey of return that same sort of ‘ ‘ Capital ’' would earn in comparable occupations in other lines of business. The United States Department of Labor could reasonably be entrusted with the duty of making a survey and cataloguing the intrinsic value of the several classes of railway executives and employes; or the Railway Labor Board could perform that function.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In event an “investor” in the employe class is-promoted within that class </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font10">into the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">officxadi </span><span class="font10">class, his stock certificates </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font10">increased to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">tow </span><span class="font10">amount represented, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">by his new classifications </span><span class="font10">To illustrate.: supposing Train </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Dispatcher </span><span class="font10">capitalized at $48^000 is promoted.to-become a» Assistant Superintendent capitalized, at </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">$6Q^r </span><span class="font10">000, he would receive non-transferable stock to * the extent of $12,000. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Likewise; whem an em- ■? </span><span class="font10">ploye for any reason is demoted, his- ffto&lt;ik </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font10">reduced accordingly. The question, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">might be? </span><span class="font10">asked as to how the various capitalized </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">values ? </span><span class="font10">are to be established: This is a proper j.ob for the United States Department of Labor, who .. with data at’hand as to the value of- such work in other lines of business, locality and cost </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of... </span><span class="font10">living taken into* consideration, could readily? determine the economic value of each' clhss </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of? </span><span class="font10">workers to be used as a basis' for determinism•&gt; the amount of “£tbek” each is entitled to-wks?) ceive as representative of his “ capital<sup>7</sup>’ </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">invest^ </span><span class="font10">ment;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With the capitalization of the carriers </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">reorM </span><span class="font10">ganized in accordance with the above, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">each clfese* </span><span class="font10">of “investors” would be compensated according to the investment each class bore </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to the-<sup>1</sup>? </span><span class="font10">total; distribution being made on-a single </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">per^ </span><span class="font10">centage basis. In other words, if the net eariS^ ings exclusive of all forms of compensation^? dividends, salaries and wages; after all<sup>1</sup> ex*? <sup>: </sup>penses and fixed charges had been met; equaled? 5 percent of the total capitalization then thenet<sup>1</sup> , amount due each' class would be distributed’</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">on’ </span><span class="font10">that basis. The detail of&quot; distriburion </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">will be* </span><span class="font10">taken up and illustrated under the head </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of? </span><span class="font10">“Distribution of Compensation” later on.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Under this heading we will now take up </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">method bf representation for each class of “Investors” in the management of the affairs: oft the corporation. In order that there may be </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a&lt; </span><span class="font10">proper community of interest in management; each class, money, brains, brawn, should </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">have* , </span><span class="font10">fair representation in management, as each class has an inherent right to a voice in tor &gt;&nbsp;conduct of the business. They are all partner® in the enterprise, working for the common good to produce a “commodity” called transportation, at the least possible cost commensurate with a first-class article and at the same time<sup>1</sup> ' make a profit that will afford a fair return to the investors, hence our organization </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">will ap</span><span class="font10">pear somewhat as follows;</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">From this, it is observed that each class of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">investors </span><span class="font10">is equally represented irrespective </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">the amount for which each class is capital</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ised. </span><span class="font10">No one class has an advantage over the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">others, </span><span class="font10">yet </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">combination of any two classes constitutes a majority.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Net </span><span class="font8">revenue subject to distribution______$3,904,402,762</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Thus it will be observed that after taking care of all operating expenses, including materials, supplies, maintenance repairs, depreciation, rents, taxes, and miscellaneous expenses, i there remain $3,904,402,762 to be distributed * among money, brains and brawn; but before a ; distribution is made, a sum equal to -J of 1 percent should be set aside in a sinking fund and&gt; invested outside of the business (such as the bonds of this and other governments, including states and muncipalities), from which may be drawn amounts sufficient to maintain a level of distribution during the lean years. Such a fund, improved by interest accretions and contributions until a sufficient amount had been accumulated to tide over three to five years depres- <sub>K </sub>sion, would eventually become a source of rev- . enuo, thus increasing the amount subject to distribution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On the basis of the above gross revenue the &quot;&nbsp;fund would amount to $31,127,013, which if compounded at 4 percent would in three years ' J amount to $35,013,654, and in five years to $37,876,664. which would be sufficient to maintain a return of 5 percent, even though the actual net revenue rendered a return of only 3| percent to 4 percent on total capitalization.' By this device, money, brains and brawn. contribute equally to the losses as well as dividing the profits arising from the conduct of the business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After taking care of the $31,127,013 contribution to the sinking fund, there would remain $3,873,275,749, the equivalent of approximately . 5.2 percent on the total capitalization of $75,- . 364,000,000. When distributed it would look like this: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MONEY CAPITAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">$18,900,000,000 at 5.2% equals_____________$ 971,350,380</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">$75,364,000,000 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$3,873,275,749</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On the above basis of distribution each of the 22.875 officers would receive on an average $4,830, and each of the 1,838,820 employes an average of $1,518 per annum, which, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in each </span><span class="font10">instance is in excess of the annual </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">return at ' </span><span class="font10">which they are respectively capitalized, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">from </span><span class="font10">which it is patent there is </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ample opportunity, </span><span class="font10">with higher efficiency, to increase the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Distribution tu money capital could be effect* * cd, as at present, in the form of quarterly dividends, 1| percent each quarter, but distribution to brains and brawn could be made on the basis of quarterly accounting as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Monthly advances against prospective dividends equal to 75%; one-third of say 75% of the quarterly paymeat; and thus afford funds with which to meet current living expenses; and at the end of the quarter the difference between the total of the three monthly advances and the total dividend due the officer or employ^ to be included in the third monthly cheek.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This might be illustrated in the following manner. .An employe whose capitalized value is - $29,700 would be entitled to a dividend on the basis of an annual return at 5.2% or $383.60 X* each quarter, but has already received three monthly advances of $85.00 each, a total of $255.00; hence there would be a balance of $138.60 due, making his third monthly check ‘ $223.00. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This method of distribution would also apply to the official class and would afford a convenient means of saving and, as opportunity presented, would also enable brains and brawn stockholders to acquire money stock and ultimately to gain financial as well as operating - control of the carriers to the limit of their ability purchase such stock in the open market and to pay for it</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">INCREASING EFFICIENCY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With money, brains and brawn properly capitalized into a three-cornered partnership, there - is every incentive, under the leadership of a board of directors in which each class of investors has representation, to carry out the dictates of the Transportation Act of Congress, by economically operating the carriers so as to earn the stipulated 5|% and even more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The stockholder who entrusts his money to brains and brawn has a right to expect that it will be utilized for the purpose of earning a return in which all three elements will participate to the largest possible extent. Hence brains and brawn must together cooperate with money in devising’ways and means of economically ... operating the property. While the directors rep-senting money on the board cannot participate directly in the operation of the roads, they can enter into The management and by advice and counsel work to accomplish the highest efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Inasmuch as approximately 60 percent of the carriers' gross revenue must </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be expended in. </span><span class="font10">compensation, it is through that channel </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">greatest opportunity for saving </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">presents itself | </span><span class="font10">&gt;&nbsp;yet the $2,084,000,000 expended </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">for materials, </span><span class="font10">supplies and maintenance, offers </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a prolific </span><span class="font10">source for the practice of economy. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">If 10 per-/, </span><span class="font10">cent can be cut from that bill, there will be </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">$208,-: </span><span class="font10">400,000 more added to the net amount </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">subject. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font10"> distribution among </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">money, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">brains and </span><span class="font10">brawn stockholders. This will hinder the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">graft* </span><span class="font10">arrangements now made by money directors;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With the employe class capitalized as. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">part</span><span class="font10">ners in the business there will be no need </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font10">overtime payments; the Adamson Law can ber-scrapped along with the working rules and regulations about which so much has been said^-J A “partner<sup>0</sup> is not interested in such things;!' in view of the fact that he wilT^articipate the net revenue. Likewise maximum train- </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and. </span><span class="font10">full crew laws, designed to create unnecessary &gt;&nbsp;jobs, would be abolished with a view to a </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font10">duction in the number of employes, thus </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">per</span><span class="font10">mitting the distribution of net revenue among </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">smaller number of stockholders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In 1916 the carriers handled 500 billion traf- ‘ fic units with 1,647,097 employes; while in </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">1920. <sub>v </sub></span><span class="font10">there were 589 billion traffic units handled, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">or<sup>4</sup>-<sup>-</sup></span><span class="font10">an increase of 17.8 percent. If the number ofi employes had been increased at the same ratio, the 589 billion units should have been handled<sup>1</sup>' with 1,942,280 employes, whereas 1,993,524 were 5 employed, It is therefore apparent that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">51,244’ </span><span class="font10">unnecessary employes were used. 51,244 ployes capitalized at $29,700 each represents total of $1,521,946,800. A return on that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">amount <sup>f </sup></span><span class="font10">of capital at 5.2 percent equals $79,141,233. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font10">is apparent that brawn would not be very </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">keen -</span><span class="font10">to maintain 51,244 unnecessary employes on the pay-roll when by eliminating them, more </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">than </span><span class="font10">79 million dollars would become available for distribution in dividends. In other words, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font10">is quite likely, a means would be found for handling an increase in traffic units with-a </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">fewer </span><span class="font10">number of employes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Personal efficiency would be stimulated under such an arrangement. Every officer </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and em</span><span class="font10">ploye with a knowledge of proprietorship </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">would </span><span class="font10">be prompted to bend every effort </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to the eco</span><span class="font10">nomical production of transportation to the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">end </span><span class="font10">that an increased compensation would </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">result. </span><span class="font10">The section crew tamping ties would see to ft that no drones were on the job, and it is doubt </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ful if there would be many kicks about pumping</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">the car out to the end of the section “on the company’s time”; likewise the freight crew would not be so keen to “double” a hill for the sake of overtime when they realized that the additional coal consumption cut their dividends. Then too, it is quite possible there would not be quite so many “hot boxes”, “leaky flues”, or “poor steamers” to add overtime. ■ In its final analysis there is not a shadow of doubt that the employe class would look at the proposition differently through the glasses of _ ownership when they were brought to a realisation that the maximum income is dependent on their highest efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The money stockholders would also suddenly develop a keener sense of efficiency in seeing to it that dividends were not being paid out of net earnings on unnecessary dollars in the business. It is quite likely that they would be right on the job devising ways and means for cutting out unnecessary expenditures in plant and equipment, to the end that a minimum amount <sup>z</sup> of “Capital” should be employed in the conduct of the affairs of the corporation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">„ Brains stockholders might be expected to “take stock” to ascertain if, perhaps, there might be a few too many “officers”. It is quite likely that a means might be found whereby the affairs of the company could not be more economically arranged. Surely, when the executive’s thought and energy is devoted to management, instead of spending h i s time in needless “wrangling matches” .with employes’ “business agents” over national working rules and agreements, etc., fewer executives would be necessary. Under present methods one out of every three executives’ time is spent, not in the constructive management of the property, but - in meeting with grievance committees. It is quite possible that the 22,573 members of the official class could be reduced to at least 17,500. which would release $534,962,000 worth of brains capital, which at 5.2 percent return would add $27,817,024 to the dividend fund; ' this, coupled with the $79,141,233 added by a reduction of employes, would make a total of $106,958,257 to be added to the dividend, bringing the 1920 figures up to $4,011,381,019, which would permit of a substantial reduction in rates and at the same time leave a division of net earnings equal to more than 5 percent on capitalized money, brains and brawn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW THE PUBLIC WOULD BENEFIT</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When the really efficient operation, as a result of reorganization under this plan, had become effective the capitalization scheme would look something like this: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Capitalization</span><span class="font8">$73,636,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Money 18,900,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Brains (17,500) &nbsp;1,645,000,000 Brawn (1,787,576) &nbsp;53,090,907,200 </span><span class="font10">This represents a reduction in capitalization of nearly two billion dollars on which a divi-<sup>x </sup>dend would not have to be paid, hence rates could be reduced without materially affecting a normal return to all three classes of investors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">, Taking 1920 figures as a basis the increased efficiency together with a reduction in rates </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font10">a stimulus to business the statement of revenue might be reasonably expected to look something like this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Gross Operating Revenue</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">1920 __$6,225,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Less 16.5% rate_______ 1,027,125,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">$5,197,875,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Plus 10% tonnage_____ 623,500,000 $5,820,375,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Operating expenses reduced 10%_____L- 2,088,900,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Net revenue exclusive of compenBation_ 8,731,475,000 Less 10% sinking fund 87,214,750</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Net amount subject to distribution_____$3,694,260,250</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Based on a capitalization of $73,636,000,000 the above net revenue subject to distribution is equivalent to a return of a fraction over 5 percent. Thus if rates were reduced 16.5 percent, which is the average of one-half of the increases granted in “Ex Parte 74”, and traffic units increased but 10 percent the gross revenue would be sufficient to care for operating and maintenance expenses reduced 10 percent from 1920 figures. Owing to decreased costs of materials and supplies, the net divisible revenue would equal an amount that would afford a return within approximately one-tenth of one percent of the return figured on the basis of 1920 totals. Therefore the public could enjoy a material reduction in rates; and money, brains and brawn would still earn a return on its capitalized value at the rate of 5 percent which no one will deny is a fair return on such investments. This plan adopted in all industries would result in such a reduction in prices as to correspondingly increase the buying power of the wages paid to everybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THE PLAN AND CONSOLIDATION OF CARRIERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font10">Interstate Commerce Commission has, in its Docket No. 12,964, promulgated a tentative plan under the Transportation Act whereby the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">carriers can </span><span class="font10">be consolidated into nineteen sys</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">tems. If </span><span class="font10">in the consolidation scheme each of the nineteen systems were to be recognized under Federal Charters and capitalized in accordance With this plan a means would be provided for accomplishing the desired result. The writer has made tentative calculations in connection with one of the proposed systems, using figures taken from recent reports, and finds </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font10">it would be perfectly feasible to incorpor</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ate this </span><span class="font10">idea into such a consolidation. If the consolidation of our carriers into a limited number of systems as proposed would effect such economics as Congress believed would follow such consolidations, then it is a foregone conclusion that still further savings would follow combining this plan with any plan for </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">con</span><span class="font10">solidating the carriers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">conclusion &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The writer hopes that the foregoing has </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">been </span><span class="font10">sufficient to stimulate thinking minds to cob-sider this plan seriously as an avenue for </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">es</span><span class="font10">cape from the troubles of past and present </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">that the seeds for thought thus planted </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">may </span><span class="font10">germinate into and give birth to an Idea </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">thaT </span><span class="font10">can become the means of solving the ridffli<sup>1</sup>; Constructive criticism is courted, to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the end^ </span><span class="font10">that we may together work out a </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">practical • </span><span class="font10">scheme that will forever still the strife </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">betweea/ </span><span class="font10">so-called Capital and Labor as far </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">as transpor</span><span class="font10">tation is concerned and thus fulfill the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">prophecy </span><span class="font10">that the lion and the lamb shall lie down </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to</span><span class="font10">gether.

I was the</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">first-born of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">young married couple; </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">unless I </span><span class="font10">am entirely ignorant, I Was flesh of their </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">flesh </span><span class="font10">and bone of their bone; their blood was </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">my </span><span class="font10">blood. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;....</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Less than two years afterward another </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">child was </span><span class="font10">born to them. As I </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">see </span><span class="font10">it, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font10">two </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">children </span><span class="font10">are of our parents’ flesh and blood. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">We two </span><span class="font10">children sprang from the same source; </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and as </span><span class="font10">I see it, we had about the same constitution, physically, to begin with. Both children </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">grew </span><span class="font10">and started off well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When both children were yet under </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">twelve </span><span class="font10">years of age, a smallpox epidemic broke </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">out </span><span class="font10">and both of these children were </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">vaccinated </span><span class="font10">against smallpox on the same day.

But getting back to these two </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">children of whom </span><span class="font10">the writer is one, neither one of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">these </span><span class="font10">two children took the smallpox, the one </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font10">the vaccination failed to take effect on has </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">grown </span><span class="font10">into </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">beautiful human being. If this </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">one </span><span class="font10">cared to do so, I beEeve she could sit as a model for symmetry of form, beauty of face, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">fine </span><span class="font10">teeth, perfect complexion, strong, forceful, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">enjoys </span><span class="font10">living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">; . The one </span><span class="font10">that became inoculated with the virus soon began to develop weakness (diseases) the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">face </span><span class="font10">looks sallow, the countenance sad, the teeth </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font10">practically all rotted out, and is tortured </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font10">^frightful skin troubles^—</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">bones are not sound, deformity exists in joints and several other places; this one has been to famous health resorts, is a weakling and has often prayed to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">die </span><span class="font10">in order to be out of pain and suffering. Medical men say “Incurable”, and yet this suffering one believes if the medical man had </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">not </span><span class="font10">' injected this virus into the blood stream, this </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">suffering </span><span class="font10">one would have developed in health </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font10">the other one did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Debt-Paying That Would Be Ruinous</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">W</span><span class="font10">HEN the war debts of the Allies to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">_ ..United States were incurred, there was no money sent to them from this country, for which ' they became in debt to this country. What was </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">sent </span><span class="font10">was manufactured products or raw mater</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ials </span><span class="font10">made or produced in the United States. These goods were sent to Europe after being made here. In return the United States did not receive money, but promises to pay or simple acknowledgements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The process of getting into debt consisted of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">passing of goods from the United States </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">the Allies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font10">is obvious that the payment of the debts </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">must </span><span class="font10">be the reverse process of the passing of . goods from the Allies.to the </span><span class="font8">United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The United States has more than half of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">gold </span><span class="font10">stock of the world; and as the supply of gold outside of the United States is only a fraction of the eleven billions of debt, it is obvious that the debt cannot be paid in gold. Gold is the official international material of exchange, /■ilver and other metals being only commodities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Since the debt can never be paid in gold, it must be paid in goods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To reverse the debt process means that goods must be-manufactured by the Allies and sent to the United States in return for which the </span><span class="font9">United States </span><span class="font10">would send back receipts </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">reduc</span><span class="font10">ing the indebtedness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If the debt is eleven billion dollars and the interest rate is live percent the annual interest is $550,000,000. This must be paid annually, but this vast payment will not reduce the debt. For the debt to be liquidated in, say twenty years,, will require roughly the annual payment of $500,000,000. This plus the interest roughly totals an annual payment of $1,000,000,000 a year, increasing the capital payment as the amount of interest decreases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Thus the United States will be enriched by a billion a year of goods without paying a cent in Return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Happy prospect! Something for nothing!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But no matter what goods may be sent to us, nothing must be manufactured and returned. . This means that much less manufactured by </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font10">erican workers than under normal conditions of international trade. It signifies that a cool billion is the amount of reduction that must be made in the volume of American mills, fac-' tories, mines, and farms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Someone will have to decide what~kind of goods shall be received from the Allies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Shall it be farm products? Then the American farmers must be content to sell a billion -dollars less of farm products a year; for that volume of farm products will flow into the country without being paid for, and will come into competition with American farm products. There will be an-enormous oversupply of farm products, a glut of the market, and a ruinous drop in the price. How will the American farmer like a further drop of perhaps a quarter or a third from the present low prices? The American farmer would be under the necessity of uttering an emphatic political “no!” to the administration that would for twenty-two years practically destroy the farmer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Shall it be copper? The copper mines will shut down for twenty-two years, and a great and profitable industry be destroyed for a generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Let it be textiles. Then for twenty-two years the textile mills of New England and the South must shut down, and the machinery rust, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">until </span><span class="font10">the textile industry is obliterated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then it shall be iron and steel. But what would the United States Steel Corporation and . the independent producers say to the glutting of the American market with foreign iron and steel?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Automobiles? Then lor two decades grass must grow in the streets of Detroit and other motor vehicle-producing localities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What industry and what class of labor is willing to make the supreme sacrifice of its all— for two decades or so—in order that the Allies may pay their debts?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">/Who will stay out of a job in order that the Allies may have work manufacturing things to send to America to pay those debts?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And echo answers, “Who?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Is Knowledge Power? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b?</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> John Diww&amp;n</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">WHEN Lord Bacon made the statement that “knowledge is power” he did not know that it was to be the inspirational stumbling-block of every generation that should come after.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The best up-to-date dictionary gives the definition of wisdom as &quot;the right use and exercise ■of knowledge”. The Wise Man in his Proverbs says: ‘&quot;Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: she crieth injhe chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates; in the city she uttereth her words, saying, How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity! and the scorners delight in their scorning, and' fools hate knowledge?”—Proverbs 1:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">How does wisdom cry without, in the- streets and in the chief places of concourse? The answer is this: Every individual is in the school of experience. Let every individual see to it that he makes a right use and exercise of his knowledge and experience. How? Get rich? Piffle! Acquire poyer? More piffle! Get an education? Stop and think.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The same wise man said: “In much wisdom is there much grief; and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow’”. (Ecclesiastes 1: 18) Now how should there be much grief in much wisdom, and an increase of sorrow in an increase of knowledge? The fact is this: Every individual carries a responsibility for the right use and exercise of his knowledge. &quot;You should know better” is a phrase which every boy and girl has heard. Every man who does his best to exercise his knowledge aright observes the silly foolishness, the emptiness, and the vanity of the passing show. The more knowledge a person acquires, the greater his responsibility. The mod</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ern educator, teacher, and preacher carries more </span><span class="font10">responsibility than any </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">other class. Upon th# </span><span class="font10">modern educator, teacher, and preacher, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">rests </span><span class="font10">the decision whether anarchy shall come to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Am</span><span class="font10">erica as it has come to Russia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The desire of individuals, communities, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and: </span><span class="font10">nations to get rich and powerful has </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">brought </span><span class="font10">the world to ruin; one-half of the world </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">tried tn;: </span><span class="font10">destroy the other half. The present generation;' has an advantage over all preceding generation# in that it has at its disposal the sum </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of all th# ' </span><span class="font10">knowledge and experience of all the generation#/ past But the wrong use and exercise of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">thi# </span><span class="font10">knowledge has brought about this world-wid# ruin, desolation and despair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Inuring the last hundred years.knowledge </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ha# </span><span class="font10">increased at a rate and to an extent that Lor£ <sup>: </sup>Bacon never dreamed of. It is </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">also an interest-: </span><span class="font10">ing fact that this great increase of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">knowledge&quot; </span><span class="font10">has come only to those nations and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">peoples'; </span><span class="font10">which had the Bible in their midst, whether </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">they </span><span class="font10">believed it or not. The presence in their </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">midst </span><span class="font10">of a small section who believed the Bible </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">had faith in its teachings is the salt which </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ha# </span><span class="font10">preserved these nations so long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">China, India, Central Africa, and other </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">coun</span><span class="font10">tries of similar character have had no part </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font10">the increase and dissemination of knowledge. .They have rather been the prey of the so-called: civilized nations that had their own fierce </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">inter</span><span class="font10">national squabbles over the exploitation </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">partition of those heathen (?) nations that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">did </span><span class="font10">not have such a wealth of information* </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">This </span><span class="font10">fact in itself would have been a comedy </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">if it </span><span class="font10">had not been so tragic—just like taking </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">candy </span><span class="font10">from a baby. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Five, six, seven years ago, the nations of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">world on both sides of the conflict called </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to</span><span class="font10">gether their wise men, scholars, thinkers, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">sci</span><span class="font10">entists, inventors, and writers, and instructed them to apply all the knowledge they </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">had at </span><span class="font10">their disposal, i. e.. the sum of all the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">knowledge </span><span class="font10">and experience of the ages—for the one purpoa# of destruction. Such was the great international conflict, which has now given place to an </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">internal </span><span class="font10">conflict — class against class, capital </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">against </span><span class="font10">labor, labor against capital; and those sam# wise men, scholars and thinkers, scientists^ </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in</span><span class="font10">ventors, and writers, are puzzled to know </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">which </span><span class="font10">is the worse, au international conflict of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">nation </span><span class="font10">against nation, or an infernal conflict — </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">claa# </span><span class="font10">against class, capital against labor, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">labor </span><span class="font10">against capital, civil wars and revolutions; </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in effect, every man’s hand against his neighbor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I venture to suggest that if knowledge should increase during the * next twenty years at the rate and to the extent that it has during the last </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">twenty years, and </span><span class="font10">that if the fierce struggle </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font10">supremacy and dominion—individual, communistic, and national — keep pace with the in</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">crease </span><span class="font10">of knowledge, even allowing that this generation has the advantage of the sum of all </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">knowledge and experience of all past generations, before the twenty years have expired </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">human race will go out of existence. So fierce will be the struggle that the race will destroy itself. &quot;Except these days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved.”—Matt. 24: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Is knowledge power? Is there wisdom in riches? “Wisdom is the principal thing: therefore get wisdom, and with all thy getting get understanding.” (Proverbs 4:7) “Get wisdom, get understanding ; forget it not. . . .

<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font10">HE city dweller in baby innocence sings the ballad, “Back to the Farm”. But the veteran of the soil shouts out, “Away from the Land!” Not only the rising proportion of town and city population, but new data from the Department of Commerce show the drift from the discouragements and impossibilities of farming into the cities and their trades.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Considering the 13 percent increase in total population from 1910 to 1920, the number of persons engaged in “agriculture, forestry and - ahimal husbandry”, should have risen from the ' 12,659,082 of 1910 to 13 percent more, or 14,-304,76Z</span></p>

Prices of farm products were </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">set </span><span class="font10">by </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">city^ </span><span class="font10">men who controlled the city market, and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">prices of things made in the city were raised^ so that, as it became increasingly harder </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">make </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">living in the country, men and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">women </span><span class="font10">fled from farm to city in an ever rising </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">tide. </span><span class="font10">From 1910 to 1920 the population increased </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">13 </span><span class="font10">percent and the number on the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">farm decreased </span><span class="font10">15 percent Everything is going against </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">farm; and it is getting worse and worse, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">as the </span><span class="font10">city merchant is replaced by </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the unscrupulous </span><span class="font10">profiteer fearing neither God, man, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the courts, </span><span class="font10">nor the devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Under human selfishness it is difficult to figure out a better system than this imporfeet one. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font10">Russia, now Socialist, the farmers who had been expected altruistically to produce enough _ for themselves and plenty for the city, simply lay down, refused to raise more than they needed themselves, and would not send food to the cities, claiming that the cities had nothing to give them in return. It was impossible to co</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">erce </span><span class="font10">scores of millions of farmers each living </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in an </span><span class="font10">isolated position, and so Russia has had to return to a modified form of the old economic system. American farmers are not any more Jfond of giving up their produce for nothing than are the Russians. The new scheme has not Worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A new system is urgently needed, or the people will starve. Nothing can now succeed except an order of things where people really care </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">For </span><span class="font10">one another, where the Golden Rule is the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">law and </span><span class="font10">where love prevails among human be</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ings </span><span class="font10">so that country and city people will help </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">one </span><span class="font10">another. In other words, the actual Christ</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ianizing </span><span class="font10">of the social order is imperative simply </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font10">there may be food to eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Only the promised kingdom of God will bring </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">order </span><span class="font10">out of the impending chaos. That, thank </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">God, </span><span class="font10">is almost here. Its beginnings may be expected by 1925.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">HIS is the expressive headline in a British newspaper about the torpedoing of the Disarmament Conference by Premier Briand of France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">M. Briand said categorically and emphatically that France would positively not reduce her land armaments. “France ” he said, “has already cut down her army to the extreme limit *iof national safety. France would not abide any Hietation as to the size of her army, being con-jrincdd that force is needed in face of the Ger</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">man </span><span class="font10">and Russian menaces.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;That,” comments the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Herald</span><span class="font8"> of London, &quot;is precise and unmistakable. It blows sky-high Mr. Lloyd George’s New Jerusalem.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">’ &quot;There is to be no land disarmament, no limitation bf armies? If France will not, no .other European nation dare disarm- Germany will inevitably begin to arm anew. Even Soviet Russia will not dare disband her Bed army. The old mad competition begins anew. Con-fpriptinn stays. And if France will not limit her army. dare Great Britain limit her navy? The Straits are narrow. The Entente already a dffbioua patch-work thing* there is no ‘sure shield’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;Not much hope of even a REDUCTION. Of gennina disarmament, of a world-peace compact, not the vestige of the shadow of the ghost of a chance. Just read M. -Briand’s words again. And then consider how silly, iflj Mr. Lloyd’s George’s millennium chatter.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For the first.time since Napoleon </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Bonapartef </span><span class="font10">France has an army able to sweep its.</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">way? </span><span class="font10">throughout the whole of Europe.

Big armies are not made </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to? </span><span class="font10">keep but to use. At the bottom of French perial dreams are three factors: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>;</sup></span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. The militarists, headed </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">by Marshal Foch.'</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10">This is the same unholy trinity that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">affects? </span><span class="font10">America, the same kind of crew that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">plunged </span><span class="font10">Germany into war/ the same that controls </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Brit-? </span><span class="font10">ish policies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If America disarms and France does </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">not,? </span><span class="font10">then England cannot, and Japan will not <sup>Rn</sup>y-? way.

<p><span class="font10">This is not the beating of swords and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">spears; </span><span class="font10">into plowshares and pruning hooks. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">At best </span><span class="font10">is </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">counterfeit designed to establish the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">more? </span><span class="font10">strongly the powerful governments of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Old </span><span class="font10">World.

<p><span class="font10">The Disarmament is not a crisis, but </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">it pre- ’ </span><span class="font10">cipitates </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">crisis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Concerning the Japanese menace to world peace General Sir Jan Hamilton said before the London Press Club:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“If you are going to block up the safety-valve of the “ Japanese, put on your gas-masks. Better let the Japanese have the whole of China than have another-war. It . comes to this: If by any mischance we [British] were to have trouble with Japan, they know quite well that they could take Hong Kong and the Philippines and that it would take a long time to get them out.” </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;A </span><span class="font8">smoking concert in a powder magazine,&quot; was Sir Jan’s final reference to the Disarmament Conference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Both Japan and America border on the Pacific. No stone wall can be run from Behring Straits to the Antarctic to delimitate spheres of influence. Both want to control Pacific policies and the sleeping giant of China. Only one can. It is a commercial and industrial difference, and that is the sort of rivalry out of which are born the horrors of war. For Big Business in Yokohama and Big Business in Wall Street are covetous of the same thing. Both control armies, navies and air fleets, and at the proper moment one is going to launch the thunderbolt at the other. It will be done for the “honor” of the nation or for “law and order”. Which will do it first!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">America wants a free hand commercially in China, the freeing of “the heart of China”— Shantung—from Japanese control, the abrogation of the Chino-Japanese treaty of 1915 extorted f born an unwilling China while her European protectors were slaughtering one another, the abolishment of all alien spheres of influence, and the open door for equal trade opportunities for all nations. Wall Street would prefer an ’ exclusive sphere of influence in China, but for policy’s sake hypocritically pretends to want it for all</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Japan is after the real thing—to get more and to keep what she has. She intends to keep China’s heart in her mailed fist—Shantung— with a protectorate over Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia, controlling China from the north and east and holding all of North China tightly. In the center of China the demand is only for a grip on the carotid artery, the Yang-tse-Kiang valley, and in the south, as a beginning, territorial rights in Fukien, opposite Formosa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The fact is that it is believed in well-informed non-imperialist British circles that an arrangement has long existed between Japan and England for Japan to have North China and Britain South China, the latter welded to India in </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">vast empire. Japan is open in expressing her desires. England is after her part, but diplomatically cannot publish her aims yet. The Disarmament Conference was to be utilized to advance rihtional. interests to get all they can ~ grab, so far as China is concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">So doth the dove of Peace hover over Washington.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>War Profiteers Now Safe .</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">O</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">N</span><span class="font10"> THE sea there is a three-mile </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">limi</span><span class="font10">t beyond which *‘hootch” pirates are safe, and on land there is a three-year limit beyond which the land pirates are safe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The three-year land limit expired on Armistice Day, November 11, 1921, three years after the end of hostilities in 1918. The federal law against profiteering carried a three-year statute of limitations, during which the war profiteers might be prosecuted criminally for their crimes against the United States, but after which they might enjoy their ill-gotten gains in peace and plenty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The three years are up. Peace reigns in the profiteering camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">How did the profiteers escape proper attention during the three years!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">How does a naval fleet escape the view of the enemy? By a smoke screen. How does an army escape the attention of the airplane spies! By camouflage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The profiteers kept up a persistent smoke screen as long as such a defense was needed. They kept attention off themselves by keeping it on some one else. They controlled the press and the secret service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">First, were the “pro-Germans”. The eyes of the American citizenry were kept looking for mysterious “pro-Germans”, of whom Federal judges and attorneys now frankly say that there were practically none.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then the “disloyalists” came in for their turn of public attention.' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Next the public were trained to look for “reds”, of whom there are practically none of a dangerous variety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Afterward came the<sup>u</sup>seditionists<sup>,,,</sup>,and many a State passed laws to catch the menace to public peace who might think differently from Big Business or Big Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the nick of time came the election for President; and in the hullabaloo over politics the profiteers were again forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Last of all came the Disarmament Conference. The lion pulled on a sheepskin, and the wolf the pelt of a lamb. The militarists became pacifists—except Briand and the Japanese who told what they thought, or dissembled their thoughts until out of the spot-light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And in the midst of the preliminary fervor about utter disarmament, then limited disarmament and finally no disarmament for France— 0 happy, blessed hour—came Armistice Day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The statute of limitation had run its course. The smoke screens had worked. The profiteers were free from fear of jail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The situation is put plainly in the Minneapolis </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span><span class="font10"> for November 18:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“War-time profiteers, crooks and sharpers who defrauded the government of millions of dollars in connection with war construction and supplies, unless they already have been indicted or convicted, will face no prosecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“They are as free from any criminal action as though they had been tried and acquitted. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“They may later find themselves defendants in suits brought b.y the Government to recover money paid on fraudulent deals or illegal contracts, but these can be only'civil suits which will put no one behind prison bars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Expiration of the three-year limit, within which any criminal action, not capital, must be instituted, has shut </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">the door to prosecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Except perhaps in a few scattering cases in which frauds against the Government were committed in adjusting war contracts following the signing of the armistice, the Government, fey </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">inaction,</span><span class="font8"> has forfeited its right to prosecute and punish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The Department of Justice will not give out any estimate as to the number of cases in which immunity </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font8">bestowed because of the inactivity of that Department in beginning prosecution. - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The Special Committee of Congress which investigated war expenditures, reported that ‘in the judgment of the Committee enough irregularities and fraudulent practices have been uncovered’ to warrant prompt and rigorous prosecution in scores of cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“In the construction of army camps alone the Committee declared, there had been leakage of approximately $80,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Many expenditures, the report declares ‘were obviously tainted with fraud’.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When the Shipping-Board investigation was made it was estimated that the number of persons probably guilty of offenses worthy of prosecution ran up to some 2,400. The waste, fraud and stealings ran to the incredible sum of $2,000,000,000, and later on it was asserted by a new head of the Shipping Board that practically all of the $4,000,000,000 put into Shipping Board operations was a loss. It was pronounced the most stupendous wreck ever known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the army there is little doubt that the needless losses to the American peqple ran to the enormous figure of<sup>7</sup> several times those of the Shipping Board.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Why was no one prosecuted effectually?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Why </span><span class="font10">was there a universal whitewash?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Because the trail ran straight to the door of Big Business and to the door of the White House.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Big Business has gained many “brethren” through the war profiteering. The number of millionaries has leaped from 20,000 to over 50,; 000. War profiteering is now a family matter. It is the skeleton in the Big Business closet., -</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But will the farmer-labor movement about to ' seat its men in legislatures, in mayorships, in governorships, in Congress, perhaps in the Cah-. ■ inet and even in the Presidential Chair, be as ready to let this odorous cadaver rest in peace as the profiteers hope they will? ’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">No. For the profiteers, for this unholy brood -of a New Rich of a ghastly species—hands and arms still dripping with the blood of boys &lt;3bn&lt;? secrated to death in stinking trenches, whil$-they reveled in perfumed apartments—for them', are destined stormy, dreadful days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Not for nothing has the Divine Decree gone out against all oppressors: “These be days of/ vengeance”. Not merely worked out in mys- : terious invisible ways, but Divine Vengeance,' wrought through the persons of trodden and <sup>1 </sup>desperate human beings, little brothers of the/ rich, idle by millions, hungry, waiting for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">the. </span><span class="font10">next voting-time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is a remedy. If the 50,000 </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font10">erican millionaires, the real rulers of the nation&lt;will heed such a kindly warning as this, and utilize i their vast abilities in behalf of the common peo-&lt; pie, and act toward all as toward beloved broth-, i <sup>z</sup>ers, there will be no Divine Vengeance, but the / inauguration of the Golden Age. On the heels of Prosperity will follow Love, the love of man &lt;&nbsp;for man. All differences will be forgotten in a . new brotherhood. The kingdom of God will have come through those having the means and the power to lead the world to its better things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But the same Bible that foreshadows and foretells many things, also declares that these . twentieth-century oppressors of the poor will not change their ways even though there be shown them the evil and the peril o^rfheir way, the divine remedy, and the frightful consequences of any other course than that which God has shown to be the right one. Would that the world’s leaders might heed! We but do our plain duty in bringing such matters to their attention. The outcome lies with the men of power. The decision lies with Big Business whether it will take the path of life or the way of suicide.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Advanced and Juvenile Bible Studies which have been hitherto published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">STRING i: CREATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">TP HE subject of creation here treated relates -*• particularly to the earth and the creatures of the earth, the chief one of which is man. We will not attempt to discuss at length the creation of other planets, nor of the other creatures. Attention is merely called to the Scriptural statement that the beginning of God’s creation was the Logos, which term is translated in our Bibles “the Word”. The record reads: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with [the] God and the Word was [a] god”. (John 1:1) God is a name applied to Jehovah, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">thtf' </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">Almi</span><span class="font10">ghty One. It is sometimes applied to other mighty ones also ; whereas the name Jehovah applies exclusively to the great eternal God. The Logos, the Word, was a god, a mighty one. “ The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him, and without him . was not anything made that was made.” He was Jehovah’s great active agent in the creation, of all things created.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&quot;Since the Bible was written for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">man’s</span><span class="font10"> benefit, the Genesis account of creation has to do with man and his place of habitation. There we read: “In the beginning God created the heav-. ens and the earth”. He created the sun, for light by day; and the moon, for light by night, upon the earth. God then created the birds and fowls that fly through the air, and the fish of the sea. He created the cattle and the creeping things, and all the beasts of the earth. All this was before the creation of man. He had formed the earth many centuries before man's creation, and He created it that man might have a place to live. He caused His prophet to write: “I have made the earth and created man upon it. For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited.”— Isaiah 45:12, 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>v</sup> &quot;God Cheated the first man and woman out of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">elements and gave them power to produce </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">bring forth children, and all the human </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">race </span><span class="font10">sprang from the first pair. God was the Father and the earth the mother of Adam. The first man was named Adam; the first woman, . Eve. “God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multi-' ply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.”—Genesis 1:27, 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>81</sup>We are all interested in knowing how Jehovah created the first man, Adam. “And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.” (Genesis 2:7) ' God did not give man a soul separate and distinct from the man. The word soul means being living, breathing creature. Every man </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font10"> a soul. . No man </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">has</span><span class="font10"> a soul. Every living creature is a soul. God called all moving creatures that have life souls. (See Genesis 1:20, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font10"> He Xies-ignates various animals as souls. — Numbers 21:28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>82</sup>Jehovah then made a beautiful home for man, which is designated in the Bible as Eden —a garden, a beautiful park. Everything in Eden was perfect, because all the works of Jehovah are perfect. (Deuteronomy 32:4) “ And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it”—Genesis 2: 8, 9,15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">”God next gave to man a law to govern him. He told him what he might do and what he might not do; and informed him that violation of this law would bring death upon him. “And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">day that thou </span><span class="font10">eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.”—Genesis 2:16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“God then created Eve to be a helpmate or companion to Adam. (Genesis 22:21-25) If Adam and Eve had been obedient to Jehovah </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">j at </span><span class="font10">all times, there would have been no sickness, ; Borrow, nor death amongst the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&quot;In the&quot;Scriptures Jesus, the Logos, is designated as “the bright and morning star”. (Revelation 22:16) He at all times was and is , the joy and delight of the heavenly Father, Jehovah. A star is used to symbolize a heavenly creature. The morning star is the most honored one in all the divine realm, Jehovah alone ex-, oepted. Other heavenly creatures are designat</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ed </span><span class="font10">as stars. *</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">••Many times you have heard the question asked, Who made the devil, Satan, the evil one?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>1</sup> The correct answer is, He was not always the , devil or Satan. He was created a perfect and beautiful creature. He was also designated a star of heaven. His original name was Lucifer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">' The </span><span class="font10">prophet Ezekiel says of him that he was “the anointed cherub that covereth”, which Beems to indicate that he had authority over some others. Continuing, the Prophet records: ‘ “Thou wast upon the holy mountain of God;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.” (Ezekiel 28:14, 15) He is described as a beautiful creature. Thus the Prophet speaks of him: “Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created”.—Ezekiel 28:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>S7</sup>Other angelic hosts in heaven are designated the sons of God. When God created the earth, laying its foundations as a habitation for man, when He created these beautiful earthly creatures upon the earth, these two great -stars of heaven sang together a song of gladness, and the angelic sons of God shouted for joy. (Job 38:4-7) Jt appears that at that time all the ■ ■ creatures^ of Jehovah Were in harmony with Him and obedient to Him, and of course they would watch the creation develop; and when the highest earthly creatures were made, perfect man and perfect woman, endowed with the</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">attributes of wisdom, justice, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">love, and power,' </span><span class="font10">made in the image and likeness </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of Jehovah, </span><span class="font10">there was great joy in heaven. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Hence the occa</span><span class="font10">sion for the song and shouting by </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the heavenly.; </span><span class="font10">hosts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. ... y.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">THIS JOURNAL AND ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">mKTS </span><span class="font6">journal Is one </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">the prime factors or instruments in the system of Bible instruction, or “Seminary Extension”, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">now being </span><span class="font6">A prcsenled in all parts of the civilized world by the Watch Towek Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, chartered A. D. 3SS4, &quot;For the Promotion of Christian Knowledge&quot;. It not only serves as a class room where Bible students may meet in the study of the divine Word but also ns a channel of communication through which they may be reached with announcements of the Society’s conventions and of the coming of its traveling representatives, styled “Pilgrims”, and refreshed with reports of its conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our “T’.erean Lessons&quot; are topical rehearsals or reviews of our Society's published Studies most entertainingly arranged, and very helpful to all ttho would merit the only honorary degree which the Society accords, viz., </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Verbi Dei Minister</span><span class="font6"> (V. D. M.), which translated into English is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Minister of Cod’s</span><span class="font6"> Wot</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">d.</span><span class="font6"> Our treatment of the International Sunday School Lessons is specially for the older Bible students and teachers. By some this feature is considered indispensable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This journal stands firmly for the defense of the only true foundation of the Christian’s hope now being so generally repudiated —redemption through the precious blood of “the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ransom</span><span class="font6"> [a corresponding price, a substitute] for all”. (1 Peter 1: 19 ; 1 Timothy 2 : G) Building up on this sure foundation the gold, silver and precious stones (1 Corinthians 3: 1115; 2 Peter 1:5-11) of the Word of God, its further mission is to “make all see what is the fellowship of the mystery which. . .has been Ind in God, ... to the intent that now might be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of God”—“which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed”.—Ephesians 3: 5-9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It stands free from all parties, sects and creeds of men, while it seeks more and more to bring its every utterance into fullest subjection to the will of God in Christ, as expressed in the holy Scriptures. It is thus free to declare boldly whatsoever the Lord hath spoken—according to the divine wisdom granted unto us to understand his utterances. Its attitude is not dogmatic, but confident; for we know whereof we alhrm, treading with implicit faith upon the sure promises of God. it is held as a trust, to be used only in his service; hence our decisions relative to what may and what may not appear in its columns must be according to our judgment of his good pleasure, the teaching of his Word, for the upbuilding of his people in grace and knowledge. And we not only invite but urge oui; readers to prove all its utterances </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font6">the infallible Word to which reference is constantly made to facilitate such testing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the church is “the temple of the living God”, peculiarly “his workmanship” ; that its construction has been in progress throughout the gospel age—ever since Christ became the world’s Redeemer and the Chief Corner Stone of his temple, through which, when finished, God’s blessing shall come “to all people , and they find access to him.—1 Corinthians 3:16, 17; Ephesians 2:20-22 ; Genesis 23:14; Galatians 3:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That meantime the chiseling, shaping, and polishing of consecrated believers in Christ’s atonement for sin, progresses ; and when th© last of these &quot;living stones”, &quot;elect and precious,” shall have been made ready, the great Master Workman will bring all together in the first resurrection ; and the temple shall be filled with his glory, and be the meeting place between God and men throughout the Millennium.—Revelation 15:5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the basis of hope, for the church and the world, lies In the fact that &quot;Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">every </span><span class="font6">man,” “a ransom for all,” and will be &quot;the true light which lighteth </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">every man that cometh into the world”,</span><span class="font6"> &quot;in due time”*— Hebrews 2:9; John 1:9; 1 Timothy 2:5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the hope of the church is that she may be like her Lord, “see him as he is,” be ‘partaker of the divine nature,’ and share big glory as his joint-heir.—1 John 3:2; John 17:24; Romans 8:17; 2 Peter 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That tlie present mission of the church is the perfecting of the saints for the future work of service; to develop in herself every grace; to be God’s witness to the world; and to prepare to be kings and priests in the next age.—Ephesians 4:12; Matthew 24: 14 ; Revelation 1:6; 20 : 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the hope for the world lies in the blessings of knowledge and opportunity to be brought to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font6"> by Christ’s Millennial kingdom, th© restitution of all that was lost in Adam, to all the willing and obedient, at the bands of their Redeemer and his glorified church* when all the wilfully wicked will be </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">destroyed.—</span><span class="font6">Acts 3:19-23; Isaiah 35.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PUBLIC MEETINGS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Complaint has been made that newspapers distort the advertisement for public meetings in various places, not giving the time and place. This is probably often due to carelessness on the part of the advertising committee. In every instance the advertising committee should not only carefully prepare copy and hand it to the advertising department of the paper, but also ask for a proof before it is published, and see that it is correct before it is published. Often the friends merely notify the press that they expect to have a meeting at a certain time, and then depend upon the newspaper man 1o write the advertisement. This should not be done. Where copy is supplied, you will be justified in paying only when the advertisement complies with the copy furnished.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark5"></a>ANNUAL REPORT FOR 1922</span></h4>
<div>
<p><span class="font17">P</span><span class="font9">URSUANT to the provision made by the charter and the by-laws of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, the annual meeting was convened at Carnegie Hall, North Side, Pittsburgh, at 10:00 o’clock Tuesday morning, October 31. After devotional services conducted by Brother C. H. Stewart, the meeting was called to order and reports were made by the President of the Society and the Treasurer for the year past; namely, from October 1,1921, to October 1, 1922. There being no particular business to be conducted at this meeting except the reports, after both reports had been given motion was duly made and seconded that the reports be received with many thanks and appreciation for the Lord’s blessing bestowed upon his people during the year past. The motion was unanimously carried. We set out the report as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Following the custom of the Society long ago established by Brother Russell, we publish an annual report of the activities of the Society for the fiscal year ending October 31. This report was made at the annual meeting held at Pittsburgh, October 31, in harmony with the charter, the laws of the land and the notice given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This report is not for the benefit of our enemies or opposers, but for the encouragement of those who are honestly endeavoring to further the cause of our Lord and Master. Not every detailed transaction of the So-cietv is published, because that is exactly what our enemies for years tried to force out of Brother Russell. Of course neither the law nor the charter requires the publication of a report, but Brother Russell always thought it wise and for the encouragement of the brethren to give a general review, and we arc glad to follow his lead. While the details of every transaction are not put into print, at the same time the books of the Association are open at all times for the inspection of any member of the Society, that he or she may see at any time that all matters and transactions of the Society in detail are entirely proper and in order. We publish the amount contributed for the work and the way in which that sum is generally spent. For every cent of it, however, even to a postage stamp, there is an account upon the books, and nothing is paid out except on proper voucher; but to set out these transactions in detail would require a large book. The way established by Brother Russell seems to be wise and to h?.ve had the Lord’s approval; and as we believe he is</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">the Lord’s wise and faithful servant, we are happy to follow his method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another year has passed; and with its close we are glad to say that the little band of the Lord’s followers yet this side the vail are strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. During the year there have been some trying experiences, but these are insignificant compared with the joy and peace of serving our Lord and King. As we pause now to view the scope of the work during the year, we find many reasons for rejoicing. We can with real satisfaction see that wc have been laboring in the Lord’s vineyard, and now forcibly come to mind the words of the Prophet: “Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.”—Psalm 33: 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These words were addressed to Israel after the flesh, and originally applied to that nation. But without doubt they apply in a broader sense to Israel after the spirit. At this time there is no earthly nation which acknowledges Jehovah as God and accepts his ways through his beloved Son, the Prince of Peace, for the settling of the difficulties that afflict mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On the contrary, all the nations of earth are today acting according to man’s wisdom, the wisdom of this world, directed by the super-mind of Satan; and by international conference, diplomacy and intrigue they arc trying to reform Satan’s empire and to control the people. But he whose right it is to take over the affairs of the nations and peoples of earth has come. He has begun his reign. That reign wiU bring the desire of all nations, and in due time the peoples of earth will recognize Jehovah as God and Jesus as the Deliverer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If a nation is wholly devoted to the Lord then that nation must be composed of a people for God’s purpose. The apostle Peter describes such a nation thus: “You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for a purpose; that you may declare the perfections of him who called you from darkness into his wonderful light; who once were not a people, but now are God’s people; who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.”—1 Peter </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">2:</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> 9,</span><span class="font9">10, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Dia-glott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At once we recognize the nation thus described as the new creation of which Jesus is the Head. It is </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">holy nation, made so through the blood of Christ Jesus and the sanctifying influence of the holy spirit. This </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">887</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">is the new nation that is coming into power. Such at this time is the only nation whose God is Jehovah and whom Jehovah hath chosen for his own purposes. It will be observed that the above rendering of this text shows that God has selected this people for a purpose; and his purpose is the reconciliation to himself of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">While the nations of the old world are rapidly disintegrating and are desperately seeking some means to establish themselves, it is the privilege and duty of God’s chosen people, the holy nation, to point out to the peoples of earth that money is not the God, neither is might nor earthly wisdom; but that Jehovah is the only true God, and that Jesus Christ is the King of kings and Lord of lords. It is the privilege of the Lord’s people, as well as their duty, to advertise to the new world the new King and his kingdom and to comfort men’s hearts by showing them that this kingdom is the remedy for the ills of humankind and that it will bring peace and lasting blessings to mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To educate the people concerning the divine plan is the purpose for which the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society was created and organized. For thirty-eight years it has been in existence as an incorporated body, but existed prior to that time as an association of Christians under the leadership of the Lord’s wise and faithful servant. Those who love the Lord Jesus’ appearing, and who love him and the heavenly Father supremely, who recognize the presence of the Lord and who arc trusting in the merit of his sacrifice, are fully consecrated to do God’s will and are heartily engaged in doing it, are properly considered members of this Society. Certain qualifications have been fixed as to those who shall vote; but this does not preclude others from being classed as members of the Society who are in full heart harmony with the Lord’s way and who are working together in harmony with their brethren to carry out the purposes for which this Society was created and organized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We think that we can say with propriety and with proper modesty, that the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is the only united body of Christians on earth who joyfully acknowledge Jehovah as God and Jesus as King and who, believing in the presence of the King and his kingdom, are unitedly making proclamation of these great truths to mankind. What a blessed privilege it is. then, that as followers in the Master’s footsteps wc are permitted now to be members of his army this side the vail and to be used of him in carrying out his purposes! As his followers there are two principal things for us to do at this time: namely, (1) to be faithful and true witnesses to the Lord; and (2) to see to it that we are being transformed into the likeness of our Lord and Master by feeding upon his Word and permitting his spirit to control us, looking forward to that happy time when our hopes will be consummated and we shall be forever with the Lord. You are particularly interested in the report based upon these two general points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">St. Paul points out that we are ambassadors for Christ, as though we speak in Christ’s stead; and that God is speaking by Christ through us, that we might bring to the world his message of reconciliation. (2 Corinthians 5:20) An ambassador is one who represents his potentate. As ambassadors we represent the Lord amongst the people of the earthly nations; and we can with propriety apply the words of the Psalmist to ourselves: “Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We take great pleasure in acknowledging before men that we recognize Jehovah as the only true God and Jesus as his long-promised King. Never was a greater honor conferred upon any creature than to be the ambassador of such a King. And since we are commanded to do with our might what our hands find to do, we must do this in order to be faithful and true witnesses of this great kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To this end the work of the Society at headquarters is organized, insofar as we are able, on a basis of efficiency. It is divided into forces, and each one is expected to do his part in the place where put; and we believe that all are doing it to the best of their ability, by the Lord’s grace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PRINTED WITNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Oue of the most effective ways of giving the witness to the Lord’s kingdom is by inducing others to read our literature in connection with their Bibles, thus proving that the things taught are true. Experience has shown that where a person buys a book he is much more likely to read it than if receiving it as a free gift. Of course our real purpose is to get the message into his hands. Where one has not the money to buy, however, and desires to read, the rule of the Society is and always has been to give them free reading matter; and to this end much literature has been given away during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Those having the responsibility of managing the work at the headquarters reasoned that, as the time of trouble increases, strikes and labor difficulties would render more uncertain the procuring of manufactured books when printed and bound by worldly concerns; that the enemy, would certainly take advantage of every opportunity to hinder and if possible to stop the Society’s work; but that if some arrangement might be made whereby the books could be printed and bound by consecrated hands, we would thus be independent of much of the labor trouble and difficulty and more likely to get the witness to the people; that in addition to this, in time we could produce the books at a saving of cost and soon be able to put them into the hands of the people at a cheaper price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Several difficulties, however, confronted us; among others, Could the machinery and other equipment be bought on time? The Society has no legal power to borrow money for procuring machinery or for any other purpose. What, then, could be done? The result was that an arrangement was made by which machinery for printing and binding the books was bought in the name of private parties, brethren in the truth, on time payments, so that the debt could be paid off in monthly installments. Hence instead of a profit being paid to worldly institutions for making books, this amount could be applied monthly to reducing the debt; and when the debt is cancelled, the plant will belong to and be used exclusively for the benefit of the Society, and then we shall be able to reduce the selling price of all the books we publish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">By the Lord’s grace such an arrangement was made and is being carried out. A manufacturing plant was equipped with the latest presses, typesetting machines, electroplating outfit, cutting, folding and binding machinery. The task seemed almost impossible; but our brethren, trusting in the Lord, put forth their efforts; and the Lord has added his blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The establishment of this printing and binding plant has in no -wise interfered with the use of the voluntary contributions to the tract fund to carry on the work; but in course of time it will be a benefit to this and, we hope, will enable us to enlarge the work and especially to help peoples who cannot help themselves. Already advantage has resulted; and we now see the way clear to reduce the selling price of The Harp of God, beginning with December 10, to 35c. As soon as possible the price on all of our other publications will be reduced. We feel very grateful to the Lord for making this arrangement, and feel certain that it has been done with his approval and that it will result in giving a wider witness to the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Many difficulties having been overcome by the Lord’s grace, the plant was started in March of this year. It is manned in every department by consecrated brethren. Tins affords more brethren opportunities of service where they otherwise might not have it. Not one cent of profit resulting from this plant has been used or will be used for any private individual, but every part of it for the purpose of spreading the message of the Lord's kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some idea can be gathered as to what has been done by this plant since its starting by observing the following figures. It has published and bound the following, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Handbills ..........—........ &nbsp;&nbsp;806,200</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Books ................. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G23.620</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font9"> ............................ 1,204.450</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Copies of </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font9"> .................................. 2,040,320</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Window cards, catalogs, etc............................... 41,250</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Free tracts ................ 10,085,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">14,806,840</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER LANGUAGES</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This printing, of course, includes printing done in languages other than English: namely, Arabic, Armenian, Armeno-Turkish, Croatian, Czechoslovakian, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Lithuanian, Polish, Russian, Ukrainian and Swedish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In addition to the English headquarters at Brooldyn, during the year there has been removed from Detroit the Polish headquarters and united with the office at Brooklyn. We have thus been enabled to reduce the operating cost of the Polish wor to some extent, besides having all the work under one management. For the various domestic foreign branches and their organization, which is operated from the main office at Brooklyn, we refer our readers to the report of 1921, where the details are set forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">FIELD ORGANIZATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The efficiency with which the witness must be given of necessity depends largely upon the organized efforts made in the field. We expect, of course, the number engaging in this work to be small; for it is only a little flock who love the Lord supremely, and by this small band he is giving the witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the year, 980 classes in the United States have reported as fully organized and engaged in the work, and 8,270 persons reported as working. Their work consists in calling upon the people, canvassing them for the books, and inviting them to the meetings, thus giving a personal face-to-face witness and inducing others to read the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There have also been engaged during that time 531 sharpshooters, who devote such time as they can to this work. Including these in the list of workers of class organizations the total number amounts to 8,801 workers. The weekly average of those engaged in this activity has been 2,250 workers. They have arranged for many meetings and have organized many Bible study classes; and thus they have done a work that is impossible for any one this side the vail to describe in detail. Its full effect will be known in due time when we see our Lord face to face. While we realize that he docs not need any one to work for him, it is a blessed privilege to know we have a part in the work<sup>-</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">COLPORTEUR DEPARTMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the year there have been 269 persons actively engaged in the colporteur service, and 193 persons in the auxiliary colporteur service. The colporteurs really bear the brunt of the battle in the field. Their noble example is an inspiration to every one who is striving to give a witness to the truth. We verily believe that the colporteurs accomplish really more good than any other one branch of the service; for they are constantly coming in contact, face to face, with the people; and their earnest, zealous method of telling others about the Lord’s kingdom leaves an impression that is lasting. We would that more could actively engage in the colporteur service exclusively; but not every one is able to make expenses in that work, and others are hindered by some influences not subject to their control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the past year this noble band of workers has placed in the hands of the people a large number of books and other literature. There have been sent out from this office for this purpose the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Studies in the Scriptures,</span><span class="font9"> Scenarios, etc...........125,060</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Millions” books ..........................................................ITS,459</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Can the Living Talk with the Dead?” books .... GG.01G “Hell,” “Tabernacle Shadows,” &amp;&nbsp;other booklets 30,268</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font9">Total.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">..64S.491</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Sales by classes from their stock on hand far exceeded this number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">jSTaiiy workers are reporting splendid success in organizing Berean Bible studies, using Thu Harp of God as a textbook. It is understood that The Harp of God does not in any wise supplant the Studies in the Scriptures, but is merely an epitome, stated in simple language, for the benefit of beginners; and it is hoped that classes started in this study may soon take up the entire set of Studies in the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HONOR ROLL</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">While we do not wish to make comparison of the efforts put forth by the workers in various parts of the field, yet it seems that some of the classes are entitled to special mention because of their zealous efforts put forth in giving the witness. Brother Russell always held that a class which devoted itself largely to Berean studies, canvassing for the books and organizing new classes, made greater progress and did more really effective work than where there is so much preaching done. The reports in the office show that the classes whose ciders go out every Sunday to preach to some other class, and who give less attention to Berean studies aud to placing of the books in the hands of the people, have not made great progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Amongst those who should be favorably mentioned are the following classes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Watertown, N. Y. Tulsa, Okla.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Charlestown, W. Va.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Norfolk, Va.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Easton, Pa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Philadelphia, Pa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Portland, Ore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">South Norwalk, Conn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Buffalo, N. Y. Tacoma, Wash. Pittsburgh, Pa. Greensboro, N. C. Lancaster, Pa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Boise, Ida.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Columbus, O.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Kansas City, Mo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some of these classes have given a wide witness in the rural districts in and about the cities mentioned, organized meetings in schoolhouses and vacated churches; and thus they have accomplished a tremendous amount in advertising the King and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Several of the classes had a large stock of the Combinations on hand at the beginning of the year. Some of these classes have disposed of all of their stock, while others have much of it on hand; and the ones who have disposed of their stock have been the ones who are more active in getting everybody in the class who possibly can do so to engage in the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">VOLUNTEER SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The distribution of free tracts does not afford the opportunity of so much personal witness as by canvassing for the books. Besides, as above observed, one is more likely to read a book when purchased. We do not wish to be understood, however, to say that the volunteer work is not profitable; for the Lord has blessed it in times past and he still blesses it. As heretofore stated, all the plates for the free literature having been destroyed during the trouble of 1918, such free tracts have not been used to any extent since. The Golden Age was intended largely to take the place of such, and during the year 687,320 copies were given away free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The resolution passed at the Cedar Point Convention later was embodied in a tract for wide distribution. Ten million of these tracts were printed for the United States, with another million for Australia and Canada; and October 31, the anniversary of Brother Russell’s change, was set for a general distribution of these tracts in the United States and Canada. In addition thereto the same tract is published in the following foreign languages for distribution in the United States:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Arabic ............ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Armenian ........................................................... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Armcno-Turkisli ................. &nbsp;&nbsp;10,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Bohemian .......... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40.000</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">German .............................. &nbsp;250,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Greek ....................................... &nbsp;200,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Hungarian ................................................................ &nbsp;30.000</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Italian _______ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100.000</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Lithuanian ................................................................. &nbsp;20,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Polish ...................... &nbsp;...100,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Russian ............ &nbsp;&nbsp;10,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">786,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In addition to the above, more than $20,000 have been sent to foreign countries to be used almost exclusively in printing this tract in different languages for free distribution. The hope is that within the next few weeks every part of the earth where the truth is known will be reached with this free tract. Up to the time of this report something above 35,000,000 copies are either printed or in course of printing for free distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">BULLETIN</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There arc issued monthly from this office 10,000 copies of the “Bulletin” to the classes in the United States alone. These arc sent to tlie classes for distribution amongst the workers, so that each worker may have a personal communication from the office for his encouragement and direction in the work, as well as the general “Bulletin” that goes to the Director. The classes through their chosen servants make regular reports to this office, so that there is a well-organized, systematic effort in carrying on the activities in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">THE GOLDEN AGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The work done by The Golden Age magazine during the past year has been very gratifying. Readers of this magazine commend it from every part of the field. It is necessary, of course, to carry some worldly news and secular matters in order to get this publication into the homes of those who are not in the truth. We feel sure that it has a place in the Lord’s work and that he is blessing it. During the past year the copies of The Golden Age sent out to subscribers and for samples have been 2,046,320, which, if sent forth in tract form, would be equivalent to 16,370,560 tracts. It will thus be seen that with The Golden Age going into the hands of the people, together with the 35,000,000 tracts issued, the volunteer work for the year has exceeded that of any year in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">CORRESPONDENCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The correspondence during the year has been exceedingly heavy. Letters and cards received at this office, 161,233. Letters and cards dispatched from this office, 130,443.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">THE WATCH TOWER</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The total number of languages in which The Watch Tower is now published is sixteen. It is published in eight languages at the Brooklyn office. The typesetting machines with which the office is equipped set all the type for these Towers. These machines are so equipped that we can set type to the number of twenty-seven languages. Plates are made, and these Towers are printed, in the office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is gratifying to note that the friends from all parts of the field report blessings received from The Watch Tower. It is the purpose of the Editorial Committee and the publishers to keep The Watch Tower free from controversy and to have it devoted entirely to instruction in spiritual matters and to the other matters in which the church is specially interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PILGRIM SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the year past the Society has sent out brethren who have engaged in the Pilgrim work to the number of 102. These Pilgrim brethren, in addition to visiting the classes and holding parlor meetings, have addressed public meetings regularly throughout the United States and Canada. The number of public meetings held by the brethren in the United States during the year is, to wit, 3,648; the total attendance at these public meetings, 645,804, the number of visits made by the brethren, 6,367; the number of class meetings held, 7,880; the total attendance at the class meetings, 373,207. The total number of miles traveled by those engaged in the service is, to wit, 488,738</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In addition to this work brethren from the United States have visited foreign countries in giving the witness for the truth. Brothers Rutherford, Goux and Martin were in Europe something over two months, a full report of which visit has heretofore appeared in The Watch Tower. Brother Hemery of the British office made a brief tour of the United States, visiting a number of classes. Brother M. A. Howlett is now in Aus-iralia, and will work out both Australia and New Zealand. Brother George Young has made an extended trip through the British West Indies, British and Dutch Guiana, and other paits of South America; and the reports from his meetings show that the Lord has blessed his work abundantly. During the latter part of the year Brothers Woodworth and Pickering were in Great Britain, attending conventions there and visiting the classes. Besides this, a number of our Pilgrim brethren have visited Canada during the year, a report of which visits will appear in the Canadian report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">THE MESSAGE BY WIRELESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In addition to addressing audiences directly, a number of our brethren have used the wireless. It is safe to estimate that at least 300,000 people have received the message by wireless during the year; and we anticipate a much wider witness by this means next year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">WORLD-WIDE WITNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the year the classes throughout the United States and Canada on a fixed day held public meetings, all using the subject “Millions Now Living Will Never Die.” It was thought well to have a general witness throughout the world on this same subject. Branch offices in the various countries of the earth were asked to advertise every available public speaker to speak on this subject. The result was that a world-wide witness was given by the public speakers of the brethren in the truth on February 26 and June 25. On October 29 another world-wide witness was given; while December 10 is set for another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The attendance at public meetings in this world-wide witness is not shown in the above report of the Pilgrims, because many brethren throughout the world held meetings that are not reported through the Pilgrim Department, some classes arranging for as many as sixty meetings on one day in and about the city where the class meets regularly. The reports from these world-wide witnesses have indeed been gratifying. They have stimulated the brethren everywhere to greater earnestness and zeal, and have advertised the truth probably more than any other one thing. When we call to mind that the same message is being spoken in more than thirty languages in different parts of the earth at the same time, we may be sure that it is having some effect upon Satan’s empire. At least it is giving a witness of the Lord and of his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These world-wide meetings give opportunity for every one who is able to deliver an address to do so. They also afford occasion for the younger brethren who are deacons and for the sisters to aid in advertising the meetings and putting the literature into the hands of the people at the conclusion of the meetings. They have stimulated the friends wherever these have participated. There has been a general and liberal response in every part of the earth, and by the Lord’s grace we hope to keep up these world-wide witnesses uutil the Lord indicates otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We must make and maintain the reputation which the Lord desires his people to have: namely, a people separate from the world who are marked as witnesses for the Lord and his kingdom. In this connection we should remember the words of St. Paul: ‘‘'Whether 1 come and see you or, being absent, only hear of you, I may know that you are standing fast in one spirit and with one mind, fighting shoulder to shoulder for the faith of the good news. Never for a moment quail before your antagonists.”—Philippians 1: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">27,</span><span class="font9"> 28, 14'’</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">ey-tnouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There is a real joy in knowing that our brethren are working shoulder to shoulder throughout the whole world in proclaiming the message of the kingdom; and while our enemies will slander those who are engaging in the work, vilely misrepresenting them, attempting to deceive others, seeking to destroy and always opposing the development of the Lord’s work, there is no occasion for the child of God to fear; but every one should take courage and stand shoulder to shoulder and press on, knowing that our Lord is leading on to victory. This witness is bound to have this effect;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVENTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the fiscal year there have been held in the United States conventions to the number of twenty-five. The Cedar Point Convention, a full report of which is given in the November 1 issue of The Watch Tower, was beyond question the greatest convention of consecrated people ever held on earth. While conventions entail considerable sacrifice and expense, yet we are sure that they are a great blessing to those who participate. The convention at Cedar Point served to give a wide witness to the country, not only in Ohio, where it was held, but in various parts of the United States and Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The people are beginning to recognize that the Bible Students are the only people on earth who are bringing God’s message of salvation and peace to them, pointing to the only way—because it is the divine way—that will bring the desire of the nations. The public press gave a wide witness to the Cedar Point Convention, which we believe will result in much good; even those who criticized us did some good; for a criticism is an advertisement of the kingdom, sometimes even better than a commendatory statement. The number of conventions here given does not include local conventions arranged by the various classes for fifth Sundays and other times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ORGANIZED ACTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thus it will be seen that with the organization at the Brooklyn headquarters and the further organization of the pilgrim, colporteur and class forces in the field, with a unity of heart in the Lord’s people, their concerted action is accomplishing a splendid work, giving each one engaging in it an opportunity of proving that he is a faithful and true witness for the King and his Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We feel sure that the Lord is pleased to have his people thus organized that they may work in an orderly manner; and each one following the instructions given by the apostle Paul is specially blessed: “Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy [public proclamation], let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith,” or ministry, teaching, exhortation, etc.—let each one serve in the place where the Lord has put him and do it with a joyful heart. If we act in harmony with the Lord, the result is bound to be as he would have it. Truly, then, God’s people arc a happy people. Engaged under the Captain of our salvation, we are certain of victory as long as we remain on the Lord’s side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">FOREIGN WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What has been heretofore stated in this report applies to the United States. It would require entirely too much space to give a detailed report of all the foreign field. For the various foreign offices, their location and organization we refer our readers to the report published in The Watch Tower of December 15, 1921. In addition to the branches and offices referred to there, during the past year the work has been extended more particular!}’ in Austria, Czechoslovakia, and some South American countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">From every part of the field in Europe the reports show an increased interest in the truth, with but one possible exception : namely, Scandinavia. In those countries there has not been such a greatly increased interest; and we think that is is due largely to the fact that they have not yet experienced their great trouble, such as has come upon some other nations of Europe. However that may be, the work is in a healthy condition in the Scandinavian countries. During the year the message has also been translated and published in Esperanto, which is being used in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We should remember, however, that our brethren in foreign countries are not equipped financially to do the work without help; and much of the Society’s funds contributed during the year has gone to aid the work in European countries, as will be seen by the report. In a later issue we hope to give a summary of the report from these various countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As heretofore reported in The Watch Tower the President of the Society, during the visit to Europe this year, arranged for the publication of more than a million volumes of the books in various languages. This work is now about completed. Because of financial and economic conditions in Europe, however, it must be paid for chiefly by the American office, and the books sold often at less than cost, because the people of Europe ha\e not sufficient money to pay more. But we are sure that the Lord is pleased to have us spend at least a portion of our receipts to help our brethren in foreign countries and to give the witness there. The world is the field. The Lord willing, during the ensuing year we hope to extend the witness in foreign countries more widely than in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FINANCIAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">None of the Lord’s dear saints are rich in this world’s goods. Notwithstanding efiorts put forth by some brethren to make large sums of money for the Lord’s work, none of these have ever succeeded. It seems certain that the Lord intends his work to be done by the sacrifice of his people. Hence it is that the “Good Hopes” fund is made up chiefly of small contributions. But many of these small donations mount up to a large su .i. It is gratifying to see that during the year the Lord has provided through the sacrifice of his saints a goodly sum to be used in spreading the gospel of the kingdom; and this used in the most economical manner that we know how to use it, w<sup>r</sup>e believe has given a wide witness. Hereto is appended a summary of the Treasurer’s report showing the financial condition of the treasury of the Society :</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">FINANCIAL SUMMARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">IlECEII’TS :</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To balance from last year..............................$ 9.336.04</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">By public witness, free literature, etc......... 20.855.94</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Balance, October 1, 1922............................ 19,253.43* $156,476.02</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">♦At the closing of our books on October 1, the end of the fiscal year, there were bills already contracted which would more than wipe out the above balance; and there was immediately paid the foreign branches for free tracts and publicity the sum of $24,204.90, which would in fact leave at the beginning of the year a small deficit. But the contributions are meeting ibis, and we will continue to enlarge the scope of the work in proportion as the Lord grants the way by providing the means-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We gratefully acknowledge the Lord’s marked kindness toward his people in the blessing of his work from the financial showing during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is gratifying to note the healthy spiritual development of the church in every part of the field. It is true that there is some deflection here and there; but this is to be expected. We arc in the evil day, the time in which the saints are being tested. Some who have walked with us complain that the Society is giving too much attention to acth ity in the field in proclaiming the message to others. Others criticize for different reasons. These criticisms are all to be expected, of course. But we are quite sure that those who are active in the field are the ones who have been making spiritual progress. The Lord Jesus said: “My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.” (John 5:17) Again he said: “I am among you as he that serveth.” (Luke 22:27) The apostle Paul urges us to be “not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.” (Romans 12: 11) Moreover, we are commanded by the Apostle to be diligent. Diligence does not mean inactivity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Again, the Scriptures tell us: “The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.” (Psalm 69 : 9) The words of this last text apply first to the Lord Jehovah himself, who has at all times been reproached by the adversary. When Jesus came, the reproaches fell upon him; and since he finished his earthly course, similar reproaches have fallen upon the body members. What, then, was the real cause of these reproaches? The Psalmist shows it was the zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house. Zeal means a burning, glowing love for the Lord and his cause. The Lord Jesus was zealous ir. being a true and faithful witness for the heavenly Father; and we are commanded to be his true and faithful witnesses. By so doing we suffer the reproach from the adversary and from those whom he can stir up to oppose us—to shoot at us fiery darts, even bitter words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jesus clearly shows that these things will have to be endured by those who are faithfully witnessing for him at the end of the world. He states that many will be offended, leading to betrayal and hatred; and that because injustice would abound the love of many would wax cold; and of course where love waxes cold there will be no effort to spread the glad tidings. Then Jesus adds: “But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.” This endurance is spoken of in connection with the proclamation of the gospel of the kingdom. Where love is the only motive that impels one to be a witness for the Lord, and where he is willing to endure privations, persecutions, false accusations, criticisms, all because of his love to witness for the Lord, then he may be sure that such experience is developing in him the likeness of our Lord and Master, teaching such to be long-suffering and yet kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is easily observed that those brethren in different parts of the held who are most active in spreading the gospel are the ones who are most tolerant in their minds toward others, kindly disposed, easy of entreatment, and who manifest a greater amount of good works. The mind must be occupied by something, cither good or evil; and if it is not occupied concerning the Lord’s kingdom, our great enemy Satan will see to it that it is occupied with something concerning his empire. So it is to be expected that those who are most actively engaged in serving the Lord, prompted only by the motive of love, will be the ones who will show the greatest spiritual development. These, holding on faithfully and loyally to the end, will be given a crown of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Here and there in different parts of the field there have been some who have become weary in well-doing, displeased with the food that the Lord has provided for his people, and have turned aside to feed upon other things; and these are quickly given over to criticism and har sh sayings against their brethren who are trying faithfully to represent the Lord’s cause. We are happy to report, however, that this number is negligible. We shordd be pleased, of course, to witness their recovery and their engaging again heartily in the spreading of the gospel of the kingdom; but we cannot stop to argue the matter with them. The Lord having committed it into the hands of the people of his nation to give the witness, those who are pleasing to him must press on, doing daily with their might what their hands find to do. The people whom the Lord has chosen for his inheritance are those who will prove faithful to him, even unto death. And truly, as the Psalmist said: “The Lord taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation.”—Psalm 149 : 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In conclusion, dear brethren, as we take a retrospective view of the things of the year just passed, we have much cause for gratitude in our hearts and joy that the Lord has been pleased to hold us fast during the year; and upon examining our hearts we rejoice to find that our singleness of purpose and desire is to serve him faithfully, to be transformed into his likeness, and in due time to see him face to face. Let us gird up the loins of our minds, be sober and hope to the end, knowing that if we continue in confidence and rejoicing in this hope firm to the end, we shall reap the eternal reward and soon be forever with our Lord.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark7"></a>“ADVERTISE THE KING AND KINGDOM”</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“Say among the nations that the Lord reigneth; the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.”—Psalm 06:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font9">HIS text is a positive commandment from the Lord, to be executed in due time. Jesus said: “If ye love me, keep my commandments.” To this St. John adds: “This proves our love of God, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments arc not grievous.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The due time for obeying the commandment here first above mentioned is at the beginning of the reign of our Lord. It is directed to those who are members of the new creation this side the vail. The Scriptural evidence in the light of recent events shows that the Lord began his reign in 1914. There the nations became angry. The World War, famine, pestilence, and revolution followed. The due time for the Lord’s people to specifically obey this commandment is when they see and appreciate the time in which we are living. Speaking to his faithful followers, he in substance says: 'Go tell the nations of earth this message. Tell them that the Lord reigns; that the first work of his reign is the dashing to pieces of Satan’s empire; that this work is in progress; but comfort their hearts with the message that the King of kings and Lord of lords comes to judge the people righteously and to give them all the truth.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The peoples of earth are in great distress, and their rulers in much perplexity. They all see dreadful things coming; but they do not know what is the remedy, if any, for such distress. The rulers have assembled in world conference after conference and have put forth their best efforts to establish peace and to save the old order from complete collapse. In the light of the Lord’s Word we know they cannot succeed in this; for the time has come for the old order to vanish and to be succeeded by the new. As the old order comes nearer and nearer to final collapse, the distress of the people and the perplexity of the rulers increase. The Lord, however, has a complete and absolute remedy by which the desire of all nations and peoples of earth can be realized. That remedy is his kingdom of righteousness; and his reign will bring peace on earth and good will to men, happiness and contentment. The people ought to know about this. It is due time for them to know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Lord desires the world to have this message of reconciliation. He has committed to his faithful followers the privilege of delivering such message. Are you one of those? If so, joyfully obey the command of the Lord and tell the people that his reign begun will shortly so establish the new world that it cannot be moved; that he will bring a stable and lasting government which will not only be free from revolution, anarchy and profiteers, deceivers and defrauders, but will bring health and happiness, peace and joy; and that to those who obey the righteous reign will be granted, life everlasting in a state of happiness and perfection. His kingdom is not for a few brief years, but is an everlasting kingdom. Tell them, as he directs in this command, that he will judge the people impartially and with righteousness; that he will lead them into the full and complete truth; that he will lead the obedient ones over the highway of holiness and will fill every heart that loves and obeys him with boundless happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A GREAT PRIVILEGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This is the message of the hour. It is a message of hope and good cheer. Every one who truly loves the Lord and appreciates the time in which we are now living will be anxious to tell it to others as opportunity allords. Those who do thus tell it with a joyful heart will be keeping the Lord’s commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It will be noticed from the text and the context that this message will bring joy to those who hear; and this, like other similar texts in the Bible, shows that there is great rejoicing among those who know and appreciate the Lord’s reign. Remember, then, if you arc a consecrated child of God you are a publicity agent for the King and his kingdom. Advertise it in every way you can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">You have received a quantity of free tracts. Each one of these tracts gives a brief outline of the precious message from the Lord. It tells of the invisible presence of the King of kings and of his reign begun. Whether you are able to make a speech or not is not so important. Anyone can carry the tracts to another. Get your territory, call at each home, hand in one copy of the tract to the person responding, and speak a good word—something lilxe this: You will be pleased to read this because it contains a message of hope of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">better time coming. Pass quickly on to the next house. Then a few days later, under the direction of the class organization, go over your territory with the books and canvass the same people to whom you have delivered the tracts. They will recognize you. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Their </span><span class="font9">interest will have been aroused by reading the resolution contained in the tract, as well as the other message; and then you can tell them that the books you have give a full explanation, with numerous Scripture citations, to prove that these things are true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Get the message into the hands of the people. Encourage them to read; and as interest is manifested, organize Bible study classes and help them to understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In doing these things, remember that you arc obeying the commandment of the Lord in bringing these good tidings of peace and salvation to the people; that you arc binding up the broken-hearted and comforting those that mourn. “How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him”—the last members of the body who deliver this message.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark9"></a>A LESSON IN TRUST AND PREPAREDNESS</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">---December</span><span class="font9"> 24---</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Luke</span><span class="font9"> 12---</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BEGINNING OF CONCERTED OPPOSITION TO OUR LORD’S MINISTRY—A TEST OF DISCIPLESHIP—DANGER OF SINNING AGAINST TH1 WITNESS OF THE CHURCH--PARABLES ILLUSTRATING CONDITIONS AT OUR LORD’S RETURN—APPLICATION TO OUB DAY.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“The life is more than the food, and the body than the raiment.&quot;—Luke</span><span class="font9"> 12: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font9">HE feast in the Pharisee’s house broke up In a measure of disorder. The Pharisees and the lawyers were now angry, and tried to catch Jesus in his words, that they might accuse him. It was apparent that concerted opposition to him and his work was beginning; but Jesus became even more pointed in his words about them and their teaching. The third phase of his ministry—that of opposition— bad come; find from this time he began to warn his disciples : “Beware ye </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">of the</span><span class="font9"> leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.” He also warned the people to beware of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Aided by the holy spirit, the disciples were to proclaim his teaching boldly. This would bring them into sore trouble; but he bade them fear not: “Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.” (Luke 12: 4) Fear God, who has called you into his service. Lovingly he assured them of God’s care, saying that not a sparrow falls to the ground apart from the will of God; and that God is so watchful and mindful of his own that “the very hairs of your head are all numbered” (Luke 12: 7) ■—symbolisms telling of a loving, particular care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Without doubt our Lord was now speaking through the apostles to the whole church. These words are intended for our guidance and comfort as much as for those who first heard them. Faithful discipleship would bring his followers into conflict with the powers of the world; It would be no easy matter to acknowledge association with him, to confess him before men. The history of the church shows that this has always been one of the tests of discipleship. Christianity, professedly the teaching of Jesus, has been accepted by the “civilized world”; but the true followers of Jesus have always been considered eccentric. The test has never been lifted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The true disciple has always been glad to acknowledge his Master; but at no time In the church’s history has more courage been necessary to confession of discipleship than now. To profess today to be a follower of the Prince of Peace Is as hard a thing as It was to profess to be a follower of Jesus of Nazareth in the earliest days of the church. The Prince of Peace is despised of men. Well for us if we have courage to confess him as our Master, whom we will serve and follow at all costs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jesus went on to say that all manner of sin against him should be forgiven, but that blasphemy against the holy spirit should not have forgiveness. We believe that Jesus referred more particularly to the witness to be given by the church. The Pharisees sinned against light; for our Lord said to them: “How can ye escape the condemnation of Gehenna?” (Matthew 23:34) But so much light has been given through the church, especially at this time, that those who sin against the witness of the church given by the spirit of God, are in especial danger. Jesus told Ins followers not to concern themselves when arraigned before the powers that be; “for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.”—Luke 12:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">A LESSON ON COVETOUSNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">While our Lord was speaking there came a rude interruption. A man cried: “Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.” (Luke 12:13) Jesus said that to Interfere in personal matters was no part of his work. The interruption was rude; the man considered his business more important than that which the Lord was doing, and Jesus took the opportunity to give a lesson on covetousness. He uttered the parable of the rich fool, the man who had so much that he did not know what to do with his possessions, and who decided to lay up a store for some years and to enjoy himself. On the day he came to this conclusion God said: “This night thy soul shall be required of thee.” (Luke 12:20) The man was a fool inasmuch as he reckoned on things outside of his control, and thought to get satisfaction out of mere enjoyment of indulgence and idleness. He forgot God ; he neither thanked him for his prosperity nor remembered his obligations towards him. And Jesus said that everyone who lays up treasures for himself, and is not rich toward God, is like that man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Then the Master told his disciples that they should take no thought for life or body: that is, “what shall ye eat, what shall ye put on” ; and he intimated that God, who feeds the ravens and clothes the lilies with their glory, will undertake to feed and clothe his children. The consecrated child of God Is placed under the operation of a law of providence which will protect and keep him as surely as the birds and the lilies are cared for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are things in connection with human life which are properly the care of man. He must provide for himself; it Is his care, his duty. But when one gives himself to God, and is accepted as a follower of Jesus, there is a changed situation ; the real care for life and its necessities is undertaken by our Father. We are not relieved from laboring with our hands, however. His care comes through our labor; but we are relieved from carrying the care of these earthly needs, in order that we may care for the service of God, and that our lives may be wholly devoted to him. If our Father did not undertake for us in these things, Satan would soon wear ns out with these cares.—Luke 12: 29, 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These poor, despised disciples, who would have the courage to confess him as their Master, and who had so much confidence as to commit their temporal welfare into the hands of God, seeking only to serve his interests, should he specially rewarded. Then our Lord added a wonderful word —“Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s'good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” (Luke 12: 32) The child of God should rather sell what he has, not indeed to give everything away, but that he may give alms; in other words that like his Father in heaven he may have something io give and a disposition to give. God would not have ns empty-handed, but stewards under him, dispensing his blessings, very often those things which were ours before we gave them to him. Our Lord then urges sill his disciples to be girded about, with lights burning, like those who wait for their Lord returning from a wedding. Then he said: “Blessed are those servants, whom the Lord when he cometh Shall find watching.”—Luke 12:37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Our Lord intimated that his coming would be unexpected, and that there were reasons for having it so. One reason concerns the devil. Jesus speaks of a thief going to a house, and says: “If the goodman of the house had known what time the thief would come, he would have watched, and not hare suffered his house to be broken through.” (Luke 12: 39) We suggest that our Lord is here speaking of Satan’s house, and thus intimates that on his return he will come upon Satan unawares. Had the Lord made it clear just when he would return, Satan would have been prepared to hlndbr him, and the harvest work would have been hindered. Our Lord also came unexpectedly to his own ; his return was to them as unexpected as to his enemy Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Peter, ever ready to ask questions, now asked whether our Lord was speaking to them, or to all. Jesus did not answer the question directly because it was not his purpose to explain all he knew about the church. He told of a wise steward, who should be made ruler over the household. “Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing. Of a truth I say unto you. that he will make him ruler over all that he hath.” (Luke 12: 43, 44) It is evident that our Lord had in mind an unusual circumstance; his words indicate that at the rime of his relurn there would be a general lack of preparedness and expectancy ; but some would be ready to receive him, and that ot these, because of his faithfulness, one would be made steward of the house, elevated to a higher responsibility. He said : “He will appoint him ruler over all his goods.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENT DAY APPLICATIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This passage has been under iiuc-h notice during the past forty years because of a very apparent fulfillment. There are some who loudly dispute a fulfillment in any man : but those who have seen, held, and taught present I ruth, most assuredly have believed that our late beloved leader, Brother Russell, held that position of steward. And this we most certainly hold, both as a fact and as a necessity of faith. The position is this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(1) God raised up a servant (Brother Russell), who boldly proclaimed that the Lord had returned, and was therefore present amongst his people, even as he said. (John 14:3) (2)This fact clearly seen led, under the Lord’s guidance, to the full disclosure of Jehovah’s plan— the divine plan of the ages. Brother Russell was the only one who fully saw the plan, and the only one to publish it to the household of faith. (3) The proclamation of these truths gathered the faithful consecrated to each other and to the Lord; and a harvesting work was begun and continued for the Lord entirely under the direction and care of Brother Russell. (4) This work so commended itself to the consecrated as to be accepted fully as the work of the Lord. As the director of the work he arranged to publish the truths the Lord gave him by means of the W. T. B. &amp;&nbsp;T. Society, which he early organized for that purpose and to provide for continuance of the proclamation in the event of his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">(5) By these things the church of God has been brought once more into a visible whole: (a) God’s people have been delivered from Babylon (Revelation 18:1,2), and (b) his saints have been gathered together. (Psalm 50: 5) (6) Not since Pentecost has the church had such clear direction nor such abundant food; and its Joy answers only to that which was promised on our Lord’s return, and to that of harvesters bringing in the sheaves. (7) Because of his special position —Pastor Russell never claimed that of ruler, except as that term might be used of a director of service—he not only was the guide of the Lord’s people, but, as has been abundantly shown in “The Finished Mystery,” he was also the “angel to the church of Laodicea”; that he might also give warning to all who profess to serve God that the time of judgment has come.—Revelation 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But what of the evil servant of Luke 12: 45-48? We reply that the word may be taken as one of general warning to those who have enjoyed the blessings of service; and that it is certainly fitting to the case of the leaders of the norai-nal church. But that the passage could not refer to the one who was made ruler of the household, as if he should prove unworthy, is clear: God does not permit such calamity to befall his faithful servants. There have been those in the service of God who have gone wrong, but there is no Scrip-&quot;ural example of an outstanding character who has been raised to such a high honor as here shown and has gone from fidelity to ignominy and shame. The great leaders, Moses, Joshua, Samuel, David, were faithful to the end. King Saul ended in failure, but he early turned from the Straight path.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">DEGREES OF UNFAITHFULNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The punishment for those who have held the truth as stewards, and who turn from it, and for those who know somelhing of the will of God and. do it not, is varied. The leader is cut asunder, not merely cut off from his service. The wilful are beaten with many stripes; the ignorant with few. (Luke 12:46-18) In verse 49 Jesus says that he came to send fire on the earth, and adds a personal note giving, as it were, a glimpse of the working of his mind. “I would,” he said, “that it were already kindled.” A Son of Pence, baptized with a dove, the emblem of peace, resting upon him ; and giving the people cause to marvel at the graciousness of his manner and the multitude of his gifts, he yet knew that before these could come from him with permanent blessings, there must be sore divisions, and fires to purge. He saw the clouds gathering, and no longer hesitated to speak of the religion of the scribes and Pharisees as a mockery and a sham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Again the time has come when the clouds are gathering, now over not only the church but also the world—clouds which tell of the end of the church’s labors, because a dark night is settling upon tho present evil order. Some are surprised when our Lord’s true followers, pained because of dissension in classes caused by lukewarmness m .some, say with their Master: “Would that the lire of purgation were kindled I” There are times for fires to burn, and for divisions, in order that right and truth may prevail, and the whole-hearted may be free to serve. The fire which comes with the Second Presence tests and purifies the members of the true church, the church nominal, and the world. Jesus blamed the people for lack of discernment. They could read weather signs, but seemed totally unable to read the signs of the times. They ought to have discerned the meaning of his presence, teaching, and miracles as easily as they could read weather indications. “Why do ye of yourselves judge not what is right?” The same words can again be used. The signs of this “time of trouble” are many; but men refuse to read them. Well for us that we have judged what is right.—I.uke 12:37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Verses 58 and 59, which close the chapter, should not be taken merely as personal instruction. They were applicable to the Jewish nation, and are appropriate to the context. The adversary was the Law' (John 5:45), though the self-righteous people had not so thought of it. But now the Leaching of Jesus had revealed their shortcoming, had removed the covering of their pretences. The Law condemned them. Jesus by his teaching was as an adversary to them ; they were indicted as transgressors. The issue had been raised : their conduct must go before the judge. There was still lime to selfie the matter. Let them agree with Jesus, settle the case with him. If they would, he had the right to do so. But Israel would not heed, and later were brought into judgment and condemnation, and were sentenced; and unto this day they are paying the penalty—unto the utmost farthing. We thank God their lime of trouble is nearly over: we look forward to the speedy release of the prisoner; and before that to our own exaltation, when the church will have the privilege of leading the Jew into freedom, and after him, all the families of the earth; when Ilie world will be free from the bondage of evil, and from the corruption which has obtained through the Pharisees and their present-day descendants.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ION I Si's—TEACHING METHODS OF BOTH ADVENTS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“The spirit of the Lord is upon me. hccaitsc he hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the poor.&quot;—Luke</span><span class="font9"> 4: IS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font9">E HAVE now kept company with out- Lord for three months. Our lessons have dealt briefly with the Inrth.s of ,Jesus and Ids forerunner John and with the larger poition of Jesus’ ministry. As all the Gospels give a much fuller account of the latter part of Jesus life and work, much remains for our studies during the next quarter. It was in the fulness of time that Jesus came (Galatians 4:4)—God’s Messenger from heaven. (Malachi 3:1) At the time of his birth the earth was in a very evil condition. Wickedness prevailed everywhere. Sorcery and demonism were exerting a powerful influence on the degenerate world, and the lamp which God had lighted in Israel was dimmed under formalism and hypocrisy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">By God’s overruling providence the world had been somewhat prepared for the coming of our Lord. The Grecian empire had spread a general language oxer all Ilie East; and Rome had brought the whole world under one dominion. Thus facililies for travel and intercourse among various peoples were comparatively easy. For a considerable time the Jews had been under I he control of Rome, but were never an easy people to govern, partly because of iheir fanatical disposition and partly because of their extreme sensitiveness about their own importance. Under Herod they had considerable liberty, and Judea was considered an important province of the empire. The fact that Herod was a descendant of Esau is to the Bible student more than interesting; it seems typically significant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For 400 years Israel had heard nothing from Jehovah; but the force of the past had carried them on, and they had now settled down as a religious community, firmly convinced that they were a people of destiny, and well assured of their ability to teach the whole world. Their leaders had fastened themselves upon the people, secure in hypocrisy and in their ability to deceive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">MISSION OF JOHN THE BAPTIST</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At the first advent God had a few faithful souls who looked to him for the fulfillment of his promises. To one of these, Zachariah, a priest, the intimation came that the time had arrived for God to fulfill his word to his people. To Zachariah, now old, was promised a son who was to be (he forerunner of God’s Messenger. Six months later the angel Gabriel, who had visited Zachariah, was sent to Mary, of the house of David, living in Nazareth, to tell her that the Son of the Highest should be born of her. Only a few knew of these wonderful things. The more public announcements of the births of these two children (Luke 1: 65 ; 2:17) ought to have led the people into expectation that God would use them as messengers; but both John and Jesus were allowed to grow up without any special attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Suddenly, thirty years later, it was announced that a Prophet was preaching in the wilderness of Judea. It was John, announcing the coming of God’s Messenger. As John was baptizing, Jesus came to him asking to be immersed. After demurring, John agreed; and as the baptism was being performed, God’s witness came; and John immediately knew Jesus to be the one for whom he was the forerunner. —John 1:31, 32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On time Jesus left heaven to become a man (Galatians 4:4) ; and exactly on time he left Nazareth to be baptized of John and to present himself to God in consecration. (Luke 3:23) How we admire him, full of grace and truth (John 1:14), lowly born, lowly reared, nothing to tempt him to high-mindedness, in either parents or home or city!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">OUR LORD’S MESSAGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jesus must have realized himself to be quite superior to those witli whom he lived and toiled. Reared in poverty and humility, he was earth’s noblest son. After his baptism his purity of heart and purpose were immediately put to the test. Sorely tempted of the devil, he retained his purity, and came away from the encounter and the forty days of lasting sweetened and strengthened by victory and experience. As soon as he had been tempted of the devil, and was ready io begin his ministry, he was subjected to a test by his Father; for he had no special introduction into his ministry. He had to feel his way into the work. Our Golden Text shows his clear view of his mission, and his boldness in declaring himself as the servant of God. He spoke graciously, but as one having authority, and conscious of his part in the purpose of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Our Lord’s calmness, his assurance, and his claims maddened the scribes, Pharisees, chief priests, and elders. He waived all their teachings aside, and spoke plainly to the people. He declared that he had come to reveal the Father; that none could approach the Father or know him unless by himself; that he was the Way, the Truth, and the Life; and that it was necessary to salvation that he should be accepted as God’s Messenger. He gave proof of his heaven-ordained mission by his many miracles, as well ns by his gracious words; by his largeness of heart and his untiring service for the people; by his humility—all so different from that to which the people were accustomed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For the furtherance of his work, and in view of the establishment of his church to be revealed later, he chose twelve apostles. These were taken out of the ordinary walks of life: a considerable proportion of them were fishermen; and all of them men of Galilee, except Judas Iscariot, who was of Judea. Jesus took these simple men, and without putting them through the ordinary ways of training so impressed his own character upon them that they well represent him to the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">OPPOSITION OF PROMINENT RELIGIONISTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jesus began his ministry in Galilee, but did not remain there long. He appears to have spent his first winter in Jerusalem and vicinity. Some miracles were wrought; but the Pharisees held aloof from him, and he made but little progress. It was of this ministry that Nicodemus said: “We know that thou art a teacher come from God.” (John 3:2) Afterwards Jesus went northwards through Samaria to Galilee, and preached there in the towns and villages, at last reaching Nazareth. He appears to have understood that his return to Nazareth would be eventful, but he had no hesitancy in speaking on our Golden Text of today. “This day,” said he, “is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This was too much for the Nazarenes. They had known him all his life; they despised him, rejected him, and then tried to destroy him. The Lord must have felt the rejection very keenly. He said: “A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country and in his own house.” (Matthew 13:57) Jesus' home people were not in agreement with him, a circumstance which would make the suffering all the harder to bear. (Mark 3:21,31; John 7:5) Despised of Nazareth, he is known everywhere as Jesus of Nazareth, ever a bitter-sweet reminder to him of his early days and of his rejection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Our Lord taught the people chiefly by parables. This simple form of teaching was an immediate help to everyone who would pay attention to him, and was intended to lead the people from their darkness to the light which God had sent by him. Rut the parables did not serve to unlock the mysteries of God: rather they served to add to these- In other words, our Lard’s parables contained hidden teaching which has provided instruction for the church of God all down the age—meat in due season, according to the measure of understanding which God at any time would give his people. Our Lord, then, spoke in parables to lay up food for his people in time of famine. They have not yet yielded their treasures; but now, since he has returned, he has given his church the key of the plan of God, and has opened these dark sayings of old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A comparison of Matthew 13:35; Psalms 78:2; 49:4 is both interesting and instructive. At our Lord’s first advent he spoke in parables, that the people seeing might not see. But there comes a time when the dark sayings of God will be opened, accompanied with sweet music on the Harp; when God gives a call to all the earth to hoar. (Psalm 49:1-4) That time has come. We have </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Habp of God</span><span class="font9"> and the sweet music with ten strings: our Lord’s teaching, simple, heartfelt, and consequently heart-touching. His message was one of love; and it was witnessed that the people wondered at the gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth. The wonderful message is again being spoken to the people.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Miracles in Nineteen-Twenty*Two</span></h3>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE Benedictine Convent of Perpetual Adoration, Clyde, Mo., publishes among other booklets one which it entitles “Wonders of the Miraculous Crucifix of Limpias,” narrating that a wooden image of Christ, which is fastened to a crucifix in a Roman Catholic church in Limpias, Spain,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">*. . . seems to assume life, and many spectators behold His sufferings, agony, and death, just as these mysteries of the passion took place on Calvary. Now- He moves those grief-filled eyes; now He turns the thorn-crowned head in various directions; now He opens and closes those parched and burning lips. The expression on His divine countenance changes in a manner that' moves one to tears, turning from the ordinary color to purple, then to ashy-gray and the pallor of death. Cold perspiration covers the body. Bright red blood oozes from the wounds, especially from beneath the cruel crown of thorns, and trickles down upon His face, shoulders and breast. The parted lips show the mouth filled with foam and blood, and at times a fresh stream gushes forth from the sacred wound of His side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The peculiar feature of the phenomenon is that some of those present behold the prodigy with the most dear distinctness, while their neighbors perceive not the slightest change in the Holy Christ.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">According to the booklet the Rev. Gaspar de Cebrones, guardian of the Capuchins of Coruna, Spain, writes that</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">proaehed the Image and laid his hand on its breast. To * his great surprise, he noticed that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">the palm was moistened,</span><span class="font5"> covered as it were with sweat, from immediate</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">“. . . one of the ’Capuchin Fathers, Father Jalon, ap-contact with the image.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The booklet declares that on Wednesday, June 25, 1919, while four thousand pilgrims were visitingthe church</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“. . . hundreds of electric lights flooded the place with their splendor. No sooner had the Mass begun when, to - the utter amazement of the people, the prodigy was repeated. The multitude observed that the image not only moved the eyes and the lips, but that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a spark of life flashed over the mysterimls face, and that bloody tweat dripped from the afflicted countenance.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It quotes from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">El Debate,</span><span class="font7"> of Madrid, an experience of Marquis de Ugena in which the Marquis narrates that when his wife and children entered the church the children told their mother that they saw the Lord smile, but she herself saw nothing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Soon after it seemed to her that the image moved its head. She looked attentively at the crucifix, fearing, however, it might be a delusion. Taking for granted ' that it was an effect of her imagination, she asked the children what they were seeing. Both directed their gaze upon our divine Savior, and replied at the same time: 'He is moving His head from one side to the other.’ ” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The booklet proceeds with an account of the ’ experiences of an English layman who writes that, while at mass</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I see that a kind of cloud rises, spreads and coven the feet, then the body, the arms and later all the cross of the Christ of the Agony, and only the divine face remains with its powers, most tranquil and most beautiful ; and at the same time all is illumined with golden light, most intense. After some moments, I do not know how many, this cloud disappears or, rather, passes which I see clearly and perceptibly as one sees a cloud passing over the sun.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It quotes from the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Dit,rio de Navarra,</span><span class="font7"> July 29, 1919, the experiences of a medical student, Heriberto de la Villa:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Scarcely had I stepped into the church, and looked <sub>t</sub> at the Christ, when I saw that He moved His mouth, as though He were speaking just naturally. I looked more carefully, and saw that He turned His eyes in different directions. Thereupon I placed myself on the right side of the church, beside the sacristy. I gazed again at the Holy Christ, and saw that He looked toward the side opposite me, then </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">threw at me a terrible. piercing glance!</span><span class="font5"> I trembled and could not help but cast down my eyes. When my excitement had subsided, I looked at Him again, and saw that He looked in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">direction to His right, at the same time bowing </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">turning His head in such a manner that I could perceive the back of His crown. Again He bowed His head, then resumed the ordinary position of the image. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Once </span><span class="font5">more He fixed on me a glance similar to the one </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">before^</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">which made such </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font5">impression on me that I was forced to leave the church. All this happened in about four minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“My </span><span class="font5">emotion was so great that I could not return to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">. the </span><span class="font5">church until five o’clock; and looking at the Holy Christ, I saw His face and breast gradually assuming a very dark blue color. His eyes moved now to the right, now to the left, now upward, now downward. His lips were a little parted, as though He had difficulty in breathing. This lasted about fifteen to twenty minutes. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">noticed at the same time that when He looked toward the left,, His gaze rested for a time as though on a fixed point, and that when He looked down, His eyes gradually lowered and finally closed entirely. At the same </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">time </span><span class="font5">He closed His mouth, while </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font5">expression of pain and resignation lay on His countenance, which touched me exceedingly. I saw also that over the left eyebrow a wound was forming, from which blood pressed through the eyebrow, and fell on the eyelid. Thereupon I saw another drop of blood fall from the crown and roll down the face. I could easily distinguish this, because the blood was a light red, and contrasted distinctly against the dark blue color of the face. After that I saw blood fall copiously from the crown upon the shoulders, but without touching the face. The lips </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">parted</span><span class="font5"> farther than before, and a white mass like foam issued therefrom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“At this instant a Dominican ascended the pulpit.. The Holy Christ gazed at him steadily for five or six minutes, then closed His eyes and mouth, and remained thus all during the sermon. When the Father concluded with these or similar words, ‘And now, 0 Holy Christ of the Agony, give us Thy blessing,’ Christ opened His eyes, smiled, and bowed His head as though He were blessing us. At the same moment someone, asked me whether </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">dare swear to what I had seen. Immediately </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">wanted to say yes, for I was still beholding the miracle, but I refrained from it and deliberated whether it were prudent or not. Then I saw that the Holy Christ, who, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font5">if wishing to prove to me what I had seen, again opened His mouth, and blood and foam poured forth copiously between the parted lips. At the same time His chin grew deathly pale, after which, like one dying, He directed His eyes upward with His last strength, so that only the whites were visible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The booklet quotes from Dr. Ant. Gutierrez de Cossio in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Adalid Serafico</span><span class="font7"> of Seville the following report of his experience when, in company with another physician, he visited the church with a view to finding some scientific . explanation of the alleged miracles. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I observe the change in His countenance in a clear, distinct and unmistakable manner. The Holy Christ passes over to the real agony, with all the characteristic signs of the dying countenance. His nose becomes peaked; His lips, drawn more tightly, grow more bluish and farther apart. The cheeks appear more emaciated, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and the </span><span class="font5">cheek-bones darker, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">more </span><span class="font5">protruded.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The booklet quotes a writer in the London </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Universe,</span><span class="font7"> giving a leaf from the experiences </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of&quot; </span><span class="font7">Dr. Don Luis Nieto, a sutgeon of Valladolid. We will ask the reader to take special note </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">J this experience of Dr. Nieto, as it affords a </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">due </span><span class="font7">to‘the true explanation of these prodigies, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font7">we will have occasion to refer to it at the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">con-</span><span class="font7">elusion of the article. The item follows: . ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Dr. Nieto had a dream in which the image of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the ‘ </span><span class="font5">Christ of the Agony appeared to him. Moved </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">by thia </span><span class="font5">apparition, he made a pilgrimage to Limpias </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to com- ; </span><span class="font5">pare the vision he had seen with the figure there, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">With </span><span class="font5">which he was unacquainted. What was his astonish- ' ment to find that the eyes moved with the same </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">sweet </span><span class="font5">expression, directing towards him a piercing, penetrai-ing glance as in his dream. The impression caused him \ to lose consciousness for several minutes. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font5">stated </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">that <sup>; </sup></span><span class="font5">he was perfectly familiar with all the details of </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the &quot;&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">church, of which lie had never read even a description.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The booklet takes various items from the Seinana </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">CatoUca,</span><span class="font7"> one of which relates to a child &nbsp;&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">who declares that the figure on the cross said, in &nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Latin the words, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Farce, Domine', parce populo ■ -Tuo,”</span><span class="font7"> which-the child did not understand, but which, translated, means, “Spare, 0 Lord, spare Thy people.” Another relates to the experiences of Reverend P. Martinez, pastor of Baneza Leon, who narrates as follows: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Shortly after Holy Mass, as I was about to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">begin ■'/ </span><span class="font5">my homeward journey, I noticed that the Oyes </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font5">image were animated with life, that they turned </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">now </span><span class="font5">to the right, now to the left, now heavenward. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Then ~ </span><span class="font5">the Holy Christ fixed His gaze directly in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">front, and </span><span class="font5">after that, let His glance sweep around </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">a </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">semi-circle. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“I </span><span class="font5">arose—hitherto I had knelt—changed my </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">position, , </span><span class="font5">and asked others whether they saw anything. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">They.; </span><span class="font5">answered, ‘No.’ I looked again and once more </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">beheld' . the eyes of the image moving like those of a living , person.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> I </span><span class="font5">still mistrusted the apparition, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and a second/ </span><span class="font5">time asked the bystanders whether </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">they saw</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> anything. </span><span class="font5">Again they replied in the negative. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">took other </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">meas</span><span class="font5">ures of precaution—</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">borrowed three different </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">kinds of </span><span class="font5">field-glasses. Each of these </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">used several times, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font5">always beheld the same wonderful phenomena.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Being thus assured, I observed that our Lord’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">gaze </span><span class="font5">turned in every direction, a longer time to the left </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">heavenward. They were sad glances like those of a </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">per- ■ </span><span class="font5">son who tries in every possible </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">manner to assuagetha </span><span class="font5">grief that oppresses him. . . . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- /■ t :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Our Lord raised His eyes pleadingly toward </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">heaven. ... </span><span class="font5">They were so filled with tears that it was difficult: </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font5">J Him to see—a circumstance which I observed </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">twice. </span><span class="font5">Only one look of comfort, or rather of alleviation, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">did I </span><span class="font5">detect on His countenance. ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Finally, after all this, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I saw our Savior move ffi^ </span><span class="font5">lips, open His mouth twice </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">for a deep breath as </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">if to&quot;v</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">side to side. At sight of this, my heart beat so violently that I could, scarcely breathe. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font5">was extremely nervous and for a long time dazed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Readers of The Golden Age who have read in our columns about Russia’s cotton saints, and who know of the thousands of other hoaxes that have been perpetrated by a. money-loving clergy, may smile at the foregoing as. another of the infinite .number of frauds which the Papacy has foisted upon its subjects. Perhaps they are right, but we incline to the thought that there is another and better explanation. That explanation is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Demonism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The demons work upon the mind; this accounts for the fact that some of the people see the image move and other do hot. In the case of Dr. Nieto it is plain that the demons had first made an indelible impression upon his mind while he was asleep; and later, when he saw the image, they had only to repeat and deepen the impression already made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Spirit mediums in India cause their audiences to see a tree grow right before them, and a boy to climb the tree and disappear into thin air. The sight is apparently real to the Jjuman eye, but the camera at a distance of fifty or a hundred feet discloses nothing except the smiling Hindu with his credulous flock standing about him in a gaping circle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Before the image began to move and talk, the church at Limpias was so poor and so poorly attended that its pastor was on the point of <sub>;</sub> closing it. Now it is crowded to the utmost, and the revenues are tremendous.</span></p>

Neither the rays of the electric lights which illumined the body from both sides, nor those from the six candles which shone upward from &quot;• the altar, could reach there.

<p><span class="font14">D</span><span class="font7">O YOU ask why men bind themselves into organizations and sometimes go on strike, enduring suffering and hardships themselves and causing the public great inconvenience! Well, we shall tell you the real secret in the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Back in the dawn of creation a man and a woman stepped fresh from the hands of their Creator. They were perfect in form and feature and lovely beyond degree. They were placed in a beautiful garden, where the hands ---of a wise Creator had graciously provided everything for their comfort and well-being. They were given power to produce a perfect </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">race </span><span class="font7">of people, and. the divine injunction was </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font7">“multiply and fill the earth.’’ The only restriction placed upon this happy couple was that of perfect obedience. This they failed to render, and as a consequence were driven from their Eden home out into a cruel world to battle against its poisonous elements and to eat bread by sweat of face until they returned to dust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Had Adam and Eve remained obedient to their Creator, as their family increased they would have extended the borders of the garden until it embraced the whole earth; and such things as sin, sorrow, sickness and death would be unknown to the human family. And today, instead of a world filled with selfishness, strife and revolution, we would be enjoying a world</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">wide paradise, filled with happy men and women. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Who is responsible for this unhappy state of affairs? Satan, the god of this evil order of things. Before his expulsion from the courts of heaven he was a beautiful angelic being. The Bible declares that it was his pride and ambition that caused his downfall. He conceived the idea of a world empire for hiniself by corrupt. ing the human race at its very fountain head. This he succeeded in doing, thereby enacting the greatest tragedy of all time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ever since that fateful day it has been the desire of man to live from off the labor of the other fellow and, if possible, to hold his brother in a state of bondage, for long centuries it was lawful for one man to ’ own another; and, strange to say, the source whence that right came was never questioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Finally there came upon the stage of human action an humble Carpenter who taught a gospel of love and simplicity destined to shake society to its foundations. Whether this Man was a member of a labor organization or not, the records do not state; but we do know that he was a friend of labor. He gathered about ■ him a handful of ignorant, unlearned men and so taught them as to stamp lasting impressions upon their minds. His promulgation of the Golden Rule started a chain of thoughts percolating through the minds of men; and soon the humble bond-slave began to ask this question: “Why should another man own me?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The history of the fight for freedom and liberty is a long one, filled with oppression, crime, • and bloodshed. When the American government was established with its wonderful document guaranteeing freedom of thought, speech, and religion, our shores became the Mecca for the down-trodden and oppressed of every land. America was hailed as the land of promise by millions of noble sons who found refuge on broad acres upon its hospitable shores. But as it was in the days of the prophet Job, when the lovers of truth'and righteousness came to present themselves before God, Satan came also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No sooner had the yoke of British tyranny been thrown off and the guns ceased firing around Yorktown, than there began the development of that spirit of selfishment among the American people that has so prominently marked the English-speaking people for centuries. As a result, we find ourselves today in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">grip of a monster whose greed knows no bounds, y and whose interest is served by the very devilf^ hiniself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;„</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is mapy a stain upon, the^pggps+jg^ . y America’s industrial history that wilt ever «®e-main a disgrace to a nation calling itself civil,-?: f ized. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>;</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is injustice and oppression, and the knowledge that they are not getting a square deal, that causes men to bind themselves into unions and exert their economic power in order to force ■ big business to pay a living wage or put into operation working conditions that are bearable.. &gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What is the final remedy for strikes? you ask. . And what is the meaning of the trouble and distress upon the nations of earth today? The v<sup>7 </sup>humble Carpenter who made such an impression upon the minds of His followers also taught ' them to pray: “Our Father which art in ■ heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth, as it is done in heaven.” All down through the age there have been some honest hearts who have continued to ■ pray this prayer, and who have looked for the &lt;&nbsp;time when this kingdom would be established. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bible shows this humble Carpenter to be -the Son of God—the Ransom-price for Adam, who had been justly sentenced to death for his '• disobedience back in the Garden of Eden. This Carpenter gave His life a ransom for all. Ths Bible shows that forty years before the estahp ' lishment of His glorious kingdom, Jesus would &gt;&nbsp;be present in the earth, yet unobserved by all A but a special class—“a little flock.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus said that His kingdom would be set up C during a time of great trouble and distress upon \ the nations; that men’s hearts would fail them' &quot;. for fear, and for looking after the things which are coming upon the earth. He said that the -1 nations would be angry and engaged in ths -bloodiest war of all history; that this war would ’ be followed by famine, pestilences, and great social upheavals which would culminate in anarchy of the most violent form; and that unless those days were shortened the human race wotdd '* destroy itself from the face of the earth. ' <sup>r</sup> *</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bible declares that after all the selfish &gt;&nbsp;schemes of man have been given a thorough test, his pride broken and his heart humbled in the great time of trouble, he will be ready </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font7">God’s message and the application of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">His reMH </span><span class="font7">edy—“that ye love one another?’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font7">Bible shows that the kingdom to be es-_ tablished on<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark24">1</a></sup> the ruins of these earthly govern-R ments, is a kingdom of joy, peace and righteousness. It will be a kingdom in which the earnest-hearted, toiling masses of men will prosper and not the profiteers. It will be a kingdom in which no giant trust or corporation will exist for the purpose of oppressing the people. Satan, the chief oppressor, with all his ' wicked influence, is to be restrained for a period </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">one thousand years; and during that time all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Prophet declares that in that day the people shall enjoy the works of their own hands. ’ - They shall not labor in vain nor bring forth for v” trouble. And as a reward to those who have ’ faith in this glorious kingdom, in which Edenic conditions are to be restored, and sin in all its degrading influence forever blotted out, the writer of Revelation (chapter 21:3-5) lifts the curtain and in these beautiful words .gives us </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">vision of the glorious conditions that will prevail upon the earth: “Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God; and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes: and there shall be no more death; neither sorrow,. nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.&quot; This will include strikes, lockouts, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The only remedy for strikes and for the present unhappy condition of society is the establishment of this long-promised kingdom in which men will practise the Golden Rule, instead of the Rule of Gold. So let all who have <sup>1 </sup>faith in the divine promises rejoice in the fact that just beyond the dark clouds of trouble lies the Golden Age—God’s kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font7">DO NOT claim to be a Bible Student after the manner of the I. B. S. A., but I do appreciate the pungent truths that you give to the world.

<p><span class="font7">At that time I knew nothing of the teachings of the Bible Students or of the works of the late Pastor Russell but I told people, when the .first crash of the World War was heard in 1914, that this civilization had reached its height and that from then on there would be trouble until the Son of God should be revealed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I could never understand the doctrine of the destruction of the earth, as I saw that this earth the footstool of God, and that Jerusalem is </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">City of the great King.

<p><span class="font7">Before I knew about the slogan “Millions now living will never die,” so certain was I of the incoming kingdom that I had prayed that if it were God's will, I might live until my eyes should behold our Lord coming in His kingdom.

<h5><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Growing Old Gracefully </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By Benjamin H. Boyd</span></h5>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE thought of growing old is to many an unpleasant one. They love to think of youth, with its overflowing, bounding energy, its vivacity, it's rosy outlook on life, its freedom from care and worry, and its ability’ to throw off what cares it has. Still others think that grow' ing old is a matter of fact, and treat it as one of • the inevitables. They think that it is useless to worry about what cannot be helped, and so feel that they should enjoy life while they may—“It ' will be time enough to think of bld age when it ' conies.” A smaller class think of old age as a time of accumulated wisdom, when, after a life well spent, one can step aside to let others enter the world's busy activities, and yet be interested in all that is going on, though not a participator, being sought after more as a sage for advice and wisdom. Such was the reason why old men composed the senate of ancient Rome— that the city might be guided by their wisdom and experience, and kept from hasty blunders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Would that the modern world recognized and respected the experience and wisdom of the aged, instead of entrusting the guidance of the nation to those whose experience is small or at least not yet ripened into wisdom. Youth and middle age are too impulsive and too full of folly to be entrusted with the w’elfare of any nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In spite of the disrespect characteristic of modern times, it is yet true that the silvered head is a citadel of majesty. The Israelites of old were commanded to “rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man.” “Honor thy father and thy mother, that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">thy </span><span class="font7">days may be long in the laud which the Lord thy God giveth thee.” When the wisdom of the Creator is pictured in Daniel’s prophecy, He is called the Ancient of Days, and is pictured with white hair. Jesus, also, in the New Testament is pictured in glory with white hair, to represent the wisdom of accumulated experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In old age itself there is nothing to be desired. All the powers of mind and body are failing, and helplessness closes in upon the individual as does darkness after the set of sun. So if one has not built up a treasure of wisdom and of relationship to his Creator (for the reverence of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom), old age is extremely undesirable. Old friends are gone; the new generation is out of sympathy; and one feels out of place, like the last rose of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">summer and the last leaf on the tree. If, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ho</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">w</span><span class="font7">ever, one has built up treasures of wisdom </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">anA'&quot; g </span><span class="font7">knowledge, then the wise seek such </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">out forin- ' </span><span class="font7">struction; and God’s companionship </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>;</sup>makes»the </span><span class="font7">failing of one’s abilities but the</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">-gradual and \ ; </span><span class="font7">peaceful yielding of life itself to Him for a long \ rest, till He shall call us forth again from the * tomb in greater strength and majesty. So the closing advice of a wise man gained from expe- ■ rience is (Ecclesiastes 12): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Remember </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">now</span><span class="font7"> thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not. nor the -years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no ; pleasure in them.” Those who have lived in companionship with their Creator invariably wish they had started to know Him earlier in ' life. The years before that time seem but lost years. Wise are they who start to know God in their youth, while vigor and strength enable ( them to build up treasures which old age cannot Y fade, and before the evil days of physical de- • cline and infirmity have overtaken them. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or ? the stars be not darkened”—before physical and -mental vision fail, w<sup>r</sup>hile yet the eyes ami ears : can drink in the Creator’s messages in nature, and observe their grandeur and hence have rich, Y deep communion for many years. To those who ' know' their Creator, the earth is full of wonders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">and beauty. As David said: “O Lord, how naan- ' if old are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made &gt;&nbsp;them all; the earth is full of thy riches.” “Or the clouds return after the rain.” Old age can- „■ not, as youth does, renew its vigor after </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> siege of sickness or trouble; its buoyancy has gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“In the day when the keepers of the house tremble.” These keepers are the arms, the house being the body. All have noticed the trembling hands and arms of the aged. “And the strong men bow themselves.” The strong men are the lower limbs, and this refers to the -bent knees and tottering steps of old age. “And the grinders cease because they are few.” The . few remaining teeth cease to grind the food properly. “And those that look [the mental '■ faculties] out of the windows [the eyes] be. darkened. ’ ’ All know the bright eye and quick : mind of youth, and also the dim eye and fading memory and slow thought‘of old age.: The sun . of life is setting, and the darkness of evening settles over the faculties. “And the doors [the; ... ears] shall be shut [become deaf] in the streets 8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.

<p><span class="font7">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;powers cease to catch the strains of earthly en-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">- &nbsp;chantments. The members of the body do not</span></p>

[The translation by Isaac Leeser renders this passage—<sup>4</sup> the almond ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tree,will refuse its blossom.’ In early times the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">almond tree was a sign of spring, and of re-‘ newal of life and vigor and. warmth, it being one of the earliest to blossom. So here is represented that old age has no hope of refreshment and renewed vigor, the body will not replace its decay, and hence hope and brightness fade.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The grasshopper shall fie a burden [literally ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•—shall drag itself along—illustrating the labor,</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">“Or ever the silver cord [of life] be </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">loosed </span><span class="font7">[we lose our hold on life]; or the golden bowl be broken [the body which contains the precious life blood be broken down in decay]; or the ‘ pitcher [the lungs which draw in life from the fountain, the surrounding atmosphere] be, bro- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ $</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">“Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was [when the body can no longer perform its office, the dust, or elements of which it is made, returns to the earth as it was—mere inanimate dust]: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.

<p><span class="font7">The being has then died; but in the memory, of God remains the full record, and injhe resurrection morning He will reawaken the soul : from its sleep of death (Daniel 12: 2), and with a suitable body give it life and consciousness once more.

<p><span class="font7">“Let us hear the conclusion of the whole mat- -ter: Fear God and keep his commandments;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">for this is the whole duty of man.” God simply requires obedience to His law<sup>T</sup> in all its applications. This law, as the Master stated, is to love God with all one’s heart [the affections’must center on God.

<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font7"> MAKER of epigrams once said: “Man is a creature of circumstance and environment.”^ And it is these circumstances and environments which influence the individual’s outlook on life generally. This'is true, not only of the present generation, but of all generations. Time was when the so-called under-dog accept</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ed </span><span class="font7">his condition as the natural course of human events.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is only within the last one hundred years </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font7">so that the human race as a whole has been doing its own thinking. For thousands of years the race has had its thinking done by professional thinkers, and has been guided and governed by their deductions; and these professional thinkers have invariably named the price of their services, and their price generally was ’the servitude of those for whom they did the thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Every man has his price” is the expression of those who have been disillusioned and embittered oy the intensity of the struggle for existence, the basis of which is three meals a day and a place to sleep—and “keeping the wolf from the door” has beconie a proverb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It will be observed that during this last period </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">one hundred years while the race has been doing its own thinking, no really new ideas or theories have been brought out. By ideas and theories I do not refer to the great increase of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">knowledge along mechanical and inventive lines,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">but rather in the relations of men to each, other, to their origin and destiny, and to. their Creator. -<sup>Ci </sup>Every idea or theory presented during the last . ■■■'.&lt; one hundred years is something old as the hills, but camouflaged to make it appear new. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;? .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Take the modern theory of evolution as an -- • '■ instance; that is the old Grecian theory or spec-' ulation respecting the constitution of matter ‘ and the origin of things in general, taught by&quot; Empedocles and Democritus. The increase of knowledge, together with the sum of all the ; learning and experience of all the past genera- ■ tions, is supposed to lend a little color to the’ ' modern evolutionist idea of the “brain age.” &quot;&nbsp;- 3*</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It will be further noticed that during this 10^-'' -, year period under consideration, in spite of the . great increase of knowledge, the human race • &lt;&nbsp;has been getting more and more restless and -discontented. As the knowledge increases, so - — does the discontent; one keeps pace with the -other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The old ideas and theories are now for the., first time being really tested out. Was the di- '■■■» vine right of kings a real, or a fancied righj^ If the divine right of kings is right, &amp;<sub>:</sub>republwM . is all wrong; and vice versa. The deductions of . the afore-mentioned professional thinkers </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;are </span><span class="font7">going to pieces, “The history of the world is <sup>1 </sup>an account of the growth among mankind of the. • - jV consciousness of freedom for the race.” . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">For ages kings were the law and they had ‘.^^</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;” /'.-I</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">their day. Side by side with them were limited monarchies, and they had their day. Then came</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">[ &quot;the idea of government of, for, and by the peo-|? pie; and representative government is breaking ‘. d&amp;tM‘'‘THe Madrid Ms‘had the wool pulled over ? if$‘<sup>!J</sup>dyeS fco^tiauch that every new scheme is : • looked upon as just another method of shearing &quot;&nbsp;■ the sheep.,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">i'</span><span class="font7"> One result of all this is the setting up of'a false standard, and every person not in sympa-;• thy with this false standard is branded as a Bolshevist. Hence the radical and the agitator have, a large following. The Socialist is a prod’’ uct of this false standard. I do not mean that the standard of the Socialist is a vicious one, ■ ■ but that Socialism is merely a symptom of a j diseased condition of society. If equality and <sup>J</sup> cooperation were established facts, Socialism would automatically disappear, in the same way ■- thM when the cause of a dis'ease of the human body is removed, the symptoms disappear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Train up a child in the way he should go, &quot;&nbsp;and when he is old he will not depart from it,” ' and “the love of money is the root of all evil”— <sup>k</sup> besides being Bible, these are good common ■ sense maxims. Even so, one trouble in the .. world today is the lack of common sense, and _ the commercializing -of the faculties, the emotions, and the abilities of the individual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">~ A way out of all these distressing conditions, - together with an amicable adjustment of affairs <sup>1</sup> generally, has been sought of all the prominent men who have acquired some distinction in the . world of affairs that is now going to pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is just like a man in the water, out of his depth, trying to take lessons in swimming from a man who is drowning. What kind of advice can a multi-millionaire offer for the adjustment of conditions and circumstances, after he has spent his life taking advantage of those conditions and circumstances to feather his own nest ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another illustration of this is to ask the man . who set the straw-pile afire how to put the fire out. People somehow have it in their heads that the man who has been astute enough to acquire a monoply of the wealth of the world is the man to lead the world back -to “normalcy.” Yes—by the nose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Years ago people fought singly until some’ body said: ‘ * Unity is strength. ’ ’ So they joined hands. The idea of the strength of unity is also being tested out. We had a world-wide illustra-&lt; tion of that idea for </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">four awful, solid years— </span><span class="font7">the triple alliance and the triple entente; and in the light of things as they stand today, not as they stood on November 11, 1918, but as they stand today, who won the war ? Is unity strength? The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">weakness</span><span class="font7"> of Germany was its </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">strength.</span><span class="font7"> This is true of all the nation^ eo. gaged in that war. <sup>h</sup> ■Vv‘<sup>?</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From one extreme go to the other. Consider a baby. What is a baby’s strength? Its helplessness, its weakness, is its strength. Everybody is its friend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The same thing applies today to the railroaders and the miners. The railroad corporations and the coal operators—their strength is their weakness. When the coal is all gone, and snow flies, and the railroads are not turning a wheel, who is the sufferer?. The public. And who is , the public? The coal operators, the miners, the railroad corporations, the railway men, and a goodly portion of the other people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Unity is strength. Years ago a certain man, becoming embittered over the death of his wife, printed a motto, which he hung over the mantel in his library—“All things come by chance.” Twenty years later, after he had had time to think it over, he added the one word, “Per- ' haps.” Unity is strength—perhaps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The triple alliance and the triple entente turned out to be a snare. The coal operators’ combine, ’the miners’ union, the railroad corporations, the shopmen, and the Big Four are turning out to be another snare. It’s all right to be wise after the event. Any simpleton can lock the stable door when the horse is gone. Yes, but these things were all foretold in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Zechariah 8:10, speaking of the return of the Jews to Palestine in great numbers, the prophet said: “For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither peace to him that went out or came in, because of the affliction; for I set all men every one against his neighbor.” If all these things that are happening in the world today were foretold in the Bible, why did not the ministers explain them? ’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here was the ministers’ opportunity. There have been two courses open to them: (1) To take sides in the controversy; (2) To stand aloof, and expound the Word of God, show the world the trouble coming, and point to the kingdom of God beyond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The records show that the ministers, the clergy, instead of expounding the.Word of God, have largely turned infidel and evolutionist; they took sides in the large, international controversy, triple alliance versus triple entente, and are now taking sides in the internal controversy. Some are for labor, some are for capital; but how many are for the Bible, the Word of God?</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">And the world knows it, and the clergy know that the world knows it, and the world knows that the clergy know that the world knows it. Do not take the writer’s word for it. Lookjip the church notices and reports of sermons in the newspapers for the last ten or twenty years, and see how the clergy have turned infidel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mr. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Roger</span><span class="font7"> Babson, publicist and statistician for the B. B.’g, big business, went on record by saying that if the Christian church (that is, the big church, with the clergy at the head of it) could not save the world, the world was done for. The Christian church referred to (the big church—Catholic and Protestant) is in the same boat with the B. B.’s; it has taken advantage of prevailing conditions and circumstances to feather its own nest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I do not \vant to be understood as inferring that the clergy have made fortunes at their business of preaching; for some of the clergy are as poor as church mice. But, as a class, they have stood in with big business. While the big bees were feathering their nest, the clergy kowtowed. Big church would have a slim living without the Busy Bees. Big politics could hardly'get along without the Busy Bees and the Busy Cees. And the Busy Bees would have a fat chance without the Big Pees and the Busy Cees. Who set the house afire? Who qan put the fire out?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If people really knew what to do and how to do it, it would not take a great while to get out of the mess, out of the slough of despond. But the people do not know.' As the Bible says —the “people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.”—Hosea 4:6.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HEBE is just one way out of the mess, and only one.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The fact of the matter is: For thousands </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">1 years' the world has been fed upon lies and misunderstandings; and these .lies and misunderT ' standings have been so skilfully presented </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and“ </span><span class="font7">mixed with a little truth, that the whole </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">world </span><span class="font7">Z has been deceived.

<p><span class="font7">I refer to:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The Bible—the oldest book in existence; it has out- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">lived the storms of thirty centuries. Men have endeav- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ored by every means possible to banish it from the'f<sup>r</sup> &quot;0 of the earth: they have hidden it, burned it, made it a L crime punishable with death to have it in possession, - -and the most bitter and relentless persecutions have been ,; : ■ waged against those who had faith in it; but still the „ book lives. Today, while many of its foes slumber in ‘4 death, and hundreds of volumes written to discredit it and to overthrow its influence, are long since forgotten, -y the Bible has found its way into every nation and language of earth, over two hundred different translations • of it having been made. The fact that this book has survived so many centuries, notwithstanding such unparalleled efforts to banish and destroy it, is at least ' strong circumstantial evidence that the great Being , whom it claims as its Author has also been its Preserver.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the Bible will be found the great laws of the universe, besides the origin and the destiny. ‘ ; i of man; in fact, almost any sensible question </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a / -</span><span class="font7">man might ask is answered in its pages. Every ' * condition of man is depicted in it—the fool, the &lt;&nbsp;wise man, the rich, the poor, the high and the &lt;&nbsp;low, young and old, small and great, sick and ,, well—any condition is shown in its pages. &amp;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is the letter and the spirit of law. This is manifest in the laws of the land. The observ- , &lt;&nbsp;ance or violation of law by the individual ia . intelligent rather than mechanical, whether the law is universal or national.

<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font7">HE first social unit was the family, whose male head was supreme authority in deciding ■ ■ all common interests. For mutual protection and benefit families combined to form tribes, i whose chiefs assumed titles to all lands and prerogatives; and tribal members had to’pay trib-' ute to them for the use of the land and natural ; . , resources and to pledge their lives to their service in battle in case war was declared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">’ &nbsp;&nbsp;' In event a neighboring tribe was invaded and</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">conquered, its lands and natural trade resources . were divided among favorite and influential lead-■ ers who maintained their assumed prerogatives by means of deceptive lying propaganda. Spe-’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. cious arguments and data are employed to con</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The entire world-population could be placed in Brazil and its density of population would be more than twenty percent less than that of Belgium at the present time. In round numbers the world-population is 1,600,000,000. Brazil has an area of 3,218,000 square miles. Belgium has a population of 6,815,054, an area of 11,400 square miles, and a population of 597.8 on each square mile. With natural law recognized and honored, over-population is impossible, and famine anywhere is due solely to an exercise of man’s vicious propensities in violating natural laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Land and natural resources are the common heritage of all mankind. Man has no natural right or title to land and natural resources not essential to his material well-being. A monoply of unneeded natural resources is a violation of natural law, a vicious crime against social order, and the prolific progenitor of crimes and famine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The English Duke of Devonshire is reported as owning (!) 186,000 acres, 290 square miles of land, a territory large enough to.sustain 173,130 of Belgium’s population. Add to.This,millions of great thefts all over the world; and we can realize the cause of social unrest and why gaunt famine stalks the earth, surrounded by a superabundance of natural resources. Nature’s children have been robbed of their birthrights.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7"><sup>f</sup> ' an equivalent in exchange. Possession and use ■ <sub>t</sub> for needed service constitute the only just and valid title to land and undeveloped natural re-;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. “The law of demand and supply” as comr &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;monly used is veriest tommyrot. Demand and</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">supply are natural functions and never vary in service unless obstructed by man. Nature creates demand and her supply is inexhaustible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">* &nbsp;&nbsp;. Nature makes me hungry and creates a demand</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">for food. Nature is the prolific mother of all ' . demands, great and small.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have an urging, crying demand for good ”■ roads. That demand has been vocal and increasing in intensity for many years. We have the labor, machinery, tools, raw material in superabundance, all begging for useful employment for the common weal. Why do we not employ « our resources and labor for our common benefit? &lt;&nbsp;Because the representatives of big business have hired us to catch driftwood on shares, and pay us with a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">very small part of our own products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When land and natural resources are restored to the unrestricted service of humanity as designed by Nature, normalcy and stability will ’ be established, militarism will disappear, and peace and plenty will reign supreme. When all healthy men and women have to give an equivalent in social or industrial energy for the prop<sup>?</sup> erty they enjoy, society will always have a surplus, and famines will be unknown.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Dr. Irving Fisher, Social Economist of Yale, .counselor of Congress and the Administration, <sup>r</sup> has written a book of about 400 pages, “ Stabilization of the Dollar,” on a standard for com-mereiaL values, without telling us what commer-' cial value is or defining the character and com. position of a standard so that one would know one if one met it in the road.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. In The Golden Age of April 14, 1920, I discussed the Immutable Law of Standards, their character and composition, and how correctly . to determine the standard for any class of units.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font7">standard is the sum total of all units of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">given kind or class. Eternity, Gravity, Altitude, and Space include all units of time, weight, height, and capacity. The commercial’standard <sub>v </sub>embraces all units or factors of human industry S or enterprise. Gold is only one unit or product’ of human energy or industry; while the Stand</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark35"><span class="font7">ard of Commercial Values must include all</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark36"><span class="font7">units or products of human energy, just a^ the</span></a></p>

<p><span class="font7">With a defined unit or product of any kind for comparison we can determine the exact value . '' A of any other unit of the same kind. With an ounce product or unit of steam energy for comparison, we can exactly define all grades and . degrees of steam products or units.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dynamos and engines are of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">many</span><span class="font7"> grades or &lt;&nbsp;capacities, and different grades are defined by their results or products without consideration of time in operation. A two-horse engine will last as long in operation perhaps as a hundredhorse engine, but their results will widely differ. Men are human dynamos or engines of many and widely varying capacities, and the only way to judge correctly their limitations is by things done. “Hours labor” defines nothing—arrant nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When we recognize and employ Nature’s standard of values and issue currency based on units of labor energies in different denominations we shall have scientific, stable, automatic, self-adjusting currency subject to neither inflation por deflation. Then we shall quit catching driftwood on shares.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Democracy is a term employed merely to tickle the public fancy without any intention of applying its meaning to social affairs. Some seventy-five years ago Thos. H. Benton said: “The individual citizen and taxpayer has about as much to say in naming candidates and framing statutes for his own government as the subject of a monarchy has to say in designating the <sub>; </sub>sex of the child that shall be born to rule over . him.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">i We started on our military career about forty </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">years </span><span class="font7">ago by declaring ourselves a world power;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">* ’ and th*e press and Gen. Miles demanded a standi, in£ army of at least 65,000 men. The public did ' - nut enthuse to the idea; so we discovered Spanish cruelty in Cuba and howled ourselves hoarse </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">about Weylerism, </span><span class="font7">declaring by emphatic impli</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">cation that </span><span class="font7">the high sense of honor and virtue </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">the United States would npt permit it to indulge in such cruelty, though we had set the boys. Our officials and editors knew that Spain and Cuba employed no mines in their warfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is a peculiar incident that of the complement of thirty-two officers reported belonging , to the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Maine</span><span class="font7"> it was stated only two minor officers went down with the ship; the others were attending a party on another ship. Another very peculiar circiunstance is that when the water was pumped from the coffer-dam surrounding the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Maine</span><span class="font7"> it was discovered without investigation that the coal bunkers were blown away from the ship by an explosion from inside instead of being blown into the ship by an explosion from the outside. To avoid prying • investigation the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Maine</span><span class="font7"> with all her valuable . material was taken out into deep water and sunk. No well-informed man today will even intimate that Spain sunk the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Maine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of course the Spaniards and Armour’sj?ow-ell-processed meat killed a lot of our boys, but the confiscators got over a billion in bonds and a fair start in militarism. Other confiscators took the perquisites while the dear public got the bitter experience and the expense. Tribal policies are still pursued by governments. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For forty years prior to the World War our officials and editors told us that all Europe was an armed camp and that any pretext was likely to start a carnival of war. In 1911 war was narrowly averted with France as the aggressor. Again, they told us by implication that' Germany alone for forty years had been preparing for war and only waited a propitious moment. At the same time for years the official records of England, Russia, and France showed far greater war appropriations than indulged in by Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Again, we implied by iteration and reiteration that in 1870 Germany had maliciously invaded France and taken Alsace-Lorraine and a billion dollars as indemnity. The truth is that in 1870 Isabella of Spain had been deposed, and the Spanish crown was offered to Prince </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Hohen-</span><span class="font7">zollern, who refused it. France asserted that that rejected offer was an insult to her </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">people</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">and a menace to her institutions, mobilized her army, invaded Germany, and captured Saar-bruck. Von Moltke got busy and “licked the stuffin’ ” out of France, as she richly deserved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our virtuous officials and editors told us the World War was a fight of right against might. The fact is, however, that, leaving out the other members of the Entente, the British empire had a population of 440,000,000; Russia 180,000,000; France 90,000,000; while the Central Allies all told had a population of 162,000,000, or less than one to four of the Entente. Instead of boasting, the various military leaders should hide their heads in shame in facing their accomplishments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was thought impossible for Germany to win against such odds. Morgan was financial agent here for the Entente. Armour, Dupont, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al,<sub>t</sub></span><span class="font7"> credited it with supplies. We loaned it $380,000,000. While editors and officials kept asserting our neutrality, they thought it safe to violate it in favor of the Entente, and did so. When we declared war they said that it was fight or pay big indemnities, frankly confessing that they had been lying to us for nearly three years. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Entente boasted that it was fighting for ■ Democracy, to put down militarism, and not fighting German citizens or for annexations and Indemnities. Their actions have given the lie to their utterance. We howled about the execution of Edith Cavel, called it murder, assassination, but did not recall our murder of Mrs. John H. Surratt at the close of the Civil War. After the Armistice our editors and officials discovered that they had lied and that Germany’s execution of Edith Cavel was lawful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We boasted loudly of our virtues and our fidelity to our contracts, and intimated that only Germany' regarded her sacred contracts as '‘scraps of paper.” Yet we took over about 25,000 copyrights and patents of German citizens, paid for by them; and in our recorded covenants or contracts with those citizens we sacredly agreed to guard their legal rights as defined in those covenants, only to convert them into 25,000 “ scraps of, paper. ” Yet we had boasted that we expected no material benefits from the war, though we have confiscated millions in German property, shipping, patents, etc., in contradiction of our statements to world citizenry. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These -perquisites have all gone to big business, and the general public reaps nothing but</span></p><img src="g_E_19221220_files/g_E_19221220-6.png" alt="" style="width:18pt;height:21pt;">

<p><span class="font7">Nearly every paper we picked-up fdrmonthsdfa &lt;•/:&gt; after our entrance into the war told us of peo^ '<sup>-</sup>* '' pie tarred and feathered, hanged, beaten by • ~ mobs; and papers, and officials referred to these criminal mob members as patriots.

<p><span class="font15" style="font-variant:small-caps;">E</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">lectricity is a discovery of comparatively recent date. Two hundred and fifty years </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ago</span><span class="font7"> it was unknown, probably undreamed</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Electrons are of still more recent date in the history of discoveries. In “The A B C of Radio,” we read:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Scientists conceive that the whole world, the chair on which you are sitting, you yourself, everything is composed of what they have agreed to call ‘electrons.’ Electricity is also composed of electrons. Therefore matter and electricity are one and the same. It is hard <sup>1</sup> to realize that this is so; and yet, the evidence that it is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">so </span><span class="font5">is striking. Ever? atoms, which were once supposed to be the smallest conceivable bits of matter, are composed of electrons. A complicated atom like that of gold, for ’ example, is like an infinitesimal solar system. It con</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">sists </span><span class="font5">of a central nucleus, like our sun, around which revolve electrons, much as if they were planets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Each atom of -matter—copper, rubber, water—has </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">just </span><span class="font5">so many electrons and no more. As long as it has </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">its </span><span class="font5">proper number, no one would know that it had any whatever, so far as any electrical effects are concerned. That is why a chair or a book seems so unelectrical. But all substances may be deprived of electrons or may re-</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">'-. Scriptures,” Vol 6, page 23), says: ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Starting with the condition mentioned in Genesis 1: 2, 'Now the earth was,’ waste and empty and dark, the wise will not attempt to guess that which God has not revealed respecting how He previously gathered together earth’s atoms. Things unrevealed belong to God, ami we do well to wait patiently for His further revelations in due time. Taking pick and shovel and a critical eye, man has found that the earth’s crust is composed of various layers, or strata, one over the other, all of Which give evidence of having once been soft and moist— except the basic rocks upon which these layers, or strata, are, with more or less regularity, built. These basic rocks indicate clearly that they were once soft and fluid from intense heat; and scientists generally agree that not a great way below the 'crust’ the earth is still hot and molten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Since these basic, igneous rocks—granite, basalt, etc. -—must at one time have been so hot as to drive out of them all combustible elements, and since they are the bottom rocks, we are safe in concluding that there was a period when the whole earth was at a white heat. At that time,, it is reasoned, water and minerals (now found in the upper layers, or strata, laid down in water) must have been driven off as gases; and must have constituted -an impenetrable canopy extending for miles around the earth in every direction. The motion of the earth upon distant rings would gradually acquire a different rota* <sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">live motion from that of the earth and thus gravitate closer and closer to her. One after another these were precipitated upon the earth’s surface. After the formation of the ‘firmament,’ or ‘expanse,’ or ‘atmosphere,’ . these deluges, from descending ‘rings’ would naturally reach the earth from the direction of the two poles, whe'te thhfe would be lea^t resistance, because farthest froih'tire<sup>7</sup>, equator,'the center of the centrifugal force of the earth’s motion. The'breaking down of these ‘rings,’ long periods apart, furnished numerous deluges, and piled strata upon strata over the earth’s'surface. The rush of waters from the. poles toward the equator would distribute variously the sand and mud and minerals, the water strongly mineralized thus covering the entire surface of the earth, just as described at the beginning of the'narrative of Genesis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“During each of these long ‘days,’ of seven thousand years each, a certain work progressed, as told in Genesis; each possibly ending with a deluge which worked radical changes and prepared the way for still further steps of creation and preparation for man. This Vailian theory assumes that the last of these ‘rings’, was freest from minerals and all impurities—pure water; that it had not yet broken and come down in the day of Adam’s creation but that it completely overspread the earth as a translucent vail above the atmosphere. It served, as does the whitened glass of a hot house, to equalize the temperature—so that the climate at the poles would be little, if any, different from that at the equator.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From William F. Hudgings’ “Introduction to Einstein and Universal Relativity” we read:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“All formal matter is made up of molecules, and molecules consist of atoms of varying elements, except where the substance is wholly elementary in nature, in which case the molecules are made up of a certain number of atoms of the same elements. An atom is an aggregation of negatively charged electrons which revolve around a center nucleus which is apparently charged positively. Electrons are believed to be identical in all forms of matter, but not all atoms contain the samemumber of electrons. It is the number of electrons per atom that apparently constitutes the difference between elements. Hence every known form of matter, if reduced to the electronic state, would be found to consist of the same ■ “ original stuff. Light and electricity, therefore, may be termed free electrons, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.,</span><span class="font5"> electrons which are not bound into atoms, and consequently glide off in every direction at the highest possible velocity of which matter is capable, viz., 186,300 miles per second.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Thus it may be seen that all other forms of matter, since they consist of electrons in the atomic or ‘bound’ state, could not possess a velocity equal to that of free electrons. But electrons do not become ‘freed’ simply </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font5">reason of matter undergoing a change of form. Water, for instance, may be changed into a solid (ice) or </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">into </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gas</span><span class="font5"> (steam), but the electrons continue to revolve around </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">their nucleus in true atomic order, and the atoms con</span><span class="font5">tinue to hold together in the molecular state, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the only.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">change being in their rate of vibration, which affects </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the^«K </span><span class="font5">degree of elasticity between the molecules and bet&amp;tar”^^ atoms. Hdnce whether water be in the solid, ‘liqtiid: gaseous state, the molecules thereof will be</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">each consisting of two atoms'-bf hycfrogStaftaAd oheriatfiaii of oxygen gas; However, when ’ matter is being*' burned up, producing a flame or a glow of light, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">thia- </span><span class="font5">t -phenomenon indicates that some of the electrons </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">have, ' </span><span class="font5">been freed from their atomic condition and have started ■. -J off on their journey in the form of light rays, while </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">an- . / </span><span class="font5">other portioirof them remain bound as atoms but undergo a change of form, becoming either gas or ashes.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">F</span><span class="font7">ROM time to time I have read articles in your magazine that give the writers’ ideas</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of the new age about to dawn; and automobiles, airplanes, and other modern inventions are mentioned as part of the new age. See article </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font7">Harriet J. Hanson, in No. 75, pages 694-696.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The idea raises a question in my mind: If there are to be these things in the new age, would it not necessitate a large number of workers, and factories, to say nothing of the needed oil, and all the workers required to produce it; and would not the whole thing resemble the days of Satan’s empire? The Scriptures promise blessings such as eye hath not seen, and which surpass the imagination. If this is so, then, automobiles, biplanes, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">et al,</span><span class="font7"> would seem paltry beside this array of choice blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are told that there is to be a new heaven iie^ earth ; and I wonder how they could be strictly new if the old things are to remain. We are told also that the former times will not </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font7">remembered. With all these machines in our midst in the hew age we would have constant reminders of the Deceiver’s empire.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">■r</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">ises. Thus the woman with an issue of blood was in tune with Jesus—she had faith—and, touching the hem of His garment, virtue—elec-tfons—went out of Him and she was healed. As electricity has a tendency to equalize itself as. between two poles, so Jesus’ vitality w$g so nearly expended in the three and one-half'years of His ministry that at the close of that time He * was so weak that He could not bear His cross. “Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.”—Isaiah 53: 4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The healing which Jesus did at His first advent was a picture of the work of the Golden Age, when “the Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing in his wings.” He will bring all the willing and obedient of mankind up to a condition of physical perfection. In this condition they will be turned over to the heavenly Father, Jehovah. At that time they will each have an individual trial and Jehovah will pronounce them worthy or unworthy of life everlasting. “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of [Jehovah] God is eternal life.” posed had not the first pair sinned, then we are led to wonder whether mother Eve and father Adam would have been given such modern inventions as the auto, etc. It seems to me that the things of God will be far more perfect than any of the things of the present evil world; and it hardly seems possible that the inventions of today will be carried over into the day when every tongue shall praise Him. Is it not more ♦ reasonable to suppose that all these grand blesSings shall come through God’s agency—Nature? For natural things far surpass things artificial.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">H</span><span class="font7">AVING- been a trained nurse for some years, and connected with various institutions, I am submitting some suggestions along ■ the lines of proper food for those suffering from certain diseases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">First, have a correct diagnosis of your trouble, and eat accordingly. In cases of organic heart trouble, and where one is recovering from some serious illness, such as diphtheria or typhoid fever, one should refrain from eating much’ at a time, as a full stomach crowds the heart and makes one feel uncomfortable, if nothing more; and sometimes it proves serious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Eat only light and easily digested food; eat between meals, but not at bed time. A lemonade drink or a cup of cocoa between meals is helpful and nourishing. To make lemonade:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Take one-half of the juice of a lemon, one generous teaspoon of sugar, a little cracked ice, the white of an egg, beaten or not, as one prefers. Put the mixture into a large glass, stir all together, then fill the glass with water. This is fine for a patient who is trying to build up in weight. The juice of an orange may be used instead of lemon, if one prefers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Obesity</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font7">HILE we may inherit some of our excessive flesh, by watching our diet closely we may be able to overcome some of it. Eating too much fat and albumens has a great deal to do in adding to one’s weight. To reduce in flesh leave , off all salt fish, pork, veal, potatoes, rice, oatmeal, macaroni, hominy, spiced beets, carrots, turnips, parsnips, pies, puddings, cakes, sweet milk and cream. Confine your food selections to fresh fish, lean meat or mutton, chicken, eggs (eating sparingly of the above-mentioned), stale bread, toast, celery, onions, radishes, tomatoes, cauliflower, cabbage, and uncooked but ripe fruits; tea and coffee without sugar or cream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In Case of Rheumatism</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">rpHE food should be free from all red </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">meat </span><span class="font7">J- and'meat soup. Eat cream soups, fish, eggs, white meats, fresh vegetables, and all cereals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">In Liver Disorders</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font7">VOID highly seasoned food, strong tea or coffee, rich pastry and cake. Abstain, from very fat or very sweet foods. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Buttermilk may be taken, also junket, eggs, &quot;&nbsp;lean meat, sweetbreads, chicken, squab, fish -(excepting those very rich in fat), and fresh green vegetables, salads without oil, and fre$h fruits.

<p><span class="font7">The dream of my life is to settle down in my own little bungalow, on my own little ranch; and there, in the golden sunlight and silvery moonlight of California to dream the hours away, seeing visions of other times and other places. And where can you find more to call up such visions than on a California ranch? ' You arise in the morning to the music of a Connecticut alarm clock. You climb into your Ypsilanti underwear, button your Boston socks onto your Paris garters, your Baltimore suspenders onto your Philadelphia overalls, put on your Lynn shoes and your Danbury hat; and you are up for the day.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Then you go out and put your Concord, New Hampshire, harness upon your Missouri mule, hitch it to a Moline, Illinois, plow, and plow a few acres of land covered with Ohio mortgages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">'And then, when the twilight falls, you fill your Pride-of-Detroit with Mexican gasoline, dash out to the beach; and while sitting in a Greek restaurant, smoking a Pittsburgh stogie you watch, a New York girl dance the Memphis Shimmey to the music of a Chicago Jazz Band.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And then you go home, read a chapter out of a Bible printed in London, England, say a prayer written in Jerusalem, put on your China-silk pajamas, crawl in between your Fall River sheets, to fight all night with the fleas, the only native product on your whole blooming ranch.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font7">HEN but a lad of six years I had the sorrow of losing my mother. Our family numbered twelve—six boys and six girls. Mother and her parents were strict Roman Catholies, while all of father’s folks were Protestant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">Af</span><span class="font7">ter mother had been put into her restingplace the home was kept going, with a hard struggle on father’s part, for a few months; arid then came the dividing of the flock. My sisters all went with my grandmother; my little brothers had all died in infancy; and I stuck to my dear old dad. After a year my father was compelled to stop work and enter a hospital on account of the loss of his sight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One day my' uncle and my aunt came to the boarding house with my second youngest sister and said that they were going to take me to - see my daddy. But we never reached dad; for [ was put into a Catholic home for boys and my sister into a Catholic home for girls.'From that day -I was caged up for seven years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The daily routine was as follows: I was up at 5:30 a. m., went to mass, had breakfast, went to work until 9:00, then had prayers, catechism, Bible history, spelling, geography, and arithmetic. At 11: 30 I played with the other boys until 12 o’clock, then had dinner, worked again until 3:00 p. m., and then had school again the same as before. At 5: 30 school was over. We played until supper; and when supper was over we played again until 7:00 p. m., when we had more prayers, catechism and Bible history. After this, .three nights a</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By William Jos. Gray &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">' A/ week, we went to benediction, and then were <sub>; </sub>allowed to retire at about 9: 30 p. m. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I am frequently being reminded that I am still a Catholic, on the ground that “once a Catholic always a Catholic”; but I reply that I have had enough to last me the rest of the journey. I confess to no man, and call no man father; but in the end, when the wreaths and ■ bells are put on the little sheep, they dare not ■ leave me out if there is anything in their tflp-ory that “once a Catholic always a Catholic.” ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some Catholic may read these lines in idle curiosity, and others with a fueling of resentment ; but I ask them to bear with me while I make a few observations. The word pope means papa or father, and we are compelled to call the priest father; so Catholics are blessed with ‘ a grand assortment of daddies. Now any good &lt;&nbsp;Catholic knows that the last sacrament, called Extreme Unction, frees the dying-person of all sins committed by the seven senses; in other words, one is thus made as innocent as a newborn babe. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font7"> If this is so, why the ' necessity for masses, prayers, alms, etc., for. the release of such souls from purgatory?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Again, if a black sheep in a Roman Catholic ‘ family is drowned or killed while stealing </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">freight ride, and if the services are all con- ' ducted in regular form, the almighty dollar is accepted for the release of the soul of such an one from purgatory. Now may I ask: Which one of the many daddies mentioned decides that' . the skid soul has been found fit, instead</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div><img src="g_E_19221220_files/g_E_19221220-11.png" alt="" style="width:32pt;height:107pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">found fit only for the abode of asbestos devils?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Again, a priest-is ever ready to hear the confession of the wickedest person and to absolve „ such sinner from crimes committed against God or,the state. This being the case, why is not the same forgiving power exercised toward the starving wretch that helps himself to some of the money put into the boxes intended for the relief of just such persons, instead of turning ' him over to the civil authorities, as is usually the case? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Again, every priest is supposed to love his congregation as himself and to love all alike. One of his parish dies rich, and the other dies poor. The rich has solemn High Requiem Mass for $25 up, and the other just mass. What is the difference between the two masses? Has one a greater lifting power than the other? If so, why- does the father who loves both of his children alike give wings to the one and put lead boots onto the other?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Again, one can readily note that three-quarters of the death notices published are of Roman Catholics and there is a reason. What doctor would come to see you and tell you that you were just fit for the grafting undertaker? Would you -not quickly give him the exit, to make way for a doctor who would tell you that there was nothing serious the matter with you but a small cold, and that in a little while you would be around as well as ever? You would do this because such a doctor would give you the courage to continue the struggle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now when a Roman Catholic is on his deathbed hell looms large before his eye,. He calls for the priest and gives his confession, receives the last sacrament, and has the feeling that he is a saint only awaiting suitable wings to fly away to heaven. Who could blame such an one for feeling that he is blessed by death and should welcome giving up the ghost? However, although ^death is thus made as attractive as possible, and as popular as possible; yet when the pope, priests, or cardinals, who are nothing but living saints in the eyes of the people, come • • to have their last sacraments, they always call for the best surgeons and doctors, and make use of the latest inventions for keeping the breath of life in their bodies as long as possible. So while they preach heaven to their followers, the earth after all is their paradise and they do not wish to leave it. Thank God, it is nearly £ime for this big organization of quackery to cash in its checks! Like other institutions it must step down into the dust to make room for God’s kingdom, the desire of every honest heart, whether he really knows about it or not.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">There are millions of honest and moral living Christians of all denominations who would not make them lower their standard under any trial.

<p><span class="font7">Now if all this be true, how could Mr. Rosen-krans’ article on Christian Science be true? ' Both are true. Christendom’s hosts, including t • Christian Scientists, are living up to the light they have accepted. But they have lost sight of the true light or have never beheld it; for . every one who sees the true standard of per- . fection as it shines in the face of Jesus Christ, can claim only filthy rags for his goodness in ' • comparison to that of the altogether lovely Ope. ■ ,</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">the “true perfection” is, what “true morality” is, is living below his privileges and therefore from that standpoint living an immoral life. We must get away from the so-called morality' which this world offers and which leads to death. We must get away from the creeds of Christendom, which also lead to ffeath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age points this out continually. It is the only paper specially devoted to that peculiar work. It shows the Bible standard of perfection; it is not tainted with doctrines either of men or of devils. Its editors do not claim to be better than their fellow men, but they have d full grasp of “the faith, once delivered to the saints.” Their aim is Christ, and they desire all to see Him in the beauty of holiness and of His perfect kingdom, which He is about to establish. So it is good for Professor Read and h'is wife and all others to see the perfect standard of morality which Mr. Rosen-krans pointed out—the “love of Christ, which passeth [human] knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God.” (Ephesians 2:19) Such is the mission of The Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The writer has been a Christian Scientist, and can truly say on the strength of God’s holy Word that the subtle doctrines of.Christian Science lead away from God, the great spiritual Being, lead away from all God’s truths, and are void of any but the counterfeit love which we inherited from father Adam af</span></p>

Neither shall there be any more partings through death; for death itself shall die. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It will be a home of eternal happiness with time to enjoy and study nature, time to study the wondrous machinery of the starry heavens, time to meditate upon the glorious character of our heavenly Father and Him who is the express image of God. All this will be made possible by God pouring His holy spirit upon all flesh, and mankind will receive the benefits of the ransom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Do not be afraid to break every man-made and demon-made tie, and get into the glorious liberty of the children of God.

<p><span class="font7">The question is as to whether Jesus Christ recognizes a politico-socio-financio-religious system, or the clergy of such systems, as His ambassadors and the representatives of His kingdom now about to be established, and for which Christians have prayed, “Thy kingdom come”; or whether all such political-social-financial-religious . combines have been spewed out of the Lord’s mouth, and should now be recognized as a part of His Laodicean ejecta.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">“A two-bit truth-teller is worth more than a million-dollar liar.” The Golden Age is in a class by itself. The people are waking up more and more to the fact that many things which they thought were “standard goods” are not so standard after all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When a few weeks ago I visited my parents, who reside in the twin cities, I spent an evening with my uncle and my aunt. While there, we discussed newspapers, magazines, church, and state. Just at that time a friend of my aunt’s came in and asked her to buy some narcissus bulbs for the benefit of the church. After she had gone my aunt said: “Honestly it makes me tired the way they expect a person to hand out money and everything for the church in this neighborhood. Why, I am sure that I bake on the average two cakes a week for some sale, supper, or function to be held in the church parlors. I am beginning to think that all church people think of now-a-days is food, banquets, and dinners. ‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Just discovered that fact, auntie?” I asked. “I found that out three or four years ago, when I used to be chief menu artist, as well as pianist, for the church in our town. Also watching the people wear out the sidewalks from their homes to the churches, carrying steaming kettles and pans, and coffee pots such as they'use. on picnics, I have concluded that if it is a hotel they wish to run, why not say so and run a good one while they are at it? The most acute attack of indigestion I ever had took possession. of me at just such a self-styled church banquet. It was doubtless due to the combination salad and the silly words of the D. D. who was the speaker of the evening. Part of his harangue was as follows: 'And all that Mr. Wilson did was pound on his typewriter and sit tight, while they threatened us, and finally after </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">series of sittings and typings they sank the Lusitania. What he should have done was to have the words “To arms” emblazoned froth every pulpit in the country.” Those were hia very words; and he is one of the leading Methodist ministers of these United States. I became nauseated when he added: ‘I realize that</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">I don’t pray enough, I should pray a whole lot more than I do; and I guess the rest of us can stand a little more praying, too.’ And every one (nearly) applauded and smiled as if their Doctor of Divine Sayings (?) was a clever man indeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Once we had a big banquet at the Congregational church of which I was at one time a faithful member. It was to be a banquet in honor of the Sunday school teachers, for their splendid work during the year. I was seated opposite the minister; and he said&lt; ‘Well, Miss Johnson, do you not feel that you are being amply repaid for your year’s work with the boys?’ (I had a class of fourteen twelve-year-old lads.) I looked at him in amazement and could not say a thing; but I thought: Surely there is something wrong somewhere when we teach Sunday school in order that we might have a good feed once a year at the expense of the church.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The day I Teturned from my visit, I was summoned to the door. A gentleman stood there, who announced that he was a minister, and would like very much to have me subscribe to a certain magazine called the “Burning Bush.” I realized, after talking with him a few moments, why it had been given that particular name; for it surely was a hot one. He asked me first to what church I belonged. I told him “The International Bible Students Association.” He swallowed some air, tugged at his collar, choked and went on: “May I ask how long since you became interested in Russell’s books?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Yes, sir,” I replied, “I am very glad to tell you that it is some four years ago.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">He : “Do you know what kind of man this </span><span class="font7">man was?” (He gave me a searching look.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I: “Yes, sir; he was a godly man, the seventh messenger of the church.” ..</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">He: “You have been deceived, madam; and ■’ his works are of the devil. Any yeligiofl.s^Plt ‘ takes us away from the.belief inthe</span><span class="font7">* old-fasl&gt; ? ioned heaven and hell is rank heresy.

Don’t you know ' that the Bible tells us of the rich man Dives being in hell and crying for a drop of water? I tell you, he is still there, crying for that drop.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I: “Why, sir; surely you know better than that. Being a minister you ought to know that that is one of the parables of Jesus, and that his parables and dark sayings are not to be understood literally.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">He: “You are mistaken, young lady, everything in the Bible must be taken literally. We are off the right track if we take it. otherwise. I would advise you to get down on your knees and ask God to turn you once again into the . pathway from which you have strayed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I:. “Yes, sir; I find it very necessary to .do so many times a day.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">He : “I will let you have this paper for half-a year for fifty cents in order that you may learn to love God properly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I: “I have learned to love Him a whole lot more since I have found out the truth about Him; and, furthermore, for fifty cents I can send The Golden Age to some friend for half a year.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He got up and slammed the door without even saying goodbye. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The whole blame can be directly delivered to the door of our spiritual (?) leaders. If they had preached “Love one another,” love would have been the inevitable consequence. But they persistently preached hatred. You know the result. I need not tell you.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">C</span><span class="font7">URSE not the king.” (Ecclesiastes 10:20) Christ has come as earth’s rightful king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the great mass of professing Christians do not receive Him. As at the first advent, “He is\iespised and rejected of men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Christ is come! Now let creation</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From her groans and travail cease;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let the glorious proclamation</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hope restore and faith increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>&lt;f</sup>With this blessed hope before us, Let no harp remain unstrung;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Let </span><span class="font5">the mighty ransomed chorus Onward roll from tongue to tongue.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Hebrew word translated “curse” in this text means to despise or to esteem lightly; and this describes the attitude of the vast majority to their new and rightful King. “Then he forsook God which made him, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">lightly esteemed </span><span class="font7">the Rock of his salvation.”—Dent. 32:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No, not in thy thought.” The word here ren-&quot;Id&amp;red’*'“thought” literally means knowledge, science. In 1 Timothy 6: 20 we read: “O Timothy [name means “Dear to God”], keep that <sup>iJ</sup>Wftieh W cbiflmitted to thy trust [that which is depoSitelFfo bur sacred trust], avoiding pro-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">| fane and vain babblings [empty-sounding or fruitless discussions] and oppositions of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">science</span><span class="font7"> falsely so called.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">* “And curse not the rich.” Here the thought <sup>:</sup>is, Do not lightly esteem or despise those who ’ <sup>v</sup> are rich in spiritual things and in the blessing of the Lord, which maketh rich. (Proverbs 10: 22) There is a general inclination to do this, even among those who profess full consecration to the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“In thy bedchamber.” The bedchamber is a place where we sleep at night. However, the present is no time for sleeping; for the morning has come, and it is high time to be up and doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yet there are many who still slumber and sleep on their creed-beds, and who do not realize that the day is’ breaking. Some sleep in the Methodist bedchamber, others in the Baptist, etc. Moreover, there are the ones who curse and lightly esteem the message of Christ’s presence. They refuse to receive the new King because He comes in such an entirely different manner and for a different purpose from that which they have been taught in their creeds. So they “know not the time of their visitation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“For a bird.” The bird is the one mentioned in Psalm 124: 7: “Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: Ute [pr error] is broken [by the power and influence of the truth], and we are escaped.” “Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”—John 8: 32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thus is pictured how we have escaped from the snares, or Satan’s bird-traps, as the religious organizations are referred to in symbolic language.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">“Of the air.” The air symbolically means the new powers of spiritual control, the new heavens, the spiritual phase of the kingdom, in which the church is called to have an inheritance with her Lord.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">“Shall carry the voice.” So the voice, or proclamation, is now being carried through the columns of the publications from the Lord’s appointed channel, where the good hews of the coming kingdom is being fearlessly declared; and the secret things are now being brought to light. The search-light is turned on all sys' terns, &quot;and corruption and hypocrisy are being</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">exposed; and as those in the darkness hate the </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">j </span><span class="font7">light, so they fulfill Psalm 64:3: “Who whet their tongues like a sword, and bend their bows' to shoot their arrows, even bitter words.” This' b is a great time for people to be “shooting, off their mouths,” especially against those who let . their light shine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font7">N HIS book entitled “The ikittle of Armageddon” on page 204, Pastor Russell has pointed out that the “only one indispensable condition of success is that we recognize the cause </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">of our</span><span class="font7"> failure, that we confess it, with humble, lowly, penitent, and obedient mi mis. and that with quenchless Western courage and faith we now go forth and do'otherwise.” These words are certainly true, anti they would seem specially to fit and apply to the millions now living who will ..never die. Such, recognizing and acknowledging the errors and mistakes of the past which have brought upon the world this terrible time of trouble, the great day of vengeance (Isaiah 63:4) which God forewarned us in His Word would come if His counsels were unheeded—and striving now in their own hearts and lives to take a firm stand for truth and righteousness—such will surely be greatly blessed. &quot;</span></p>

Death came upon them and upon their race as God’s penalty for their disobedience. For 6000 years we have had a reign of sin and death. Nevertheless the Bible assures us that God has not forsaken the race; but that in due. time, He sent His Son into the world, that whosoever believes on Him might not perish, but have everlasting life. (John 3:16) The Bible, further assures us that this great fact, that the •man Christ Jesus gave himself a ransom'for all, is to be testified to all in due time (.1 Timothy 2:6), in order that all might have an opportunity to believe and to avail themselves </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">the offer of life everlasting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">, <sup>135</sup>The birth of Jesus, the greatest event in F the world’s history, was about to be enacted. : Two thousand years had passed since God had made the promise to Abraham of the coming</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">■ of the mighty One through whom all the fami-k lies of the earth should be blessed. During that | time Jehovah was'executing Ills preconceived t plan, renewing His promise to keep it fresh in the minds of the faithful, and shaping the ^course of those who should participate in this great transaction. And now, as the day drew v near, the stage was being set.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7"><sup>13G</sup>The place selected was Bethlehem, situated an elevation south of Jerusalem. It was j. viice the home of Boaz, whose fields the beauti-• ful Moabitish woman Ruth had gleaned whom 1 Boaz redeemed and afterward took as his wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here Jehovah had used Boaz as a type of Christ Jesus and Ruth as a type of the church, His bride, foreshadowing things yet to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">„ <sup>137</sup>Later Bethlehem was the home of Jesse f. and of David his son. The name David implies ** ‘beloved one’; and it was here that he was anointed to be king over Israel, from which time he typified Jesus, the mighty Son of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">ST Jehovah had selected this as the birthplace of \Jesus; hence here the birth must take place.—</span></p>

Joseph the carpenter, although a resident of Nazareth, was of the house of David, and hence must go to the city of David to be numbered and taxed. Naturally his espoused virgin would accompany him<sup><a href="#bookmark65">5</a></sup>to that city. She likewise was of the house of David through another line — another reason why she should go there. But above all, the Lord directed them there because it was a part of His arrangement.</span></p>

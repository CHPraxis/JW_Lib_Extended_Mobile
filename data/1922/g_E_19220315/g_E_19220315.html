<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font6">HESE animals are to be found everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They are closely related to the human family, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">are accustomed to live in houses, the same </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font6">human beings. A man in Chicago has announced that it costs $5,500 to rear a boy to the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">age </span><span class="font6">of twelve years, so that a boy is a consider</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">able </span><span class="font6">investment. And, bless his heart, the boy </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font6">worth it! Who would not pay $5,600 for a perfectly good boy of twelve years of age ? And who would not pay $5,499.98 for one that is not perfectly good, but is pretty nearly perfectly good! And most boys are that. James Whitcomb Riley has said that “there is no such </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">thing </span><span class="font6">as a bad boy, but some of them are better than others”; and this expresses our sentiihents </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">exactly.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">HUMAN being looking at a boy cannot tell exactly what the boy will do next; but it is pretty safe to assert that if there is anything around that he can climb, it will not be long before he makes the attempt. The boy finds himself in a world that has all sorts of strange sights and experiences for the venturesome, and he cannot tell what possibilities await </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6"> unless he climbs and takes a look.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Max Rochester, a Brooklyn lad, was coming </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">from a swim and thought that he ought to poke his head in between two timbers, so that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font6">could see what was back of thejn. After some effort he got his head through between the timbers, but his ears made his head like an umbrella, intended by nature to go much more easily in one direction than the other. He could see all the sand and water that was behind the timbers; there was nothing else to see; but he </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">could </span><span class="font6">not get his head out. Policemen were summoned and greased his head and neck, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">then </span><span class="font6">tried to pull him out by the legs. The ears </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Still stuck out, and Max did not wish to have</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>in Boys</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">them scraped off. Finally the firemen had to come with axes and chop him out. They got him out just as the tide was rising to a place where it would soon have drowned Max, ears and all. Max was inquisitive. There was nothing wrong in what he did. He merely wanted to know; and, poor kid, he found out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many a boy has lost his life climbing. A boy of nine, while playing “follow your master” narrowly escaped death, when he fell from the top of the retaining wall surrounding the excavation where the West Farms, New York, subway leaves the underground for the overhead structure, in the Bronx district. As it was, the lad’s skull was fractured. At the point where the boy fell there is but a short interval between trains, and had he fallen immediately in front of a train death would have been certain. A train was bearing down upon him at the time he fell, but the' motorman saw the boy fall, and stopped the train in time to pick him up, and have taken him to a hospital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">John Martin, a schoolboy of thirteen, was less fortunate, and had a very sad death. In a playful struggle with some schoolmates a nickel was knocked out of his hands and fell through </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">subway grating to the shelf below. John’s companions helped him to pry up the grating. He jumped down and began to feel around for his nickle. In the darkness he plunged headlong from the shelf and his cries were drowned by the roar of the express train below, which in a moment mangled his body almost beyond recognition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The courts have taken official notice of the fact that boys have a tendency to climb, and that railway and other structures should be so designed as to make climbing unattractive if not&quot; impossible. Little David Fruchter climbed to the top girder of a bridge which crosses the New Haven railroad tracks at 149th street, in the Bronx, to</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">' reach a </span><span class="font6">pigeon which he saw there. He did not <sup>!</sup> reach the pigeon, but he did reach the high voltage wire which furnishes the driving power for : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the trains; and when his hand touched the wire</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font6">was hurled to the floor of the bridge and his hand was so badly burned that it had to be '' amputated. The United States Circuit Court of Appeals has confirmed the decision of the lower court that the New Haven railroad must pay the boy $10,000 damages and his father $1,000 ' damages because it designed the structure in such a way as to lure boys to climb upon it. Corporations must take notice of the fact that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">. there are such </span><span class="font6">things </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font6">boys.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Boys and Wanderlust</span></h6>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">T </span><span class="font6">IS hard for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">boy to be put into one place and to stay put. He is not sure but that there </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">' are </span><span class="font6">advantages in some other location. He ‘ would like to see; he wishes to know; and his . curiosity makes him an explorer. However attractive it may be, the place where he is or where he has once been is never so interesting </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">him as the place where he has not been.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A six-year-old boy of Brooklyn takes the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">inedal in this respect. In three years he has been y “lost” forty-three times. His father is so accustomed to receiving notifications from the police of Philadelphia, Bridgeport, Plainfield, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">other points up to a hundred miles from ; New York, that whenever the boy gets “lost” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">■ he </span><span class="font6">just waits for the usual notice. His father ; - understands exactly how the boy comes by his • wanderlust, but he is still puzzled to know’ how the youngster gets the money to make the trips.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably the youngster is too small to ride the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">j &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brake beams, or the roof, or even the platform</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of a blind baggage; but a youngster of six can</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;squeeze between the backs of two seats, turned</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>:</sup> - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;back to back, or into a closet which has inad-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">- &nbsp;&nbsp;- vertently been left unlocked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ ’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The editor of The Golden Age once knew </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">U &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boy, Frank McNair, of Nunda, N. Y., who visited</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every state in the union and all the important</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">:• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cities, without paying a cent of railroad fare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one of his trips, in which he went to Calif or-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">U &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nia and return, he rode from Albuquerque to</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Gallup, New Mexico, in the boiler of a station-(■- • ary engine that was on a flat car. On the return trip he rode from Pasco Junction, Washington, g &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to Minneapolis, locked up in a tourist sleeper</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sub>?</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upper berth during the day, and riding the roof</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">„ at night. Discovered by the train crew when </span><span class="font6">about two hundred miles out of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Minneapolis, </span><span class="font6">the passengers aboard, many of whom </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font6">highly enjoying his trip of three nights and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">two </span><span class="font6">days in their company, and who had been feeding him out of their lunch baskets, raised </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">purse and paid his fare into Minneapolis. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font6">passengers were as bad as Frank, and he </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font6">not a half-bad boy. The only trouble with </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him </span><span class="font6">was that he was killed in a train wreck </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">before </span><span class="font6">he was old enough to have any sense. He </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">rode </span><span class="font6">the blind baggage once too often.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sometimes the girls have wanderlust, too, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">occasionally they have it with the boys. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A girl </span><span class="font6">in Asbury Park borrowed her father’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">automo</span><span class="font6">bile and two boys of the neighborhood, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">started out to see the world. They had no </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">money </span><span class="font6">with them, but they had </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">large </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">box </span><span class="font6">of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">candy. </span><span class="font6">They got about a hundred miles </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">away from </span><span class="font6">home when the candy and gasoline gave out </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font6">the same time. They stepped into </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a garage to </span><span class="font6">see what w’as wrong with their car; and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the. </span><span class="font6">garage owner telephoned to the girl’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">father, </span><span class="font6">who came and got them. Fathers </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">are a </span><span class="font6">very </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">nec</span><span class="font6">essary nuisance in this world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two girls of Bath Beach, Brooklyn, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">concluded </span><span class="font6">to leave home because one of them had played “hookey” away from school the day before </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">was afraid that she would be detected </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">punished; and the other was afraid she </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">would </span><span class="font6">find the examinations too hard to pass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Two boy chums came to their rescue </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">gallantly offered to show them the world; </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font6">least, they would pilot them through the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">wilds </span><span class="font6">of Manhattan and over to Jersey. This </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">would </span><span class="font6">be undertaking great risks; for the popular </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">idea </span><span class="font6">with myriads of New Yorkers is that but </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a little </span><span class="font6">way beyond the Jersey ferries the natives </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">are. </span><span class="font6">dressed in breechcloths and spend most of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">their' </span><span class="font6">time lighting with Indians and running </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">away </span><span class="font6">from wolves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When they got to the Jersey ferries, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">girls </span><span class="font6">decided that there would be no fun in encountering the Indians and wolves and white </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">savages </span><span class="font6">unless the boys went along to protect them; </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">so, Eve-like, they tempted the boys to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">accom</span><span class="font6">pany them. The boys yielded, but only after </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">good old-fashioned test of flipping a coin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Only one of the party had any money; </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">this </span><span class="font6">was Frances, and Frances manifested </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">an. insati</span><span class="font6">able desire to spend the little all </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">($5.10) of the </span><span class="font6">party’s means, upon eating as much as possible as soon as possible.

<p><span class="font6">Once in awhile one of them gets an idea </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font6">shames his elders. Such a boy was Russell </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">V. </span><span class="font6">Harkema of Seattle. Russell could not swim; and accordingly was at once placed in a most difficult position when, as he sat quietly fishing, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font6">was startled by the screams of a woman and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">girl floundering in deep water thirty feet off </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">shore, </span><span class="font6">and saw a man plunging in after them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Russell grabbed a piece of log, bestrode it, kicked his way out to the woman and the girl, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">accomplished their rescue. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">little girl </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">helped </span><span class="font6">him to return to shore with his burden by shoving out another piece of log to him. By the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">time </span><span class="font6">he had the women ashore the man who had tried to rescue them had drowned.

<p><span class="font15">B</span><span class="font6">OYS are like dogs; they travel in packs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bad dogs lead good dogs into mischief, sometimes; but the good dog cannot help it that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font6">likes to travel with the gang. New York used </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">have what was called the Gas House Gang, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">which </span><span class="font6">at one time made as much trouble for the police of New York as any one factor in the city. Lively, mischievous boys made lively, mischiev</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ous </span><span class="font6">young men; but what was funny in the boy </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ceased to </span><span class="font6">be funny in the young man. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">pup is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in a </span><span class="font6">hard way when he gets his growth. While </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">he is </span><span class="font6">a little shaver everything he does is cute,</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">[</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font6">when he gets big everybody expects him to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">. act </span><span class="font6">like an old dog ten times his age. It is the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">same </span><span class="font6">way with a boy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Finally the brilliant mind of E. H. Harriman </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">' found </span><span class="font6">a way of breaking up the Gas House K? ’ &quot;Gang. He organized the Boys’ Club of New </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">York; </span><span class="font6">the Gas House Gang were taken in as</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">357</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">charter members; suitable quarters were provided; and straightway the boys have become the best behaved boys in the city. It is reported that the percentage of juvenile delinquency among these boys is now the least in the city and that seventy-seven percent of them attend either day or night high school. The boys now have their own commodious building at Tenth Street and Avenue A, and the annual membership^ originally 300, is now 7,000. It is calculated that 250,000 boys have passed through this club since it was started. Why does not the Association-of-Nations “statesmen” build boys’ buildings instead of battleships?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The basic idea of the club is that if a boy is given healthful recreation he will not become dissipated. Hence the club is fitted with several complete gymnasiums, a dozen basket-ball courts, a fine swimming-pool, a wrestling and boxing room, and many other facilities for promoting athletics and education in all its branches. The club uses about three tons of soap in a year, a fact which speaks for itself. The club is designed to foster truthfulness and healthy ambition, as well as physical cleanliness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The same club maintains at Jamesport, Long Island, the William Carey Camp, containing fifty acres, with twenty-eight buildings. This</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">camp takes care of 2,500 boys each summer, five regiments of five hundred each at two-week intervals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font6">E DO not like to write on the topic “Boys and Crime”. There are boys who do things they ought not to do; and for the safety of the community as a whole it is necessary that measures should be taken to restrain them until they learn to have a proper respect for the rights of others. But there is a vast amount of misinformation and, hypocrisy as to what constitutes a criminal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A man kills a fellow man; he is a murderer. A thousand men go out and kill a thousand -of their fellow men; they are heroes. A man takes something that belongs to another; he is a thief. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A nation takes the coal mines or other natural resources from another nation; it is patriotic. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">man who lies about his fellow man is guilty, of slander. All the press of a country may engage in a shameless campaign of falsehood about an entire people; and who is there who dares say or intimate that their course is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font6">perfectly right ? Let him say it in war-time and he goes to jail for his hardihood and presumption for telling the truth at an inopportune time.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19220315_files/g_E_19220315-7.png" alt="" style="width:32pt;height:143pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">The so-called criminal records reveal the fact that the high peak of crime is at the age of • seventeen years. In Kings County, New York, in 1919, sixty percent of the cases before the courts were of boys below 21 years of age; and in 1920, in the same district, the percentage was seventy-five. This merely means that in most instances crime is a natural result of immaturity of mind. These boys have done wrong not so much through malice as through mischief, inability to distinguish properly between liberty and license.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is most unfortunate to have to send boys like that away to a professional school for criminal-making; for that is all that any prison is or can be. Among the Israelites there were no prisons; but there were cities to which a criminal might flee for safety, to shield him from death or attack at the hands of the friends of the one he had wronged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">John S. Kennedy, President of the New York State Commission of Prisons, says that seventy percent of the juvenile delinquents, male and female, between the ages of 16 and 30, placed under probation, and having served out a term of surveillance, are never heard of again. And many of those that are heard of would never be heard of were it not for the fact that some police officer, knowing of the one mistake, and eager to make a recoud for himself, made too strenuous an effort to fasten upon the unfortunate some new crime for which he was in no way responsible. This percentage proves that most bad boys are not bad boys and most bad girls are not bad girls. They are merely undeveloped men and women.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mr. Kennedy in commenting on this subject says, in substance:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Every student of criminology has learned almost at the outset of his studies that the most important single factor found associated with chronic criminalism is the abnormal [undeveloped—Ed.] mental condition of the criminal himself. Well-authenticated facts are at hand </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">indicate that at least fifty percent of the inmates of prisons and reformatories exhibit mental abnormalties and are in need of much more specialized treatment t</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">han</span><span class="font4"> is afforded by the ordinary routine methods employed in the average penal institutions; that from twenty-seven to thirty percent of such inmates are feebleminded and possess only the intelligence of the average American child of twelve years or under. But the number of bad boys is steadily decreasing, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and flakes </span><span class="font4">records of all institutions in which our commission </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Ms® </span><span class="font4">interested already show that the crop of 1921-1932 </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">will </span><span class="font4">be agreeably less. The chief reason for this is because effort along intelligent lines is now being made </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to dis</span><span class="font4">cover what may be the mental disease, deterioration, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">or </span><span class="font4">feeble-mindedness before they are sent to prison.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In similar vein, Willis Steele, writing </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">iri file </span><span class="font6">-v New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Herald,</span><span class="font6"> declares that there are </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">fewet </span><span class="font6">i bad boys now growing up in the country </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">than-&quot;-* </span><span class="font6">has been the case at any time within </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">tw<sup>r</sup>enty ~ </span><span class="font6">years past. This is largely attributable to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the &quot;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">official classing of alcohol with other </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">narcotic^ -</span><span class="font6">drugs, and its prohibition by law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It must not be thought that because a boy </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">has '-</span><span class="font6">been noisy or boisterous, or has done something- -out of the ordinary, or has even been </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">locked Up, </span><span class="font6">he is therefore a bad boy. Two boys in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Brooklyn ~ </span><span class="font6">were locked up on the charge of disorderly </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">con-</span><span class="font6">duct because they had made some </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">hand-' </span><span class="font6">grenades, each containing several </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ounces of , </span><span class="font6">powder, and had had a lot of fun hurling </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">these '. </span><span class="font6">against ash-cans in a vacant lot. Probably </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font6">was all very wrong to batter up some old </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">dis-</span><span class="font6">carded ash-cans and scare all the people in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the ■'<sup>;s </sup></span><span class="font6">neighborhood by making </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">lot of noise; </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">but we </span><span class="font6">cannot see it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">New York State has a law forbidding </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">boys to </span><span class="font6">be on the street after nine o ’clock at night </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">unless. ; </span><span class="font6">accompanied by adults. It is a good law </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and -</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I </span><span class="font6">should be enforced. If boys get into mischief </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font6">is generally after that hour, when some </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">crook </span><span class="font6">or schemer may want them to hold the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">bag dr </span><span class="font6">r in some way act as accomplice.

<p><span class="font6">The Big Brothers have a camp near Tuxedo, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Called </span><span class="font6">Camp Nehahe.

<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font6">HY anybody should want to abuse a boy is hard to understand, but many of the little fellows have some very hard experiences. In London a tradesman, for some unknown reason, put a split pea into the ear of a boy, necessitat</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font6">a painful operation for its removal. The court allowed the boy £150 and his father £15 </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(damages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A case was brought to the attention of the Children’s Society where a ten-year-old lad was disrobed by his father and his stepmother and tied with ropes to the kitchen wall four days and three nights, meantime being fed on bread and water.

<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font6">HEN a man has proven to his boss that he has an understudy that can take his place, the honest and efficient employer knows that here is a man whom he can promote without injury to the business, a man who is alive to the interests of the business, and who expects promotion. Everything argues in his behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When a man has proven to his boss that the boss cannot get along without him in the particular position which he then occupies, and that nobody else could possibly occupy that position as well as himself, at that moment that employe’s chances of promotion are forever gone. Everything argues against disturbing the business by promoting him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Every department head who is of any real benefit to the business has his work so organized that in case of an emergency every person in it could be moved a step forward. Every department head who is of any benefit to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a business </span><span class="font6">makes it his concern to aid any person in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font6">department who expresses </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">wish to learn </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">some </span><span class="font6">branch of the business. It is his way </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">up, and </span><span class="font6">it is their way up. It is the legitimate </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">concern </span><span class="font6">of the head of every department to become </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">oa-</span><span class="font6">quainted with the ability, industry, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">adaptability, </span><span class="font6">attendance, and accident records of every </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">man </span><span class="font6">under him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some concerns use the three-position system. Each man must know his own duties, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">those </span><span class="font6">of the two positions above him. But if he </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">does </span><span class="font6">not desire promotion this is not required, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">but' </span><span class="font6">his subordinates will be promoted past him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is the concern of every executive </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of a large </span><span class="font6">business to see that the department heads </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">the business are trained to take up other duties if an emergency arises calling for their use. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Au </span><span class="font6">executive who tries to keep all the details </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">one, </span><span class="font6">has a peanut mind and will always have a peanut business. A subordinate who strives to keep his job safe for himself by keeping the details of his work secret should never be promot</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ed; </span><span class="font6">and if already in an important position he should be changed to a place where he can be of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">less harm </span><span class="font6">to the business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">department head’s value to a business can </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font6">well determined by the smoothness with </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">which his </span><span class="font6">department runs when he is sick. If </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font6">runs well he is probably a capable man. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">If nobody </span><span class="font6">knows how to do anything in his absence, and if his desk is jammed with unfinished work, the status of which no one but himself knows, he is a liability to his employers, not </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font6">asset.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One, of the best times to find out what is in subordinates is to give them a temporary promotion when the man above is sick or is absent </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">for some </span><span class="font6">other reason. It is a great encouragement to the man thus honored and is much bet</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ter for </span><span class="font6">the business. It is very discouraging for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">department head, who already has much to do,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">have to take up the work of some other department head who is ill or absent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">r. rpiIE man who aspires to promotion because</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">J- of his desire to rule over his fellow men is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">’ a' </span><span class="font6">detriment to society and one of the greatest i. - drawbacks to the brotherly interest of man in his fellow man. The men whose memories are z most loved are those men who have tried to S, serve others rather than to rule them. “The Son ‘ of man came not to be ministered unto [to be . served], but to minister [serve |.” Yet it is quite proper for a man to have a healthy ambition f to make the most of his opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">fs</span><span class="font6"> Many officials hold their positions in the world &gt;&nbsp;entirely by bluff. Not infrequently they do not understand well the duties of the work assigned 8L to them, but are able to maintain a hold upon ' superior men and constantly rise above them, £ and by </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">their</span><span class="font6"> efforts, because they happen to be $ ready of speech and pleasant of manner in the [y place where it counts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I<sup>1</sup> How is a subordinate working under such a man to get promoted? How is he to depend on ||f ' promotion, when, as is estimated, not fifty per</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">E</span><span class="font6"> cent of the officials in the country can be trusted to deal fairly in the promotion of the men below </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I..' them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The answer is difficult, but there is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a way. </span><span class="font6">The employe should always </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">set before his mind </span><span class="font6">the fact that the business is his business </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">its interests his interests; </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font6">should know </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font6">improvement is the order of the day, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and he </span><span class="font6">should use his brains to see how the work in his department could be improved. And </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">when </span><span class="font6">he has a suggestion that he thinks is worthy </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">adoption he should contrive to get that suggestion directly into the hands of his employer and to let is be known from whom it comes. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This </span><span class="font6">is liable to make trouble with his immediate superior; but it is not so liable to do so after the second, or third, or fourth suggestion has </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">been </span><span class="font6">made, because his value is appreciated higher up and the subordinate official does not </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">dare </span><span class="font6">discharge him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The reason why the suggestions should </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font6">first be confined to the things in one’s own </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">de</span><span class="font6">partment is so that the employer will not get the idea that &quot;here is somebody who thinks that he knows more about how to run my business than I do myself’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are always plenty of improvements </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">be made. The way to do is to question everything that is done, at least to one’s self. Is this form or process necessary? Am I sure that it &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">is necessary? What use is made of it? </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Am I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">&quot;v</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">sure that use is of sufficient importance to justi- ’ ' fy its continuance? Can it be made simpler? .s Can it be combined with something else ?_ </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Can &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ </span><span class="font6">•• f</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">it be done quicker? Can anything be omitted</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">from it? Should there be additions made to it? .A* Is the order of work here the right order? Could</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">the routine be changed to advantage? The </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ques- </span><span class="font6">q tions one may ask himself are endless. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One who is aspiring for promotion should realize that no promotion can come without the . assumption of added responsibility, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font6">should be willing to assume such responsibilities ' when they come his way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In choosing a department in which to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">work, </span><span class="font6">if choice is possible, or in choosing a business, <sub>r </sub>it should be remembered that changes in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">per- </span><span class="font6">-q sonnel are bound to come sooner or later and iyS that the larger the business the more likely </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Not every faithful employe has the gift of leadership, and some of them will not have promotion when it is offered to them; but it is generally true that an increase of wages without </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">posssibility of some other kind of advancement acts only as a temporary palliative, and that when the employe finds he can get no farther he becomes lazy and refuses to use his powers of imagination and administration for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">welfare of the business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The policy should be followed of promoting men from within’the force. Going outside for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">men </span><span class="font6">destroys the confidence of the men in the sincerity of their employers, and a shakeup frequently follows which changes and disorganizes the business from top to bottom, not always to its benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While a man must have a good measure of self-esteem in order to make a good executive, yet too much is worse than too little. It makes an executive proud, and supercilious, a domineering aristocrat and braggart; and no subordinate can have any respect or love for such a man but will almost unconsciously yield only such half-hearted service as is inspired by fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Trustworthiness should be an employer’s first consideration in the promotion of a man; and it not infrequently happens that the employer is less trustworthy than many of the men under him, because it often happens that his promotions rest not upon the things upon which they should rest but upon family ties, sect, denomination, membership in some secret order, politics, or pressure from outside source.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Promotions which have as their only basis the fact that a man has been with a company a given number of years are unsatisfactory to</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">employer and employe alike. It is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">conceivable* </span><span class="font6">that a man might be with a company for </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">lifetime and know little </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">care less </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">about its-</span><span class="font6">general interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">It is not wise to let any man know in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">advance </span><span class="font6">that he is to be promoted.

<p><span class="font15">F</span><span class="font6">OB half a century I have been an ardent student of social economy and have investigated the most eminent authorities, ancient and modern. Early in my investigations I discovered the fact that our social perplexities are all due to a vicious fiscal system that robs the many for the benefit of the few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Like Colwell, Jevons, Allison, Del </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Mar, and </span><span class="font6">many others, I fully realized </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the crying neces</span><span class="font6">sity for a standard or dictionary that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">would? </span><span class="font6">correctly define each and every commercial </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">fac</span><span class="font6">tor or unit and thus eliminate all confusion </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">andj, </span><span class="font6">controversy from the world’s marts. Establish* </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ed facts are not subject to controversy. ■' .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">' I </span><span class="font6">failed to realize that nature had instituted </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font6">immutable law of standards and a specific standard for each and every class of social units </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font6">factors known to man. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font6">started from a false premise and failed .to recognize nature’s only standard for correctly defining any and all commercial units. If we don’t know our destinat ion and the proper way thereto, we are not likely to arrive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Twenty-five years ago I quit the political arena because I refused longer to discuss publicly a subject of whose character and parts I was sublimely ignorant. I arrived in February, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1916. -</span></p>

When McCormick asserted that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">binder would revolutionize small grain husbandry, he was not boasting; but he was turned down, and for years the public refused to acknowledge his great service. When that great </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">boon to </span><span class="font6">surgery, the formula for nitrous oxide gas, was made public it was refused and its author died, and even his name was forgotten before his great service was recognized. When I assert that the discovery of the standard of social values is the exact equivalent of all other discoveries, past, present, and future, T am not theorizing nor boasting. I state a great and dominant truth fully demonstrated and Verified to my intelligence. I know exactly what </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I’m </span><span class="font6">talking about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Marx and Engels issued the great postulate </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font6">the worker is entitled to “production cost”, his entire product or its equivalent in other products in exchange, but the failure to demonstrate to the worker a method or rule by which </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font6">could correctly define and verify “production cost” left him stranded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Farm </span><span class="font6">organizations demand of Congress a tariff on foreign products that will equalize “production cost” here. For farm organizations and Congress to discuss units of “production </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">cost” </span><span class="font6">or units of labor value when they cannot correctly define the character and nature of those units, do not know what they are talking about, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">is the climax of asinine stupidity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The fact is the “production cost” or </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">labor </span><span class="font6">-ji value of a given product is exactly the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">same </span><span class="font6">the world over, and the currency that does </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">not &gt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">recognize that plain fact is the child either </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">I,' ignorance or of knavery.

<p><span class="font4">On September 16,1919, the Congress, by special enactment, granted a charter to a group of men and their successors empowering them to of veterans of the World War American Legion.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font4">and because the organizers had been furnished by interests^ which have never been revealed with practically unlimited funds, the American Legion has come to be considered by the general public as an organization voicing the spirit and aspiration of all former service men. ' Ever since its organization the men in control of the American Legion have wrongfully assumed to represent the great body of veterans of the World War in matters of legislation, of public policy, and in many questions in which those leaders are personally interested, but about which the body of veterans as a whole care nothing. These leaders have become so overbearing and insolent in their assumptions that they are now, and for some time have been, presuming to give voice to the opinions of all former service men—those who do not belong to the American Legion as well as those who do. Their conduct in this regard has gone to such lengths that we feel that it has become incumbent on us to acquaint you, as the chartering power, with the actual facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The real situation is this: A group of silk-stockinged officers met in France and determined on the formation of an association of veterans. Shortly thereafter, at a time when the Army was rapidly returning to the United States, a committee of hand-picked, self-constituted former officers, carrying out the line of action which had been determined on at the preliminary meeting in France, opened offices in New York and procured from unknown sources some hundreds of thousands of dollars, to be used in futherance of their ends. This committee prepared the constitution and by-laws for the proposed organization, which was to be known as the American Legion, and arranged for a meeting in St. Louis, at which the constitution and by-laws were to be adopted and the American Legion launched. The same New York committee supervised the selection of delegates to the St. Louis meeting by calling on the draft boards throughout the United States to hold meetings of former service men at which the delegates were to be selected. In each instance these meetings were restricted in their choice of delegates to officer's of the rank specified by the New York committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By the terms of the charter of the American Legion and its constitution and by-laws its officers were Belected by the organizers, and the successors of these officers are still chosen by the same self-constituted interests on a self-perpetuating basis.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">5.

An examination of the facts in the cases of Arthur Clark-, Carpenteria, Calif.; Frederick Keis, Jr., Cincinnati ; Kate O’Hara, Minot, N. Dak.; former Senator J. Ralph Burton and Prof. Wilson, at Ellinwood Kans.— to mention only a few of these instances—will convince all fair-minded men that the perpetrators of these outrages should not be permitted to hide their offenses behind a Federal charter.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">6. That the leaders of the American Legion have pursued the settled, uniform policy of interfering with, and dictating to public schools and colleges, churches, : newspapers, public meetings, political assemblies, officers charged with the preservation of the public peace' and all persons and all activities which in any way threatened to endanger the interests of the secret financial backers of the Legion, and they still pursue this policy under the cloak of the Federal charter and without any authorization from the body of their members.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6">At the Kansas City Convention of the American Legion, held in November, it was demonstrated that these fellows have no regard for established law but are a law unto themselves. That assembly was reported to have been a drunken carousal, all respect for law and order being trampled upon. It is stated that they took their jugs and bottles to the chief of police, and asked that official to keep them in custody until called for. This he did!</span></p>

It is apparent to a visitor that England is comparable with a much over-cultivated garden, which unless foreign fertilizer, in the form of commerce, is abundantly supplied, becomes at last incapable of nurturing its dense population. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font6">thinning-out process and the cultivation of other fields through a scheme of emigration seem absolutely necessary. Unemployed are in evidence almost everywhere, in some districts more than in others. They can be seen with dejected mien, “hanging around” the labor exchanges and street corners. Varied are the efforts put forth to extract from the social soil sufficient nourishment to attend to daily needs. Some hawk small articles from door to door; others “sing” in the streets, casting wistful glances at the windows; others form into bands of musicians, forcing upon a bored public every variety of melody at unseasonable hours; while still others engage in the nocturnal profession ’of burglary. “Unemployables” are not wanting —those who prefer to drag along on the “dole” and to prop up the counters of “public houses”,</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">public protectors in the face of a scourge. Thus j is demonstrated the anarchous tendency of the &quot;&nbsp;times and we may easily surmise what will be the nature of the occurrences when the “four winds” are loosed and the resulting whirlwind.-/ of anarchy begins to increase in strength and rapidity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of the disregard of the Kansas City Convention of the Legion for the prohibition amendment to the Constitution— the highest law of the land—the Joplin Tribune said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Of the distinguished visitors who attended </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font4">American Legion convention, none was received </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">with </span><span class="font4">more royal acclamations than John Barleycorn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“With bonded labels like chevrons on his glassy shoulders, neck erect and his cock hat tipped jauntily </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">fol </span><span class="font4">immediately removal, Gen. John stalked through the downtown streets amid the cheers of hundreds of legion-aires.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">falling further and further into the abyss of dejection and hopelessness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The housing problem still remains critical. At the same time that many families find themselves obliged to drag out an unsatisfactory existence in one or two rooms, a large number of houses stand empty—“For Sale” but not “For Rent”, their owners hoping to realize on them at a handsome profit. The building of new dwelling houses is negligible; and, although the building-material “ring” has allowed prices to drop slightly, it is unlikely that any marked activity will be noted until further progress is made in that direction. In the meantime, through the selfish greed of the “ring” private buildihg operations are suspended and the crying need of the people for increased housing accommodations remains disregarded. Most of the building of dwelling houses in the recent years has been carried out by the minicipal governments; and, although these constructions have been mostly designed as dwellings for the workers, their excessive cost places their rentals beyond the reach of that class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the best residential districts of the West End of London there are large numbers </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">houses for sale. The owners, formerly belonging to the wealthy classes, but whose incomes have been depleted on account of Income </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Tax </span><span class="font6">demands, find themselves obliged to reduce </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ex</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">penses and move into smaller and less expensive abodes, or into hotels. Household staffs are being reduced, and butlers and other not absolutely essential servants dispensed with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Land is rapidly changing hands in England, and a new class of landowner is coming into evidence. “Small holders” are increasing. Many of the great estates are being divided up and portions disposed of; and ancestral halls are passing into the hands of war millionaires. Occasionally a duke or an earl announces that Jie is in financial -straits and that he will be forced to dispose of a portion of his estates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hospitals are finding it difficult to make ends meet. Many of their former patrons have been obliged to cut. down charity expenditure, and it is said- that many of the newly rich do not fully appreciate their responsibilities in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The recent prolonged drought in many districts has wrought considerable havoc. It has been necessary, in- some counties, to carry water long distances in order to supply the needs of cattle. Wells have gone dry, and rivers have decreased </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">content. It has even been said that, unless conditions show an early improvement, certain localities may become uninhabitable. It is es</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">timated </span><span class="font6">that for the past year there has been </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">.a </span><span class="font6">shortage in rainfall of about 12 inches. In some parts the lack of moisture has brought about the contraction of the soil to such an extent that the foundations of buildings have had to be reinforced or rebuilt. Prospects for agriculturists and cattle raisers for the coming season are unpromising.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">England is beginning to share the fate of America in the form of domination by “combines”. Milk is 8d per quart, as compared with pre-war price of 4d; while as regards its quality and the methods of distribution employed, these, compared with conditions of the industry in New York, are nothing short of a disgrace. One </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">the most enterprising London dailies, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Express,</span><span class="font6"> has been making a campaign .for some time, to bring about better conditions </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">the milk supply business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Prices of </span><span class="font6">necessities, with the exception of house rent, traveling, and coal, have fallen very considerably, and are in many cases back to prewar rates. A medium quality suit of men’s clothes can be bought for $20.00, while a good </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">pair of </span><span class="font6">shoes cost $4.00. Christmas fare—with </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the exception of turkeys, the price of which was</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark49"><span class="font6">“boosted” by heartless speculators from </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">28c. to </span><span class="font6">$1.00 per pound—was reasonable, which enabled</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark50"><span class="font6">the average family to provide a more liberal</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark51"><span class="font6">table at the festive season than in the preced-</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font6">ing post-war years. Internal trade, especially at the great sales of women’s goods, 'is brisk, in view of the prevailing low prices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">General (export) trade returns show a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">grad</span><span class="font6">ual improvement. It seems doubtful, however, if the government will be able to balance </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">forthcoming budget, unless stringent economies are promptly affected. The nine months of the' current financial year shows a deficit of some £60,000,000, due very largely to the falling-off - &nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">of income under the Excess Profits duty. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The , ■ </span><span class="font6">report and recommendations of Sir </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Eric Geddes ■; </span><span class="font6">on governmental expenditures appears to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font6">been side-tracked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The rapidly lessening faith of the people in the clergy is becoming increasingly apparent as • skepticism and indifference increase. The church authorities recently refused the offer of a large sum of money for several of the church edifices and ground in the city of London, the sugges- • tion being that the money might be profitably employed in augmenting the stipends of necessitous clergy. Many of these city churches are ;• of ancient origin, situated in the central busi- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ness section of the city, whose number of inhab- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. '■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">itants on other than working days is infinitesimal. Church attendance on Sundays is said often not to exceed a dozen persons; and aside from the fact that attaching to these churches there is usually a valuable “living”, it is difficult to find an adequate reason apart, possibly, from historical associations, that would warrant their perpetuation. The English church ap- ' -pears to be collapsing in more senses than one, <sup>r </sup>as announcement was recently made- that owing to subsidences a portion of Lincoln cathedral needed substantial repairs, which it was estimated would cost $1,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The British coal industry has recently secured some substantial orders, and in some fields </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">pits are working at full speed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Discontent with, and criticism of, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">govern- P </span><span class="font6">ment are very apparent. It is felt that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">powers that be are working more for their </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">own' • ' ' </span><span class="font6">particular interests than for the general inter- •: ests of the masses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Transportation in England is almost invariably on a highly efficient basis, while the system u existing in London is probably the best in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the , *</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">world. Surface transit is mainly carried on by means of well-designed and efficient motor omnibuses, of which there are hundreds of different routes in operation, and which are rapidly replacing street-car lines. These services operate not only in London itself but also to points at considerable distance outside. The subways are rapid and comfortable, and noise of operation has been to a very large extent eliminated. There is a general working agreement between the subways and motor bus lines, all of which come under the inclusive term of “underground”. Each station is clearly marked; and self-explanatory maps showing the whole transportation system of London are freely displayed, which helps tend to reduce travel to an almost exact science. Apart from a general re-planning of the entire system, it is hard to see how the facilities at present afforded could be improved upon.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font6">T THE age of two years I had a fever which affected my eyes. Between the ages of six and ten I lost many weeks of schooling on account of this. At one time I never saw light for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">over </span><span class="font6">six weeks, having my eyes bandaged continually except during treatments. At that time </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">specialist saved my sight; but as I grew older there was little improvement, though near</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ly </span><span class="font6">all “salves”, “drops,” “washes,” were used.

<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font6">HAT would you think of a man that would borrow $2,290.49 from another man, and give him </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> check in payment of the account, and then, for political reasons, would hem and haw forty-five years about making the check good? That is what Albert H. Baynolds, 4331 Oxford St., El Paso, Texas, claims Uncle Sam has done to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the spring of 1877, during the Custer campaign in the Black Hills, Mr. Baynolds, now old and poor, furnished the United States troops under Lieutenant Johnson with cash to the amount of $2,290.49 (virtually all the money he had in the world—his patrimony in fact), and received a United States voucher in return. The voucher should have been redeemed; i. e., paid some time during that calendar year, but the Black Hills were then far from any bank and the voucher was not presented until early in the next calendar year. As a result payment on it was refused.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The outcome is that for forty-five years Mr. Baynolds has been beseeching presidents, senators, congressmen, everybody, to see that he gets his money. Presidents write back and say that they can do nothing; that there must be an act of congress. Senators write back and beguile him with tales that after just a little bit his bill will be passed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The years have stretched into decades and decades are hastening Mr. Baynolds, once a . patriot of the patriots, and a believer in this government, down to a place where, shortly, unless he is one of the Millions Now Living that Will Never Die, he will have no use for his $2,290.49 when he gets it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How is it possible that such a shameless robbery could be perpetrated by the greatest and richest country in the world? Mr. Baynolds tells us that the answer is in one word, Politics. When the Democrats would pass the measure some Bepublican objects; when the Bepublicans would pass the measure some Democrat objects. The days stretch into months, the months into years, the years into decades, the decades </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">lead </span><span class="font6">to the tomb. Mr. Baynolds has been robbed and the unintentional but none the less efficient thief</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">that stands before the world in this instance is the same great corporation, the United States Government, that has sent many a hapless bank clerk to Atlanta Penitentiary for five years for irregularities that in amount and in meanness </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">spirit in no way compare with the robbery </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">which Mr. Raynolds so justly objects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How can the United States Government consistently send anybody to Atlanta Prison as </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">thief when it is itself in this instance, a thief of the meanest, lowest order, a thief that borrows money which it is well able to repay but which it refuses by neglect to repay to a poor man? But perhaps it is enough for the common people to reflect that not much can be expected from a body that w’ould seat Truman H. Newberry in the highest legislative seat in the gift, or in this instance, we might say, the purchase, of the people. If this country does not need Christ’s kingdom, none ever will.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">T SEE “by the papers”, that the “disarmament J- convention is a success of the first magnitude”. If we believe all we read in the papers we must have a leather judgment, an elastic conscience, a dark brown imagination, and a pair of opaque eye-glasses, and then we shall be qualified to enjoy “oursel’s as ithers”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A few years ago the papers arose to remark that Germany was hell and the inhabitants were all he-devils and she-devils and imps; and that this nation was divinely appointed to execute judgment on Germany. The pulpit and press started a war-dance and invited all the_inhabi-tants to join in the mirth-provoking exercises; and this they did with a keen relish. The nations round about were invited to “join with us” and all unite in a supreme effort to make the festivities the most successful that our oldest inhabitant ever “hearn tell on”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those who did not dance were invited to contribute toward the fiddler’s fund, the refreshment fund, the manager’s fund, the castor-oil fund, the sugar fund, the Hog Island fund. There were more holes to fill with funds than there are rooms in a yellow-jacket’s castle. Preachers pounded pulpits for funds to make “the world safe for democracy”. Editors beat their tomtoms loud, long and furiously, calling attention to the fact that “if we do not destroy the devil and his imps they will invade the U.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Suddenly there was a panic; a day was </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ap</span><span class="font6">pointed for “prayers for peace”.

No. 58 is the latest to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">hand; </span><span class="font6">and I wish to add a thought to the first article, by Robert Lawson. We must </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">remember that </span><span class="font6">God changeth not, and that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">every command He</span></p><img src="g_E_19220315_files/g_E_19220315-22.png" alt="" style="width:45pt;height:40pt;">
<p><span class="font6">ever gave will be carried out some time and by some one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For some time the first command given to I- father Adam in his beautiful garden home has been dinning in my ears, day and night. “Subdue the earth” is part of it; and now as there is so much agitation about the coming restitution I am very much impressed with the fact ' that man still has this work to do. And the sooner men awake to their responsibility and opportunity, I believe, so much sooner we shall see the curse begin to be removed. Every reasonable thinking person admits that the soil is the foundation and source of all wealth, and that without access to free land people are at the mercy of the money kings who at present control almost everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">l am here in a country (Mexico) that by most Americans is regarded as very unsafe to life and property. But from what I have seen and heard, I believe that I am much safer here than in any city in the United States. I have seen men go into the banks, and come out with sacks of gold and silver on their shoulders, and walk the streets in safety. This could not be done in any other country that I know of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Moreover, I do not know any place on this continent where the government is offering - such favorable opportunities for real, earnest i men and women who would like to secure homes in a climate and on a soil that produce abundantly Tor a small outlay of labor. I also see the opportunity for families with small means ( to secure homes, where they soon can have a miniature Edenic garden.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">• So I am agitating for the work of restitution </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">± &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to </span><span class="font6">be begun here, by men and women coming</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">f &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6">and grasping the opportunity for practically</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">&lt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;free land with every condition very favorable;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font6"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and if we are really living in the time when</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">f &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;millions now living shall never die, is it not</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">about time that those who believe in the literal ■ restoration spoken of by the mouth of all the T - holy prophets since the world began, should ; show their faith by their works, and begin by getting out of the cities (which in the near fu-ture shall be overthrown), where every crime thrives and increases? I believe it will not be</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">long </span><span class="font6">after we really go to work in faith to do </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s </span><span class="font6">will that we Shall see the curse gradu</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ally remove.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Mexican people are quiet and peaceable, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">much in need of leaders and instructors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">They have been under the oppressor s so many years that it is only natural that they are suspicious. So if you think that God meant man to subdue the earth, remember that in Mexico there are millions of acres available at almost any terms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The government is organizing a colony six miles from this city, with good soil, water, and climate much like that of Los Angeles, without fog. As much land as a family is capable of using can be leased for a term of from twenty-five to fifty years; and I believe the great reason why this government is not recognized by the United States is simply the fact that bankers and real-estate sharks see plainly their doom written. If this government can put the people on the land and let them make for themselves happy homes, this nation will be an object lesson for the whole earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God’s will shall be done on earth as it is in heaven. I am 68 years old, and expect to live forever. Glory to God! I do not know how long I shall be here, as I expect some friends who wish, to locate in Durango, and I will go with them. But any information which I can give I will gladly do so.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font6">O THE poor and unemployed of our great cities, the burning of corn for fuel by Western farmers and by light and power companies, seems a frightful thing. What it means to the farmers is not so easily apparent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the Department of Agriculture we learn that a ton of corn is equal to coal at $10 per ' ton. We are also informed that a ton of hay extracts $7 worth of value from the soil. Corn will probably take an equal toll; and an equal value in fertilizer must be used to replace it, if the soil is to continue to be productive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If the corn was fed to stock of any kind, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">large part of it would be returned to the soil as fertilizer. When jt is burned, the value disappears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thousands of acres in our Eastern states have been worn out to a point where they will produce nothing but sheep sorrel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our timber, like our soil, is being ruthlessly wasted and destroyed; and in the more thickly settled parts of the country there is no timber.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font6">the United States, most of our timber lands have .gone to the individual, for exploitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some years ago, vast stretches of timber, coal, and mineral lands in West Virginia were advertised and sold for cents an acre; and for the exploiting of these resources, the American public is now suffering.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Our methods of the past have been chaotic and harmful. It is universally admitted that we are the most wasteful people in the world. In every walk of life we are improvident and wasteful. When you receive your mail today please note that for one letter of importance, there will be several that advertise goods that you do not want, appeals for support from candidates for office, and a multitude of other things that do not interest you. In an election in this city recently, the postal employes were forced to work three additional hours to deliver campaign literature alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You may ask: What has this to do with me? The reply is: It is waste, and every one has to stand a part of it; and whether you know it or not, you must stand your share.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Take the daily paper: The greater part of it is devoted to advertisements that busy and useful people seldom have time to read. Three-fourths of the printing, and three-fourths of the material on which the printing is done, are wasted through lack of a proper system of manufacture and distribution. The labor of thousands of men and the forests from thousands of acres are wasted to market shoddy goods, that it would be better never to have made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Good hides are destroyed to make cheap leather to supply the poc<sub>z</sub>r with shoes, half of which are paper. Burlap overcoats are made for those who can pay for no better; poorly built houses waste our fuel; we live at long distances from our work’, and in labor and carfares waste a vast amount annually. To go to and from work, the ordinary city worker spends the interest on $1,500 annually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have in our present system built a wonderfully ingenious machine, that is so complicated that it will not pay to use it much longer. When a ship costs too much to repair, or becomes obsolete, the Government scraps it. When </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">manufacturer finds that he cannot afford to use antiquated methods, he adopts new ones. A nation cannot do this with an economic system such as we live under. There are too many to profit by the old order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Were we able to put into operation </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a systenE*| </span><span class="font6">that would save one-fourth of the waste </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of to-'<sup>5</sup>! </span><span class="font6">day, there would be a vast amount of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">unemploy* V </span><span class="font6">ment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Should we turn the labor of these idlers </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">into </span><span class="font6">useful channels, we could make a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">wonderful </span><span class="font6">world, in which it would be </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">pleasure to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">live. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At present we are like a horde of locusts: </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font6">consume the material resources in coal, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">oil,', </span><span class="font6">timber, and minerals.

<p><span class="font6">To understand the mixing of iron by </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">chemical &lt;• </span><span class="font6">analysis it is necessary to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be acquainted with A </span><span class="font6">the fact that iron has mixed with it </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">certain </span><span class="font6">chemical elements. These have a very </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">marked ■ : </span><span class="font6">effect on the strength of the iron. One </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">hun- , ■ </span><span class="font6">dred pounds is the basis upon which the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mix-</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> e </span><span class="font6">ture is figured. For example, suppose we </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">have -</span><span class="font6">an analysis made; we find it as follows: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">y</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Manganese .......... .55 %</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Graphitic Carbon 2.75 %</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark61"><span class="font4">Silicon .......................... &nbsp;2.13 %</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font4">Combined Carbon &nbsp;.45</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark62"><span class="font4">Phosphorus.45 %</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark63"><span class="font4">Sulphur ................ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.019%</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark64"><span class="font4">The balance is metallic iron .........93.651%</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font6">It lias been discovered in the last few </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">decades </span><span class="font6">that these elements can </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font6">regulated </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">when cast- ” </span><span class="font6">ing, and better results obtained. Castings </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">can </span><span class="font6">be made so that they may be machined </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">easily, </span><span class="font6">and yet they will be strong; or they may </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be -</span><span class="font6">hard, weak, and brittle. Because of this, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">up-</span><span class="font6">to-date manufacturers, when having</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">-castings ' </span><span class="font6">made, demand that they stand a certain test, and require test-bars frpm every heat. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The re- ' </span><span class="font6">f suits are better and uniform castings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Four elements are taken into consideration in most cases, when casting ordinary gray </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">iron: f </span><span class="font6">namely, silicon, manganese, phosphorus, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and ■ </span><span class="font6">sulphur. Let us consider them in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">order </span><span class="font6">named. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">silicon &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This element is a softener </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">up </span><span class="font6">to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a certain &gt;&nbsp;' </span><span class="font6">point, after which it has a hardening </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">effect, .</span></p><img src="g_E_19220315_files/g_E_19220315-24.png" alt="" style="width:41pt;height:23pt;">

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">It is not advisable to permit it to go above 3.50 percent. It is not necessary that it go any higher for any class of work, although chemists generally agree that it does not reach the hardening point until the 3.50 percent is reached. For farm and other light machinery from 2.00 to 2.25 percent is sufficient; but for gas-engine cylinders better results will be obtained by keeping this element at 1.75 percent or as low as 1.25 percent, depending upon the required size. Other elements being normal, the higher the silicon, even reaching as high as 3.50 percent, the softer and weaker the castings will be. With low silicon, hard and strong castings will be obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">MANGANESE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This element is a very important one; and : it has been the experience of the writer that defective castings could be remedied by the proper use of it. Manganese from .45 to .60 percent in machine castings gives good results. When it runs higher the effect is to soften, unless it runs as high as the silicon; for then it hardens. With from .60 to.90 percent in cylinders there is fi close grain which tends to keep them from leaking. When casting white iron for feed-grinder burrs the teeth failed to run out sharp. On making an analysis it was found that manganese was only .21 percent. The next heat it was raised to .40 percent with the other elements about the same. The result was good sharp teeth which were not too brittle. _</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">PHOSPHORUS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This’ element is very desirable in light castings ; for it adds to the fluidity of the iron. To illustrate: the iron may flow from the cupola with every indication of being very hot, but does not run light pieces. Usually, upon investigation, the phosphorus is found to be low. In light castings this element may run from .80 to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1.00 </span><span class="font6">percent. This results in brittle castings. One factory was losing a large percent of work </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font6">breakage in their tumblers. By lowering the phosphorus the loss was overcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">SULPHUR</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sulphur is very detrimental to iron if it is found in an excessive degree. It is preferable below .10 percent in machinery castings and as much lower as possible in cylinders. To add </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">the foundryman’s troubles it is absorbed</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">from the coke by the iron during the melting &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'<sub>f</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font6">process. This is overcome to some extent by , &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">the use of manganese, which carries off some of ■ the excess sulphur. When this element is found &lt;&nbsp;in too large a percent it has the following effects; . The castingswillbe strong but very hard, causing considerable difficulty in machining. Also in : •/ process of pouring,the iron will be very sluggish . and sharp corners are not inclined to fill out. In cylinders there will be leaky places, called by foundrymen sulphur holes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As we stand at the dawn of the Golden Age the possibilities in the perfection of mixing and melting irons are still before us. The accomplishment, in Solomon’s day, of brass moulding refutes the evolution theory. In 1 Kings 7:15, 16 and 46, the casting of two large pillars, each <sub>; </sub>27 feet long, is recorded. This feat would tax j the ingenuity of brass foundrymen of today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The account is very simple: “In the plains of * Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay. c ground between Succoth and Zarthan”. If some one would step into the office of a brass foundry- - i man in our day and offer him such a task, it is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>A</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font6">doubtful if it could be accomplished as easily &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">as the writer has stated it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font6">N 1844 Samuel F. B. Morse invented the mag</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">netic telegraph. People ridiculed the idea of getting messages over wires and looked upon Morse as being a harmless creature, though a little weak mentally. The line between Baltimore and Washington was duly completed; and the first message transmitted was, “What hath God wrought!” During the past seventy-eight years, hundreds of thousands of miles of tele- • graph lines have been constructed and the oceans crossed and recrossed with cables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But telegraphy after a time, seemed too slow; messages had to be sent by dots and dashes. Could not something be invented to make it possible to talk over the wires? Men began to think and to work along this line; and in the early 70’s Alexander Graham Bell successfully carried on ’ a conversation over wires. The voice was transmitted, and from that time we have had the telephone. During the past fifty years, millions of telephones have been installed in the homes of the people in this land and other countries. The telegraph and the telephone are</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">' considered indispensable, not only for business but also for pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Still more thinking was done. Would it not be possible to transmit messages without wires ? The cost of hundreds of thousands of miles of poles and wires, to say nothing of erecting them and keeping them in place in spite of storms, fires, etc. was thought of. After much experimenting on both sides of the Atlantic the wire' less telegraph was invented in 1900; and when people heard of the invention they thought it </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">. a </span><span class="font6">false report and an impossibility. But again the supposedly impossible was accomplished, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">today, only twenty-two years later, we have thousands of land stations and every ship required by law to keep and maintain a station and the necessary operators. Now, ships in distress may signal for relief; and thus thousands of people have been saved that otherwise would have, perished at sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While the wonders of radio were being discussed, and while station after station was being erected, men were experimenting with means of conveying the voice through space without wires, and in this too they have been highly successful. This has been accomplished within the present decade. The radiophone has follow</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ed </span><span class="font6">the radiograph, just as the telephone followed the telegraph in even a shorter interval of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now with a radiophone set in the home, one is able to hear and enjoy musical concerts, press dispatches, weather and crop reports and time signals. The writer has a set in the home, and nightly is able to hear stations in New York and New Jersey, six hundred miles away, Pittsburgh, Chicago and other large cities. Any electrical supply house, in any city, can furnish a good * receiving outfit of twenty-five-mile radius for $25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Recently, Mr. Maxim, the inventor, was heard delivering a lecture in New Jersey in which he said that 20,000 people were listening to him by radiophone, and that he expects it to be possible </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">thus speak to one million people within three years. What would George Washington think if he were to return today and witness the means of communication and transportation that we daily use? Would he not say in the words of that first telegraph message, “What hath God</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16" style="font-variant:small-caps;">O</span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">liver Wendell Holmes says that it is necessary to begin at least two hundred years </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">before </span><span class="font6">birth if a child is to have the inheritance </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">s that </span><span class="font6">it has </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">right to demand. But Bible Stu</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">dents </span><span class="font6">know that to go back six thousand years </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font6">could not get what our father Adam lost </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">when he </span><span class="font6">brought the penalty of dying and death </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">upon </span><span class="font6">himself, and by the law of heredity upon </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font6">of his posterity. And it is to restore to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">'Adam </span><span class="font6">and his posterity what Adam forfeited </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">when </span><span class="font6">he disobeyed God that our Redeemer laid </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">down </span><span class="font6">His perfect human life a ransom-price to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font6">given to the poor suffering children of Adam, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">when the </span><span class="font6">times of restitution of all that was lost to the human race shall come.—Acts 3: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So then, the wisest course to take is to make </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">most of what we received as a birthday present, and to do the best we can under pres</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ent </span><span class="font6">conditions. And to do that, we can begin with </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">prospective mother. The first essential is to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">put her </span><span class="font6">into as good physical condition as possi</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ble; for </span><span class="font6">she who carries one must nourish two. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">If </span><span class="font6">there is a time in a woman’s life when foods </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">are more </span><span class="font6">important than at any other time, that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">time </span><span class="font6">is the period of expectant motherhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If the mother’s diet before birth of the child, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">during the nursing period, is deficient in tissue-sweetening mineral salts and so-called Vitamines required by the developing embryo, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">deficiency is made up at the expense of the mother’s own tissues, with a corresponding loss </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">health and vitality, affecting not only the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">mother </span><span class="font6">but also her child. How can vitamines </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font6">mineral salts that have been taken out of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">mother’s food find their way into the tissues </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">her unborn child, or into the maternal milk </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font6">which her child is nourished after birth ? It requires no highly endowed intellect to come to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">conclusion that it simply cannot be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is no greater tragedy than the result </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">ignorance of food and nutrition, which affect both mother and child. Without the proper sup</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ply of </span><span class="font6">those food elements during gestation, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">lactation period is followed by depressing consequences. During those two periods the mother who does not have those elements in her </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">food </span><span class="font6">is asked to operate without the materials essential to the accomplishment of the heaviest burdens of life. But she pays the penalty in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">extreme </span><span class="font6">suffering, and many times with her life. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">There </span><span class="font6">are many other factors which contribute </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ito her. </span><span class="font6">distress and suffering, but no single one </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">as far-reaching as the lack of natural nour-</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">875</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">ishing foods—foods which contain all </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the ele- • </span><span class="font6">ments essential to nourish the body in all its requirements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Prospective mothers should know, or should get this knowledge and act upon it, that there are certain minute quantities of certain substances found in natural foods, the lack of which entails serious disturbances of nutrition with corresponding loss of health, and this lack prevents her from returning to a normal condition of health after the two periods—gestation and lactation. The absence of these substances is always followed by serious consequences. The demand of lactation during the nursing period consumes the tissues in milk production until a condition of emaciation, anemia, impaired vitality results, favorable to the development of certain diseases, if the mineral salts have been refined out of the mother’s diet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is well known that mineral starvation is usually the primary cause of disease, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font6">the absence of these salts not only impairs </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font6">food values but actually tends to make them poisonous. Mineral starvation is followed by disturbances in the vital process, a reduction of the . blood, a reduction of the internal secretions, leaving the system in a condition favorable for the development of that dread disease, consumption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mineral salts are absolutely indispensable to the life of the tissues of the human body, and properly nourished tissues are indispensable to normal motherhood. The body is constantly excreting them; and where a new supply is not immediately available the blood and tissues are constantly impoverished by this process. It is therefore imperative that the prospective mother should know and use this knowledge in providing those substances in all the food she consumes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This subject of mineral-starvation is no new thing. Everybody should know that from milk— natural—whole grains, vegetables when properly prepared, and fruits^ we -obtain substances that are not found in white bread or white-flour . products, nor in meat, nor refined cereals. Yet as a rule they entirely ignore this important fact. Day after day they sit down to a table abundantly supplied with white bread </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">white-flour products, refined cereals, meat and condiments. Yet none of those foods contains the substances needed by the human body. Meat is wholly deficient in the mineral-salts of iron, calcium, potassium and magnesium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Next</span><span class="font6"> in importance to milk and whole wheat come the vegetables — baked potatoes, stringbeans, peas, tomatoes, cauliflower, cabbage, beets, celery, lettuce, radishes, fruits—oranges, apples, peaches, berries, melons, etc. When any </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">the above mentioned can be eaten in their raw state so much the better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A poached .egg on whole wheat toast, with some fruit and unskimmed natural milk—not pasteurized—makes a good meal. Then a glass of milk when retiring is splendid. Fried foods, pickles, spices, pastry and starchy sweets should be avoided, and replaced by sweet fruits such as figs, dates, raisins, prunes, etc., which are much more wholesome. *</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">PUKE AIR</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is estimated that to take a room 12 x 12 ft., flood it with fresh air, then put one adult into it and close the doors and windows—in two hours he has breathed all the air over once; in four hours, tw<sup>T</sup>ice; and so on. Pure, fresh air is essential to life, health, and happiness. Air is a marvelous invigorator to both mind and body. Nothing is more depressing and unwholesome than the breathing of impure air. And when we fully realize the renewing force, the li fe-giving power, of fresh air and sunshine, we will admit them freely to our homes and by thus doing exclude much sickness and suffering. When we live in close, ill-ventilated houses, we are courting danger by breathing and rebreathing the exhalations from our own and others’ lungs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the principal factors in causing sickness in the average home is that of air breathed over and over. If oxygen is the basis of lii’e— and it is—and if carbon dioxide is the great enemy of life, then it docs not require a great amount of reasoning to see that when we rebreathe carbon dioxide that has been thrown off in the process of breathing we are taking an enemy into our system to stead away our health and life. For how can (he lungs supply oxygen to the blood if there is no oxygen in the air which the lungs breathe ? ITow very simple the question is when one stops to think!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Each one of us, and especially prospective mothers, should give this all-important subject her most earnest consideration? You would not knowingly starve yourself or your child. Therefore why shut off the supply of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the life-giving </span><span class="font6">oxygen ? If all people could be made to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">under</span><span class="font6">stand the importance of fresh air, what a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">great </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">if </span><span class="font6">reduction in the number of sick people it </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">might </span><span class="font6">make, if the knowledge were acted upon. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How hard it is to impress people with </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">this. - ? </span><span class="font6">fact: that air was made to breathe, and that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font6">was made about as it should be used. Some </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">seem</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">to think that they can improve it by filtering </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">it -</span><span class="font6">through several layers of lath and plaster, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">shut- </span><span class="font6">N ting it away from the sunshine, contaminating it with the emanations of bodies of old </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and ? </span><span class="font6">young, cats and dogs, etc., before it is properly prepared for themselves and their children to . breathe. How frequently one hears mothers /. say if the door is left open, “Close that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">door, , </span><span class="font6">quick! Can't you see that baby is in a draft!”' How unreasonable to be afraid of air in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">mo</span><span class="font6">tion! It is about as harmless as any thing </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">can </span><span class="font6">be. If you love your child give it fresh air day and night. If you must sleep indoors in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">summer, ' </span><span class="font6">at least throw every window and door </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">wide </span><span class="font6">open. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To keep children healthy and sw<sup>T</sup>eet-tempered, . they must get plenty of fresh air. They </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">cannot </span><span class="font6">get too much. In cold, stormy weather </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">when ' , </span><span class="font6">you do not wish to venture out, put the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">chil- . ‘ </span><span class="font6">dren’s wraps on them and throw the windows w ide open. Do this just before their afternoon nap and you will see the beneficial results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">FEEDING THE BABY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mother’s milk is the perfect food for the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">hu</span><span class="font6">man infant intended </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font6">nature for its </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">suste-. </span><span class="font6">C nance during the<sup>1</sup> first year or longer. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Failing , </span><span class="font6">in the supply of mother’s milk, substitutes </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">may </span><span class="font6">be used. ’The stomach of the new born </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">infant </span><span class="font6">is small. It has a capacity of only about </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">two • </span><span class="font6">or three tahlespoonfuls at first, so that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">during </span><span class="font6">the first week it is best to give the feedings </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font6">intervals of two hours, and give nine </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">or ten . </span><span class="font6">feedings per day. With the second week the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in* . </span><span class="font6">tervals should be two and a half hours, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">with </span><span class="font6">seven or eight feedings per day; and after </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">three </span><span class="font6">months, intervals of three hours should be </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ob</span><span class="font6">served with not more than six feedings per </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">day. . </span><span class="font6">At seven or eight months, intervals </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of three and </span><span class="font6">a half hours should be allowed, with five </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">feed</span><span class="font6">ings daily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The best substitute for mother’s milk is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">goat’s </span><span class="font6">of- cow ’s milk. If either goat’s or cow’s milk </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">is. </span><span class="font6">used it should be modified. Goat’s milk </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and -</span><span class="font6">cow’s milk have nearly the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">same composition,, </span><span class="font6">j</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">though </span><span class="font6">perhaps the amount of fat in the goat’s p milk is slightly less. A quart of either goat’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">g or </span><span class="font6">cow’s milk should be set aside in a cool place £ for eight hours. Then the upper half, contain-k' </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font6">most of the cream, is poured off and diluted ?' with an equal amount of pure water. To this mixture an ounce of milk sugar is added. The &amp;&nbsp;quantity for a feeding is to be determined by the age of the child. [Authorities on vitamines</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">i disagree </span><span class="font6">with this paragraph.—Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&gt; A breast-fed baby is seldom troubled with </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">l~'</span><span class="font6"> indigestion, unless fed too much or too often, i Bottle-fed babies are not always so fortunate </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">this respect. Sometimes the stream of milk </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">■' coming </span><span class="font6">from the bottle is too large, and thus </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Hot </span><span class="font6">mixed with the saliva. This is easily reme-i </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">died by </span><span class="font6">procuring a new nipple and making j </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">smaller </span><span class="font6">holes in it. Sometimes modified milk </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“7 should be </span><span class="font6">given as though for a younger child, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">;• the </span><span class="font6">quality being rather rich for the little stom-5 </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>1</sup> ach. </span><span class="font6">When the child is well over one year or eighteen months it may be given small quanti-</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ties </span><span class="font6">of more solid food. But go slowly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Babies as a rule are not given enough water </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">drink. In the morning instead of the usual <sub>s</sub> bottle of milk, substitute for it a bottle of warm [ Water with a little sugar in it, to make it more i' palatable for baby. This will flush out the ali</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">mentary tract </span><span class="font6">and prevent constipation. Never </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">resort </span><span class="font6">to the pernicious practice of giving sooth-</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">’ ing </span><span class="font6">syrups, or any other drug. When its bowels </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">' need </span><span class="font6">attention give it an enema. Then there </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">will be </span><span class="font6">no danger of after-effects that prove </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">? harmful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ Never encourage a child to eat, a very common practice among parents but a very harmful one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘ It does not matter if two or three meals are *■ missed. When the appetite returns, the food eaten then will more than make up for what was ? lost by better digestion and assimilation. A warm bath and a long nap will set the child . right again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Piecing between meals for older children is a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">bad </span><span class="font6">practice. It causes indigestion and destroys appetite, which is the most important factor in digestion. The skin becomes sallow or very flushed, while the tissues become soft and the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">- teeth </span><span class="font6">decay, the bowels are not normal, and the child becomes fretful. Many cases of summer complaint attributed to the heat or to fruit are </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">direct result of irregular or over-feeding. Observe regularity in feeding, sleep, bathing </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">; and the </span><span class="font6">other requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is nothing so good to give a child </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font6">a bilious attack or cold as all the orange juice : it wants.

A child should never be given meat to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">eat </span><span class="font6">till after the age of five years at least; and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">tea </span><span class="font6">and coffee are not fit for any one, let alone </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a -; </span><span class="font6">child.

The more milk children drink </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the ■' </span><span class="font6">less other food they will eat, and milk is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a per</span><span class="font6">fect food for any one.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">children’s diseases</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is the prevailing superstition that one </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">can</span><span class="font6">not escape the contagious childhood </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">diseases* </span><span class="font6">such as mumps, whooping cough, measles, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">scar</span><span class="font6">let fever, diphtheria, and the like. Some </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">are so </span><span class="font6">stupid in this belief that they tell us that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font6">should try to have them while young, “get </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">them </span><span class="font6">and have them over with,” assuming that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">every </span><span class="font6">one is bound to contract them some time, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">that they are less dangerous in childhood. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Such </span><span class="font6">people look upon sickness </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">as a natural instead y </span><span class="font6">of an abnormal condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Any trifling indisposition on the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">part of the </span><span class="font6">child is often regarded as the forerunner of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">contagious disease. “He is coming </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">down with </span><span class="font6">something,” the mother fears; and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">forthwith </span><span class="font6">the child is coddled, drugged, bundled up, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">kept </span><span class="font6">in the house for fear he will get some fresh air, etc., until the wonder is that he does not justify her fears. There is really no reason why a child should be sick at all. Children reared </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">under </span><span class="font6">proper conditions of life would not “catch” those diseases, even if exposed to them. It is the child <sub>;</sub>' with the lowered vitality that is subject to them. <sup>z </sup>If good health is maintained, a power of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">resis</span><span class="font6">tance is established that effectually baffles </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">dis</span><span class="font6">ease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many times when </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">child is in seeming </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">good </span><span class="font6">health it consumes unwholesome food, or </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">water, - ■ </span><span class="font6">unnoticed by the mother, perhaps; and it is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">only </span><span class="font6">when the child becomes ill as a result that any attention is paid to it. However, if it had only received the proper attention then, it undoubtedly would have escaped a serious sickness. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But </span><span class="font6">with the usual ignorance among parents in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">re- , </span><span class="font6">gard to the laws of health and the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">nature of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">z' </span><span class="font6">the trouble, the child is almost certain to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">receive</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">the wrong treatment, and is almost sure to have “something”. Windows are kept closed, extra clothing is put upon the child, and it is given every thing to eat it wants, because it is sick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of course the child grows worse. Then the doctor is called, who also proceeds to make matters worse with the usual drugs or “antitoxins”. If the child manages to live through this foolish treatment, the doctor is given the credit, and if it dies, well, “He did the best he could!” But he did not do the best he could. He should have removed the poisons from the child’s system, instead of putting more into it.</span></p>

It is very good for indigestion and for correcting the children’s bowels ’ that they may sleep and rest. It is very simple and is worth any one’s while trying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Take a few nice ripe tomatoes (not canned tomatoes) squeeze them into a pulp; squeeze in a rag all the juice from the pulp and strain the juice through another fine cloth. Then for every tablespoonful of the juice add one teaspoonful of granulated sugar and boil until about as thick as molasses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For a small child 3 to 6 months old give of teaspoonful one hour and the milk the next hour.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Sweet Spices of the Bible</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font6">HIS subject may sound spicy, but it is not our thought to treat it as such. Yet when E. we. consider the spices mentioned in the Bible jr .and their significance, we believe it to be a sub-f ' ject worthy of careful study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">K</span><span class="font6"> The Bible is the most wonderful book in the ■L- world; it contains no idle words, unless an oc-£ * casional interpolation, .and such must not be ; considered a part of the Bible. But many of its f- richest treasures are concealed in parables, dark *= sayings, and symbolic language; and he who k would get its most precious truths must dig deep ■J, to unearth these treasure-mines, searching dili-if gently God’s wonderful storehouse of knowl-1 edge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">f &nbsp;&nbsp;The “sweet spices”of theBiblearenotmention-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I ed as flavoring extracts, but because of the sweet J scent, or perfume, which they possess: and L these perfumes each have an appropriate signi-ficance, symbolizing friendship, appreciation, wisdom, understanding, knowledge, ability, con-secration, sanctification, gratitude, praise, pray-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I- </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">er, </span><span class="font6">patience, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">t As an example of friendship, see Proverbs </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font6"> 27:9; “Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: b so doth the sweetness of a man’s friend by ■' .hearty counsel”. The word “ointment”, here, we ? believe refers to the oily liquid in which the f sweet scent, or perfume, is contained, represent-£ ing the spirit of friendship, oil being used in the 'i Bible as a symbol of spirit. But the sweet scent ? itself emanating from the ointment, represents the hearty appreciation of the friend’s counsel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">t The apostle Paul, we believe, gives us a k similar thought in his letter to the Philippian ■ church: “But I have all and abound: I am full, ’ having received from Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odor of a sweet k smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">' God”.—Philippians. 4:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What had the church at Philippi sent by Epa-phroditus to the apostle Paul that he here calls “an odor of a sweet smell” Surely it was not i a bouquet of roses, sweet peas or apple blos-L soms! Whatever it was, it required a-sacrifice . on the part of the givers which was well-pleas-<sup>f</sup> ing to God: and the gift was very acceptable to the Apostle. We believe that the Apostle was at this time a prisoner at Rome, and no / doubt he was deprived of many of the comforts *■_ that others enjoyed</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">; and to</span><span class="font6"> show their love and i friendly feeling toward him, the church at Phil-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Dr. H. C. Temple</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ippi sent to him a substantial present; and the Apostle is here expressing his appreciation of this gift, and commending the spirit that prompted it. Apparently it provided for all his wants, so that he could say, “I am full”, I have abundance. It is this spirit of self-sacrifice for the good of others, the spirit of loving friendship prompting sacrifice, and his appreciation of this, that he calls “an odor of a sweet . smell”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">HOLY PERFUMED OIL</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The holy oil with which the kings and priests of Israel were anointed, or set apart to their sacred office, was perfumed or scented with sweet spices. This holy anointing oil represented God’s holy spirit; and their anointing with it represented the anointing, or setting apart by God’s holy spirit, of Christ and the church for a sacred purpose. These&quot; sweet spices with which the holy anointing oil was perfumed, we believe, represent certain endowments bestowed upon the anointed ones by God’s holy spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Lord gave Moses particular instruction in regard to making this holy anointing oil, found in Exodus 30:23, 24: “Take thou also unto thee principal spices of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekelsj and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels, and of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To understand the significance of these principal (sweet) spices, take for example Bezaleel, who was especially endowed by the spirit of the Lord for the work of building the tabernacle (Exodus 31:3), and who was a type of Jesus Christ, whom God anointed for the work of building the antitypical tabernacle, or house, “not made with hands, eternal in the heavens”. (2 Corinthians 5 : l)“See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, to devise cunning work, to work in gold and in silver and in copper” (mistranslated brass).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We note that Bezaleel was filled with the spirit of God; that the holy anointing oil is a symbol of the spirit; and that this holy anointing oil was scented with myrrh, sweet cinna-</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">378</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">mon, sweet calamus and cassia: also that wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and all manner of workmanship were the endowments of the spirit of God upon Bezaleel. We conclude, therefore, that the myrrh represents wisdom, sweet cinnamon understanding, sweet calamus knowledge and cassia all manner of workmanship. But Bezaleel was the type. Christ, the antitypical Bezaleel, received the real anointing of the . spirit of God in wisdom (myrrh), understanding (sweet cinnamon), knowledge (sweet calamus), and in all manner of workmanship (cassia).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This harmonizes also with the statement of the prophet Isaiah in his account of the anointing of our Lord with the holy spirit. “The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him [oil], and the spirit of wisdom [myrrh], and understanding [sweet cinnamon], and the spirit of counsel and might [cassia], and the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord [sweet calamus].” (Isaiah ll:2)Itwill he noticed that the statement“coun-sel and might” used here and symbolized by cassia, is equivalent to the statement “workmanship” as used in the case of Bezaleel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING EQUIVALENT TO</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">WISDOM</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We note that in the holy anointing oil there were five hundred shekels of myrrh, and five hundred shekels of cassia, and only two hundred and fifty shekels each of sweet cinnamon and sweet calamus. Why not five hundred shekels of cinnamon and calamus also? We answer: Wisdom (myrrh) is the proper application of knowledge (sweet calamus); a man may have . knowledge and yet be a fool if he improperly applies that knowledge; hence understanding (sweet cinnamon) is necessary to the proper application of knowledge; or a proper balance of knowledge and understanding is equivalent to wisdom. Thus five hundred shekels of myrrh (wisdom), five hundred shekels of sweet calamus and sweet cinnamon combined, (knowledge and understanding), and five hundred shekels of cassia (workmanship), to a hin of oil is equivalent to the full measure of the holy spirit with which our Lord was anointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The following from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower of</span><span class="font6"> 1917, page 349, confirms our belief that Bezaleel was </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">type of Jesus Christ:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The ancestry of Bezaleel, as mentioned here, is typical of the existence of Christ on the various planes </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">He</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">' 'I</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">lived. Bezaleel was son of Uri, he in turn </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">son </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">Hur, and he in turn a son of Judah. Now Judah </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">mean# -* </span><span class="font4">praised; so was Christ praised in his prehuman exist<sup>4</sup> A ence, referring to the glory He had with the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Father ‘ </span><span class="font4">before the world was. Hur, the next offspring, repre- _ sents Christ’s humiliation, as the word Hur means grave, so Christ humbled himself even unto death, yea, to the&gt; ignominious death of the cross, down into the grave. From there He came forth with the right to life for every human being, and is the “Light of the world” John 1: 4), as Uri signifies light. And now He is the shadow of the Almighty, the robe of righteousness pro- -vided by God for us, as signified in the word Bezaleel, “Shadow of the Almighty”. Verse four says that this Bezaleel could devise cunning work to work in gold (the divine nature) and in silver (the spirit nature) and in copper (brass, the perfect human nature) show- . • ing Christ can complete work- on all these planes of existence.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus we see that when the anti typical Beza- . leel has completed his “cunning work” on the ] antitypical tabernacle, He will have worked out jewels of gold (144,000 — Revelation 14:1) in -the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4); and a great . multitude of ornaments of silver, in the spirit nature (Revelation 7: 9,14); and a world of copper, in the perfect human nature, the restor- . ed human race, in the divine image, as copper . resembles gold; and all perfumed with the “principal spices” in wisdom, in understanding, <sup>; </sup>in knowledge and in all manner of workman- <sub>? </sub>ship; each perfected and scented in his own J-nature. “I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh.” &lt;&nbsp;(Joel 22:28) So even the fleshly will be perfumed with spices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">WISDOM AND FOOLISHNESS &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Myrrh does not represent the “wisdom of this . world” which the Apostle says “is foolishness i with God” (1 Corinthians 3:19); but it does represent the wisdom “that is from above”. It “is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, ■ without wrangling, and without hypocrisy”. ’</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">But the war ended in half the time that was </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">expected and </span><span class="font6">upset many an applecart of in</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">trigue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>:</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Now it is not a boom in “religion”—which </span><span class="font6">Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pound weight”. About </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">hundred pound weight would be all </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a man could </span><span class="font6">carry; so Nicodemus was loaded down with “wisdom” and “patience” (myrrh and aloes) </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font6">he took the body of Jesus from the cross </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">embalmed it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">PERFUMED BEDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Proverbs 7:17 we read: “I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes and cinnamon”. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">My </span><span class="font6">bed would be </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">that upon which I rest, referring, we</span><span class="font6"> believe, to Bible doctrines upon which </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font6">rest in faith. The Christian should rest in faith upon doctrines perfumed with wisdom (myrrh), patience (aloes), and understanding (cinnamon). But the prophet Isaiah tells of other beds that are not thus perfumed. “For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it: </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6">the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.” (Isaiah 28:20) Pastor Russell says, “Studies in the Scriptures”, Volume </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">IV, </span><span class="font6">page GOS: “This may be interpreted to symbolize human creeds which are long enough for babes in Christ, but too short for a developed man, substituted for but very different from the doctrines of God’s Word whose length and breadth surpass human knowledge”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The sweetly perfumed doctrine of God’s great love (John 3:16) pulls all the cover off and exposes the fallacy of the unperfumed and unholy doctrine of eternal torture, taught by the traditions of men. Yet these two doctrines lay side by side in all the unperfumed creed-beds of Christendom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then if we would rest in perfect peace </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be</span><span class="font6">neath a covering of sufficient length and breadth, let us rest our faith upon doctrines, as </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a sure </span><span class="font6">foundation, a bed perfumed with wisdom, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">pa</span><span class="font6">tience and understanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">means one in papal-empire interests—but </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a sad </span><span class="font6">slump that is expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So says the Roman Catholic Bishop of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Clif</span><span class="font6">ton, England. He preaches: “There will be much less religion in the world in twenty years time”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Undoubtedly the Bishop has clearer vision </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">the drift of the tide than his brother of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">cloth, </span><span class="font6">the Reverend </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">J.

<p><span class="font4">&quot;No one can tell what the world will think of religion </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font4">twenty years time.

There </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font4">just now, in fact, a distinct revival of interest in this country in spiritual matters, and present-day tendencies certainly do not bear out the expression of opinion uttered by the Bishop of Clifton.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the preachers disagree, the man on the street must form his own opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bishop is right. There will be much less Roman Catholic religion in twenty years.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>Science Undermining Skepticism </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By 0. L. Rosenkrans, Jr.</span></h5>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font6">N THE </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Literary Digest</span><span class="font6"> for December 3,1921, is an article, &quot;Casting Out Devils,” telling how Doctor Montagne Lomax, an alienist of repute, told a London conference of churchmen, called to discuss spiritual healing, that in spite of the popular skepticism of men of science and psychologists concerning demon possessions, he himself firmly believes that many cases of insanity are demoniacal possession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The article goes on to explain how the advances in psychological knowledge are undermining the skepticism of nineteenth century materialism. Quoting the London </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Church Times </span><span class="font6">it says: “We can believe, for example, in the existence of evil and malignant spirits, and be at the same time intelligent and up-to-date scholars”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However, this intellectual change of front has not filtered down to the general public, whose prevailing attitude toward the unknown, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font6">one of skepticism. Probably scientific men soon will soberly accept the view of demoniacal possession, and thus pave the way for a popular belief in Spiritism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The public would be taught, not that the malignant influences are the fallen angels, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">hut that </span><span class="font6">they are the disembodied </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">spirits of wicked hu</span><span class="font6">man beings. This would, however, conflict </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">with </span><span class="font6">the Purgatory teaching of the Roman </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Catholic </span><span class="font6">church. Perhaps the failure of Spiritism to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be</span><span class="font6">come popular with the masses has something </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">do with the attitude of the Papal </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">church con</span><span class="font6">cerning it. If Spiritism is to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">become ascendant, </span><span class="font6">it would seem that the Roman </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Church must </span><span class="font6">somehow reconcile its doctrine to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">admit it.</span></p>

The </span><span class="font6">dust out of which Jehovah formed the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">body was </span><span class="font6">°not conscious. It had no life in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">5 </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">After God </span><span class="font6">had used these elements to form the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">man, He </span><span class="font6">breathed into his nostrils the breath </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">■ of </span><span class="font6">lives, which animated the body, caused the f </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">lungs to </span><span class="font6">begin to work, sent the blood tingling r </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">through </span><span class="font6">the arteries and returning through the / veins; therefore there resulted a moving, breath</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">' ing, </span><span class="font6">sentient being, a man, which is a soul. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">body aside </span><span class="font6">from the breath does not constitute</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">• the </span><span class="font6">soul; but it requires the uniting of the breath with the body to constitute the soul. And when Hgi </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font6">separate the breath from the body the soul f </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font6">longer exists. The Scriptures do not say </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">■. that </span><span class="font6">God breathed into this body immortality, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">;■ but </span><span class="font6">merely that the soul resulted by animating j </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">body after it had been created; and this I </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">resulted </span><span class="font6">from the breath which He breathed into p </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">nostrils.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">*<sup>T</sup>Just so with man.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">■ ■ hence a soul. When he ceases to breathe he is Uead.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>5S</sup>Man is a soul. He does not possess a soul. Every creature that breathes is a soul. God applied the words living soul to the lower order of animals long before man’s creation. (Genesis 1: 20, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font6"> That all breathing creatures are designated as souls by Jehovah is proven by these words: “Levy a tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep”. ( Numbers 31 : 28) All souls die alike. “For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">beast: for all is vanity. All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.” —Ecclesiastes 3:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup>Tn the manifestation of divine justice God said to Adam: “Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat; . . . for in the day that thou eatest thereof, dying thou shalt die”. (Genesis 2:17, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font6"> This sentence was pronounced against man, the being, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font6"> soul. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">If</span><span class="font6"> there could be any doubt about this, it is definitely settled by another statement in the Bible which reads: “The soul that sinneth it , shall die”. (Ezekiel 18: 4) “What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave?”—Psalm 89:48.</span></p>

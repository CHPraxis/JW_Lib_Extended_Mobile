<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Beyond the Indus </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">(Part</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> i)</span></h3>
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font10">HE word India simply means “Beyond the Indus,” the river at the western boundary of&quot; the country. India is a triangle, washed on two sides by the sea. Its length, north to south, is 2,000 miles; and its greatest width is 1,800 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Two millenniums ago the armies of Alexander the Great, ruler of Greece, invaded India. But India is a long way from Greece, and the soldiers who had conquered the world for Alexander did not wish to go farther away from home. Alexander wanted to go on, but lifter a few days’ parley saw that he could not do it without a revolt, and reluctantly turned back. In the middle ages the Mohammedans overran the country, and there are 66,000,000 Mohammedans in India at this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The problem of giving India a just, humane, uplifting government is the greatest governmental problem ever undertaken by man. It is so much more difficult than Britain’s Irish problem; or Mexico’s peon problem, or the United States’ Negro or Philippine problem, that all of them, and a dozen more to boot, are not worthy of comparison. The reason is that India is not a unit in any direction. It is disunited racially, lingually, religiously, industrially, socially. It is in an abyss of poverty beyond the ability of any mind to comprehend .that has not come into actual contact with India itself. And the problem is not getting easier of solution. Indeed, it grows harder year by year; for India is going to ruin in more ways than any other country, and has a less distance to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Imagine a land in which the people cannot afford to have separate homes; but family groups of thirty to fifty individuals live in one house, built around a quadrangle. In these dwellings are women whose only view of life is that of the court upon which the rooms of women always face. There is no furniture. The sanitary arrangements are unspeakable. The buildings are so rickety that they can barely stand. The walls and the floors swarm with vermin. In millions of these homes, food is to be had but once a day. Cholera and plague are rife. Tn the cities the industrial workers sleep fifteen to twenty in a single room, in a stifling atmosphere and in an intolerable stench. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font10">single window or door provides what ventilation there is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the country as a whole the rainfall is the heaviest in the world; yet, at times, there are hundreds of square miles of scorching plains without a tree, and so dry that the earth cracks. Leprosy and fever stalk hand-in-hand with hunger within the villages, while cobras and other poisonous serpents lie in wait to catch the unwary, or even invade the villages themselves. Four million people die of fever in India annually. One woman out of every six </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font10">a widow, and considered of ill-omen. She </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font10">denied suitable clothing, her jewelry is broken, her head is shaved, and she is virtually a prisoner for life. Even if not a widow, she may </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font10">take a railway journey except in a closed compartment with drawm blinds. If a woman </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">rank, she drives to the station in a closed carriage and passes from the carriage to the train through an artificial passageway of sheets held up by servants. She has nothing to say about whom she should marry. The marriage contract is arranged through brokers. To be the parent of a large family of girls is a disgrace; for a daughter is considered a calamity.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Governmental Complications</span></h5>
<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font10">MAGINE the difficulties of trying to rule over a state that for centuries was administered by 700 separate and distinct governments, all bearing rule at the same time in </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">aa </span><span class="font10">many adjoining states, and each with different customs handed down for generations. In these states forty languages and nearly four times that number of dialects are in use. Seventy of</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">the native states, inhabited by an average of a million people each, are governed by their native rulers much as they have been for hun-. dreds and in some instances thousands of years. The problems of governing such a people as a whole must involve the wise direction of these lesser rulers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Imagine the difficulties of trying to rule over 315,000,000 people, only six percent of whom can read and write, and of whom twenty percent are Pariahs who may not even use the public roads because they pollute others at sixty-four feet; and these 315,000,000 people are divided into 2,300 major and many more minor castes, with such an infinite variety of rules respecting pollutions and purifications that foreigners never get to understand them fully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A family of one caste may not mingle with those of another. A Pariah is considered untouchable and may never rise above that state. The average wage is three cents a day for all classes. Any kind of dead animal is the basis for a family feast among those who are of the untouchables. Clothes are washed by pounding them on a rock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Here is a land which has more than 30,000,-</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">000 </span><span class="font10">gods, or demons, each' requiring acts of penance or self-inflicted torture on the part of the worshiper. Each devotee is supposed to wear on his forehead the mark of his god, which determines his caste and his standing in the caste. The devil is worshiped because he is the strongest of gods; smallpox is deified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Women are never mentioned in conversations between men. It is an insult to speak to a man about his wife. The forty million child-widows are never permitted to view even the tops of the trees. Their whole lives are spent indoors. It </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font10">a life dishonor to reach the age of twelve years without being married. Public prostitutes are attached to the temples of worship, for the convenience of the heathen clergy and their friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In one section a marriage ceremony requires three days; in another a whiff from a pipe suffices. In one section the women wear skirts and in another trousers. There are districts where hunting and even warfare are still carried on with bows and arrows; and if there are not enough complications in governing the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Hin</span><span class="font10">dus there are 66,000,000 fighting Mohammedans, with all the idiosyncrasies for which </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Mo</span><span class="font10">hammedans are famous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Speaking in general terms, there is only one European in India to each 2,000 population. It is perfectly obvious that the only legitimate excuse a European has for being there is an unselfish desire to help the natives arrange for themselves that form of government which </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">will </span><span class="font10">be for their greatest benefit. Besides these Europeans (only 168,000 in the whole land) there are 16,000,000 natives who have some education and who under the direction of Europeans are engaged in professional and administrative work. These millions are more easily directed than the overwhelming masses engaged in agriculture, all of whom are chronically on the verge of starvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is obvious that one of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">things </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">most </span><span class="font10">needed in India is education; and it seems </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">great pity that in a land where the taxes can be wrung from the people only at the cost </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">the deaths of large numbers of them that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">so </span><span class="font10">much money should be spent for other things and so little for the education that would help to relieve the whole horrible situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the United States it is said that out </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">every dollar raised for taxation something like ninety-three cents goes to pay the cost </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">wars that are past or wars that we hope to get into in the future. But we do spend one cent of the dollar for education; and to that extent, or, we may say, in that proportion, this is </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">civilized nation. Indeed, some have even termed this a Christian nation, largely, we presume, because of the sums we spend for such good purposes. India does not do quite so well in the education of the masses; it has too many other ways for its money. It collects a total revenue of $617,000,000 and pays out $1,838,338 for education — less than one-third cent per one dollar. Ninety percent of the girls </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">eighty percent of the boys receive no education at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The income of the average American has been computed at exactly forty times the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in</span><span class="font10">come of the average Hindu, but the Viceroy </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">India is not content with one fortieth of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">income of the President of the United </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">States. </span><span class="font10">Not on your life! The President gets </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">$75,000 </span><span class="font10">per year, and the Viceroy gets $83,500, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">plua</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font16"><a name="bookmark29"></a>'1 »I</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">many allowances and presents from native rulers—which make the job much sought after. Christian Viceroys in heathen India have to be well paid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then the Viceroy must have assistants, somewhat like the President’s cabinet. Each member of the President’s cabinet receives a salary of $12,000 per year, but a member of the Viceroy’s council receives considerably more than twice that amount each. When these arguments reach the ears of the Hindu heathen, they become very convincing evidence that Christianity is a paying proposition, that pays even better in heathendom than it does in Christendom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The press of India seems to be in about the same condition as the press of the United States, i. e., afraid to tell the truth on any subject for fear of getting into trouble. In the year 1910 the Viceroy and his council (these make all the laws for India) put through a Press Act, calculated to take away all remaining freedom of the press in India; and the law seems to have accomplished, just what was expected of it by the liberty-loving British Empire. Since its enactment penalties have been levied on some 350 presses, 500 publications have been suppressed, and 300 newspapers have been bonded in large amounts. The press may publish the most violent attacks upon the natives, but nothing seriously criticizing the European interlopers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On account of its poverty India cannot afford much in the way of instruction by movies, although there are said to be 168 motion-picture houses, at which all classes of films are shown. The poor Hindus are like everybody else—seeking something of change, something that will make them forget their unhappy lot. They revel in the American films displaying the daredevil feats of cowboys on the </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font10">erican plains.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Famines in India</span></h5>
<p><span class="font18">O</span><span class="font10">F COURSE everybody knows or should know that there is no agricultural land that does not produce enough food to care for its population if there were some way by which all of the food raised could be devoted </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">feeding all that need it. But no such way </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">has been </span><span class="font10">found. When the great famine of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">1921-1922 </span><span class="font10">visited China, and millions died for </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">want </span><span class="font10">of food, Chinese big business was export</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ing eggs and other foodstuffs in great quan-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">tities. Does it not seem </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a pity that there waa </span><span class="font10">not some power in China strong enough </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and -</span><span class="font10">good enough to buy those eggs or </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">commandeer , </span><span class="font10">them and distribute them among the starving? Now if the Chinese government had had </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">V starving army instead of just plain </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">common </span><span class="font10">ordinary everyday folk, not an </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">egg</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> would have </span><span class="font10">moved until the army was cared for. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">-7</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">So it is in India. The country raises food enough. One cannot judge otherwise from the <sup>: </sup>facts; for in the year 1899-1900, when India ' was in the throes of one of its greatest famines, it exported over $60,000,000 worth of &lt;grain, and during the famine year of 1917-1918 the exports of foodstuffs were 7,000,000 tons, amounting in value to $247,179,360.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Students of Indian affairs claim </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">that in the </span><span class="font10">last great famine, in one year, the deaths </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">from </span><span class="font10">starvation and from plague caused by insuffi- , cient food amounted to 40,000,000 people; </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">they lay this loss directly to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the World War, ' </span><span class="font10">which swept India of foodstuffs. Does it </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font10">seem a pity that India does not have </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a govern</span><span class="font10">ment strong enough and good enough to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">pre</span><span class="font10">vent the export of foods when it knows that such shipments mean the death of millions </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">f </span><span class="font10">Granting that the civilization of Europe </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">is • </span><span class="font10">beautiful, brotherly, generous and “Christian,” is it sufficiently so to justify the killing of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">40,- &nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">The London </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Times can</span><span class="font10"> hardly be classed </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">as a </span><span class="font10">sentimental journal, but it published </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the fol</span><span class="font10">lowing from its Bombay correspondent; and there is a world of pathos in the simple recital of the facts attendant upon one of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">greatest </span><span class="font10">dramas of misery ever staged on this </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">planet. </span><span class="font10">The dispatch said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“India having been swept bare of foodstuffs to meet the exigencies of the war, the people feel that the home government is lukewarm in releasing supplies from outside, and regret particularly that the shipping controller is maintaining high freights on fat and rice from Burma. These severe sufferings are superimposed on the devastating influenza and cholera epidemics.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Taxes in India</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">i IE money paid in for taxes in India would 4 do a great deal to alleviate the miseries of its people; for $617,000,000 is a great ,sum of '|g| money. </span><span class="font10">In India, it would prevent 40,000^000 </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">people </span><span class="font10">from starving, and leave over a third </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font10">sum for distribution expenses, education, etc. Of course the government would have to cut down its expenditure of $213,911,500 for military purposes and $72,344,500 for strategic railroads; but would it not be worth while when people are starving? Starving people cannot </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">eat </span><span class="font10">armed soldiers or railroad tracks. It might </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font10">necessary to give the Viceroy a cut in his wages of $83,500 per year, with a slice off from the councilors’ wages of $27,000 each per year. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font10">jobs would be good ones at very much less wages, and the best of Viceroys or councilors is not worth much to a man that is starving to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Much of the money collected for taxes in India really belongs to the people themselves. Thus, the $113,432,000 land-tax, the $17,764,000 from forests and the $19,571,500 from salt are all for the use of things which pertain to the Hindus as a people from time immemorial. What a pity that only $1,838,338 of all these</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">amounts finds it way back to the people in the form of expenditures for education!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some of the money assessed for taxes plainly</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">’ belongs to the devil. In no other category can we place the $15,281,000 derived from the British Government opium monopoly, and the $60,766,550 derived from the sale of liquor. Ameri</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ca </span><span class="font10">is much more pious. We do not license the sale of liquor here; that is, we do not do so any more. We would be doing it—most certainly we would—but the ones that would have voted for the continued reign of John Barleycorn in our midst were busy drinking French wines when the Prohibition Amendment to the Constitution was passed, and the Supreme Court, in the exercise of rights not granted to it by the Constitution, has not yet decided that the Constitution is unconstitutional, though there are some who surmise that it may do so some. day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Sir William Digby has published statistics showing that the transport of India’s foods from the interior to the coast by means of the numerous railway lines and thence to the ends of the earth has so worked against the interest of the people that famines are increasing in frequency and intensity. He shows that in past centuries there was the number of famines in</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">dicated :</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Famines in India are not caused chiefly by failure of rains; for India has the heaviest rainfall in the world.

<p><span class="font10">Historians claim that it was from the taxes raised in India that the full costs were paid of Britain’s first Afghan war of 1839-1840; the Persian war of 1856; the Abyssinian war of 1866-1868; the Perak expedition of 1875; the second Afghan war of 1878-1880; the Egyptian war of 1878-1880; and the Soudan war of 18851886. It is hard to see why people who are starving to death, or who are always on the edge of starvation, should have to pay these bills.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">C</span><span class="font10">OOLIES in the tea gardens of India seem -to be treated about on a par . with the treatment of American citizens in the convict camps • of the South, as far as we can judge. That is&gt; . they are treated as slaves, and all just rights as human beings are denied them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A case has come to our attention where some</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">Commenting on this table a writer has well said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Work, hunger, lingering death—these are the milestones on the tragic path of the life of the workingman in India. Enveloped in an engrossing mist of poverty he goes through life as in a nightmare. From birth to death he rises before dawn hungry, works all day long with but little to eat, and at night he goes to bed hungry again. His constant companions are hunger and thirst, debt and degradation, sorrow, suffering and sickness, unclean clothes and unsanitary homes. His only Consolation in life is the hope of relief in death.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One of the causes of India’s poverty is that out of a total population of 318,132,537, according to the latest census returns available, 4,500,000 are what are termed in India mendi</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">cants </span><span class="font10">or holy men, but what in America we would probably designate as religious bums </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font10">pious tramps. These go on pilgrimages from </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">one </span><span class="font10">“shrine” to another, begging their way from the poor people along the route.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Agriculture in India &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font10">NDIA produces one-tenth of the world’s wheat, one-fifth of its cotton, and one-third of its tea, tobacco, rice, cattle, and cane sugar. The crop-yielding area is 198,500,000 acres, 54,000,000 of which are in rice and 14,000,000 in cotton. The irrigated area is 37,000,000 acres, but much more irrigation is necessary to properly distribute the water supplies. Some of the irrigation projects of India pay their promoters the full cost in dividends every four years. It seems a pity, after they have paid for themselves a few times, not to do the generous thing and let the poor Hindus have them as a gift.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">More than 200,000 acres of the best land in five thousand coolies during the war had their costs of living doubled and their wages raised only ten percent. They desired to return to the mainland from the port on the Brahmapootra River where they were employed. Access to the boat was refused them and there was some disorder, but no one seriously injured. That night the camp of these refugees was entered by armed men who assaulted men, women, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">children with the butt ends of their rifles. This unexpected attack, following upon the weakened conditions of the people due to insufficient food, is supposed to have been responsible for the cholera epidemic which followed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It has been often observed that cholera, the bubonic plague, or the “flu,” frequently follows special drains upon the vitality of the halfstarved Hindus, and that those reasonably well fed are immune. It was the shortage </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">food in India during the winter of 1917-1918 that caused the 6,000,000 deaths from “flu.” </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">For </span><span class="font10">a while they were dying in Bombay at the rate of 5,000 per week. About one-third of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“flu” ■ </span><span class="font10">deaths of the world took place in India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Those that have knowledge’ of the matter claim that there are at least 100,000,000 of India’s population who are chronically underfed,’ and that 60,000,000 of these must be content v with one meal per day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The high cost of living, due to the World War, has caused much unrest among the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Mo-</span><span class="font10">hammcdans. One of the rules of the Mohammedan clergy is that the dead shall be buried in unused shrouds, as otherwise they will not . land hereafter in the special place which is to j be occupied by those who have observed </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the ' </span><span class="font10">rules.

<p><span class="font18">I</span><span class="font10">NDIA has been styled and is generally admitted to be “the prize of empire”; i. e., it </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">has the </span><span class="font10">greatest natural possibilities of any country on earth. It lies in a commanding position on the trade routes of the world and is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, reservoir of raw materials on the planet. It has a </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">sixth of </span><span class="font10">the world’s population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">India could have the greatest metallurgical works in the world; for it has vast coal fields and billions of tons of iron ore, lying on the surface, which can be loaded on cars at less than a dollar a ton. It is one of the greatest producers of manganese, and has inexhaustible riches of gold, silver, copper, tin, antimony, lead, platinum, bismuth, tungsten, graphite, mica, asbestos, gypsum, chromite, clay, al</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">um, </span><span class="font10">petroleum, agate, sapphires, diamonds, and rubies. It has ivory in large quantities, and untouched sources of vast power in the great rivers which rise in the Himalayas and find their way into the Indian Ocean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Two thousand years before the beginning of the Christian era the beautiful muslins of India’s hand-looms were used in Egypt as winding sheets for the mummies of the Pharaohs. Before the traders of Northern Europe ever found their way around the Cape of Good Hope, India's silks, brocades, carpets, woodwork, ivories, silverware and brassware were sought after and admired throughout the breadth of Asia, Northern Africa and Eastern and Southeastern Europe. Today India has nothing left but agriculture and a few cotton and jute factories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For a time after British occupation India sent the products of her looms to England, where they commanded fancy prices; but the invention and use of labor-saving machinery soon changed this. In a little while England was importing India’s cotton and sending back </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">cotton </span><span class="font10">piece-goods -to India cheaper than the Hindus could make them. The natural </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">result </span><span class="font10">was that the Hindus bought the cheaper </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">goods, </span><span class="font10">and their own weaving industry collapsed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Without specific information as to how it </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">was . </span><span class="font10">done, the Hindus claim that they have been discriminated against by legislation which has </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">de</span><span class="font10">prived them of their industries, and that at </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">same time they have been given inadequate </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">aid </span><span class="font10">in obtaining the education 'without which </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">they </span><span class="font10">can never regain their former position among the industrial peoples of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">They claim that at the present time the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">mar</span><span class="font10">kets of India are swamped with articles </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">European manufacture, which are beyond </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">powers of the Hindu people to purchase, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">■which, without machinery, they cannot </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">make </span><span class="font10">for themselves. They </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">say, too, that if they </span><span class="font10">could revive their ancient industries </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">on the </span><span class="font10">basis of modern science, and could for </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a time </span><span class="font10">retain in their land the grains which they </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font10">raised, they could do away with want and misery and make India </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">second Garden of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Eden </span><span class="font10">— indeed, make it a place </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">where, ultimately, </span><span class="font10">many times more of European products </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">could </span><span class="font10">be absorbed than is now possible. Paupers </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font10">poor customers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">That British statesmen see the possibilities of India is plain from the following remarkable declaration by Lord Curzon:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“India is so important that without her the Empire could not continue to exist. But for India Lord Beaconsfield would not have bought the shares in the Suez Canal; and but for the Suez Canal we should not be in Egypt. But for India we should not have been able to incarcerate the mighty spirit of Napoleon in the rocky prison of St. Helena, nor should we have acquired predominant position in Mesopotamia, nor have controlled the Persian Gulf. India started us on that career of territorial conquest which was arrested only by the snowy ramparts of the Himalayas, and which converted us from a small island with trading and maritime interests into the greatest land power in the world. Consider what would happen were we to lose India and were some other power to take our place. We should lose its splendid and unfailing markets, shut against us by hostile tariffs; we should lose what is the principal, indeed, almost the only formidable element in our fighting strength. Our influence in Asia would quickly disappear; we should not long retain the posts and coaling stations which dot the ocean highways with the British flag; Australia would be much more open to attack; our colonies would cut themselves off from a dying trunk, and we should sink into a third-rate power, an object of shame to ourselves and of derision to the rest of mankind.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By Mrs. E. J. Price</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">E WILL </span><span class="font10">suppose that by some extraordinary'chance a kind motherly woman pays </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">visit to the mother of three small children, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">informs her that she will care for the children while the mother takes an afternoon off, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">away </span><span class="font10">from all her household cares and worries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The afternoon is bright and sunny; so the young mother decides to take in the sights of the many department-store windows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">She has not walked a great distance before she notices a number of people gathered in front of one of the windows of an electric store. After investigation she finds out that the demonstrator inside the store window is about to display the very latest model in electric washing-machines. She decides to wait and see the demonstration. She views with a measure of incredulity the ease and comfort with which a large family washing can be completed independent of human energy. She walks away, thinking of the one-day-a-week task which keeps her bending over her washboard. She cannot even indulge in the luxury of the thought that some day she may be able to afford such a machine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After walking a short distance, she reads an announcement in one of the department-store windows to the effect,/Be sure to see the ideal kitchen in the basement.' She resolves to see the exhibition..</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On arriving* there, she finds the ideal kitchen scientifically arranged, and completely furnished with all the latest electrical appliances which save the housewife time and energy. She is enraptured at the electric stove, with its many labor-saving devices, and its high oven ‘which eliminates so much stooping. But alas, she knows that she must be content with the stove she has at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Her attention is next drawn to the electric dish-washer. As she marvels at the simplicity and rapidity of dish-washing accomplished by this labor-saving device, she thinks of the pile of dishes she washes each day and of the valuable time that is spent on this one task alone. Surely the electric dish-washer would be a blessing in her home. But she realizes that her circumstances permit only the bare necessities of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Laid out on the table is a complete canning </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">outfit </span><span class="font10">of numerous little devices which help to make canning a pleasure for </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the housewife. </span><span class="font10">She meditates. What is more gratifying </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to the </span><span class="font10">average housewife than, when early fail </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">seta </span><span class="font10">in, to go down into her cellar and view </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">with </span><span class="font10">satisfaction the tempting array of jars of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">pre</span><span class="font10">serves, luscious jams, and vegetables ready </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font10">the winter's use! But too often these same </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">jars </span><span class="font10">represent hours of strenuous labor, due to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">fact that the housewife did not have </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the nec</span><span class="font10">essary utensils to work with. Truly she thinks this canning outfit wonderful for those who </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">can </span><span class="font10">afford it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After taking in the many details of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ideal </span><span class="font10">kitchen, she passes on to another department, where she has the pleasure of seeing the electric vacuum-sweeper demonstrated, and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">with </span><span class="font10">consternation views with what simplicity the dirty, trodden rug can be revived to look like new. She thinks what a boon this electric vacuum-sweeper would be in her home compared with her daily tiresome task of sweeping </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">with </span><span class="font10">a corn-broom. But again she realizes that these luxuries are not for her. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">NOT FOR POOR PEOPLE</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A few circles away she watches with close attention the electric sewing-machine exhibited with its many beneficial advantages and truly considers it a great saver of time and human energy. She thinks of the many hours she spends treadling her old-fashioned sewing-machine after she has done a good day’s work and put her little ones to bed. But again she passes on with no hope of having a new machine of her own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On her way out her attention is drawn to the flower section. The inborn love of the beauties of nature is strong within her, although she rarely has the pleasure of feasting her eyes upon them. She thinks: <sup>&lt;r</sup>What a treat it would be to be able to take home half a dozen roses.” But she realizes that the amount of money necessary for such a treat would buy a pair of much-needed stockings for her boy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With varied feelings she walks home, pre- . pares the evening meal, and at the supper-table relates to her family the experiences of the day. After getting her little children tucked into bed, she draws her chair up to the fire, closes her eyes, and indulges in a mental vi-. sion of the home of the more fortunate </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">house-</span><span class="font10">' wife who is in </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">position to hire sufficient help and to assign each servant to special duties, so as to keep her home methodically man</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">aged </span><span class="font10">and cleanly, and who, through having the necessary capital at her command, is enabled </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">install all these beneficial appliances, and thereby decrease her staff and her household expenses considerably. This housewife realizes that in the electrical appliance she has an ever-willing and obedient servant that knows no set hours and rarely has a grievance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The young mother ponders: Why </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font10">so? Why are these beneficent only within the reach of women who</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10">should it blessings too often</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">have the least need of them—women who are quite able to pay the price for human energy </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">accomplish whatever task they want done? Why should the young mother who is burden</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ed </span><span class="font10">with the care of a small family, and who has to manage her home independently of help, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font10">denied the opportunity of benefiting through all these blessings that have come to mankind within recent years? Surely if any one was meant to benefit by these appliances, it was the mother of small children who has numerous calls on her energy during the child-bearing and child-rearing period of her life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In ages past poets and composers have writ</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ten </span><span class="font10">and sung the praises of mother, her unselfish love, her ever-ready and keen sense </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">sympathy for those in trouble and sorrow. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">But </span><span class="font10">somehow it seemed that before they_coul&lt;l bring a vivid picture of “Mother” to the eye, they had to depict her in the following phraseology: “Her brow that’s all wrinkled and furrowed with care,” or “The silver hairs that shine among the gold,” etc. Alas I Today we find that mankind in general has done little to help to keep these wrinkles and silver hairs away. In fact, we generally find that mother has to grow into these characteristics before she is fully appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Let us all hope that ere long mother will have all her cares and sorrows taken away, that she will soon share in the blessings that will be showered on mankind when Jesus takes unto Himself His great power and reigns in equity, when men “shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat; for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.”(Isaiah 65:21, 22) Then, God’s blessings will not be limited to the favored few — to those who by birth, environment or chance, have all earth’s good« things poured into their laps.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">C</span><span class="font10">ONDITIONS in this part of the country are deplorable, and admitted to be so even by- the city newspapers. Russell County is in bankruptcy; many others in this vicinity are </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font10">the verge of bankruptcy, according to reports. In our little city there has been a good number of business houses that have gone into bankruptcy this year, and business is practically dead in this part of the country. The Eagle and Phenix cotton mills here, which employ about 2,000, are running four days per week at wages as low as before the war. The Perkins Hosiery mill, which employs about •1,000 when running, is shut down. There are twelve or fifteen cotton mills here and all of them have reduced wages back to the pre-war scale, and at the same time house rent is as high as it was during the war and in many cases higher. The men who own and rent houses are members of the different big churches in this city, or at least the majority of them are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Concerning morality, I believe this city </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font10">worse off than any place of its size in the state of’Georgia. We have Camp Benning just eight miles below the city and our streets are throng- ’ ed with soldiers and officers. Morals are at </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">low ebb. The crime wave here is terrible. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Re</span><span class="font10">cently the city court record showed </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">107 cases </span><span class="font10">in one week. It will average ninety cases </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">per </span><span class="font10">week the year around. In the face of all this crime the churches that were recently preaching war have been running protracted meetings ; and all the time crime increases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I am convinced we are living in the end of the gospel age and in the dawn of the Golden Age, when the true bride class shall soon become united to the Groom or Lord and Head, and see Him as He is, and share' His love through all eternity; in blessing and lifting </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">up <sup>19</sup> </span><span class="font10">tile poor world of mankind to the original condition of father Adam before he transgressed the divine law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Thank God for His vengeance on all institutions of error, and unrighteousness worldwide. The signs that our dear Lord said would come at the end of the age have come just as He predicted, and all that He said would happen is just as sure to come to pass. The nations are assembled and are taking counsel together against the Lord; but all the navies, all the armies, all the dollars, all the men, and all the women taking counsel against the Lord shall utterly fail; for God will have them in derision.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Questions by E. L. Robinson Answers by B. J. Drummond</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17" style="font-variant:small-caps;">M</span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b. B. J. Drummond writes with such evident sincerity in his article, “Solving the Railroad Problem by the Golden Rule,” that I accept his offer to answer questions to obtain further information. I would be pleased to see my questions answered categorically in The Golden Age. [Mr. Robinson’s questions and Mr. Drummond’s replies thereto follow in order.—Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Page 240, Column 1, paragraph 3, he says: “Both parties are not guiltless; . . . transportation systems can be made to serve more adequately the public whose creatures they are.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font10"> If both parties who now operate the roads are guilty of hampering transportation, why should not the public take possession of its creatures (the roads) and operate them in the interest of the public?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font10"> The “Public” had control of the carriers for a period of twenty-six months with the result that the writer, along with thousands </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">others who used the service provided, were more than ready to welcome the return of the roads to private operation. The fastening upon</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">. the </span><span class="font10">carriers of the “National Agreements” covering working conditions is only a fair sample of what might be expected were political influence dominant. The casual shipper cannot </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">pos</span><span class="font10">sibly appreciate what the daily user of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">trans</span><span class="font10">portation was obliged to contend with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Page 240, Column 1, Subhead, “Unselfishness Requisite.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">^Question:</span><span class="font10"> How will the proposed plan promote the required unselfishness?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font10"> Unselfishness would naturally </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">fol</span><span class="font10">low any plan wherein the success of any </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">one </span><span class="font10">group is dependent upon the cooperation </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">the other two. It must be botne in mind </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font10">the net amount subject to distribution </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">pro-rata </span><span class="font10">is that which remains after deducting from gross revenue the total expenses exclusive of compensation. There is a natural desire on the part of money, brains and brawn to increase gross revenue and decrease expense in order that a larger amount may be available for distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Page 240, Column 2, paragraph 2: “Brawn cannot be side-tracked in the matter of compensation. It is entitled to receive fair consideration at the hands of money and brains.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font10"> Does this imply that money </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">brains will work as colleagues in fixing </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">compensation of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">brawn?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font10"> They do not fix the compensation of brawn, nor does a combination of any two elements fix compensation of the third. The compensation is fixed by economic conditions as indicated in the answer to query 2. The United States Department of Labor is suggested as a possible medium for fixing the value of the various classes of brains and brawn from which to determine the amount of stock to be issued to each individual comprising the several-groups. To illustrate: Male stenographers for instance are capable of earning $1500 a year whether they serve a railroad, a jobber, a manufacturer, or a lawyer. This is equivalent to a return of five and one-half percent on approximately $28,000; hence each male stenographer would receive 280 shares of<sup>-</sup>stock at par value of $100 each as representing his contribution to the business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Page 241, column 2, paragraph 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font10"> How much water is included in the $18,900,000,000 money capital proposed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font10"> This sum representing money capital invested in the American Bailroad is a tentative figure given out by the Interstate Commerce Commission as the value on which rates are to be made so as to produce, as near as may be, five and one-half percent on such value. The Commission states this value does not include any water; same having been squeezed out in the process of valuation on which the Commission’s Engineers have been at work for more than five years last past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font10"> Does the brawn capitalization recognize the brain required in the manual operation of the roads? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font10"> It does to the extent that they are necessary to carry out and execute the orders of management. A crossing flagman who did not possess sufficient brains to wave the warning signal at the approach of a train certainly could not be intrusted with that responsibility; and yet it is not his brains that are being compensated, but his ability to give the signal. His compensation is measured by his “stock value.” One with only sufficient ability to flag a crossing for a railroad is in the same class as one who acts as a “chambermaid” in a livery stable. Such ability would probably command compensation of about $700 a year, equal </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">five and one-half percent on about $13,000; therefore such an one would be assigned 130 </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">shares of stock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font10"> If so, what portion is for brain ' ' and what portion for brawn?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Ansiver:</span><span class="font10"> See foregoing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font10"> If part of the brawn capital is ’ for brain, is it capitalized on a par value with managerial brain? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font10"> See foregoing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Page 211, column 2, paragraph 3. This paragraph provides for the redemption of surplus 4 money capital at a premium of two percent । plus accrued dividends. It also provides for dis- j missal of surplus brain and brawn and cancel- I lation of their capital on payment of two dol- &nbsp;&nbsp;M</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font10"> Brain and brawn are not at any ? greater disadvantage than money.

<p><span class="font10">whom I jokingly asked: 'What are you worth, Uncle Mack?” His reply was: “Don’t know now, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">de </span><span class="font10">block.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font10"> If it is conceded that capitalizing one’s ability or brawn on the basis of what they are capable of earning in the world’s market is reducing men to a dollar value, then they </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font10">reduced to the dollar value. We are all worth what we are capable of earning. One would not think of compensating a mechanic fifty dollars a day for doing the labor of repairing a “Tin Lizzie”; yet many executives are capable of commanding much more than that. Why? For the same reason-that a skilled carpenter is worth more than the saw-and-ham-mer kind.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font10"> In a 3, 3, 3 directorate is it not likely that brains and money capital will act in collusion as at present to hold brawn in subjection?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font10"> No more than brains and brawn might endeavor to corral money; each is compensated according to the value of his investment, no more, no less. Their interests are common.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font10"> Will not the unequal compensation be a continual cause of strife in the directorate?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font10"> The compensation is not unequal; each receives five and one-half percent on the amount invested whether it be money, brains, or brawn, and neither can increase that rate without the others sharing at the same rate; likewise if the net revenue shrinks belqw that figure each class shares at the same rate.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font10"> No; for the compensation is </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font10">determined by the numbers involved. The money may be owned by few or many. The brains capital may be confined to a few, yet in value exceed the capitalization of either money </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font10">brawn. Likewise on account of highly skilled brawn workers a few might represent an in-vestment in excess of either money or brains.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font10"> Is it an equitable distribution </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">net earnings to allow the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">same compensation </span><span class="font10">to money capital which performs no </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">service, </span><span class="font10">as to brain and brawn’s capitalized </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">expert </span><span class="font10">knowledge to which they add </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">service in time </span><span class="font10">and labor?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font10"> Money is as necessary </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to the suc</span><span class="font10">cessful operation of the business as is </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">expert </span><span class="font10">knowledge or skilled brawn.

Money therefore performs a very necessary service. Brain and brawn workers have the opportunity of investing their surplus money in the business and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">thus </span><span class="font10">draw dividends both as brain or brawn </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“in</span><span class="font10">vestors” and money “investors” too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font10"> How would Jesus of Nazareth distribute the net earnings among those who had contributed to the transportation service?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font10"> I am not prepared to intelligently answer this question, except to state that I believe that Jesus of Nazareth would have made a distribution based on equity. I am sure that He would have adopted a method that would render an equal return to money, brains, and brawn, but the three working in harmony would have to earn it. If there were a loss, the three classes would also have to share it equally.</span></p>

The tendency is away from the Harding camp. Democrats and progressive Republicans are in favor. Yet we could not think of Mr. Wilson as leader. His espionage act, his private wars, his deportation and conscription acts, his daylight saving scheme, his league, his trip to Europe, his </span><span class="font10">secret confab with the pope, his presents, etc., etc., preclude the idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Yet the people are forgetful. They are easily diverted and divided. They are conservative and trustful. Many are unread and unthoughtful. Thousands do not know that Democrat means Republican, and vice versa. They </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">do not </span><span class="font10">know that the real work of the old parties is </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">serve private interests and keep the people divided on tariff issues that no statesman can fathom. Mr. Wilson may be the leader, but evidently he is still headed for the Wilhelm-Czar Nicholas camp.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">C</span><span class="font10">EASE ye from man whose life is in his nostrils” says the Prophet. Political parties are </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">stupendous failure. Renegade republics have no more lease of existence than have the musty monarchies. Who could really believe in the Democratic party, so often in power, and as often derelict and unsatisfactory? Who could actually believe in the Republican party, which had all the say from the sixties to the eighties? These two parties representing the same idea of government, but nursing political ambitions, oppositions and hatreds instead of working for the greatest good, may expect rejection at the hands of the voters. The Democratic party is gone, let us hope, never to return. And its twin brother in corruption bids fair to go with it. “Be patient, therefore, brethren.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Political Money-Blessers</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">R</span><span class="font10">E CENT LY a “fortune teller” passed through and displayed great powers for blessing money. He could bless a roll so that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font10">would prosper in the thing wherein it was invested and accomplish all that could be desired. One man got his two hundred blessed, and a woman had her fifteen hundred so conjured that like the widow’s oil it would never play out. The blesser merely passed the money over his head and behind his back and through his hair to impart the philosopher’s touch and the buying power. Thereafter, success would attend all investments, and everything that the money touched would turn to wealth. Then the roll, handed back, was not to be opened until </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">certain day at a certain hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But to spoil it all and to take the joy out of life one of the blessed got over-anxious and opened her package in the wrong place, and found only a roll of blank paper. But the blesser had passed on in his search for still others to bless and enrich.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Politicians and office-seekers work on the same principle. Promises are made from year </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">year, and the years merge into the dim past, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">promises pile up like national debts. The people forget until the next April fool spellbinder comes along with his mouth disease,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">and his magic of words to bind their faculties until the next election. Then they begin, to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font10">flect that they have been stung once more. But again they forget until the next fool-stinger comes along. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

The Fricks and the Rockefellers should be included. With such men in Congress steel strikes and railroad strikes could be abolished by simply compelling men to work until they fell dead, and then compel a new crew. The historic Homestead riots and the Colorado Avar on miners and their helpless families could have been avoided on similar lines. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Doubtless quite a lot of operators, et<sup>-</sup>al., in Mingo County, West Virginia, could be depended upon—if elected to Congress—to banish traitorous coal diggers from the earth, if need be, to cleanse the sacred coal fields, and establish prison discipline, and thus prevent common intercourse between folks who have no respected rights under the capitalistic sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then there is Governor Allen, the great Kansas Industrial Court legislator. Would capital ever get anywhere without him? Laws that work one way—laws to curb and compel miners to dig coal and keep the public warm and keep up dividends, though the said public neither employs, nor digs — are the limit to date. We should have a Congress of this type of men at once, if we are fools enough to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">want </span><span class="font10">anarchy!</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font18">O</span><span class="font10">THOU Usury, high and mighty, great and powerful; thou innocent-looking, many headed monster! In what country art thou not supreme ? What trust art thou not the head of ? No business is transacted without thee. Thy word is law. Thy devouring heads have many strange shapes ■— interest, dividends, rentals and profits; while taxes and customs duties are much of thine own. All these and many more go to appease thy gluttonous appetite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The foolish church, weak and deceived, lies prostrate at thy feet, begging and obtaining from thee a small portion of thine ill-gotten gain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Even the missionaries in foreign lands have kind words for thee. Why should they not? For thou suppliest much of their daily needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Thou hast, too, a loyal priesthood, thy “Wall Street” gang. Surely thou must acknowledge that they sacrifice many victims upon thine unholy altar, that others of thine ignoble breed, more favored by thee, may the richer be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Since when, old Usury, didst thou coin thy new name “Interest”? For I’ve searched the Bible through and through, and nowhere is the new word given. Thou knewest that interest, no matter how low the rate, is usury. Yet thou hast made the world believe that as “Interest” thou art ‘not Usury at all. O thou two-faced, many-headed rascal, full well thou knewest that usury was condemned! (Leviticus25: 36; Psalm 15:5; Matthew 5: 42) How soon shall they find thee out? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">How strange, O Usury, that our great ones, both Jews and Christians, have lost confidence long ago in God and His prophets, and are now humbly praying unto thee, Great Usury, and to thy “profits,” saying, “Give us this day our daily bread.” And thine evil system, generous to the few, surely gives it them.

It is through thee and thee alone that millions go starving in the midst of plenty; for thy wealth (reserved capital) must keep doubling and doubling as the years roll by and our Usury dues must bo met though all else fails. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">W</span><span class="font10">E OWE it a duty to our Creator, to ourselves, to our friends and relatives, and to society at large, to keep ourselves in the best possible health. While much of the sickness in the world today is due to imperfections inherit</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ed </span><span class="font10">from our forefathers, over which we have no</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">control, yet on the other hand it is equally true that a great deal of ill-health could be avoided by observing common-sense ways of taking care of our bodies.

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ance. This fact, then, is the excuse for this article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Are we temperate in our eating? Or do we often, if not continually, overload our digestive Bystem, causing stomach and intestinal troubles </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">which </span><span class="font10">tend to dull the brain and make us a bur</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">den to </span><span class="font10">ourselves and to others? In this land of plenty, most people eat too much, and especially too much of concentrated food. More coarse foods, especially whole-wheat bread and other foods rich in vitamines, more milk instead of tea and coffee, more fruits, green salads, and other vegetables, and less meats, are </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">few pointed suggestions as regards eating which should be followed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Not only do we need to exercise greater care </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font10">the quantity and kind of food we eat, but </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font10">need to take more time to eat it. Short lunch hours and the habit of bolting the food is a menace to the health in this strenuous land of ours. We are undoubtedly in too much of a </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">hurry </span><span class="font10">for our own good. Proper mastication </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">food cannot be overestimated. Gladstone, the “grand old man of England,” made a practice of chewing every mouthful of food sixteen times. If food is swallowed in lumps, only the ' outside of these lumps can be acted upon by the digestive juices in the stomach and intes</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">tines, </span><span class="font10">thus causing constipation by clogging the intestines with undigested food. Let us treat our stomachs with respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Water should be used in much larger quantities than is commonly done, both externally </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">internally. Regularity in bathing goes hand </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font10">hand with good health. The pores must be kept open to allow the poisonous matters in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">body </span><span class="font10">to pass off and also to exercise the vaso-motor nerves in control of the size of the blood-vessels in the skin. Cold baths, especially, will stimulate these nerves; and this is one reason why a person taking cold baths in the morning is practically immune from taking cold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Internally, water is of great benefit in stimulating the action of the digestive glands and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font10">keeping the food in soluble condition, thus eliminating intestinal troubles. It also serves </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">wash away impurities from all parts of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">body. </span><span class="font10">Let us drink more water. A glass or two </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">water before each meal is a good practice. Even the old tradition,” Don’t drink water with </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">your </span><span class="font10">meals,” has been largely reversed; and it </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font10">now recommended that most of the water </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Irinking be done at meal time, with the cau</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark87"><span class="font10">tion, however, that it be not used to wash </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">food down. Drink at least eight glasses of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">pure * </span><span class="font10">water daily.</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark88"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FRESH AIK AND SUNSHINE</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark89"><span class="font10">Fresh air and sunshine are enemies of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">bacteria which cause most of our serious </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">dis-</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark90"><span class="font10">eases. Do we deny ourselves these boons </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font10">health by staying indoors when it is unneces- . sary to do so? Do we sleep with closed </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">win- ' </span><span class="font10">dows, and breathe over and over again the foul air when we might, with windows open, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be fill- ■ </span><span class="font10">ing our lungs with fresh air and a full supply of oxygen, and wake up with clear minds instead of headaches, or at best, dulled ' ainsf. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Do </span><span class="font10">our homes get a thorough airing every </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">day, </span><span class="font10">even when the weather is cold? Not only should we spend as much time as possible in the fresh air, but we should get the full benefit by deep ■ breathing. This' requires a conscious effort </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font10">first, but later becomes a habit. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In addition to fresh air and sunshine we </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">need </span><span class="font10">exercise. Lack of exercise is </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a common cause </span><span class="font10">of ill-health among those engaged in sedentary pursuits and indoor work of different </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">kinds. A </span><span class="font10">few minutes of gymnastic exercises can </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font10">taken in the home by everyone. (A complete </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">set -</span><span class="font10">of Bernarr Macfadden’s Setting-up Exercises was furnished free of charge by the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">National </span><span class="font10">Physical Culture Week Committee, 113 40th Street, New York city, to all who agreed to use them during the National Physical Culture Week, May 1st to 8th.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In addition to this, there is one exercise which all have access to, and that is walking. How much better a brisk walk would be than the lazy habit of riding every little </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">distance </span><span class="font10">we go! A brisk walk will stimulate the respira-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">tion, the circulation, and the digestive organs. It gives a person a good appetite and tones up the whole system. Walking will thus help thin people grow fat; and, paradox as it may seem, it also makes fat people grow thin, if they do enough of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Not only is it necessary that we sleep with windows open, but we should see to it that we , get enough sleep. While we are often guilty of . eating too much, we are also guilty of robbing our bodies of needed sleep. School authorities j in both elementary and secondary, as well as in &quot;&nbsp;higher institutions of learning, agree that much *-i|| failure in schools is due to lack of sleep.

While the amount of sleep needed by different individuals varies, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">with </span><span class="font10">most adults eight hours should be the min</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">imum, </span><span class="font10">while children need much more than this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Work, giving exercise to brain and body, ds </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a general </span><span class="font10">thing is a blessing to mankind; yet </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">it is </span><span class="font10">possible for some with a limited amount </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">physical vigor, and at the same time an unbounded ambition, so to overtax the body that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font10">cries out in pain. Then they wonder why </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">they </span><span class="font10">cannot be well like other people. While work alone, under right conditions, seldom hurts anyone, yet it is a fact that work com</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">bined </span><span class="font10">with worry has killed many people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Worry without work has killed more. Worry </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">is a </span><span class="font10">very difficult matter to overcome; yet by using self-control together with proper rest, sleep, fresh air, exercise, and a systematic way </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">accomplishing&quot; our work, one can eliminate it </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to a </span><span class="font10">large extent. Then, too, some little time is </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">needed </span><span class="font10">for recreation. “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy” is a true saying. We </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">can </span><span class="font10">at least train ourselves to forget our regu</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">lar </span><span class="font10">business when we are away from it. Completely relax at least fifteen minutes each day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Cultivate happy thoughts which are at the </span><span class="font10">same time pure and noble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are many other points which </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">could'be </span><span class="font10">mentioned, such as care of teeth, care of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">eyes, </span><span class="font10">and proper use of clothing; but perhaps enough has been mentioned for one time.. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A careful </span><span class="font10">observance of these points will undoubtedly contribute materially to our health, comfort, and happiness. Even during the Golden </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Age </span><span class="font10">good health will undoubtedly come to mankind in proportion as they exercise temperance and self-control.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font10">HE possibilities of being youthful and in full vigor of health at the age of one hundred years are fast approaching a point when this will be a reality. So remarkable and rapid </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font10">the unfolding and increasing knowledge in </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font10">understanding of the functioning of the human body, and the application of corrective - action, that one is struck with the remarkable fitness of such expressions as uttered by the , prophet Daniel and the patriarch Job: “Knowl-• edge shall be increased,” and “Man shall return to the days of his youth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The complexity of the human body manifests \the creative genius responsible for its forma' tion; and.it has been this very complexness which has prevented even the wisest from escaping the penalty of death. Now, as the new ' - King of earth, like the sun 'with healing in his beams,’ arises, He is shedding forth the truth e • necessary for attainment of human perfection, k. Ignorance and prejudice have long stood in</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">the way of better health. When “bad goes </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">worse” even the despised things are acceptable, if they bring relief. Different doctors are tried and abandoned, patent medicine fails to bring results, and various home remedies seem </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to be </span><span class="font10">lacldng of any permanent good. “There </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">must </span><span class="font10">be something that will bring relief,” is the everpresent question. “What is it?” comes the continual response. Articles on dietetics </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">are read </span><span class="font10">with interest and tried. Physical suggestions of all kinds are investigated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All human defects are caused by some violation of physical law. Physical law was created by Jehovah God. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font10">violation of. God’s </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">law is </span><span class="font10">sin. “All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.” Therefore all die. Life could be obtained if every physical law were fully obeyed. Since the violation of these physical laws is born in us, through cell culture and nerve cravings, causing established habits of thought </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and action handed down through 6000</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">years of accelerated motion, we must acknowl</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">edge </span><span class="font10">our helplessness. How to obey these laws </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">One who composed the human anatomy alone is able to reveal. He is now beginning the great unveiling. “The knowledge of the glory </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of God </span><span class="font10">shall cover the whole earth as the waters cover the sea.” Jesus died and rose again for that very purpose: that He might give life </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">the dying race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">POISE IS PERFECTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Perfect poise of human organism means human perfection, and human perfection means everlasting life. Balance is the secret of the <sub>z</sub> perpetuation of life. Unbalanced action of the body forces means death. The factors enter</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font10">into the perfect poise of the human body produce such a network of delicately balanced, related forces that the attaining of this balance has proven beyond the scope of human ability. In dealing with it we are lost in an intricate </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">maze. </span><span class="font10">&gt;We feel as finite as the astronomer gaz</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font10">into the endlessness of space.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some of the things involved are: The amount </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">oxygen breathed and the amount in the atmosphere; climatic conditions; atmospheric pressure; the changes of heat and cold, wet and dry; water in its pure and affected states; the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">food </span><span class="font10">we eat in its great variety combined with quantity and frequency of participation; the contraction and expansion of the muscles and tissues of the.various parts of the body; their proportionate pull one upon another; the downward pull of gravity proportioned with the ten</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">sioned </span><span class="font10">strength of muscles; general stimulation versus lethargy; cycles of rapid vibrations and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">slow </span><span class="font10">vibrations over nerve fields; high and low pressures of blood streams; chemical compoundings forming acids and alkalies, and their precipitates, and other numerous chemical changes; electrical activity of varying degrees;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">effect of solar activity and sun rays upon the tissues of the body; colonies of cells with cultivated tendencies; the charging and discharging </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">energy stored up in the cell tissues; the vig</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font10">of cell growth; the proportion of phagocytes and other blood corpuscles; our mental moods, thoughts and environment; etc.; and the intricate variety of effects which all of these have one upon the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When all these related effects are properly balanced, the human machine functions with precision. Who will tell us how properly to ad</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">just </span><span class="font10">all of them, one with the other!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">EFFECT OF THOUGHT &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The nerves control all functions of the body by being the centers and conveyors of oscillations similar to the oscillations of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">electric ions </span><span class="font10">over a copper wire or through the air or from the sun or from the far distant stars. In turn, the blood feeds the nerves; and the nerves control its flow through the pumping of the heart and the contraction and expansion of the arteries, veins and tissues. This control is governed by the nerve habits, and also greatly influenced by our thoughts, which either directly or indirectly affect every part of the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For example: Fear throws excessive nerve force over the nerve fields affecting heart </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ac</span><span class="font10">tion, exciting the flow of secretions from various glands and forcing out of balance </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">or equi</span><span class="font10">librium the entire nerve and gland system. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font10">affects the brain to a noticeable extent. (Alarm, fright, worry, a continual consciousness of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">hav</span><span class="font10">ing done wrong, can all be catalogued under fear.) The free flowing of the blood is </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">cut down, </span><span class="font10">which subtracts from the amount of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">energy in </span><span class="font10">the nerve cells, and reduces the vital powers of the whole body. This process continues cycle after cycle, until in threescore years and ten the energy of the body has so decreased as to cause to cease the functioning of parts of the body. Fear was the first effect of the disobedience of God’s command, as experienced by Adam and Eve recorded in Genesis 3:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The success attending proper exercising, osteopathic and chiropractic treatments, the effects produced by electricity and radio-activity and proper eating can be traced to contraction and expansion of the tissues of the body. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font10">forced action of drugs will produce like movements. These movements have much to do with life and death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is easy to see that, when the blood lacks - ? the necessary elements which feed the various tissue-forming muscle, bone and organs; the lessened growth will tend to make these parts smaller; and as a result contraction sets in. When the proper elements are given the blood the tissues grow, and the muscles and ligaments • &lt;&nbsp;relax, often curing serious maladies. These .. contractions so tend to tighten certain parts as to prevent the blood from properly flowing to other parts, starving them, and causing contractions elsewhere. Thus one defect follows another. A continuance of these improper mus-</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Bular tensions in time distorts the body, and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">even </span><span class="font10">pulls the bones out of their proper position, especially those of the vertebra?. Grad-v illy these improper positions develop into permanence and slowly increase in their unbalanced state. The nerves in turn are pinched, and fail to stimulate through excitation the regions of cell growths over which they have jurisdiction. The tissues become sickly and, unable to thrive properly, begin to die off; and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">tensions, thus increased, cut off in a measure or completely the drainage through the veins. Dead tissue becomes suspended in the system, which develops into poisons called tox</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ins, </span><span class="font10">and becomes breeding grounds for all kinds of minute forms of life, called germs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">POWER OF LIGHT, HEAT, AND ELECTRICITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&quot;We know of the power exerted by light, heat and electricity, and are conscious of the existence therein of a varying vibratory motion of intensive activity. Electric ions are the smallest particles of matter, we are told, released from an atom, and constitute the vehicle of power which is utilized in millions of ways in the endless variety which exists in God’s creative works. The human body could not exist without the constant activity which the releasing of these ions create. Thus for example: The storing up of starch and sugar in the liver is but </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">convenient and compact way of canning this energy. The blood-vessels are the highways over which this canned energy is carried to the tissue cells of the entire body. The nerves are the electric wires which direct the use to which this energy is to be put; and the releasing of it from the cells produces muscle movements, nerve vibrations, thoughts and every other activity of the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Thus energy is stored up in the cell tissues of the body and released through chemical action or direct nerve force. By infinitely rapid vibration set up by an unknown activity in the cells of the brain and other parts of the nerve system, the cells of the body are caused to change their shape and otherwise energized into activity causing mechanical movements of the body and creating life movements. When the flow of the vibrations over the nerve tracts is interfered with or at low ebb, the sure effect is to contract or tighten up the tissue contracting the walls of the blood vessels, thus cutting off blood flow and nerve force. This in time</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">cuts down still more the possibilities of getting the force to the nerve centers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The osteopathic and chiropractic professions endeavor to loosen up these tensions and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">speak <sup>? </sup></span><span class="font10">of the effort as relaxing the various parts. Electricity tends to charge the tissue with ions ' causing a measure of dilation. Radio-activity and the direct rays of the sun work in the same way; indeed, it has been found’ that nothing </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">can </span><span class="font10">r excel the benefits of sun rays. Sun baths should &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">be taken often. There is a radio-active pad &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">which bathes your body with sun baths while 1 you work. This relaxing of the tensioned con- | dition of the system breaks up congestion and - j establishes a temporary or permanent flow of [ ionic energy from the nerve centers, vitalizing &lt;&nbsp;the affected parts of the system immensely. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">We j </span><span class="font10">cannot stress too strongly the effort to seek </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font10">laxation that should be made by nervous </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">per</span><span class="font10">sons and those suffering pain in portions of their body by this tensioned condition.

<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">HROUGHOUT </span><span class="font10">central and western Kansas the leaves on the elm trees are falling. Some trees are stripped of about three-fourths of their foliage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At first it was thought that the cause was yellow aphis, an insect not larger than a gnat, which sucks the juice out of the leaves, thus causing them to shrivel and fall. On the ce</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ment </span><span class="font10">walk under the elm-trees were drippings </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">from </span><span class="font10">the leaves, often a smeary coating like molasses, disagreeable to walk upon, and very sticky. One of the college professors pronounc</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">es </span><span class="font10">this trouble merely the result of too much </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">rain in </span><span class="font10">the spring and the consequent exudation of sap from the leaves that sometimes is called honeydew. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some young ladies going to and fro under the elm-trees have found their hair pretty </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">well </span><span class="font10">gummed by the stuff falling upon their </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">uncov</span><span class="font10">ered heads.

<p><span class="font10">Never before have the cottonwood </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">trees </span><span class="font10">thrown off so much cotton. Lawns in the vicinity of cottonwood trees are white with the fuzz, as are also the honey-dewed elm leaves, making it appear as if the elm leaves </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font10">downy feathers. The writer saw ten </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">or twelve </span><span class="font10">bushels of cotton-fuzzed leaves raked off from a single front-door yard, piled along the gutter to be burned; a most unusual sight </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">for the time </span><span class="font10">of year.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark109"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark110"></a>Did He Baptize the Dog?</span></h4>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font10">HE Reverend---is no longer a minister in</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Massachusetts. This was not because of irreverent returning of thanks at his boardinghouse, where he is alleged to have said on one occasion, “O Lord, we thank thee for the salad,” and on another, “O Lord, we thank thee for the French fried potatoes”; but because he took a glass of water and sprinkled some of it on a dog’s head, saying, “Buster Porter, I baptize thee a full-fledged Presbyterian.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">His brethren in the ministry were deeply incensed at this, when it was brought to their notice; and yet they are all doing something equally meaningless. No one can really baptize another. The true baptism is the burial of one’s will into the will of the Lord, the taking of His will henceforth to be our will. This true baptism begins at consecration and ends in death. The raising out of this baptism is in the resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All this is pictured in the ordinance of immersion. The one who is to be </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">imm</span><span class="font10">ersed </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">en</span><span class="font10">trusts himself wholly to the one that is to do the immersing. He is let down gently into the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">water </span><span class="font10">until completely covered, and then he is </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font10">gently raised. He is helpless in the matter. All he does is to yield, to submit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Did the Porter dog do any yielding, any submitting? Did he make a consecration to the Lord? Did he covenant to do the Lord’s will </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">even </span><span class="font10">unto death ? His sprinkling signified nothing, except that Reverend ---- did not have</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">good </span><span class="font10">sense. And the sprinkling of human beings does not signify more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">No preacher or other person has the power to baptize anybody by the mere use of much or little water accompanied by many or few words. Baptism is a much more important matter than </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">be left to any such chance. If the symbol is performed prior to consecration, it is of less</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">effect </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in heaven an&lt;J in earth than an ordinary </span><span class="font10">bath. And sprinkling never was </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a picture of </span><span class="font10">baptism, and means nothing </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">at all to anybody. </span><span class="font10">It was never practised in the early </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">church, and </span><span class="font10">no ordinance to sprinkle anybody </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">is to be found </span><span class="font10">anywhere in the Bible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Greek word </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;baptizo&quot;</span><span class="font10"> means the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">same </span><span class="font10">as it does in English—to immerse. There </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font10">other words to signify sprinkle and pour. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">No </span><span class="font10">concern need be felt over the fact that' so </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">many </span><span class="font10">theologians have this wrong. It is to be </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ex</span><span class="font10">pected, for they have everything else </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">wrong; </span><span class="font10">and it would only confuse matters if they </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">hdd </span><span class="font10">this right.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font10">WO years ago, in the year of our Lord 1920, the Presbyterian Board of Publication published a Catechism for Young Children which contains six questions and answers that illustrate how hard it is for theologians to break away from the errors handed down to them from the dark ages. We give the questions and answers as they appear in the catechism, and then supply a Tittle additional information in brackets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Question 7:</span><span class="font10"> In how many persons does this one God exist?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font10"> In three persons.[Revised answer: In one person. “To us there is but one God.” (1 Corinthians 8:5,6) “Hear, 0 Israel: Jehovah our God is one.” (Deuteronomy 6:4,5) “I am Jehovah; . . . my glory will I not give to another.” (Isaiah 42: 8) Every text in the Bible is in harmony with this revised answer.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Question 8:</span><span class="font10"> What are they?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font10"> The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. [Revised answer: Nowhere in the Bible does it say or intimate that the three named are one person. This answer is based upon a fraudulent text which all Presbyterian and other scholars know is not a part of God’s</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10">He lacks wisdom who plunges into </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">action </span><span class="font10">without first determining the result thereof? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<sup>:</sup>J||</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">while he who observes the proverb, “Look </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10">&gt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">'jSjjM</span></p>

To “sit down and count the cost” </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">is the \||| </span><span class="font10">wise course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“The fool hath said in his heart, There is </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font10">God”; while the prudent is filled with </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">rever</span><span class="font10">ence when he beholds the marvelous beauty and grandeur of the heavens, the delicacy of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">flowers, and the wonders of the mountain ranges with their canyons—all the work of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">an '■/ </span><span class="font10">all-wise Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The foolish are controlled by passion, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">wise by principle; the foolish by vengeance, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the “ </span><span class="font10">wise by forgiveness; the unwise by hatred, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">prudent by love.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Word, and which it is an impiety to use as </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">basis for doctrine. (1 John 5: 7) When Christ prayed that the church may be one as He and the Father are one, He showed in what the oneness of Himself and the Father consisted —namely, a oneness of spirit; they both have the same holy spirit, and the church has it, too. And when the church has the holy spirit it does not have a ghost—which is a mistranslation of the word spirit—nor a person in any sense of the word; but it does have the power, or influence, or disposition of God.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Question 18:</span><span class="font10"> What did God give Adam and Eve besides bodies?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font10"> He gave them souls that could never die. [Revised Answer: If this were not so serious it would be positively funny; for the only person in the Bible who ever made such a statement was the devil himself, in Genesis 3:4. The devil made that statement in direct contradiction of Almighty God; and for making that statement Christ referred to him as “a liar and the father of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">it”—</span><span class="font10">the father of the biggest lie ever told. (John 8:44) The facts are that the only thing God gave Adam and Eve besides their bodies was their breath;</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">the union of body and breath, in any animal, makes it a soul,</span><span class="font10"> a sentient being. When the breath stops the being ceases to exist until </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font10">is reawakened. There is a vast difference between becoming a soul, a being, and having </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">soul given to one.—Gen. 2:7; Num. 31: 28.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Question 140:</span><span class="font10"> What becomes of men at death?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font10"> The body returns to dust and the soul goes into the world of» spirits. [Revised answer: All Presbyterian scholars know that the word </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">ruach,</span><span class="font10"> translated spirit in Ecclesiastes 12: 7, is the same word translated breath in Ecclesiastes 3:19, where the statement occurs that man and beast all have one breath and all go unto one place; that all are of the dust and all turn to dust again. It is not true that when </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">man dies he is more alive than ever. These theologians have taken Satan’s teachings too seriously and not taken Jehovah’s statement that “the soul that sinneth it shall die” seriously enough.—Ezekiel 18: 4, 20.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Question 142:</span><span class="font10"> What will become of the wicked in the day of judgment?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font10"> They shall be cast into hell. [Revised answer: The wicked are Scripturally defined as those who have first been brought to a knowledge of God and who have then forgotten Him. Concerning these it is said not that they shall be turned into hell, but that they shall be re-turned there. “The wicked shall be returned [s^ub] into hell—all the nations that forget God.” (Psalm 9:17) For </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">plain statement as to what will actually happen to the wicked note the following: ‘Wet a little while, and the wicked </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">shall not be;</span><span class="font10"> yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place and it shall not be.” (Psalm 37:10) “The wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.” (Psalm 37:20) “The Lord pre-serveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy.” (Psalm 145:20) Every statement of Holy Writ is in harmony with the thought that the final fate of the wilfully wicked is complete, absolute, utter non-existence anywhere, “the blackness of darkness forever.” —Jude 13.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Question 143:</span><span class="font10"> What is hell?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font10"> A place of dreadfill and endless torment. [Revised answer: It is the cemetery; nothing more, nothing less. Send to us at The Golden Age office, and we will send you free of charge a book explaining every passage in the Bible where the word hell occurs; and when you have finished reading it will make you sick at heart to think that these Presbyterian theologians, in order to carry along an old worn- • out theological system, will continue to teach little children a pack of lies which have no foundation whatever in God’s Word, and certainly none in reason or common sense.]</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Satan invaded this planet more than 6,000 years ago. He captured the citadel—the heart of man. As the children of men have multiplied, he has extended his dominion until his black banner floats over the remotest frontiers of the race. His subjects during his entire reign have numbered more than twenty billions. Among them has been every degree of loyalty, from near-unwilling service to whole-hearted devotion to their wily master and burning zeal for the triumph of his foul regime.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">His reign in the minds of men has produced false reasonings, wicked imaginings, unchaste pictures, harmful plots and devilish schemes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In controlling the bodies of men, he sends their feet into dangerous paths of snares and pitfalls, their hands to do violence, their eyes to behold evil, their tongues to blaspheme.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">xpaest and </span><span class="font10">his fearful decrees^ Satan has been a • delegate at large to every constitutional convention, has been in every parliament, congress, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">legislature. His one policy has been to ► put enough good with the evil to float it, to , make it respectable, then to score in the matter </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">- of </span><span class="font10">enforcement—crucify Christ, and let Barab-</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font10"> bas go free. He is a past-master politician, a : designing demagogue, the author of secret diplomacy, the champion of great armies and i navies, the father of wars, the inventor of the g “Holy” Inquisition, the counselor of popes, the unholy aspirant for the throne of God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SATANIC SOCIAL ORDER</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">K Satan conceived the social order. Man was <sup>!</sup> made to rule, but not to rule his fellow man. ;■ His God-given dominion was the earth and the * lower forms of life. But Satan has filled the fc earth with kings and subjects, nobles and serfs, | masters and slaves, capitalists and workers, | millionaires and paupers. Poverty is regarded as social leprosy. The poor are quarantined for t life. The doctrine of the brotherhood of man [&gt;' is not accepted in theory and is flagrantly de-[ nied in practice. Satan’s aristocracy repudiates the great truth proclaimed by Paul on Mars P .Hill, that God of one blood has made all na-f tions that dwell on the face of the earth. Each f race believes itself superior, thinks itself the i center. Selfishness masquerading as patriotism has filled the world with hatred and carnage, ir Satan founded the world’s industrial sys-[ terns. The earth and the fullness thereof were made for all the people. But under the rule of Satan there is the survival of the slickest, who by hook or by crook have gotten possession of t the good things of life, and have put up a sign, * “Keep off the Grass.” The masses are not allowed to till the ground, nor work in factories </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font10">mines, nor otherwise earn their daily bread E without the consent of their masters. To most </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">mankind life is a monotonous grind. And । after a long struggle for existence, at the end fi of the. way, millions can only boast that they H did not starve to death. In the wake of war, or £ when nature is fickle, other millions are denied L that boon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">? And as the crowning feature of his infamy, | Satan is the architect and builder, the god of I the world’s religious systems. He found in , man’s heart a desire for religion. He corrupted </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">‘the </span><span class="font10">desire, and then supplied the demand. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">He has furnished every brand and variety that </span><span class="font10">would be acceptable to fallen humanity. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font10">has satisfied some with nature worship, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">idol </span><span class="font10">worship, philosophy, or science falsely </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">So call</span><span class="font10">ed; others with the vagaries of false prophets. But his master stroke in the field is the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">cor</span><span class="font10">ruption of Christianity and making all nations drunk with this mixed wine. Satan’s churchi-anity, which is abroad in every land, with </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">which </span><span class="font10">he soothes the consciences and allays the fears of millions in times of peace, and makes them fight like demons in his bloody wars, is a </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">clever </span><span class="font10">counterfeit to those who are blinded by sin, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">al</span><span class="font10">though it does not in the least resemble </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">religion of Christ to those who are enlightened by the spirit and Word of the Lord and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“fol</span><span class="font10">low the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.” </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And </span><span class="font10">churchianity persecutes Christianity, just </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font10">the Bible foretold the seed of the serpent </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">would </span><span class="font10">make war on the seed of the woman. Churchianity has her great denominational systems, her magnificent temples and high-salaried </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">cler</span><span class="font10">gy, her great wealth and myriad activities, and under the law of cohesion is drawn into closest affiliation with other phases of Satan’s kingdom —big business and politics, both in peace </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">in war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Being the god of this world, Satan dominates everything from savagery to civilization </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">(T), </span><span class="font10">from Lover’s Lane to Ghateau Thierry. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">His </span><span class="font10">reign has been infinitely worse than a failure. It has been the tragedy of the universe! </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">After </span><span class="font10">six thousand years of his continuous rule, supported by both houses of parliament—popular religion and mammonism—millions are starving and nations are falling. The spectre of lawlessness is seen in every land. The earth </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font10">a cemetery. The graves of the dead are </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">wet </span><span class="font10">with the tears of the living. Impending </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">cata</span><span class="font10">clysm threatens world-wide chaos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But the decree has gone forth. The time </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font10">at hand. The measure of inquity is full. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font10">lesson has been taught. Dagon is falling </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">from </span><span class="font10">his throne. As Satan’s star goes down the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“Sun </span><span class="font10">of Righteousness” is rising with “healing in his wings.” The Year of Jubilee, has come. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Pro</span><span class="font10">claim liberty throughout the land, to all </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">inhabitants thereof! Satan will perish, and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font10">the ages to come his rebellion will be remembered only as a warning by the “redeemed </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">the Lord” as they walk amid the flowers and bowers and eat freely from the trees of life </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font10">evermore in the world-wide garden of God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font10">HE. Bible is the basis of Christianity, the acknowledged textbook of Christian theolo; |L gy, and i<sup>s</sup> generally admitted to be the inspired - Word ro^ God. The translations, or versions, ' contain many errors both in translation, punc-' tuation and in the substitution of words, and there are a few passages that are not authentic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">•7‘ But this is not surprising when we consider f ■ that the King James’ version now in general F use, was translated from only eight Greek-man-F. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• uscripts, dating back to the tenth century, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">£ <sup>1</sup> by </span><span class="font10">forty-seven persons all of whom held sec&gt; tarian views, and would naturally make their translations coincide with their creeds as near</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">. ly </span><span class="font10">as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">During the past century the Scriptures have g been retranslated by nonsectarian Greek scholars, from more than six hundred manuscripts, ? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' dating back to the fourth century, and admitted</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">• ■ by </span><span class="font10">many theological and secular writers to be </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font10">nearly perfect as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">‘ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bible has the largest circulation of any</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><sub>E</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;book </span><span class="font10">in the world, but is without doubt the least</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">. ' understood of any. This is because some parts </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">y</span><span class="font10"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are literal, that is to say, should be under</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">stood as written, and other parts are symbolic </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font10">figurative, and have an entirely different meaning from the written word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Old Testament is divided into two parts, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">historic and the prophetic. The latter is mostly symbolic. Some of the historic relates </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">the children of Israel especially. The ordinances and laws given to Moses are typical and represent future events, Moses himself being a type of Christ.—Acts 3: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the New Testament the symbolic is found</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">throughout, but the parables of our Lord and the book of Revelation are </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">exclusively</span><span class="font10"> figura-</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">tive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">That God should give us the Scriptures for our guidance and for a large part of them to be unintelligible may appear paradoxical, but this is not so. From the beginning it was not God’s design to reveal His purposes to the children of men until the time for so doing. This was because men had proved themselves unworthy of His confidence. (Isaiah 29:10-14) Even the prophets who wrote these things did not understand.—Daniel 12:2-8; Job 42:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Nevertheless God has from time to time vaguely intimated what His plans were. For instance, we have that oath-bound covenant</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Bible </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By Robert La Fount</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">which God made with Abraham: “And in thy § seed shall all the nations of the earth be bless- “ ed”; “And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, all the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an ever- &lt;i lasting possession”; “And all the land that thou &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">J</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark120"><span class="font10">seest, to thee will I give it and to thy seed</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark121"><span class="font10">for ever.”—Genesis 13:14-17; 17:8; 22:18.</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark122"><span class="font10">Again, we have the covenant which </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">God made </span><span class="font10">with the house of Israel: “For this </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">is the cove-</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark123"><span class="font10">nant that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font10">will make with the house of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Israel</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font10">after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts, and I will be to them a God; and they shall be to me a people; and they shall not &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;«</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">teach every man his neighbor, and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">every man &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all shall know me from the least to the greatest.” — —Heb. 8:10, 11; Amos 9:11-15; Micah 4:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">IN PARABLES</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When Jesus Christ came, He preached to the *' people in parables which they did not under- ’ stand.(Mark 4: 34) But He explained the meaning to His disciples, saying: “Unto </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">you it is 5 </span><span class="font10">given to know the mystery of the kingdom of t. God; but to them that are without, all these things are done in parables: That seeing they-may see, and not perceive; and hearing they ' may hear and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be for</span><span class="font10">given them.” (Mark 4:11, 12; Matthew 13:1017) But even the disciples did not begin </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to un</span><span class="font10">derstand fully until they had </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">received the holy </span><span class="font10">spirit at Pentecost. (John 12:16; 14:26; 16:2, 3) Jesus said: “I thank thee, 0 Father . . . </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">cause thou hast hid these things from the.wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">babes.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The following shows why these things </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">should </span><span class="font10">be hid: “Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect [righteous, justified] yet </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font10">the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes [rulers] of this world, that come to nought. But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden mystery which God ordained ) before the world, unto our glory; which none of the princes of this world knew, for had they known it, they would not have crucified </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">Lord of glory.” (1 Corinthians 2: </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">6-8) The nat</span><span class="font10">ural man does not and cannot understand </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">these </span><span class="font10">things.—1 Corinthians 2:12-14.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">When the disciples more fully understood, they preached the meaning to the church in plain language, and continued to do so as long as they lived. But after their death dissensions arose in the church, which terminated in a great apostasy or falling away from the faith. (2 Thessalonians 2:3) The knowledge referred to was entirely lost sight of, nor was it to be again restored until the time of the end, and then only to a limited class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In Daniel 12: 9 we read: “Go thy way, Daniel; for the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end . ; . and none of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall understand.” Our Lord in speaking of His second advent, and of this time of the end, said: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world, for a witness unto all nations, and then shall the end come.”—Matthew 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Revelation 14:6 says: “And I saw another angel [messenger] fly in the midst of heaven [ecclesiastical world] having the everlasting gospel [gospel of the everlasting kingdom] to preach to them that dwell upon the earth”— the same gospel that Jesus Christ and His disciples preached. (Matthew 4:23; Mark 1:14; Acts 20:25; 28:31) This takes place at the hour of judgment. (Revelation 14:7) This</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">shows conclusively two things: First, that the gospel of the kingdom had not been preached from the great apostasy until some forty years ago; and second, that we are in the last stage of the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“this gospel,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What then is this gospel? It is the glad tidings that at the end of this gospel age God would destroy and break into pieces all the kingdoms of the earth, and that He would set up a kingdom that would stand for ever. (Daniel 2:44; Revelation 11:15); that at His second •advent Jesus Christ would rule over this kingdom for a thousand years; that all peoples, nations and languages should serve Him; that the desire of all nations should come—peace, justice and equality.(Daniel 7:13,14; Luke 1:31, 32; Ezekiel 37: 22-28; Isaiah 2: 2-4; Haggai 2: 7; Revelation 20:4, 6); and that God’s will shall be done upon earth as it is in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The hidden parts or mysteries of the Scriptures are a record of what God has done in the <sup>at</sup>past, and what He purposes to do in the future. These symbolic writings are like the cipher messages which ambassadors send to their re-</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">spective governments, and which </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">require a key </span><span class="font10">to be understood. The Bible, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">however, provides </span><span class="font10">its own keys. These keys </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">(understanding) of </span><span class="font10">the kingdom of heaven were given to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">St. Peter, . </span><span class="font10">and he had the honor of first explaining </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">gospel of the kingdom to both </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Jews and gen- -</span><span class="font10">tiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We should not permit the symbolic parts </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">discourage us in the study of the Bible. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“He -</span><span class="font10">that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.” Moreover, in these </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">days </span><span class="font10">of enlightenment, we have revised translations, concordances, and non-sectarian helps, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">which ' </span><span class="font10">make the understanding of the Bible comparatively easy. It is very essential that we should . have a correct knowledge of God’s Word and of His plan of salvation.—Hosea 4:1, 6; Isaiah 5:13; 2 Timothy 3:15-17; John 12:48; 8:47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THE GREAT APOSTASY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At the time of the great apostasy [325 A. D.] the teachings of the primitive church gave way to human traditions and theories. Many of the latter were the result of putting a literal interpretation upon symbolic passages. These traditions and theories have been handed down from generation to generation and constitute much of the doctrines of the churches of today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Since the Reformation these churches have been divided up into hundreds of sects and isms, with a diversity of conflicting creeds and . articles of faith, which harmonize with the Scriptures in but few respects. The majority- ’ of the followers of these churches are biased, and their minds are in abject slavery to their theories. They trust in “the traditions of men,” and pay more heed to the opinions of some . high churchman or professor of theology than ■ they do to the Word of God. Yet the Bible says : “Cursed be the man that trusteth in man.” . (Jeremiah 17:5) And our Lord said: “In vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the . commandments of men.”—Matthew 15:9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This is not intended to imply that there are ’ no good people in the churches. There are, no ’ -doubt, hundreds of thousands who are honestly striving to serve God, but who have been deluded by church mythology and deceptive .. hymn-book theology, and whose minds have been blinded by the god of this world. However, things are changing. God is causing the minds yf of the people to become enlightened; and they &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">’tS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">are beginning to realize that the salvation </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">that &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10">-Jg</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Many of the nominal churches claim to represent the true church of Christ. They say that they believe in Christ and His teachings, and that their work is to convert the world before Christ's second advent. These claims are not only inconsistent, but impossible. The vail and covering which God spread over the face of all nations and over all people has not yet been removed. (Isaiah 25:7; 2 Corinthians 3:14, 15; Ephesians 4:18; Bomans How then can they believe that which not know, or teach that which they do derstand?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">How could the world be converted</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Moreover, Jesus Christ did not establish His church for the purpose of converting the world before He returned, but to take out of the world “a little flock,” a chosen few, who could and would overcome self and Satan, and were willing to sacrifice all that they had for Christ’s sake.—Luke 14: 33; 5:11; Matthew 19:27; Mark 10:17-22; Acts 2:44, 45.</span></p>

Revelation 7:4 says that they represent the twelve tribes of Israel, who were God’s chosen people, but who were rejected by Him because of their disobedience. In Acts 15:14 we read that God would take from among the gentiles “a people for his name” (Christians), and this applies to this elect church only. It would be just as absurd to call the Eastern nations “children of Israel” as it is to call those of the West “Christians.” The prophet Amos refers to them as heathen. —Amos 9:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FALSE TEACHINGS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now we will call attention to a many church teachings that are in tradiction to that of the Bible.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10">few of the direct con-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">The churches say that at death good, people go to heaven. Christ positively denies this.— ( John 3:13; 7:33, 34; 8:21; 13:13; 14:3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The churches say that the final punishment for sin is eternal torment. The Bible says that it is eternal death (utter destruction).—1 Thes- • salonians 1:9; Psalms 145:20; 92:7; 9:5; Job 20: 5-7; Proverbs 10: 28-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The churches say that the sacrifice that Jesus made upon the cross was to save believers only. The Bible says that it was to save all, both believers and unbelievers.—1 Timothy 4:10; 1 John 2:2; Hebrews 2:9; Romans 5:15, 16; 11: 32; John 12:47; 1 Timothy 2:13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The churches say that God hears and answers their prayers. The Bible denies this.— John 9:31; Proverbs 15:29; Isaiah 1:13-15; 59:2-4; Micah 3:4; Jeremiah 14:10-16; Ezekiel 8:18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The churches say that Christ’s second advent is for the purpose of destroying the world and -s all that is in it. The Bible says that it is to ' destroy the works of the devil, social, political, financial and ecclesiastical; to open the eyes of the people, to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God. “God • . having raised up His Son Jesus will send Him -to bless you in turning every one of you from his iniquities.”—1 John 3:8; Acts 26:18; 3: 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In other words, Christ’s second advent is </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">give all of Adam’s posterity, both living and dead, an equal opportunity of regaining by &quot;&nbsp;obedience that which Adam lost by disobedience—namely, everlasting life. (Genesis 3:22, 24) This will be without being subject to evil influence; Satan will be bound. (Revelation 20: 2, 3) For this purpose God has reserved the 1000-year seventh day, “the sabbath of the Lord thy God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are many who, though professing </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to be </span><span class="font10">Christians, dispute the veracity or divine au- . thenticity of the Bible. These evidently overlook the fact that the Bible is the foundation of Christianity; and that if the Bible is not ■; true, then Christianity is nothing but </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a myth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If on the other hand it is true, then those who reject its teaching cannot be Christians.</span></p>

The old father then spoke in pro</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">phetic </span><span class="font10">phrase, evidently under the direction of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">Lord, saying unto his son Jacob: “Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font10">lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother’s </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">sons </span><span class="font10">bow down to thee: cursed be every one </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font10">curseth thee, and blessed be he that bless-</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">eth thee.”—</span><span class="font10">Genesis </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">27: 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>118</sup>Almost immediately Esau returned from </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">field, and found that Jacob had received his father’s blessing and that he (Esau) had been unsuccessful in carrying out his purpose of defeating the open and fair transaction which he had made with Jacob when he had sold his birthright. He hated his brother Jacob and determined to kill him as soon as his father Isaac was dead.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">evidently been due to the fact that they were ignorant of the record. No part of Jacob’s action in connection with the birthright is reprehensible. Everything with reference to Esau is reprehensible. God subsequently showed that Esau pictured the peoples of earth who are Christians in name only, but not in truth and in fact, who are hypocritical, and who persecute the true Christians; while Jacob pictured or foreshadowed the true followers of Christ, who have been misrepresented and persecuted by the merely nominal Christians. God showed</span></p>

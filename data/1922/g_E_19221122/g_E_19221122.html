</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">some thirteen millionaires practically own or control all of the railroads, banks, and other great industries of this nation. How long do you suppose such conditions, can. continue! ■.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">There is.' a limit, to human endurance, and often it is the last straw that breaks the camel’s back. Therefore it is wise and proper that not only the workers of this country, but also the . lawmakers, should study our financial system, the most outrageous and enslaving system that has- ever been fastened upon a people, and see whether we-cannot devise some way out of our dilemma. ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">If one is not a wealth-producer he is a parasite to the extent that he is being clothed, housed and fed by wealth-producers. However, the labor of non-producers is exerted to a more . or less degree in the interest of parasites higher up in the financial strata^ and therefore practically all workers are working to pile up riches for a few already fabulously rich.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">To gbt this system clear let us use this illustration: Say that a man is entitled to live off his accumulated savings, which is granted. He saves $20,000. He then starts living therefrom, and ,it takes $1,000 a year. After one year he has $19,000 left, and in twenty years would have’Mevoiired his accumulated savings. But he actually lived therefrom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">However, our modern system has a different society, often despising the wealth-producers who are feeding, clothing, and housing you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Thus every time a $20,000 bond or other</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">form of capitalization, either real or watered, . is placed, it means that one average family can live in idleness—-often despising those who pro- 1 vide for them — bringing up their children to ' take the same view of labor«thirt*they&quot; themselves entertain^ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' ’ ’ , ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• people can live in idleness and luxury, never •' rendering‘a service therefor and usually not ’ even appreciating whence their bounty' is derived. . ■■..\. , . • ■.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">How long are the wealth-producers of this . nation going to be- deceived -by this scheme which permits so many of our population to . live in idleness and luxury while every year the wealth-producers are- compelled to work harder and harder and skimp to a greater ex- . tent to carry, a burden that is ever being piled higher and higher! . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Do you wonder that our government officials are compelled to make a special study of conservation and efficiency and continually admonish the wealth-producers of the nation to practise conservation and greater efficiency! How can it be otherwise when financial autocrats are continually saddling more bonds,' real and watered, onto the backs of the wealth-producers!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">If you want to see peace and plenty in this nation, make capital work for the benefit of mankind, not for the benefit of a<sup>-</sup>favored few. Toi do this we must take from-capital the power to levy, tributethat is, compel capital to work without interest (usury) or profit.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">If Elihu had lived today, he perhaps might . not have waited so long for the old boys to say their long-winded pieces and get through, but in aD probability he would have put his oar into- the conversation right from the beginning, speaking, as does our modern youth,-with that fine and inimitable contempt for established custom which is the outstanding feature of modern progressive thinking; fot this truly is the day of Youth-, in every department of public and private life. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">• And it really is doubtful whether pur modern man; with all his ideas of the importance of the modern young man in general, and himself in particular, could get </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">together</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> .and logically present. as good and sound ah. argument as did Elihu on that occasion, <sup>as</sup> stated in the .32nd chapter of Job. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">However, this is merely a preface to the- discussion of a point which is of some slight in. terest to the writer, and may be to the.reader, which is, that there </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> a spirit in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">man</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> which is</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">showing itself more prominently today than ever before in the world’s history; a spirit which has a multitude of expressions and which, in one or other of its three main manifestations, is showing itself today in the actions of every ' man and. woman of the age of accountability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">. It is again the same spirit of self-expression, and in the. effort to express oneself, all the good, bad' and indifferent qualities that go to make up a human being show so plainly that</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE world’s history has been made by people who demanded the right to express themselves in word or in act. Sometimes it was the silver-tongued orator who s&lt;S worked on the minds, of others that he succeeded'in convincing ‘ them that his particular road to some </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">summum bonum</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> was-the one and only road which could succeed; and. thus he achieved his own ends through the instrumentality of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Again, history records the exploits of many swashbuckling adventurers: who, being in their day opportunists, achieved, some measure of self-expression, usually, at the expense of the common good.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Some few years ago another ego became swollen and bloated with his demands for selfexpression; and finally, through a series of circumstances which were so opportune as to be almost miraculous, if they were not skillfully engineered by this same ego, the long-looked-for chance came, and again in an effort to carve ' a name long to be remembered in history, Europe was bathed in blood and tears, and the fingers of sorrow stretched into every corner of the so-called civilized world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">What the result of that effort at self-expression was,‘&quot;we all too sadly know today; but the lessons of the “old men” of history fall on deaf ears, and in the thousands of years, which have passed since Abraham went forth to the slaughter of the tep ki$gs, and Lot’s herdsmen strove with, the herdsmen of his uncle in the .land of Canaan, the Vorld has found no new or better way to settle its difficulties than with battleaxe and sword.</span></p>

The.landowner or “baron” owned everything in sight, and Spent his . days in devising ways and means of acquiring everything else that was not nailed down. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Beneath his beneficent rule the “serf”-eked out a perilous existence, tilling the lord’s land and raising his cattle and horsey and incidentally rearing his children to perpetuate the slave system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Then there waS the “army” Which was composed largely of the native-born serfs who found it easier to live on the baron’s bounty and make what they could on the side from the frequent raids on other land-owners; and often</span></p>

And also the severe rap oh the knuckles that England got ‘over the colonization of the land wliieh now we call the United States enforced the lesson .that she also could bite off more than she could chew, on occasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>

Wherever there is a war, you will find the old-gag about protecting “sacred institutions,” and the “inalienable rights of man,” and usually too, something about defending the “sacred faith of dur: forebears” and so on, ad infinitum</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In modern times we have the events in Ireland. At this present .writing the .Irish situation is about as .clear as mud—and getting, no better fast Right after the European war , seemingly Ireland thought it a good time really to start something.. For many years she had been “swelling, up” like new wine, and a number . of minor explosions had served to keep her constantly at boiling point. Finally the smash came; and again </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">after</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> a number of people had -been killed and maimed, and business ruined, England made, one of her famous compromises, ' wherein she gave Ireland two-thirds of what she wanted, and withheld one-third. The result was that a rough and noisy minority of the Irish figured- that .if old T^trly En</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">gland</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> could be forced to give up two-thirds, she could als'o be made to hand, over the other third, and the' war went on more merrily , than ever, because now, instead of tWo factions fighting, there are.</span></p>

There is a possibility of their both being settled in the immediate future; but, in the meantime coal is not being, mined and we are within a few weeks of cold weather, and railroad equipment is running down to such an extent that when there is some coal to haul, the chances are that there will be plenty of trouble getting it to where it will do. the most good. Incidentally the harvest is bn in many sections, and crops cannot be moved in anything like the quantity that is necessary for the well-being of the country.

Yet all valuable infor-matiou should be dispensed, free for the profit and benefit of all. The following should be of much value to those who have no latent talent - as. well as to those who have. He who must-answer these questions in the negative should-not.attempt to write scenarios; for his talent is- not sufficient to merit development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">. Can you read a story halfway through arid then imagine a logical outcome! After you tridate themselves when you see or. read 'of an originakjoke! If you have honestly answer- ’ ed-the. foregoing, queries affirmatively, you are. now. ready as a prospective play-writer to consider the laws which must govern your writing. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">You must from the first remember that ydur ' story is to- be told by action and ever keep this _• &quot;actions speak louder than words.” - Build'yo.ur narrative around an original thought This may'' be called the germ of your story and should be ' exposed—made known—in one of the opening</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">underneath a .brief synopsis of the whole, followed by the cast of characters. Your play proper will consist of any number of- reels according to the length of your story. Each reel or part is made up of scenes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The’number of scenes which can be used in a reel depends upon the* length of time required to show each scene ; but the average number is about thirty. It is important that -you .have.. these scenes blend intelligently without. confusion or break. Written explanations called ’ leaders may occasionally be used to precede , scenes. But these should be inserted only where necessary to carry the thought. • &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The foregoing only outlines.some of the prin- . ciples which are found to govern all successful</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">writers of photo-plays. Hence the. prospective writer who would achieve success should give careful attention- to the plays screened at his local theater; and, above all, he should study pver the- -printed scenario of some successful --play.' This will help one to understand more. of the- technique of photo-play writing than all 'cither'. explanations, oral or written. - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">£.-jQiap of the most successful printed spenarips qnd' one which is obtainable at lower-cost and ’Jes^ difficulty&quot;.than, any other is- the- PhotoDrama of- Creation. This well-known scenario iis the product of onC of the most successful 'jrriters of our age—Pastor C. T. Bussell, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">now </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">'deceaseds It has been screened in practically, evOrypartof the civilized world ; and so eri-’thusiasticaily have the people received it that-iit many of the larger cities it has been repeated time and again. The fact that it treats on a Biblical subject does not decrease, but rather ^enhances its value and interest . • &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">. ’•*, The geitn around which and out of which all .other action in this play comes and revolves is. the thought of creation. The Supreme Being .began His activity by the creation of the Logos, through whom all else was created, including -bur earth. The Photo-Drama focuses attention upon the. creation- of our original parents and events that resulted therefrom. It depicts their 'fall into sin, and.shows how through them the trhole race was involved in degradation. It further depicts their deliverance from sin through, the Great Emancipator, Christ Thus is shown how the whole earth is to be brought .to the designed Edenic condition. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Consciously or unconsciously all-other photoplays revolve around this central Drama of Creation. The Creation made possible the existence of all activities terrestrial or celestial, human or divine- God’s laws define their scope</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and determine the length of their continuance. ■ Hence all budding photo-play writers and . other aspirants to the motion picture industry. y-ould do well to align themselves with the ’ ; future march of progress. Human sentiment ia . fickle, and to obtain its favor now does not • mean anything in regard to one’s future. In the near future the motion picture industry . may be expected to be- revolutionized. <sup>r</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The ancient worthies, including Abraham, ■ Isaac and Jacob, will’ soon be- the directors of.. this industry and will’accomplish things hither- ‘ &nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to unthought of. The sky is a most natural &quot;&nbsp;. background, and in, the future will serve as a screen on which the most, perfect and' interest- ' ing plays-ever presented to the world may be expected to be-shown/ These noble worthies will have multifarious duties, and will need a corps of assistants to carry put, the. details. Hence it is well to aspire for some of these worth-while positions of the future. These are days which hold'forth great possibilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The god of this world, Satan, realizes that his usurped rule has ended. To ensnare as many as possible he is holding forth many dazzling allurements; By this means he seeks to absorb , the time and-.talent of righteously inclined peo-pie’ in . the’direction of acquiring present fame and wealth. Those looking forward to a more sure reward should not allow themselves to be -thus entangled.--' &nbsp;&nbsp;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A word to the wise is sufficient; but a word from the Book of Wisdom is doubly faith strengthening: “Lay not: up for yourselves treasures on earth: . . . But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven.”(Matthew 6:19, 20) As far as lieth within you, bend your dramatical and photo-play writing talents into alignment with the future -r into alignment with God’s will concerning, you. .</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">N November, 1918, the Vesuvian artillery of the nations paused in their hymn of hate and destruction, and the world was informed that the armistice had been signed. The peoples of earth gave vent to great rejoicing, because they believed that the bloodiest struggle of history bade fair to end and make way for peace and reconstruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Back in the balmy pre-war days,” we were told by our statesmen, poEticians and ecclesiastics that a great struggle of nations was impossible, with our civilization (!), that peace societies, institutions of learning and culture, etc., made war impossible; that humanity would not tolerate such a bloody spectacle; That<sup>-</sup>was prior to 1914. With the facts the world is now sadly acquainted. Like a thunderbolt from the clear sky the nations of earth (Christendom, . Christ’s kingdom) were hurled into a great cauldron of affliction. The war has<sup>-</sup>been termed “earth’s colossal crime.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Then-we were told by these same statesmen, </span><span class="font5">politicians </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and ecclesiastics, that this would be the last war; it was “war to end war” and forever “make the world safe for democracy.”. . After four years of inconceivable ruin and, . horror the armistice was signed; the masterminds of victors and vanquished met at Paris in the historic Palace of Versailles'to draw up the instrument of &quot;peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Our President, Woodrow Wilson, sailed from these shores in the good ship George Washington, armed with his now famous fourteen points <sub>: </sub>(none of which ever seemed to stick anything) - • and his “League of Nations,” which was later said by the clergy to be “the poUtical expression of God’s kingdom on earth.” Yes! these great ones of earth would set things in order and usher in the Millennium. That was three . years ago; and what of Europe today? . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We now come to Genoa. This conference was called by Mr. Lloyd George, of England, who hoped by this means to bring about the economic rehabilitation of Europe, to straighten out international rivalries by a plan of peaceful. organization, and thus to keep afloat the European ship of state. His own statement at the opening of the Conference was: “If this conference fails, -the world will be swept with despair; and Europe' will again see a welter of blood.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Why have the efforts of these brilliant ones of earth' so signally failed! In order properly to answer this question it will be needful for us to make a brief review of man's history.-The Genesis record, chapters two and three, tells us of man's creation in perfection, his ihstruc-tions, his deflection, and his. banishment from his Eden home. The Bible shows that for a long period God left man much to his own devices; then He organized the nation of IsraeL —Amos 3:2. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Through the prophets of Israel God foretold the history and final-destiny of man: After the overthrow and dispersion of Israel there would arise four great universal empires of earth, these to be succeeded by the fifth, which would be God’s kingdom on earth—“the desire of all nations.”(Haggai 2:7} Furthermore, Ged gave us through these prophets the length of time these earthly dominions would hold sway; it would be a period of 2520 years from the overthrow of Israel, God’s typical kingdom on earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The consensus of opinion is, that Zedekiah, Israel’s last king was dethroned and taken prisoner to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, in 606 B. C. This means, then, that the lease</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of ^earth’s kingdoms would expire August 1st, 1914, and that there God would begin to make ready for the fifth universal empire of earth— the kingdom of the Prince of Peace.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">P</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ERMIT me to express my appreciation of the variagated. and cosmopolitan .character of the articles appearing in The. Golden Age-.magazine. It-is bound to attract many minds, of all calibers and conceptions; and while success cannot be measured by the number attracted to any given thing (else all of Satan’s fry are a success, as no doubt they are from a fleshly standpoint), yet we may hope for. success even along the,line of numbers in this day, • when “all the ends of the earth shall turn to</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the Lord/’ . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">. There is a remarkable want of consistency in your magazine, however, .when it . comes to the position, it takes toward this Government, in the many articles dealing with the Govern--ment's attitude toward conscientious objectors to'war, the position in general being that any war is essentially a war of the beast against the Lamb, in which all combatants, on either side, ' are on the side, of the beast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The writer has no contention as to the fact that war as war is wrong; but that any nation' and every nation that participates in war is wrong in that participation is another question. • I believe the failure results from seeing the wav from only one angle; and that angle, the relationship of the Christian to it, accounts for the critical attitude of those who may otherwise seek to do God service. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Because many conscientious objectors were mistreated?by officials in power in this country during the war, when every one had something else to do than watch the other fellow usurp power, does it follow that the responsibility</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">for the acts of these officials can justly be laid oh the. Government as a whole, or on the administration in particulart • &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Would it not at least be courteous—to say nothing of being Christian —1.0 publish their good deeds as well as their bad ones, and to leave the judgment of the nation to the great assize at which Jehovah through His chosen and approved representatives will preside!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">That trite saying that “what We’hear add what we see depend on what we are&quot; is true of the Christian as of others. • Is'all that we see and hear of this .Government only evil! .«■ Evidently the Very fact that one branch of the Government, the postal system, permits the carrying of your magazine through its arteries, and because its officials recognize the force of the constitutional declaration for .freedom of . speech and press, argues at least the desire to be consistent, in spite of all the accusations lodged against it in the magazine. Surely this is laudatory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Take another case: The local LB. S. A. class in this little town stood for non-partici- • pation in the struggle during the war. One of its members, who was before the state council of defense to answer for the stand he took, was killed shortly thereafter in the peaceful pursuit of driving horses attached to a load of hay. We have a state accident insurance statute here which entitles to compensation all suffering from accidents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The man who was killed could not during his life conscientiously serve his country during war, and the writer has all respect for honest</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">conscientious objectors. But in spite of. this, • is. no doubt that the Judge will accept their plea, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">state government, by .virtue of the statute Bat it seems to the writer that the inconsist- . </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">through its accredited officials compensat- ency of such will be a. barrier to their being . </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ed </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">,the widow and the children to the extent able or qualified to judge at alL To walk apart </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Several thousand dollars—I believe five thou- from-the world and the professed church is- ' sand.

But I must kike exception to an article in your issue of August 16, entitled “Farmers’ Skirts Not Clear.’<sup>r</sup> This article so woefully misrepresents the farmers as a class that it seems very much out- of place • in The Goldek Age.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">me for this!” He hauls his fertilizer, seeds, etc., home; and again he asks: &quot;What are you charging me for this!&quot; (Little chance there for the ___________________________ ________________ farmer to profiteer.)

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">’ nation of the earth’s axis has not always been as it now is. Our present seasons, wherein the' days get shorter and shorter until in the north</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">- would always be irctie circles mf perpetual ice at the poles. This is the natural effect of six ■ months of night at the pole, during which the cold becomes so intense that the succeeding six months of daylight do not warm up the earth sufficiently to cause the melting of the snow and ice. . . . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Geologists are aware that at one time there was a luxuriant growth T&gt;f vegetation at the. poles. Evidence- .of this has been shown in the discovery of mastodons and antelopes ^embed- • ded in crystal ice, which had not digested the plant food contained in their stomachs. This food was of a character that could not possibly have grown under frigid arctic conditions, but? needed instead a warm, equable climate. This indicates, therefore, that at the time of the flood, in Noah’s day, the deluge of waters occurring in ?he . torrid and temperate zones of the earth’s surface produced simultaneously at the poles the great ice-fields which once covered</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><a href="#bookmark21"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">parts of North America, and Europe during. \ what has been designated by geologists . as the “glacial period.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark22"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">These refrigerated animals must have been: overwhelmed by the deluge and instantly frozen</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to death. It is logical to assume from the -. character of the plant food contained in their stomachs that it could have grown, only under ' temperate climatic condition^, and that consequently a temperate climate .must have prevailed at the poles, prior to the flobcL What ' could have, caused this mild climate to change-to the present frigid one! &quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• ’.' •</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">• When the huge mass of water descended, and in greater volume at the poles than anywhere else because the centrifugal force is least there, this resulted in a disturbance of the center of ■ gravity of the earth. It is a well-known fact that the center of gravity does not coincide with the actual center of the earth,, but lies to the south of the earth's center. Antarctic explorers tell us that the huge cap of perpetual ice at the south pole is at least .1000 feet thick; Naturally the weight of this tremendous mass suddenly descending at the , poles must have had considerable effect in causing the earth’s . axis to become inclined toward the plane of its orbit. The axis thus inclined now makes an angle of 23° 27' with a'line drawn perpendicular to the plane of the • orbit at the point where the axis intersects. This angle is known as the obliquity of the ecliptic. The earth, since the flood, has been revolving around the sun in a slanting position. This slanting position causes the different seasons, likewise the differences in length of day and night, and also the extreme cold in the arctic and antarctic regions. It was in all</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">There’ was (according to records) a period of ' 300 .years, A. D., when the church had the power to heal sick and to raise dead.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Final Disposition of the Earth ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">NOTHER, old hymn that was- enjoyed by the last generation^ probably more than by this one, runs : '</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All the earth shall mett away</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">’ I used tri wonder what purpose the earth would serve, floating about in space, after being relieved of its human crew. However’ even with this, melting-process theory before me, I am not</span></p>

But even this would not- be satisfactory; for according to scientific authority the processes that old niother-father Earth passed through before she-vbecame a fit place. to support br-ganic life, were, to. use the longest word at band, “tremendous.” A mere bagatelle (six-</span><span class="font5">thousand) of,years have </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">fled “since death began</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Excuse me; I find on looking up the passage that 1 have made a slight- mistake'. T should - - -have said: The church said and says that. What • the Master said was: </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Inherit the earth.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Being brought up in the Methodist faith, I ' have largely depended for my religion on what •. I.have heard; and no doubtthri cobwebs of that ' faith yet circle my- inwardc- and becloud my perspective. (Why those good people called themselves Methodists has never fully been explained to me;’ they do not appear to have any greatly different or peculiar method of worship than many other churches. Indeed, the Anglicans are greater sticklers for method than are Methodists.) Having, thus digressed, let us inquire further regarding the.earth as a good and eternal place of abode for mankind. Christ said: “Inherit the earth.” ’ The church says that man’s place is in heaven. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Heaven God’s Home</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">H</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">EAVEN ... is God’s throne,” said the Master. I must confess that it is rather ’ .ambitious of man to aspire to the throne of God! Lucifer had similar lofty aspiration. “The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord’s, but the earth* hath he given to the children of man,” sang David.(Psalm 115:16),“! am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly,” said the Master. (John 10:10) The kingdom of heaven is amongst you, He reiterated. Here heaven and eternal life are synonyms. Pray ye like this: “Thy kingdom come ... on earth.” You do not</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">S</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">OME TIME ago, there appeared in a Boston newspaper a cartoon drawn by Mr. Winsor . McKay, portraying a gigantic watch, in which he placed human, beings in process of ex</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ami</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ning ■ • the. works. This cartoon, in our opinion* provides a fine commentary upon- a verse written</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">• by that eminent logician, the apostle Paul, in his pastoral letter to the. Christians at Rome: “For the invisible things of him from the crea-. tion of the w-orld are clearly seen, being understood by the things which are made.”—Romana 1:20.' .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">' After studying the mechanism of a watch, tgking the view-point of the human being in the large time piece illustrated in the cartoon, one is reminded • forcibly of the truth of David’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">' words when he wrote: “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God”;, for we find in the watch evidences of a Supreme Intelligence.— Psalm 14: J. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. McKay sends to the editors of the newspaper in,question the following letter: - &nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">• “These humans as I have drawn them are a thousand times smaller than real life. They walk around inside the works of a watch wondering at its large</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">

<p><span class="font5">wheels, -wondering what power' conceived and created . these gigantic heavy wheels and. bars of metal,.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The human beings, looking jinta the mainspring of the watch, would gaze-in. awe u they, see it unwinding,. never. changing, .always eveni . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“If these microscopic human beings were real, and were born, lived and died inside the watch-case, as we were born, live and die inside the- atmosphere of our little earth* what would they think,. how much could they know, how would they deceive themselves, and how perfectly satisfied would they be, like us, their big brothers of the earth’s surface, with everything that they thought and all' the- conclusions that they reached!&quot; • ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• : . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■.</span></p>

They keep the deed; and when tha property is partially paid for; the men are discharged, and the home is lost. This way, perhaps 400 people have already beep defrauded In.

But the Lord is taking note of all these things. How fitting the words of Jesps: “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites I for ye devour widow’s houses, and for a pretense make long prayer:, therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.”—Matthew 23:14.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">■ To the “natural man” this doctrine is absurd <sup>; </sup>nonsense. The great Christian systems, being _ composed principally of &quot;natural men-, demand' thai kind of preaching which they can under-. ' stand.

' ’.; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Now that we seldom hear from the pulpits the preaching of the gospel'of the kingdom but the preaching of-moral philosophy (and very good preaching that is, too), how vividly the words of Jesus appear: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world, to all nations, as a witness, and then the end shall come.” (Matthew 24:14) . The. end of what? The end of the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom of heaven and the closing of the door into it: the end of the rehgious, social, and economic “wo rid” termed the gospeb age; and the . beginning of an era under entirely new ideals and new economic laws. - j . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Another-reason why this gospel of the kingdom is no longer preached, is that it is so interwoven with the prophecies that it cannot be preached separately, and scholarship has decided that consideration of the prophecies is. perplexing- and unprofitable. But Jesus said;' .“0 fools, and slow to believe all that the pro- , phets have spoken.” .’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">After answering the question of His disciples, &quot;Tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy presence?” Jesus went bn to tell them what would be the indication of His second presence. He said that His coming would be as secret as a thief at night, . consequently not known;, but He repeatedly advised all to watch, saying that the indication of His presence would be like the “bright-shiner” (the sun) shining from the east unto the west (Matthew 24 : 27) Errors, Ees, decep-</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">■ for it an entirely, new order of things, a worldwide unity. Of course, in-the process of this stupendous change confusion and anarchy may for a time prevail.. Combine or perish is the ultimatum of existing economic conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Roman and Greek Catholics, Protestants;. Mohammedans, Buddhists, etc., all feel this im-pelting force. Every distinctive religious doctrine, every political division, all special im terests that stand in the way are being swept aside; for the law of a. new economic era is operating. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We see the initial steps in finance^—the trusts - — first the small subdivisions, then the large divisions —religious,, financial, political, even the great kingdoms of the world, all forced onward toward one common ground. This common ground toward which everything moves is. summed up in one ethical, principle — the. summary by Jesus-of the law and the prophets: “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might, and thy neighbor as thyself.” This is clearly to be not only the religious ideal of the whole human race, but. a rigidly enforced law dominating business and government. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This no doubt strikes one as absurd, impossible, “Utopian’<sup>1</sup>; but a deeper analysis of the factors threatening the old mercenary control . of human affairs discloses the fact that these ethical doctrines winch so long have lain dormant are stirring at last with unwonted life.

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font10">HE Writer, a machinist, has been unemployed since July, 1921. At first I did not bend ' very strenuous efforts towards finding a position, because of depressed business conditions. But later, when I noticed what appeared to be a resumption of business operations, judging from the numerous advertisements for help appearing in the newspapers, and seeing my little bank account vanishing, I began to inquire into some of the offers made. Well, I spent much money in answering advertisements which were to reach the prospective employer through the medium of the newspapers’ box exchange; but I received only one reply, despite the fact that fe in many instances I enclosed postage for a reply. ’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one exception came as a surprise, from</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">the general manager of a very large manufacturing concern, stating that he was sorry that ' just then there was nothing to offer, hut that he was filing my communication for future reference and would notify me should an oppor-. tunity open. The advertisement had been running in the newspaper for several weeks; but &gt;&nbsp;the situation being in another state and city, I had purposely avoided answering it. Later, when I had decided to answer, I was not surprised to learn that the vacancy had been filled. . But I was surprised to receive any answer at all to my solicitation; and I have been more surprised to see the same advertisement ap-' ’ pearing at intervals of two or three days apart ever since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living in a large city, I have spent a lot of</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">money riding about on the street-cars from &amp;&nbsp;place to place, in answer to advertisements for help in my line., but always with the same resuit: The reply was, “The place has been filled,” although in some instances I had procured one _ of the first issues of the paper heralding the notice for help. I have come into contact with many others who have related to me very simi</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">lar </span><span class="font10">experiences; and often I have heard the query, “Why do you suppose the papers carry these fictitious ads?” I have given the matter much thought, and my conclusions are as follow’s :</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Newspapers are looked upon by the public in general as a guide to enable people to form conclusions as to prevalent conditions. Hence when the “want ad&quot; columns for “male” and “female” help cover two or three sheets the public at large naturally conclude that the cry of the destitute<sup>1</sup> is altogether uncalled for, since the papers are full of positions of every kind for those who want employment, and who are willing to work. <sub>t</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On the other hand, big business—and other business, too, that is not so big—all have their organizations; and from a monetary standpoint they are as much one as Jesus said He and the Father were. The “want” ad columns are a very good way to feel the pulse of the workers to ascertain just how far employers may go in reducing the scale of wages paid for labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Nearly every advertisement demands the history of the applicant for from ten to twenty-five years or perhaps for life—when he worked last, where, and for what reason he quit, what wages he was making, and what he would be willing to work for now, etc. All these and many other questions enable the “image” to arrive at as good an estimate as to how far it may go in taking advantage of the unsuspecting novice, as does the confessional box enable the “beast” to decide the fate of its subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Imperial Rome and Papal Rome made the “beast” that decided the fate of the so-called religious heretic; and Protestantism and big business make a wonderful “image” of the oldtime oppressor’s rule. In either case the method of exploitation is the same. Both systems have their various organizations supervised by salaried adjutants who report their findings to an operative head. Between the two the poor </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">man</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">is double-crossed; and where is he? If he offers -resistance, he is immediately termed a Bolshev</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">ik. If he submits to this order of things, his . life is made an existence, only as a result of manifold excessive taxations, rent, commodities of all kinds, etc. And then the masses of the people ask why there is so much crime, so many suicides, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The answer is plain to be seen. The spirit of</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“God save me and my wife,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">' My son John and his wife, Us four, and no more”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">. is </span><span class="font10">responsible for the whole matter. We are not unmindful that the Lord has set a time for their visitation; and without His aid they shall bow down under the prisoners of servitude which they have made, and these mighty ones shall fall under those whose lives they have been in-</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">strumental in crushing out. “Woe unto those that decree unrighteous decrees, and that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">wrftfc •' </span><span class="font10">grievousness which they have prescribed.” See Isaiah 10:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At this writing I have before me a clipping from the Chicago </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span><span class="font10"> announcing a demonstration by the ‘Taeast,” to regain one of the triple crowns for the pope's tiara, viz., the ~ crown of temporal dominion which they admit has been lost for over fifty years. Simultane-' ously, in the same city of Rome, another demonstration made up of one hundred other organizations paraded the streets with red flags demanding a republic, and evidently determined that there shall be no return to the Papal Hierarchy. If this is true, we have great reason to rejoice as we see our deliverance drawing nigh. The false prophet is to be taken with the beast, as is plainly foretold in Revelation 19: 20.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Our Most Dangerous Citizens </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By John Buckley</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font10">HO and what is the most dangerous element in our society? There are many different opinions. To the one with' diamonds, and readily collected cash, the criminal is the most dangerous. To the large manufacturer, the labor agitator and the union appear to be the worst; and the general public forms its opinion from the news publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Unless you have acquired something to make robbery an inducement, the burglar will not visit your home; and you may safely go to bed at night, leaving the door unlocked. The poor have little to fear from the criminal class. The gunman confines his operations to his own class, to the police, or to those who oppose him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Labor organizations and agitators seldom create anything more serious than a riot, and . the power of government has always been able to control it. To go beyond the point of riot requires finances which the poor do not possess. So far as I have been able to learn, no working class, unaided, has ever overthrown a government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The French Revolution found leadership in - the bourgeois, or middle class. They in turn were overthrown by a more radical element.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Russia, the Nihilists, many thousands of</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">whom were sent to Siberia, were of the educated class. The Kerensky revolt, which over' threw the Russian monarchical government, was of the educated and business classes. The present government is more radical, but it would not stand for a month if it depended alone upon the industrial workers of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mr. Skeffington, of the Department of Justice, recognized a dangerous element. When he learned that a law had been passed which gave him power to arrest Reds, he declared that the Harvard College radicals were the ones that he was after. Fortunately the country was not ready to deny Americans citizens their rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He recognized a danger in intelligent, inde- ’ pendent, and progressive thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The greatest danger that can come from any -J class will be found in the opulent, aggressive J business element which, continually seeking gain, creates conditions that in time become unbearable. Sitting, like spiders, in sumptuous business offices, they lay plans for revolutions and warfare through which they may gain con- 1 cessions and increase their wealth; for war and revolution will be financed anywhere that there x. is a prospect for a financial return.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark20"><span class="font10">The American Sugar Trust admitted before</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark21"><span class="font10">a Congressional Commission' that it financed</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark22"><span class="font10">the Cuban revolt, which preceded the Spanish</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark23"><span class="font10">War, to the. amount of $40,000. We have not</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark24"><span class="font10">learned who financed the Jameson raid in South</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark25"><span class="font10">Africa; but the English people paid for the at-</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font10">tempt in blood and money. The great war </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in &nbsp;&nbsp;J</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">E</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Europe was brought on by business friction; and none of the workers, who are now paying the bills, had any voice as to whether it should be or should not be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Anarchist plotting in his room is a trifling matter. He lacks the money necessary to conduct war, and the greatest number of people that he is likely to kill will be limited to half a dozen; while the wily plotter who has a backing risks only his money, and may be .guilty of the murder of thousands. Individually, men may be dangerous, but only insomuch as they are able to furnish ideas which cannot be combatted, and which may be more deadly than the methods now employed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Colonel William A. Gaston, who has just returned from Europe, says that over there they are preparing for another war. He also says that there are about 30,000 American tourists doing Europe, and that their average expenses are about $100 per day. It is no new thing for the exploiters of American brawn and muscle to squander fortunes abroad and to return loaded with junk of every description, bought of European misrepresenters at fabulous prices; while American industries languish, and weary seekers for an opportunity to labor throng the highways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">An interesting case is that of a neighbor of mine, a foreigner. With care, courtesy, and attention he has been able to attract a small trade, which in a fair degree of comfort supports </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">wife and six small children. Speculative buying has become a craze; and the property which he rented, with its little business, offered opportunity for a profitable investment. He has been ordered out. The purchaser does not need the good will, and does not pay for it. He puts in a new stock, and continues the business of which he has robbed another. The landlord who owns the house where the neighbor lives has also ordered the family to vacate; and he with the family is likely to be of the unemployed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Meanwhile, the exploiters spend millions abroad, rents are going up, wages they are trying to bring down, and a general condition of dissatisfaction prevails. Where building is going on, the houses erected are not for the working class; and a tenement at a price that a worker can afford to pay is not to be found. Housing commissions do what they can do to protect the public, but property holders have rights which cannot be ignored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The dangerous class of today is to be found in the ranks of the aggressive business class, who, after having run things to the limit, and having created a condition that neither they, nor anyone else can endure, will cry, “It is time for a change!” These, in order that they may continue to rule, will become self-appointed heroes to save the people. So, here as elsewhere, history is making ready to repeat itself.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Lack of Appreciation </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By 'James E. Fuller</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">L</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ET US </span><span class="font10">look back ten, twenty, or thirty years and remember our school days. How often teacher used to ask us to write an essay; and, even if we were permitted to choose our own subject, what a task it seemed! We knew that flowers were beautiful to look at, smell, or touch; we knew that they had roots, stems, leaves, and that they required planting, hoeing, and watering. We had often seen the big locomotive engine, and. knew that it required coal, water, and steam to make it move; that it had six or eight big wheels and a “cow-catcher” and couplers to couple or connect the cars it pulled along behind; yet to our young minds how hard </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">it was </span><span class="font10">to write this down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But now we find ourselves “grown-ups”; and yet, were we to sit down and try to write an es-</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">gay </span><span class="font10">on current events or the signs of the times or to begin to count our many blessings one by one, how far could we proceed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Many have not the talent to enumerate their blessings and privileges in writing or even to tell them to others, but surely one and all can render to God heartfelt thanks that they are living now, and that through the changing scenes of life with the many labor-saving devices coming forth, they can begin to see a silver lining to the gloomy cloud which for so long has kept the world in darkness and ignorance. And as the knowledge of the Lord goes forth, revealing the whys and wherefores of all the sin and pain, sickness, sorrow and death of the past, let us one and all show our appreciation and confess the great God and Creator of all things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For some time I have been one of your sub </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">scribers, </span><span class="font10">and can assure you that I do enjoy The Golden Age and do look forward for each issue. I wish to thank you, on behalf of all who contribute, from time to time, for the light received and comfort wrought. I honestly believe The Golden Age to be one of the channels which the Lord is using to reveal the hidden things, both temporal and spiritual; and I believe that we are living in the last days when truth shall come to rule and when hidden things shall be revealed. — Matthew 10:26, Mark 4: 22; Luke 8:17; 12:2.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">I rejoice to see that there are others who appreciate The Golden Age and the articles you publish; and no doubt it is encouraging to receive such letters. But, Mr. Editor, do you ever receive any “knocks”? Does everyone agree that The Golden Age is doing a good work and helping to increase knowledge along economic, financial, moral, physical, mental, scientific, and religious lines, and setting forth not only the cause of the present world unrest, but its cure and ultimate recovery and restoration? Tell me, do you get any “slams” or “knocks” from the ecclesiastical humbugs, and the financial bigbugs that would like to see The Golden Age stopped, or at least censored to their likings?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One can imagine how some who have read the “Go to Church, thou Fool” articles would like to throttle the good work being done. Darkness and light never did agree. Nor do justice and injustice. None who cherish self, error, darkness, etc., could or would agree that The Golden Age is doing a noble, splendid, enlightening work.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Have you, dear reader, heard the glad tidingi that millions now living will never die, that the.^ *.. prayer so long offered up, “Thy kingdom come, • Thy will be done in earth” (Matthew 6:10; Luke 11:2) is being fulfilled right now, and that those in their graves will soon hear our Lord’s voice and come forth? Have you heard this before? What do you say? Surely, yes. And do you believe it? Surely I do. Well, have you done your little bit and told the glad tidings to some other poor soul who has not yet heard it? All have some dear friends who would like a gift or who would appreciate a good turn done. Do not wait till they are on their sick beds, when your thought may be diverted to some fruit or flowers; do not wait till death may claim them. Do your friends a real good turn now Give The Golden Age for a year; but if you cannot afford to do this, lend or give your own copy, and if you have not even one friend to give it to, leave it on the seat in the street car, <sup>x</sup>rain, ferry, or boat. Some dear one very much distressed may be seeking for just the message that it contains. Even in this way, small as it may seem in your estimation, you are using a privilege offered; and an added blessing will surely follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Do not burn or destroy a single issue. You’ve read it and been blessed. You believe the Lord is using it to spread the truth and to uncover error and superstition. So don’t hoard the copies up in drawers, boxes, or trunks, but pass them along, and thus show that you are not lacking in appreciation of one of the best ways open for spreading a knowledge of the truth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font10">N Golden Age Number 65, page 363, paragraph 5, Mr. H. N. Branch says: “Marx and Engels issued the great postulate that the worker is entitled to ‘production cost,’ his entire product or its equivalent in other products in exchange; but the failure to demonstrate to the worker a method or rule by which he could correctly define and verify </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">‘production cost’ </span><span class="font10">left him stranded.” Now Mr. Branch infers that he has just such a rule or method; and if he will give it with a practical illustration or demonstration, we shall be interested and will consider it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Page 364, paragraph 3, reads: “A surveyor or bridge contractor can take a blue-print of details and determine the exact </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">'production cost’</span><span class="font10"> or labor value of a bridge of defined character.” Now, Mr. Branch, do these people use your method or rule? But if this is not what you found, please let us have the latest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Page 363, paragraph 2, states: “The product or value is the exact equivalent of the energy employed in its production.” Will he verify this statement? How does it harmonize with the fact that of two cords of wood having the same labor cost, one might be elm and another hickory? In the case of hundreds of other articles where the commercial value and labor expense</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">|r will not agree, will he further explain how his proposed currency will correctly define both <sub>;</sub> “labor expense” and quality of such products, how such can be priced so that each will rei ceive equal currency for his labor and labor <sub>9</sub> equivalent for his currency?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On page 364, paragraph 2, we read: “A ~ standard is the sum total ,of all units of its kind oi* class.” We ask </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font10"> all units of a kind or class, measured or unmeasured, should he called a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">standard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Page 363, paragraph 4, reads: “I assert that the discovery of the standard of social values is the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">exact equivalent</span><span class="font10"> of all other discoveries.” We ask why, in what way, the discovery that all social values are and always have been the standard of value is of such importance, even if there is such a standard? But what we want to know and are trying to find out is if Mr. Branch can determine the commercial value of products to any degree of accuracy by l.-ibor cost and how he does it. (Please use some product where the grades vary to a considerable extent, as an illustration.) Or if he can measure value in any other way than by inspection, and analysis, or actual tests. (I mean their value for use or service.) Should not ' price graduate with value?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">' If there are such voluminous standards as “all of labor,” “all of value,” why confound the two? What reason is there for using the terms</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“labor expense” and “value” as equivalents when they cannot be made to graduate one. with the other? Again, in what way will the proposed labor certificates function differently than now do our gold certificates after which they are patterned? and by what will they be redeemed? Mr. Branch understands that an average can be used with fairness only under certain conditions, and that any exchange system, or price, must recognize the value for use of the products bartered.—Golden Age Number 65, page 363, paragraph 4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We ask these questions with all candor. They are questions that must occur to the minds of many readers. If Mr. Branch has answers to them, we wait his pleasure to reply in his own concise, scholarly way. His writings in the Golden Age contain many self-evident truths, much of value on finance, standardization of labor and products, which to our mind are the most important questions before the world today. If any nation is saved from impending disaster, surely it will be the nation that cleans up and institutes a system so that men can work, and men, women, and children can eat, and wear comfortable clothes, and be properly housed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Of what use are abundant crops, warehouses full of materials and goods, under an abominable system that stops everything until the plunderer passes through and corrals his spoils?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>The Standard of Value </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By J. H. Morrison</span></h3>
<div>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-variant:small-caps;">M</span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b. H. E. Branch states in The Golden Age that “labor is the standard of value,” and Mr. B. F. Grossell states that “gold is the standard of value.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I do not agree with these statements and ask that you allow me space in your valuable 'Journal to give some of my reasons why the </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;text-decoration:underline;">marke</span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">t price is the true standard of value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If we wish to sell anything, whether it be labor products or property, we must accept the market price, and if we desire to purchase anything we must pay the market price. But Mr. Branch states: “Price is not value.” True, price is not real value, but the price, money, or credit we receive in exchange for the labor products or property which we sell is legal value, and the amount of money we receive determines the amount of useful things of real value we can</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">get for our use or benefit in exchange for the money thus received. Hence the market price is the real standard which determines the amount of value or useful things produced by others that we may get and enjoy in exchange for the surplus labor products or^property which we produce or have for sale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then price or money is legal value, but it is always exchangeable in the markets at our option for real value at the market price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Labor is not real value; it is the products of labor that possess real values, and the amount of money received in exchange for labor performed for others always determines the amount of real value the laborer can get in exchange for the labor performed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Labor does not always produce value; inefficient labor will often spoil valuable mate*</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font17"><a name="bookmark33"></a>\ J</span></h2>
<p><span class="font10">rial and thus cause a loss instead of producing value, and efficient labor may also be performed in preparing and seeding land, but lack of moisture or some other cause may prevent the maturing of the crop. Hence the labor produces no value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Labor usually produces value, but the market price always determines the amount of useful things we can get in exchange for our labor products or property.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Because of this fact laborers organize into unions to advance the market price of labor. Manufacturers organize into trusts to raise the market price of their products; and the farmers organize into associations to raise the market price of their products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All values must be estimated and compared in numbers, taking the market price expressed in legal numbers as a basis for such estimation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To illustrate: Suppose you desire to purchase ten dozen eggs and the market price of eggs is twenty-five cents per dozen. We estimate the price of the eggs by multiplying the number of eggs by the market price per dozen, thus: 10 x 25 equal 250, and we find that the eggs are worth 250 in official numbers or cents. Then we simply point off the number obtained decimally, thus dividing it by one hundred, and read it $2.50. Thus we find that we must give pieces of money having their value expressed by the official numbers 250 in exchange for the eggs. And in this manner all transactions small or great are estimated and compared for settlement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Our legal number or unit of comparison is the number one hundred, and we call it dollar. Hence we estimate and compare all values in hundreds or dollars and fractions thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Official numbers are the numbers officially printed or stamped on pieces of metal and paper by<sub>4</sub> our Government, which indicate the official value or denomination of each piece of metal and paper thus issued. These pieces of metal and paper we call money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Money is official national credits in favor of the holder, issued in convenient form and suitable denominations to be conveniently carried and transferred in settlement of accounts and in exchanges between individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then when we deliver money in settlement of debt or in exchange, we simply transfer an amount of national credit-bearing official numbers exactly equal to the value of the debt cancelled or the products, property or labor ceived, and the money thus transferred </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be®* </span><span class="font10">comes at once a legally collectable credit in' favor of the parties who receive or hold it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then it is evident that when we receive money in satisfaction of debt or in exchange for products, property or labor that the money received does not constitute our pay any more than </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font10"> credit slip delivered to us by a merchant in exchange for products would constitute pay. But as we all know, when we deliver the credit slip to the merchant and receive goods equal to the value of the credit, the goods received constitute our pay. And it is the same with money when we exchange our money in the markets for the things we desire; the things received in exchange for the money constitute our pay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then it is evident that money does not pay debt; but when money is delivered in satisfaction of debt, the debtor is released because the</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">money he delivers transfers the debt from himself to the market for payment or collection. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">J</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A true definition of money—Money is legal, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">national, transferable credit in favor of the 1 holder, which is always due and collectable at the option of the holder, through being legally exchangeable for anything desired from the ‘Ujjl market at the market price equal to the value of the money held anywhere in the country -j which issues the money. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* J</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then the real purpose of money is to trans- j fer and balance accounts between individuals, also between individuals and the state by transferring these official credits issued offici- <sub>o</sub> 1 ally on pieces of metal and paper each having its value expressed in i umbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The same in effect as a mercantile company ] which can safely and justly issue credits in J exchange* for desirable useful products delivered to them at the market price, so it is also ' gj evident that any government can safely and justly issue and deliver money or national &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">credits in exchange for useful service in con- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">st ruction of public utilities at the market price of such service, or in exchange for public utilities already constructed at their market value, <sub>t </sub>or in exchange for government indebtedness -at its face value. For the government would thus receive equivalent values for the benefit of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">all the people, or as many dollars worth of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">useful value at the market price as it would thus issue and deliver dollars worth of national</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">credits or dollars worth of money. Then the parties who' supplied the useful values to the government would be justly entitled to collect their pay for the things they delivered to the government by exchanging the money they received in our markets for as many dollars worth of the things they desire at the market price as they have received dollars worth of money from the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">GOLD STANDARD</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is no such thing as gold standard of value in a general way; gold has a fixed market price because all the leading nations have legally provided that they will issue a certain amount of money on a fixed quantity of gold, which is simply fixing a legal price on gold, and this is the only reason why gold does not fluctuate in the market. If all the nations should fix a legal price on any other certain product and agree to take all that could be produced, such product would not fluctuate in the market any more than gold does at present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then it is evident that gold is not the standard of value, but gold simply has a legally fixed market price while all other products must compete in the markets for a price and find a market if they can; hence, the market price or standard of value of all other products must</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">fluctuate until we have a legally fixed price on everything produced. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, w</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Gold is not even a just or proper basis for the issue of money; for when our Government prints money on gold the legal value of the metal used is equal to the legal value of the money it retains, hence, is as disastrous in effect as if our Government should insist on having each Government bond and each postage stamp it issues printed on an amount of gold equal in value to the bond or stamp issued on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">How long do you think a business concern would last that would issue its credits on gold-leaf equal in value to the credits issued?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">ft is evident that the only service the gold, on which money is issued, performs is to retain tin? official stamp and numbers printed on it in a readable and transferable form, a service which paper will perform much better than gold. Besides it is certain that no people can afford to buy gold on which to print its national credits any more than a business concern could afford to buy gold to make books on which to keep its accounts; for money is simply a national method for keeping and transferring accounts in an official and legal manner.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font10">N THE following article we have endeavored to give a reliable comparison, and to trace the development of carriage or transportation, from' the earliest periods at which data are available down to the present day, being as brief as the largeness of the subject would permit, and confining our findings to land conveyances alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Within the scope of the word “carriage” comes a vast variety of forms of conveyance —all vehicular structures employed for the purposes of transport of merchandise, movable goods and human beings. Such vehicles are generally mounted on wheels, but the sledge and the litter are types of the exception to * this rule. In its narrower application, however, the term is restricted to include just such vehicles as are used for the conveyance of persons and are drawn by horses; in its wider sense, tram-cars, motor-cars, sleeping-cars of railways, and the state carriages of royal personages are included.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">EGYPTIAN, GREEK AND ROMAN VEHICLES</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Glancing back for a moment or two to the period of antiquity, we find that a wheeled carriage appears to have been in very general use in Egypt at an early period, called a car or chariot; in the Bible the word is usually translated “chariot.” The bodies of these chariots were small and built for speed. They were also narrow and thus suited to the narrow streets of Eastern cities, and to mountain roads often only four feet wide. From Egypt the use of chariots spread into other countries. We read that King David took 700 chariots from the kings of Syria. Solomon had 1,400 chariots, and his merchants supplied surrounding countries with them at the price of 600 shekels or about $240 each. Ancient Nineveh and Babylon employed chariots for hunting as well as for war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Alexander the Great, king of Macedon, invading Asia, was met on the banks of the river Indus by King Porus, in whose army, we are told, were many elephants and several thousand chariots. . . . After Alexander’s death a funeral car was prepared to convey his body— a car, perhaps, never excelled in the annals of coach-building. It was designed by the architect Hieronymus, took two years to build, was eighteen feet long by twelve feet wide, mounted </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font10">four massive wheels, and drawn by sixty- i </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">740</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">four mules eight abreast. Its form of structure \ was that of a platform with a lofty roof sup-<sub>; </sub>ported by eighteen columns profusely adorned ' with draperies, gold, and jewels. Around the ' edge of the roof was a row of golden bells; in the centre of the platform was a throne; before the throne was the coffin, around which <sub>t </sub>were the weapons of war and the armor which Alexander had used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Romans established the use of carriages as a private means of conveyance, and with them carriages attained a great variety of forms as well as richness of ornamentation. The question of good roads also received their close attention, and the construction of the Appian Way about 331 B. C., has supplied us with one of the most noted memorials of antiquity. This road is in good condition today.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">EARLY BRITISH VEHICLES</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Tin' ancient Britons used a car for war-like purposes which was different from the Roman pattern. It was open in front instead of behind, with a pole, flat and broad, extended between the horses, so that the rider could walk along and drive from the front if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Upon the introduction of the feudal system, the use of carriages was prohibited on the ground that they tended to render vassals unfit for military service. At that time men of all grades and classes rode on horses or mules— monks and women on she-asses. Horseback was the general mode of travel. In this manner great lords made their public entry into cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Covered carriages were first introduced in the beginning of the fifteenth century, but were confined to ladies of the first rank; it was accounted a reproach fdr men to ride in them, and so it sometimes happened that electors and princes excused their non-attendance at state meetings on the plea that ill-health made it inadvisable for them to ride on horseback.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At Paris in the fourteenth, fifteenth, and even the sixteenth centuries, French monarchs rode commonly on horses, servants of the court on mules, and the princesses and principal ladies sometimes on asses. Persons even of the highest rank often sat behind their equerry on the same horse. It is recorded that in 1550 there were only three carriages in Paris—all belonging to royalty and nobility. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When Richard II of England was forced to flee from his rebellious subjects, about the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">year <sup>8</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font10">X;51399, he and all his followers were on horse-back, while his mother alone used a carriage. The oldest carriages in England were known Br as’ “chares,” “cars,” “chariots,” “carroaches,” Mfe and “whirlicotes.” The first coach in England If: was made in 1555 by one Walter Rippon, who </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">K-</span><span class="font10"> also made one for Queen Alary in 1556, and one for Queen Elizabeth in 1564. Coaches of E the type now properly so-called were first | known in England about 1580, being introduc-\ ed from Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">By the beginning of the seventeenth century the use of coaches in England had become sufficiently prevalent to move Parliament in 1601 to introduce a bill “to restrain the excessive use of coaches.” The bill, however, was defeated. Their use told severely on the occupation of the Thames watermen, and a man named Taylor, who was a waterman and a poet, complained of it thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Carroaches, </span><span class="font8">coaches, jades and Flanders mares Do rob us of our shares, our wares, our fares. Against the ground we stand and knock our heels, .■ Whilest all our profit runs away on wheels.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">g But notwithstanding the sneers of wits and watermen, coaches became so common that , early in the seventeenth century there were estimated to be 6,000 in London and suburbs; and after this the modern conceptions of car-■ riage building began to appear. Steel springs were first used in 1670—straps having been used previously. In 1804 Obadiah Elliott received a gold medal from the Society of Arts for the invention of hanging vehicles on ellip-. tical springs. 5.- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">- - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUBLIC CARRIAGES</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">5 . Then came public carriages for hire. The y - stage-coach, with seats outside and in, was the chief mode of public conveyance in England F during and after the sixteenth century, and jp before the advent of railways these had regu-&amp; lar routes or “stages” all over the country. It These vehicles were utilized by the govern-ment to carry mails from 1784 on; and thus the f term &quot;mail-coach” came to be attached to them. K Similar vehicles were also used on the European continent and in America about this - time. **</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The^riving of coaches with four horses was a task in which considerable skill was required, and English literature is full of the difficulties and humors of &quot;the road” in olden days. A form of sport thus arose for the gentry and nobility; and after the introduction of.railways had made the coach an obsolete factor through' necessity, the old sport of coaching for pleasure still survived, though only to a limited extent. However, in various parts of England, Europe and America, public coaches still have their regular times and routes for those who enjoy this mode of travel. The idea of “driving’&quot; was responsible for the use of the terms “coach” and “coaching” to mean tutor or train-er for examinations or athletic contests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The earliest railway vehicles for passengers were merely road-coaches of that period adapted to run on rails, and the expression &quot;coach- * ing-traffic” is still used in England to denote traffic carried in passenger trains. We are told that in 1673 there were stage-coaches running from London to York, Chester and Exeter, each having forty horses on the road and each carrying six inside passengers. The coach took eight days in traveling to Exeter—175 miles. In 1754 a coach was started from Manchester called “the flying coach” which was advertised to reach London in four and one-half days. In 1784 coaches became universal at the speed of about eight miles per hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">RAILWAY DEVELOPMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Turning our attention to railroads we find that the first horse-railroad was built in America in 1826. These railways had their origin in the tram-ways or wagon-ways which, at least as early as the middle of the sixteenth century, were used in the mineral districts pf Newcastle, England. A wooden railway was in existence near Bath, England, in 1734. The iron railway was known for half a century before its desirability for the carriage of general merchandise was realized. In 1813 William Hedley budt a steam locomotive and named it “Puffing Billy”; it was used only for hauling coal near Newcastle; and in the following year George Stephenson's first engine, the “Blucher,” drew a train of eight loaded wagons weighing thirty tons at four miles per hour. The steam locomotive, therefore, is an invention mainly of the last hundred years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">From the year 1820 railways and steam locomotives began to make rapid progress. The first known railway authorized by British Parliament was in 1821. Animal power was at first proposed; but upon the advice of Stephenson, its engineer, steam-engines were substituted. The railway operated between Stockton and Darlington. At its opening performance on September 27th, 1825, a train of thirty-four vehicles, making a gross load of about ninety tons, was drawn by one engine driven by Stephenson, with a signalman on horseback in advance. The train moved off at the rate of ten miles an hour and attained a maximum of fifteen miles on favorable parts of the line. A train weighing ninety-two tons could be drawn by one engine at the rate of five miles per hour.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19220830_files/g_E_19220830-10.png" alt="" style="width:29pt;height:38pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">The principal business of the new railway was the conveyance of minerals and goods; but from the first, passengers insisted on being carried, and on October 10th, 1825, the company began to run a daily coach called the “Experiment,” carrying six inside and from fifteen to twenty outside, making the return journey of forty miles in two hours. The fare was one shilling, and each passenger was allowed to take baggage not exceeding fourteen pounds in weight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Other small lines soon appeared, but the Liverpool &amp;&nbsp;Manchester Railway, which was opened in 1830, was the first to impress the national mind with the ponderous fact that a revolution in the methods of traveling had really taken place. And further, it was for it that the first highspeed locomotive was invented and constructed. The directors having offered a prize of £500 for the best engine, trials were held on a finished portion of the line in 1829, and three engines took part—the “Rocket” of George and Robert Stephenson, and two others called the “Novelty&quot;’ and the “Sans-pareil.” The last two broke down under trial, but the “Rocket” fulfilled the conditions and won the prize.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The main features of the steam locomotive were thus established, and its subsequent development is chiefly a history of gradual increase in size and power, and of improvement in design. In America the development of the locomotive dates from almost the same time as in England. The first one built here was in 1830. It is reported to have hauled forty or fifty passengers in four or five cars at a speed of from sixteen to twenty-one miles per hour. After a few months of life it was blown up, its attendant, annoyed by the sound of the escaping steam, having fastened down the safe</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">ty-valve. This one had a vertical boiler an&lt;T<sub>v </sub>was carried on four wheels. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- w</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The following decades saw the “railway mania” and by 1840 there was a mileage of 1331 miles in Great Britain. In the United States progress was more rapid, there being 200,000 miles of track in 1900. A railway line 3 across tbo North American continent from the S Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean was first &nbsp;W</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">completed in 1869, being 1,848 miles long, and &nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">running through a country then for the most part uninhabited. But these lines have been J dwarfed since J 891 by the Siberian Railway ‘ ' built by the Russian government across the ■ entire continent of Asia, a distance of 4,073 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">miles. At the close of 1907 there were approxi- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">mately 601,808 miles of railway in the world, ; of which over half was in America. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Passenger carriages, as previously mentioned, were originally modeled after the stagecoaches which they superseded. Early exam- ' pies of these had bodies about fifteen feet long, six and one-half feet wide and four feet nine j inches high, divided into three compartments, | and holding eighteen persons in all. The dis-tinetion into classes was made almost as soon ' as the railways began to carry passengers. ' Those who paid the highest fares were provided with covered vehicles, on the roofs of which their luggage was carried. They had the privilege of booking their seats in advance. 1 Those who traveled at the cheaper rates had 1 at the beginning to be content with open carriages, having little or no protection from the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark40"><span class="font10">weather. However, by the middle of the nine-</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark41"><span class="font10">teenth century second-class passengers had begun to enjoy “good glass windows and cushions on the seats.”</span></a></p>

<p><span class="font10">Today the cost of constructing one first-class standard passenger car, such as is used on the Pennsylvania Railroad, is over $5,000. The 4 largest locomotives today require over three &quot;■ tons of coal before they pull out of the round- j house to make their trips, and over five tons gj can be carried on the tender. The water tank will hold well over 4,000 gallons, and the total weight of the engine proper exceeds 100,000 ■ | pounds.

<p><span class="font16">i</span><span class="font10">J* of the subject of carriage, or transportation, through its deeply interesting course of development along the pathway of many centuries from the earliest known periods down to our day. By far the most rapid period of this de; velopment has been, as we have heretofore mentioned, within the last century—more exclusively within the last fifty years. Our day in this respect as well as in many others is without parallel in earth’s history. Everybody F knows that, stimulated by printing, there has been a greater development of knowledge along every line within the past century than during the preceding fifty-nine centuries. Everybody knows that the telegraph, telephone, wireless, electric lights, gas lights, steam roads, electric roads, machinery and conveniences of our day were </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">all unknown</span><span class="font10"> a century ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The first steamboat was operated in 1807; the first reaper in 1831; the first telegraph in 1844; yet today thousands of mammoth and luxurious cars and steamships are carrying , multitudes hither and thither “to and fro.” The J prophet Daniel, speaking by inspiration, said <sup>11</sup> . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that “in the time of the end many shall run to</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">£•' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fro and knowledge shall be increased”; and</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ _ . we have this prophecy fulfilled before our eyes. Here we conclude the matter. So active has been the inventive genius of man during the i past half-century that the media for running - to and fro are exhausted; for mankind are now traveling over the earth and under the earth, over the water and under the water, and through the air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But although we know this rapid development to be a fact, it seems almost incomprehensible to the rising generation; for, as we count time by little days of twenty-four hours, fifty years is a long while and these things seem to have come gradually. However it be, but few yet realize that these things are foregleams of a better day—the Golden Age—to follow “the time of the end” of this order of things. The Bible declares the coming glory of earth in no uncertain terms; when God shall make the place of His feet glorious; when the whole earth shall be a Paradise of God. Our great scientists, who give no heed to the Bible, testify that present attainments are as nothing to what is just at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“In the time of the end many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.” Are we not in the midst of the running to and fro which this prophecy predicted? Is not the Bible being fulfilled? Who can dispute the facts? What do they signify? We answer that they exactly corroborate the divine description of that part of earth’s history in which “the God of heaven will set up his kingdom” for the “blessing of all the families of the earth.” ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The kingdoms of men are passing. The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Lift up your heads, ye suffering masses; for millions now living will never die.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Presidential Terms</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">M</span><span class="font10">B. HARDING- wants the president's term extended to six years with no reelection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">While we have no political preferences, we have an interest in people and may, perhaps, express an opinion. Presidents (-an go far enough in any direction in four years. The expectation of a second term doubtless restrains some from going the limit in a wrong course. With a six-year term and no come-back, nothing to fear, a bold reactionaire could go far in a wrong course. Four years, without a doublegear recall for safety first, is long enough to give political tools in the president's office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">President Harding knows he never can be reelected. He is now on the Wilhelm-Wilson toboggan and he will be as unpopular at the end of his term as Tumulty-Wilson is today. Wilson and Harding have both betrayed their trust. Air. Wilson's solemn pretenses to keep us out of war when he knew that a group of promoters were dragging the nation into it, and his secret mission and servile toadying to the pope of Rome, etc., have destroyed his influence once for all. Harding’s steadfast opposition to the League of Nations and his final yielding to foreign influence have destroyed any hopes that he may have of reelection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bryan and the Monkeyites</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-variant:small-caps;">W</span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">illiam J. Bryan is causing consternation in the ranks of the monkeyites. It is queer how some people insist on having monkey progenitors. Perhaps the monkey-like tendency to foolishness and apish mannerisms has something to do with it. But how much more beautiful, reasonable, and acceptable the Bible statement that “God formed man of the dust of the ground, and blew into his nostrils the breath of lives; and man became a living being.” Adam was a direct creation made in the Creator’s image.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The monkeyites are in for it. Air. Darwin, the first one to discard his tail and wear tailor-made clothing and assume the title of LL. D., could never find the “missing link.” No one ever has seen a monkey in the transition stage; no one ever has seen a fish leave the water and develop wings, legs or toes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With the exception of Air. Darwin, no monkey has ever been known to shed his coat of</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">750 </span><span class="font10">hair and develop a nose<sub>r</sub> a forehead, and; * brain with moral and reflective organs. Air. Darwin. LL. D., is the alpha and the omega in this performance. Of course, this is a joke on Mr. Darwin; but seriously, if monkeys had developed up from protoplasm and maggoty and i' -om fish to fowl, in the long centuries past, why do we not now find monkeys merging out of monkeydom into manhood? Why do monkeys insist on being monkeys only?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Why admit that there has been a change in the now inflexible law of nature, to wit, that “like begets like”? The species are unalterably fixed, “each after its kind,” as designed by an ?Jl-wise Creator. One exception to this law is in the process of nulling, but here the process ends; for, as all know, these animals do not propagate. Then by careful breeding some have developed new varieties of pigeons, but these must be kept separate from the common variety, or else they soon return to nature’s level.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10">The Darwinian theory of evolution has done <sup>; </sup>much to destroy faith in a personal Creator and in the Bible as His revelation. Away with ‘ it! Adam, instead of being one remove from ' ? a nnmkey, was a perfect man with no equal ’• ’■ except in the man Jesus. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">/CHICAGO women, to the number of 3,500, 'o' are said to have their hair bobbed each day. The advocates of bobbed hair are plentiful. Some great writers are urging it on the grounds that hours are wasted in dressing the hair. It is safe to say that those who bob their hair to save time do so that they may spend it on the streets or in worthless amusements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A man known as St. Paul, who lived in the first century, A. D., and wrote a large portion of a book called the New Testament, and believed to be divinely inspired, wrote something about woman’s hair. He says: “If a woman have long hair it is a glory to her; for her hair is given her for a covering.” Woman’s hair has (-ver been her greatest treasure of personal adornment. However, it resolves itself into the question, What length should long hair be, and how much it should cover? We hope that no young lady will give up her pretty locks on the advice of a faddist.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">I</span><span class="font10"> SAT one evening in a little back bedroom of a palatial mansion in one of the city’s finest streets. Opposite me sitting on the bed (the room boasted only one chair and I occupied that) swinging her feet dolefully, was my dear friend Edna, erstwhile country girl and now maid-of-all-work in the aforesaid mansion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“I just love housework,” she said, “but if it keeps on this way I can’t stand it. I wish you’d write an article about what a girl who does housework for others has to endure.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Behold the article!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Oh, yes, housework is a delightful occupation for women. So has Texas a delightful climate. The trouble is, Texas has too many fleas. So has housework, when one tries to do it for others. I have been through the mill and speak from personal experience. All the drawbacks I shall mention are not present in every instance; but many exist in practically every case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The chief objections are:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. Undesirable working hours.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">2. Poor wages compared to the work done.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">3. Conditions which rob a girl of self-respect.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">4. Imposition.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">5. No family life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">6. Freakish, independable women employ-' ers.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">UNDESIRABLE WORKING HOURS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In cities it is usually not necessary for a maid to arise earlier than she would if she were working at any other occupation. From six to seven o’clock and even later is the average; </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font10">her working day usually does not end until eight o’clock at night. If she has had an hour off in the middle of the afternoon she is fortunate; but what good is an hour in the afternoon when a girl is anxious to go out in the eve</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ning? </span><span class="font10">She is obliged to rush through the dishwashing and is hot, flushed and shaking with the nervous strain when she finally runs for her car. “If they only wouldn’t stay at the table so long after they are through eating,” one girl complained, “I could still clear the table and get through with my work in time to get away in the evening; but there they sit and talk and I stand in the kitchen and make faces at the door.” The average housekeeper does not want her maid to leave the house more than two evenings a week. She must be there to answer the door-bell, even in the simplest homes, so </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">that the</span><span class="font10"> august family’s dignity will not suffer. Why have a “girl” if your company does not know it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Few girls get away to a Sunday morning church service. If they do they have to fight for the privilege and squeeze in their work somehow. Some girls have Thursday and Sunday afternoons off, but many are obliged to come back to prepare the supper and wash the dishes. On Thursday afternoon, when a girl is hurrying through the after-luncheon work so that she can get away early, Madam is as likely as not to begrudge her an extra hour and think of all sorts of delightful little tasks that simply have to be done. It is often four o’clock before Mary gets away and then she is usually in tears. That is Thursday afternoon off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Holidays, when other people are at home and enjoying themselves, are a terror to the housemaid. Elaborate dinners and company galore make the day a nightmare. Madam is likely to be irritable and nervous and to communicate her feelings to her underling. The work and service are doubly exacting and strenuous and no amount of extra pay (if it is given) can make up for such a day of strain. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">POOR </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">WAGES COMPARED TO THE WORK DONE</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Eight to twelve dollars a week in this city are good wages for a maid. She has a room and board, her washing when she does it herself or helps the laundress, and frequently</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">scarcely needs to buy any clothes because her mistress donates lavishly of her slightly-worn = garments. A Union man demands an eight-hour day and double time or time and a half for r &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overtime. Poor Mary does not know what is</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">L &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overtime and what is not. Her hours are any</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">ft &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;old time of the day that it suits her employer's</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">F • fancy to call for. Would a man do it? Neither</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">? will a woman unless she has to. Witness the loud and continuous wail for domestic help!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CONDITIONS WHICH ROB A GIRL OF SELF-RESPECT </span><span class="font10">. Eating in the kitchen while the family eat in the dining-room is, in itself, not so bad. Even a maid may be demoralized by listening to a dinner-table conversation of the “well-bred.” The thing that sends a painful flush into a girl’s face is the fact of being called into the dining-room after the family and possibly ; guests have been served and, with plate ex. tended, wait while the housewife places thereon whatever she thinks is enough. When a girl . . has to wait until the family are through, or snatch her food between courses, the meal is cold and unappetizing. Locked ice boxes and . provision rooms, “traps” in the shape of boxes J of candy, the pieces of which have been care-| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fully counted, furtively guarded and often</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">t &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counted silver, special dainties for the family</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">k only, and pussy-footed mistresses who keep an eagle eye on all a girl’s personal affairs, are ’ so many shocks to a conscientious girl.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">By common consent the worst room in the <sub>t</sub> house is the maid’s. To this room gravitates ■ all the old furniture, the poor pictures, the cast-off curtains, the worn rag rugs. If it is a - north room without sunlight, or an attic room, so much the better. One chair is plenty. The <sub>a</sub> dresser may wobble on three casters. An alarm <sub>?</sub> clock is the only essential furnishment. Of late . the matter of providing an attractive room for the maid has been receiving attention from architects and house builders, and the evil is f &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lessening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">t The children of the family are often allowed | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be impudent and disrespectful in their con</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">i’ tact with servants, and not the least of a girl’s difficulties are occasioned by untidy and careless children who seem to have a firmly-rooted ide&quot;&amp; that because a person is paid to clean up after them she should be everlastingly and un-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">• <sub>z</sub> Necessarily at it and her efforts to keep the Ihouse neat receive no sign of appreciation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span class="font10"> f</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When a housewife has such a good servant that she can spend most of the time on the porch, she beguiles the time too frequently by using every opportunity to speak disparagingly of housemaids in general and hers in particular. A girl is spoken of and to, in a patronizing and condescending manner which is bound to stir up feelings which the “idle rich,” fed on plutocratic press propaganda, call socialistic, but w’hich are really democratic. So much the better for the girl. Under such conditions she ought to do some thinking which is constructive enough to cause her to quit her job and find something better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">IMPOSITION</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A position that seems ideal when it is first entered into may become in time impossible simply because the housewife seems bent on making a breaking test of the girl’s patience and capacity for work. Instead of appreciating good, hard work and showing it by increasing her wages, many employers load on extra tasks. “Maggie wouldn’t do it; but Mary works so hard we can easily ask her to tend the furnace and shovel snow off the walks and do other little things.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">NO FAMILY LIFE</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A girl who does not go home at night is cut off largely from her own family and neighborhood associations. Where there is, as is usually the case, a great difference in natural endowments and education between employer and employe, and some snobbishness on both sides, there is no fellow-feeling; and a girl is often lonely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FREAKISH, INDEPENDABLE WOMEN EMPLOYERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This last objection is, I believe, one of the worst and one of the most prevalent. Women often are chronic promise-breakers, irritable, unnecessarily exacting, lazy, discontented, supremely selfish. Friend husband spoils them and friend maid gets it taken out on her. A friend of mine, anxious to go to Sunday morning meetings, made an arrangement with her employer to go every other Sunday morning. She was very happy about this and worked doubly hard to show her appreciation; but she told me a little later that each Sunday when </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font10">was her turn to go out her mistress said: “It’s my turn to go to Mass, isn’t it?” and when informed to the contrary she was sulky all day.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19220830_files/g_E_19220830-11.png" alt="" style="width:24pt;height:169pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">This same lady did not usually go out on the Sundays when it was her turn to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A woman who is generous to the point of extravagance at one time, and then suddenly • flies to the other extreme, is a trying proposition to everyone and especially so to her maid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THE REMEDY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is but one basic remedy for all these evils and that is love in the heart of the mistress herself. Serving a family is like serving the Lord. Both require a devotion and a sacrifice that can never be paid for in money. Both render a return that cannot be translated into business terms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Much of the usual routine work in a household may be taken off its mistress' shoulders </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font10">paid assistants; but such work can be reasonably accomplished in an eight-hour day. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">If </span><span class="font10">the family wish to sit long at the supper table, let the housewife and the children clear the table and let the dishes wait until the morning when Mary returns from her home fresh and ready for business. Such tasks as remain to be done after the supper hour—putting the children to bed, welcoming guests, making them </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a ' </span><span class="font10">glass of lemonade—should properly be done by a loving hand, not by the paid hand. Let housewives, however well-bred or newly rich, realize that being a housewife is a privilege and not </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">disagreeable duty that ought to be shirked in order to be in good form; and the servant problem will be solved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The reason we have a domestic help problem is because so many housewives themselves </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font10">not domestic.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>Why Girls Dislike Housework </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By Mrs. c. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">l.</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"> Palmer</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font10">HE reason why girls do not work more in private homes is that they are not treated right. They are treated as nobodies, and housework is called low class, while work in offices, stores and such is called high class. I have done all kinds of work, from housework to nurse work, and I know how it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I have worked for some people who treated me as a daughter, with kindness and love, and gave me the use of their best room if I had company. Then I have worked for some who did not want me to eat at the table with them, or sit in the room with them evenings, but just considered me a poor nobody, only made for a drudge. I did not tarry long with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Housework girls are generally looked down on. Young men, who could give comfortable homes to their wives, will not marry a girl who works in a private home be she ever so smart and neat, but usually prefer to notice and take a butterfly who thinks more of fine clothes and society life than she does of her husband and domestic life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another thing that has impressed me is that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">people </span><span class="font10">in good homes do not want children. They would rather house, bathe, and feed a lapdog </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">than a </span><span class="font10">pretty baby. Poor families with </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">from </span><span class="font10">four </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to ten </span><span class="font10">children are looked down on </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and sneered at. They </span><span class="font10">think no one ought to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">rear any </span><span class="font10">children if one cannot afford to send them to high school and college. I wonder </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">if </span><span class="font10">they think our dear Savior just notices college-bred people and passes up the poor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then again, paint and fine clothes have ruined the people and made life harder for working girls. There is nothing as nice and comfortable to work in as cotton such as calico, percale, or gingham; but a girl is looked down on in these. She must wear wool, silk, and gauze so thin as to afford no real covering to the naked flesh. The sensible, old-fashioned girl is laughed at. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>v</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I have noticed at depots when the trains came in that the smartly-dressed men </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">helped </span><span class="font10">the well-dressed women with their suit </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">cases, </span><span class="font10">and the poor sick mothers had to struggle along with their parcels and baggage </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">as. best </span><span class="font10">they could alone. Truly it is time for the long-looked-for kingdom. How I long to see it visible to all the human race I</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Dare to think, though others frown;</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">J</span><span class="font10">S EARTH’S temperature changing? If so, how is it being brought about? Will it be necessary for a great earthquake to remove the ice-caps of the polar regions? or will the removal of the ice-caps be brought about in a more natural way?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">These questions and several more have been running through my mind for some time, partly because of the frequent articles along these lines of thought in the Golden Age and the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">New Era Enterprise</span><span class="font10">; but mostly because since first reading Pastor Russell’s works, “Studies in the Scriptures,” in 1898, I have been convinced “that </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">restitution</span><span class="font10"> is due to begin shortly” and that preparation for the restitution of all things (Acts 3:19-24) is now going on. Believing this, I have kept my eyes open to the signs of the times, noting events that seem to be working along the line of preparing the whole earth for habitation, as this will be necessary when the resurrection of the dead takes place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower,</span><span class="font10"> January 1, 1913, page 11, Pastor Russell has briefly discussed the deluge. In the second column under the subheading, ’Why the Polar Ice?” paragraph 2, we find these words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“But scientific Bible students are having their faith </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font8">God’s Word established more and more. Without affecting the torrid zone, the warmer temperature is now extending itself into the frigid zones quite rapidly. ‘Greenland’s icy mountains’ will soon be a thing of the past. The poles are warming up. The ice-caps are dissolving. Last winter was called the ‘straw hat season’ of Alaska because of higher temperature than ever before known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The fitting of these facts to the Bible narrative is not only intensely interesting, but conducive to faith </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font8">God, in his providences, and in the Bible, and very conducive to a disregard </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">of the wild guesses of</span><span class="font8"> ‘professors’ who have no faith in the Bible and are seeking to discredit it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The sudden break of the canopy of water would not only cause a deluge to come down at both poles, and the flow of great tidal waves toward the equator, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font8">geologists show was the case, but it would also produce a sudden and intense cold at the poles. The water froze so rapidly that out of the solid ice animals have in recent years been dug, which have grass between their teeth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“VVe have only to put two and two together to have </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">chain of evidence linking us to the Bible. For in-gtance, it is asked why it was colder at the poles then </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">than </span><span class="font8">now. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font8">reply is: The more direct rays of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Om </span><span class="font8">then, as now, fell on the equator; </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">but the torrid zone icits hotter than now, until the trade winds sprang up</span><span class="font8"> [I have emphasized this matter of the winds </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">be</span><span class="font8">cause of some things I will say later on about the winds and the great influence they have upon the climate and what causes the winds to change their course as they have done in recent years], which carried the heat and distributed it all over the earth. And the waters of the equator must have been hotter then, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">as -</span><span class="font8">the poles were colder, until the ocean currents set </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">in, </span><span class="font8">[These ocean currents exert a powerful influence upon the air currents, their direction, and their temperature] which, like the Gulf Stream, carry* the. waters from the equator and distribute them along the shores of America and Europe— and the Japan and other currents, which in the Pacific carry their water, warmed at the equator, to the poles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“These processes, going on for 4,400 years, are gradually thawing out the polar regions, as all scientists agree; and this it is that has recently been causing larger numbers of icebergs from the polar regions to break loose and float down, to the distress of mariners. [The Titanic was destroyed by a great ice-field coming south more than a mouth earlier than the ice usually comes south, and this was following the warm winter in Alaska].”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is during this gradual warming-up process that has been going on since the Deluge, that is more and more getting rid of the ice-caps and preparing the earth for the restitution hordes, that the words of Jesus (John 5:25-29) will be fulfilled; and while this may not have affected the average mean temperature in the United States and America during the last one hundred or two hundred years, it has as a whole greatly modified our climate, so that now many products can be grown in northern regions which in former years were out of the question because of cold and frosty summers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SOME CHANGES IN MY LIFETIME</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">My father moved to central Kansas in 1876, and in that region no one was making any effort to grow fruit-trees because it was thought to be too cold to do so; the winters were too severe, the summers were subject to frosts. But about 1881 we began to have some climatic changes, and that country was subject to cyclones and hail-storms in summer. In a few years almost everybody had dug cyclone cellars. Cyclones had never been heard of in that region before. Why was this ? My opinion is this: A shift in the Japanese Current had taken place, the warm air currents had shifted farther north and naturally the climate in northern regions got a little warmer. About 1886, my father, who was a close observer of such</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19220830_files/g_E_19220830-14.png" alt="" style="width:135pt;height:24pt;">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Bbookltk, N. T.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">things, decided that the climate was getting warm enough to try an orchard, and he got some trees and planted them. This proved a success; and we have grown plenty of fruit there ever since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In 1891 I came to eastern Washington to the town of Colfax, and went to work on a big farm. As it was May I looked around presently for gardens and orchards, and finding none inquired why the farmers had none. I was told it was too cold to grow anything of that kind as they had severe frosts in the summer-time. This I found to be a fact. But note the change in that region in only thirty years. Now everybody in all the great Palouse region and all eastern Washington and Idaho adjoining grows all kinds of fruit and vegetables, and even corn and tomatoes. In fact, every summer now there are thousands of acres put into corn to fill silos on summer fallow land where thirty years ago it was so cold at that season that wheat and barley frequently froze.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After reading the “Studies in the Scriptures” and learning of restitution, I began to keep my eyes open to observe the climatic changes and to try to understand how God was working to bring them about. In this eastern Oregon and Washington region we used to have, in the winter and early spring, a very peculiar wind. It was called “Chinook Wind.” It seemed very cold; but, strange to say, the snow just seemed to evaporate and disappear in a few hours when the Chinook Wind began to blow. I wondered considerably about this wind, as nobody seemed- to know what caused it or whence it came. But about 1912 something happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I was taking the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Pathfinder</span><span class="font10"> at tiie time and noticed an article saying that for some unknown reason the ocean currents had suddenly changed and the great Japan Current which had flowed against the shores of Oregon,Washington, and British Columbia, was now striking 1,000 miles farther north; and that the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, and Pastern Asia were getting that warm Japan Current and also a strong current flowing north through Bering Straits. Soon after this it was noted that the Gulf Stream had swung in closer to the eastern coast of the United States and in many of the summer resorts the sharks were getting too numerous for safety. (The sharks seem to be a warm water fish.) About that time another news item said that the ocean current flowing south between Australia and New </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Zea- -</span><span class="font10">land had suddenly increased in volume and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">WaS <sub>: </sub></span><span class="font10">now a river of hot water flowing swiftly south.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">You may ask: &quot;What effect had all this on the climate? Well, in this region of eastern Ore- , gon, where I have lived since that great cli- -A matic change, we do not get the Chinook Winds ; any more as we once did. If they came here at all in the last ten years it was only for an hour or two.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But it was only six months or so after this change before a tremendous change began to take place in Alaska. The next fall the Yukon ' River was closed with ice one month later than it had ever been known to close before. That winter the people in Dawson City celebrated Christmas in straw hats and linen dusters. It was the warmest Christmas ever known in Alaska. Some time after that a man who had traveled extensively in Alaska said that if the same condition continued two years there would be no ice-cap left in Alaska; it would be all melted away. In a recent issue of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">World’s Work</span><span class="font10"> I read an account (Stephenson was the writer) of an explorer in the northern region. Much data are given therein showing A the unbelievably warm condition that really ex- &quot;&nbsp;ists now in northern Alaska. Forty years ago b the climate in the interior of Alaska was ter- ’ ribly cold in winter: also in summer it would, frequently get quite cold. This was told me by a man who went into Alaska prospecting about that time. A careful study of the great ice-cap ' melting away will quickly prove the power and wisdom of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Let us suppose that instead of cosmic snow, . which formed the great ice-caps, it was warm enough to cause the last canopy to come to the earth as rain. What would have happened? Something like this: The earth’s great crust &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">at that time being rather soft and pliable &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">would have buckled in terrible shape as the j great weight of waters would have quickly set- : tied into the depressions, and instead of having the great plains and farming lands for peo-pie to live upon, most of the earth would have been in some such condition as the west coast A of South America and the Himalaya region of j Asia. In fact, most of the earth’s surface would have stood upon end and there would. Jiave been very little farming land but many very high mountain ranges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Note the difference, though, when we </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">cosh -•»</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">eider the great ice-caps as a part of God's plan to make this earth habitable; for the effect of the ice-cap has been: First, the great weight of the ice helped to hold down the land when the water settled into the ocean beds (which up to that time were very insignificant), and the upheaval of the mountain ranges began; for this was the natural consequence of the water settling into the depressions of the earth —the land surface would have to rise to counterbalance the water. Therefore, as only </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">small portion of the Deluge was water and the greater portion was ice, the buckling of the earth’s surface has been very small compared to what it would have been if there had been no ice-cap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">• Second, the gradual melting of the ice has given the earth’s crust time to solidify more ajid the ice-cap has held down vast tracts of land, so that we now have great plains which otherwise would have been mountains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Third, Jesus said that one of the signs of His presence would be earthquakes in various places; and I believe it is an acknowledged fact that the year 1920 was one of the worst, if not </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font10"> worst earthquake year in 2,000 years. Now why was this? To my mind it seems quite natural that this is the result of the change of the sea currents with the consequent rapid melting of the polar ice-caps, and the comparatively rapid filling up of the oceans with greatly increased pressure upon the ocean beds, which in turn caused the mountain ranges to rise a little higher. But no new mountain ranges will be formed, because the earth’s crust has now solidified sufficiently to resist the upheaving action, and the only change will be in a lowering of the ocean-beds and a slight raising of existing mountain ranges. This, of course, will cause numerous earthquakes. Jesus knew what would take place and when it would take place. He knew that a final adjustment of earth’s sea currents, as well as the land and water surface, would take place previous to the establishment of His glorious kingdom, so that after it began operation the climate of all the world would be favorable to health and happiness. Soon all people will realize that cyclones, blizzards, tornadoes, earthquakes, and frosts in the summer-</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">tirSe </span><span class="font10">are things of the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One of the things I noticed soon after this great current change took place was the way </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">■ the </span><span class="font10">changed climatic conditions caused the</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">great (?) ones to wonder. 'A French astronomer was writing about the sudden change of the hot wind that had always blown across India and is, or was, the cause of the destruction of crops in that region; that for some unknown reason it (the hot &quot;Sirocco” wind) had suddenly changed and was now blowing up through the center of Asia and had done great damage to the crops in the Yenisei and Lena river-basins, being so much hotter and drier \ than ever before known. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Pathfinder</span><span class="font10"> editor remarked: “Yes, we can all see that it was the hot wind that did the damage, but what made the wind change is what I am wondering ' about.” It seemed to me very easy to see that it was caused by the change of the Japan sea current and the Gulf Stream which, with their accompanying hot, moist air currents, were now blowing nearly north instead of just a little north of east. This in turn naturally had an effect upon all the air currents of the earth, aud as a consequence we have had some remarkable weather all over the world these last eight or ten years. But take courage; these • conditions will not last many years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills that were un- • der the whole heaven were covered. Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.” (Genesis 7:19,20) This text always has been one of the stickers for all people trying to discredit the truthfulness of the Bible; but when one takes into consideration the actual facts this ceases to be a stmnbl ing-block. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When a person takes into consideration the cause and effect of the Deluge it is very easy to see that previous to the Deluge the high hills and mountains were really very small _ compared with hills and mountains as we know them. It should be remembered that it was the waters of the Deluge that caused the earth to buckle and thereby made the high mountains as we now see them. It is said that the Ark landed upon Mt. Ararat, and that in recent years it has been seen, but upon a pinnacle that could not be ascended, and that it is now in an icecap about 17,000 feet in altitude. It occurs to me that when Noah came out of the Ark it was not so very high; otherwise how could all the animals have gotten out in safety if it had been upon a pinnacle (as it now is) so high and steep that it is impossible to climb up to</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it 7 This is proof positive, it seems to me, that</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">as the waters of the Deluge drained off into the seas the mountain ranges were heaved up ' higher and higher to counterbalance the weight of the waters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When the present ice-cap disappears, there-fore, as it will in comparatively few years now, the water will be all in the oceans, the moun-* tain ranges will never rise any higher and there will be no more earthquakes. When these r facts are taken into consideration, it also proves beyond a doubt that the Bible narrative of G-enesis 7:19, 20 is an absolute fact; and that th( *mountains as they existed as that time were ,, actually covered just as the Bible says they</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">were. These facts give the humble child of' God power and confidence in the presence bf any infidel or higher critic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: <sup>;</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I see no reason whatever to expect such </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">great and terrible earthquake as would jar the ice-cap off the polar regions; such an earthquake would simply destroy the earth. The way God is really getting rid of the ice-cap (through the ocean currents changing from time to time) seems far more in harmony with His glorious character of Justice, Wisdom, Love, and Power, and just what we should expect of one so great. When the ice-cap is finally melted off, in a very few years, the climate all over the world will be stabilized forever.</span></p>

They point out that in the United States as a whole there are about 1,542,000.000 acres of which only 311,000,000 acres are tilled; then there are 471,000,000 acres more that could be tilled and are not, and besides there are 361,-000,000 additional acres that could be used for pasturage and orchards and are not, and it is calculated that there are 399,000,000 more acres that are irreclaimable.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>Tobacco—an Unmitigated Curse </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By N. w. Hall</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font10">HERE are curses which are curbed to some extent in their evil influence and effects. The liquor evil is curbed by “regulation” or prohibition. Gambling, dueling, and wholesale prostitution are forbidden. But the curse of tobacco is absolutely unbridled. With no shame, no regrets, and no consideration for the welfare of humanity, the tobacco business goes on increasing, and taking deeper root in the interests, habits and industries of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Look around you everywhere and see the advertisements of tobacco—-cigarettes, cigars, smoking tobacco, chewing tobacco. Various and innumerable are the fancy names, illustrations, pictures of beautiful women—as if it were not enough to degrade the human race without using the beauty of woman to attract attention. And to complete the wickedness, half-nude pictures of girls are put into some cigarette packages to tickle the lustful fancj^of the boys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Look on the walls, on the fences, on the trees, in the newspapers, in religious journals, in the magazines, in the almanacs, and see the evidences of the increase of the tobacco traffic. Go to any public place or gathering, ride on cars, go into stores, and in the presence of ladies, even in the churchyards, in the groves at church dinners, in the automobiles and other trysting places, behold the presence of tobacco.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is getting to be a common thing for a young man to smoke in the presence of young ladies. It is no rare thing for a man to light his cigarette or cigar in the presence of ladies or gentlemen without asking whether tobacco smoke is offensive. Such is the invariable result — the destruction of politeness — so that any man, after using tobacco for a while, will puff away into other men’s faces as if he did not even think of the consequences. And thus it goes on. He soon smokes in the presence of ladies without permission. He becomes a slave. He poisons the very atmosphere he breathes. He poisons his family. Even the air that his own little children must breathe is laden with tobacco poison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The use of tobacco will blunt a man’s moral sensibilities until he can poison the air that others must breathe without any compunction of conscience, can forget the Golden Rule com-pletelyeand trample it under foot like a beast. It is no wonder, then, that a man can keep on poisoning himself until he becomes a nervous wreck and undermines his constitution, till he becomes a prey to heart disease or some serious malady, and transmits to his children an inheritance of physical weakness and mental and moral obliquity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Think of the filthiness of the tobacco habit: the offensive breath; the spitting, at home and abroad, on floors, on sidewalks, in public places; not even the church is exempt from the filthy habit of the tobacco chewer. And some carry the juice on their beards and in the corners of their mouths. We once heard a man say, with his old pipe in his hand: “Any man who wiil smoke a nasty stinking old pipe is </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">nasty stinking man, 1 don’t care who he is.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And what a multitude of tobacco slaves^there are in the world. Afost of them will admit that tobacco is injurious. Yet they keep on using it. We heard a very intelligent man say that he wished to Almighty God that he need never see another piece of tobacco. That man is probably smoking today, and smoking himself into the grave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What a waste of money is the use of tobacco I If a man spends only ten cents a day it would be over thirty-six dollars a year; perhaps thousands of dollars in a lifetime. And all this is worse than wasted; spent to his own injury and to the injury of others. Can a Christian do this, while humanity is suffering? The use of tobacco, and the whole tobacco business, is sin, and only sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The tobacco business is now organizing and preparing to become one of the great monopolistic powers of the world. And the press is a veritable tool of the tobacco business. The pulpit, as usual, is silent to all the evils of tobacco; while, to their shame be it said, many of the ministers use it themselves. Now, we make bold to say, and we challenge refutation, that no man who will not declare the whole truth in regard to the sin of using tobacco is (it to preach the gospel.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">12,1notice the joke about &quot;Purchasing Immunity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Doctor Loeb in this same issue shows you conclusively that, when the acid stage is reached, death is about to take place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Long ago an English scientist gave as his proof of death the acid-action produced on litmus paper by the tear-gland. The French courts in 1920 accepted that test as definite proof of death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Surely, it is logical to assume that health must show the opposite condition of alkales-ence or a constant supply of same to the greedy acid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In every little cell there is an acid base: and it seems as if life is one spontaneous vibration, force or reciprocation, heat, etc., long before any electrical manifestations can take place, i. e., a piece of zinc is nothing, a piece of copper is likewise nothing. But the moment they arc placed in suitable relationship they become spontaneously charged (paired as positive and negative) and this is the first ruling of affinities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Each little cell must manufacture carbon dioxide; for if it does not, you arc sure sooner or later to be unhealthy; therefore, supplying the cell with the material to do this and also to enable it to expel it is necessary to living process. Healthfulness results from the expelling of the carbon dioxide and the attraction and absorption of oxygen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All nature is endowed with the following law: Unlike attracts unlike; like poles repel. Furthermore, carbon dioxide is diamagnetic and oxygen is negative-magnetic. Faraday and Tyndall proved the existence of these forces or reciprocations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Doctor Moras says: “Health is nutrition; and disease, no matter what the name, is malnutrition.” Therefore, there is either alkalescence or acidosis in the system. The cure is the getting of the alkalesence to the cell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The writing of the same doctor on vaccination is worthy of your consideration. Doctor Amber says vaccination juice is not a means of cure. Dr. Lindlahr’s work on this subject should not be passed by.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Auto-suggestion and mind-cure cannot cause or compel a cell to manufacture carbonic acid if it has not the material with which to do it. There are many pathological and physiologic^ chemists of different parts of the globe whose untiring researches prove that the cell makes carbonic acid and must have alkalescence to continue life’s process; so why perpetuate this humbug of vaccination?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What about the Philippine Islands’ record of 1918-1919? In 1918 in the Philippine Health Service about 3,285,376 slugs of pus were put into that number of Filipinos; and the harvest of 47,369 cases of smallpox with 16,447 deaths was reaped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In 1919 they improved the service and delivered 7,670,252 pus “puncheries” into their brown brethren and reaped a harvest of 65,-180 cases of smallpox with 44,408 deaths. That certainly ought to make one think awhile.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">T WUNDER if many of your readers are -*■ aware that they may appropriate to their physical bodies as food the flower or bloom from the common pumpkin-vine, and that, too, without damage to the crop of pie stock that the vines usually mature in their season.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Nature provides the pumpkin-vine with two sets or kinds of bloom. When the little pumpkins set on the vines, the latter are provided with yellow bell-shaped flowers on the opposite end from the fruit stem; through this flower the seeds of the fruit receive their polleniza-tion, and this flower should never be disturbed. But the vine is usually well-provided with flowers or blooms that come out each on an independent stem; their duty is to provide the necessary pollen for the other class of flowers and to make fertile seed for next year’s crop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Those wishing to add these flowers to their menu (But, perhaps, only such as are fond of eating mushrooms will fully appreciate pumpkin bloom as a table delicacy) may select a dozen or one and one-half dozen of the male flowers, as they are commonly called, peel all the green stem from the base of the flower, leaving the clean, yellow, bell-shaped blooms unbroken; wash them in salt-water, drain after rinsing in clear water, flour and fry them as you would the sponge mushroom, using butter, crisco, or lard. It will be necessary to watch them while frying, as they scorch easily.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">O</span><span class="font10">UR minds and thoughts must not be filled .•jwithithe contemplation of the evils of this present moment, but with the vision of the future age—an age without violence and bloodshed, where men are free to grow; where the » dominion of greed is at an end, and love finds no obstacles of mutual selfishness.” So says one writer; but whilst it is well to look forward, it is also advisable to inspect our existing surroundings, to see if there is a basis for our hope of a new and better day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To quote an American periodical of some years ago:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“There never was such a wonderful period. We never before knew so much, or could do so much. No part of the centuries that are gone was as glorious as this hour. The hundred years behind us are crammed with achievements that outbalance the sum total of progress since the signing of the Magna Charta. The average mechan</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ic </span><span class="font8">enjoys luxuries which the rich of other days could not command. The college freshman has more real information than the foremost scholar of the Reformation period. A mere hundred years ago, even the scientist </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font8">thought the atmosphere was simply space; gas was only </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">E- a </span><span class="font8">smell.

The only horse-power was four leg-</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font8"> ged, and wore a tail.

Electric lights, trolley-cars, bicycles, automobiles, department stores, skyscrapers, tinned salmon, airships, penny newspapers, appendicitis and power cranes are still infant </span><span class="font7">ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Impossibility is now an oldfashioned word </span><span class="font7">wiili </span><span class="font8">a definition, but not a meaning. Almost every dream of the past is a reality today. The magic cities, and fairy ■ kingdoms of your grandmother’s tales, are not half so wonderful as the world in which you live.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Do we rightly understand and appreciate the meaning of the wonderful inventions of our 'day? They are coming to us because we are living in the dawn of a new dispensation. They are the foregleams of an epoch so wonderful as to be beyond our most vivid imagination. Everything is getting ready for the Millennium. Not only is it coming some day, but it is at the door! We are not, indeed, enjoying its full blessifigs yet; only a foretaste of them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">all the families of the earth, not only those now. living, but those who are still in the bondage of death. It is sweet to realize that, in spite of the oft-repeated note of despair, “Not in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">our</span><span class="font10"> time,” there are millions of earth’s present inhabitants who will never die, but who will soon begin to regain mankind’s lost perfection, physically, mentally and morally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Inventions and improvements of today have served a useful purpose, but also they have had an effect quite the reverse. They have brought a mode of living which is far too hurried and unnatural. During the early years of the Golden Age, mankind will discard much of the presentday “rush,” and settle to a more even life. Probably cities and towns will lose much of their popularity, and the country villages will regain their former status to some extent. It is even likely that some articles, upon which machines are now employed will again be made by . hand; for work will then be a joy, not merely a necessity, as now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Our present commercialism, which does not allow the real love of labor to assert itself, will be destroyed, but from the wreck and ruin of the old world, all remoulded and glorified, shall appear the new heavens and the new earth. In- * stead of the degrading toil for the materials of existence, there will be the joy of being useful, either in making, distributing, supervising, or what not. There will then be no need to try to force anyone to abandon idleness, but everyone will be glad to ease the burden of others. “Thou things which the earth itself yields, and the ungrudging labor of mankind. Money will become obsolete, and its attendant evils with it; the earth will yield even more abundantly than now; and the present activities of a great percentage of the human race to provide for wars and strifes will then be turned toward bringing forth the sustenance of the earth for the mutual welfare of all.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">No one will be rich, and no one poor. Those upon whom poverty now lays its grasp have ■ only a feeble conception of the real pleasures of i life; when that happy day of freedom is in </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">fall </span><span class="font10">swing, they will hardly know how to take advantage of its benefits to the full, for fear of asking too much. Our employers of labor are not altogether to blame for the present degradation, for they, as well as the employes, are part of the worn-out system. When existing methods of commercial exchange, governed by money, have been proved to be what they really are— a sham— then will be seen just wherein lies the true wealth of the world, i. e., in the bountiful </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">761</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">“Adam and Eve in Eden were commanded to tend </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font8">dress the Garden. In their unfallen state their </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">labor </span><span class="font8">was recreation and joy combined. So it will </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">be in </span><span class="font8">Paradise Regained. Christ will have redeemed the world from the bondage of sin, and will bring back </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">earth to its Edenic beauty. Then shall we read, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font8">never before, the love of God in all the unfoldings </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font8">nature, in every balmy breeze, every fruitful tree, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font8">every fragrant flower.

<p><span class="font10">The homes of the coming age will not be jerry-built; they will*be solid and enduring, and an adornment to the earth itself. The atmosphere will become pure and free from the grime which today spoils the landscape. The sordidness of many of our buildings would make God’s lovely flowers and green fields and bright sunshine feel ashamed, were they capable of sense.</span></p>

But some day not far distant, in that renewed earth, he will see. The deaf ones, though blessed with eyesight to view the beauties of the world, never hear its melodies. The hu- y man voice sweet and musical, nor the song of | the birds, they hear not; but in that day these &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">things in their grandeur shall be theirs. The &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S'</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">No prisons, lunatic asylums, nor work i houses will then mar the relationship of one to another. They will no longer be needed. There will be no longer the fear of going through life and fulfilling the obligations of society, and ending one’s days away from rela-fives and friends, under the wing of chhrity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Each individual will have thrown away the distrust of others which now mars life; he will find it easier to live in mutual confidence then under the new order, than under the present system of fear. The happy relationships of that time will call forth the divine qualities of <sup>7 </sup>forgiveness and mercy in each heart, and the <sub>? </sub>best constructions will be placed upon the words and actions and attitude of others, in- ' stead of the worst.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The dwellers in those abodes will be happy and contented. They will not be afraid of one another. No lines of care will mark their foreheads, and they will be of fine physique. They will love the earth, and the beauties of nature, and, as Ezekiel puts it, “they shall sleep in the woods.” The animals will be in subjection to them—their willing, gentle and obedient servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The sickness which besets humanity now will be banished. Every disease will be swept away, and to all eternity decay and death shall never invade the land. The ills and pains of mortality will then be in the past. No more tearful eyes, no sorrow or pain; for the former things have passed away. In that blessed era, life unending shall be man’s portion, animating all nature, flowing from the great Author of life, sweeping away sorrow and sighing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Deafness and blindness and infirmity, those misfortunes which so often meet our eyes and draw out our sympathy, will then be no more. Many a blind man has gone through life disconsolate and sad because he could not view the golden sunrise and sunset, because he could</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The people will not endeavor to keep just within the pale of rectitude for fear of punishment; but their lives will be real. The commercial arrangements of that time will not be held together by specious lies, but will be based upon truth and justice. The standards of honor and public esteem will differ vastly from now. Success in cheating one’s neighbors, as a road to renown, will have been closed forever. Capital punishment will be abolished, and so will the necessity for it. <sub>i</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The code of rules upon which mankind will place their seal will be in striking contrast to the ferocious criminal laws of the Middle Ages, which have come down in some measure to our own. Men then seemed to enjoy tormenting their fellowmen, and they thought of their God as a fiend of torment, and a jailor, rather than a wise, just and loving Father. We are as- • sured that in the coming age God’s character will be cleared of the vile slanders which even His professing children have heaped upon His name in past centuries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">life will then be restored, and the home religion, too, when family circles, long sundered by* the hand of death, are again united. One writer, has expressed it: “Through the whole community the influence of a Christian home spreads. The town seems purer, the birds sing more sweetly, the flowers bloom more radiantly. Joy sings its anthems in such a home, as it sings in no other place.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All the faculties of the human mind will be developed there. There will be no enterprise into which mankind can enter that will be too great to be carried forward to completion. As the ages of eternity unfold there will never be any fear that the years to come will bring to an end the happiness of God’s creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The apostle Paul has referred to these happy times. After speaking of the selecting of the church from amongst mankind, he says: “And this is in harmony with God’s merciful purpose for the government of the world, when the times are ripe for it—the purpose which He has cherished in His own mind of restoring the whole creation to find its one head in Christ.”—Ephesians 1: 9,10, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Weymouth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-variant:small-caps;">T</span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">he news from Lithuania is that Catholic priests are going amongst the people, robbing them of money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There was an occurrence of that kind in a town near here. One woman (she is likened to a nun) received $20,000 from her brother in America. She went over to the priest and told him about it. The priest then said to her: “Give your home away to the poor [this woman owned a home] and keep the money you have with you; for tonight at 12 o’clock the Lord God, an angel and two apostles, will come to take you to heaven.” This woman went home, gave her house to a tenant, telling what would happen to herself—that she would be carried to heaven the same night at 12 o’clock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The ...tenant went and notified the police of what she had been told. The police came and hid themselves in the house, to await developments. At midnight the priest disguised as God, wtth false long hair, a white beard, white 'robes with a red scarf across the shoulders, came ni, accompanied by an “angel,” dressed in while with large white wings, and two “apos-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Truly the poet has said:</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">ties” robed in white. They came at the appointed hour with candles, took the money from the woman, and proceeded to carry her out, when the police came from their hiding place. The priest, who was disguised as God, and the organist as the angel, were caught, the two men who impersonated the apostles escaping. Now God and the angel are being paraded from place to place, to show the people what is being done in Lithuania by religionists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are many happenings of this kind, regarding which I will write you later. I enclose a newpaper account of the above incident— taken from a Lithuanian weekly. There is a slight discrepancy between the two accounts, however, as is usual in newspaper reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“In the vicinity of Suvalki the police caught </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font8">and confined him in a cage, shot the angel’s </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">wing off </span><span class="font8">and cut the devil’s tail off. The whole thing </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">happened </span><span class="font8">in the following manner: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Over in America there died a brother </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of a certain </span><span class="font8">devotee to whom a large sum of money </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font8">sent </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">after </span><span class="font8">the brother’s death. Naturally, she deposited the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">money </span><span class="font8">in the bank. The city bandits, however, laid plans </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">how ,</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">to get the money from her. First of all, a bandit appeared to her in the garb of an angel, who announced that her brother was suffering in hell and that the next day God and the devil would appear in her presence to discuss the matter. He furthermore said: 'If, therefore, you wish to release your brother from hell torment, take your money out of the bank and bring it home. When God will appear, hand the money over to him; and he, in your presence, will hand the money over to the devil, who will then release your brother.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The devotee heartily agreed. The next day all three of them came to her, namely, God, the devil, and the angel. As soon as God stepped into the house, he made the sign of the cross and blessed the devotee, who prostrated herself before him, and awaited further instructions. Following a brief benediction, God propounded </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">question to her: 'Did you bring the money from the bank?’ To this she replied that the bank was unable </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font8">pay her money.

But at this juncture, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">fortunately, </span><span class="font8">the militia, who all this time were concealed in. the house, caught God, and wounded the angel, who </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font8">making every effort to escape. The only one who </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">es</span><span class="font8">caped was the devil! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“God was decorated in a white beard, and dressed </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">in ' a </span><span class="font8">white robe, which was covered with a </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">red </span><span class="font8">one, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">with , a </span><span class="font8">blue mantle over all of this. The devil’s garment </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">was .. </span><span class="font8">made of oxhide.

<p><span class="font8">“Behold! what darkness still prevails </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font8">Lithuania, governed by the priests, and how the refuse of mankind ' endeavors to make use of that darkness.

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">HERE </span><span class="font10">is </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">wide-spread Anglo-Israelite propaganda, both in Great Britain and in America, teaching that the Jews never returned from the Babylonian captivity, in fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies to that effect; teaching that this return is an unfulfilled prophecy which must be fulfilled in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Prominent among their exponents is one who has written a book called “Judah’s Sceptre,” etc. In this book the statement is made that “not a word of history, sacred or profane, shows -that any tribe of the ten tribes, or remnants of tribes, of those pre-Samaritans, the children of Israel, who composed the Northern J</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">^pg</span><span class="font10">dojn, have ever returned to and dwelt in their 'former . home.”—Page 109.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This is a very strong statement, incapable proof. In fact, it is an utter falsehood proven to be false from the Scriptures. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Let </span><span class="font10">employ some passages of Scriptures </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and seg &amp;</span></p>

They claim that as the ten tribes never saw Babylon, therefore they could not return from - Babylon, forgetting that the term Babylon t means the empire (including the old Assyrian <sub>;</sub> Empire) as well as the city. Therefore the ten tribes were in Babylon (the empire), and i all who chose to do so did return to Palestine, r 2. They claim that the Northern Kingdom । was composed of ten tribes. This is not so, ex? actly; for the tribe of Levi left them and went f to Jerusalem united with Judah and Benjamin, i? thereby making three tribes in the Southern Kingdom and leaving only nine tribes in the t Northern Kingdom, to be lost. Where are the ten ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">n . Fausett, in his Bible Commentary, says: | “Therefore there were only nine tribes and not | all of those, wholly remaining to the Northern I Kingdom.” See Joshua 19:1, 9; 2 Chronicles K 11:10; 28:18; also 2 Chronicles 10:17; 11:16, 17'; 15: 9; 30: 25; 31: 6; 34: 9 to prove that fc many members of the nine northern tribes left and joined forces with Judah.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Ezra 7:7 says that there went up with Ezra some of the children of Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Ezra 7:13 says that the king’s decree was given to Aim them of the people of Israbl ... in the realm (Babylonian-Medo-Persian Empire, including the old Assyrian Empire).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Ezra 6:17 teaches that twelve he-goats were offered as a sacrifice according to the number of the tribes of Israel (represented in the return from captivity).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Ezra 8; 35 speaks of twelve bullocks being offered as a burnt offering for all Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Nehemiah 7:73 says: “When the seventh month came [after the return from the captivity] the children of Israel were in their cities. all Israel dwelt in their cities.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Josephus, writing of that period after the captivity, said: “The cities [of Palestine] lie very thick. The very least of them contain about 15,000 inhabitants.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Dr. Pusey, writing of the period of the Maccabees, said: “We find Palestine containing millions of Israelites again.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We learn from this array of evidence that during the captivity the twelve tribes lost their tribal and nationalistic division and were amalgamated as one people having one common bond —their religion. We learn that all who cared returned to Palestine, rebuilt their temple and city and restored their sacrifices; that it was a restoration (as prophesied) as far as the people met the God-imposed conditions of the prophecies, which was only partially.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark84"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark85"></a>Theology of Jewry, 30 A. D. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By Homer E. Walden</span></h3>
<p><span class="font16">A</span><span class="font10"> BRIEF description of the three prominent Jewish sects of our Lord’s day follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">' ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE ESSENES</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Th<sub>g</sub>, Essenes -were an exclusive society, dis-/ tinguished from the rest of the Jewish nation ,, • in Palestine by an organization peculiar to &quot;&nbsp;themselves and by a theory of life in which a gj- sever^hsceticism and a rare benevolence to one |[l another and to mankind in general were the Kt most striking characteristics. They had fixed F 5 ttjfes for initiation, a succession of strictly sepa-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">rate grades within the limits of (lie society, and regulations for the conduct of their daily life even in its minutest details. Their membership could be recruited only from the outside world, as marriage and all intercourse with woman were absolutely renounced. They were the first society in the world to condemn slavery both in theory and practice. They enforced and practised the most complete community of goods. They chose their own priests and public officebearers, and even their own judges. Though their prevailing tendency was practical, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">the tenets of the society were kept a profound secret, it is perfectly clear from the concurrent testimony of Philo and Josephus that they cultivated a kind of speculation which not only accounts for their spiritual asceticism, but indicates a great deviation from the normal development of Judaism, and a profound sympathy with Greek philosophy, and probably also with Oriental ideas. At the same time we do our Jewish authorities no injustice in imputing to them the patriotic tendency to idealize the society, and thus offer to their readers something in Jewish life that would bear comparison at least with similar manifestations of gentile life. They imbibed Greek (Platonic) philosophy.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THE SADDUCEES</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Josephus defines the tenets of the Sadducees thus: They deny the existence of God, and claim that everything lies in our own power, so that we are responsible for our good or bad fortune.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Sadducees do away with destiny altogether and set God beyond the possibility of punishing or supervising men. They deny the immortality of the soul and the punishments and rewards of hades. They were the infidels of their age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THE PHARISEES</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">-sS</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">When Alexander came to the throne (B. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">C. </span><span class="font10">103) the Pharisees were the real rulers and imposed upon the people the deductions from the written Law which formed the growing body of their oral tradition. The reign was long enough to establish this tradition in respect of ritual; and even when this golden age—as it seemed to later scribes—was over, they exercised a paramount influence upon the common people. They had learned to read God’s will in the events of history and deduced, for example, the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead. Bible scholars of today agree with their findings on this important subject, realizing that it is impossible to harmonize the heathen and widely prevalent theory of the inherent immortality of man with the Bible doctrine of a resurrection of the dead. There is a world of true philosophy in Martha’s simple statement regarding her dead brother, “I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”—John 11: 24.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">rj~n With issue Number 60 we began running Judge Rutherford's new book, |( | [I &quot;The Harp of God”, with accompanying questions, taking the place of both ergfc Advanced and Juvenile Bible Studies which have been hitherto published.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>105</sup>Before the blessing promised could come to the peoples of earth, the seed which was promised must first come. The Israelites, otherwise called Jews, therefore expected that one of the natural descendants of Abraham would become their king and that through that king and his kingdom all the nations of the earth would be blessed by receiving the benefits first given to them. For this reason the faithful Jews looked forward with great expectancy to the birth of the one who was to be their king. They based their hopes upon the repeated promise made by Jehovah. Without doubt it was thought by some that Isaac, the son of Abraham, would be the one through whom the blessing would come. “After the death of Abraham, God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi.” (Genesis 25:11) When Isaac was about sixty years old there were born to him and his wife Rebekah two sons, twins, who were named by them Esau and Jacob.—Genesis 25: 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>10G</sup>Isaac then went to live in the land of the Philistines, and while there, God said to him: “Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee: for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; and I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.” (Genesis 26:3, 4) Thus the Abrahamic promise was renewed to Isaac. Before the death of Isaac, he pronounced his blessing upon his son Jacob, and Jacob thereby became the successor of his father to the Abrahamic promise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>10T</sup>Under the rule of descent, the firstborn or eldest son was the heir of the father’s estate and any other rights or privileges that went ’ with that estate, unless for some cause there . should be an exception to the rule. Esau having been born a few moments before his brother Jacob, Under the operation of this rule would be the successor to the Abrahamic promise and - heir to his father. His birthright, therefore. 4 Would include the promise made to Abraham. ?NBut the Lord clearly indicated that there should be an exception to the rule in this case and that Jacob should be the heir and not Esau. When it was known that the mother would bear two sons, just before the time of their birth Rebekah the mother inquired of the Lord concerning the expected children; and the Lord said unto her that two sons would be born to her and that the elder should serve the younger-(Genesis 25:22, 23) This definitely $hows that it was God’s purpose that Jacob, who was bom last, should be the heir and successor to the Abrahamic promise.</span></p>

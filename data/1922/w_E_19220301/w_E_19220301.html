<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">THIS JOURNAL AND ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS journal </span><span class="font7">la </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">one of the prime </span><span class="font7">factors </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font7">instruments in the system of Bible instruction, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">or &quot;Seminary Extension”, now being </span><span class="font7">presented in ail parts of the civilized world by the Watch Tower. Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, chartered A. D. 1S84, “For the Promotion of Christian Knowledge”. It not only serves as a class room where Bible students may meet in the study of the divine Word but also as a channel of communication through which they may be reached with announcements of the Society’s conventions and of the coming of its tiaveling representatives, styled “Pilgrims”, and refreshed with reports of its conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our “Eerean Lessons” are topical rehearsals or reviews of our Society’s published Studies most entertainingly arranged, and very helpful to ail who would meut the only honorary degree which the Society accords, viz., FerM </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Dei Minister</span><span class="font7"> (V. D. M.), which translated into English is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Munster of God's</span><span class="font7"> IJ'oid. Our treatment of the International Sunday School Lessons is specially for the older Bible students and tench<sup>0</sup>.s. By some this featuie is considered indispensable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This journal stands firmly for the defense of the only true foundation of the Christian’s hope now being so generally repudiated —redemption through the precious blood of “the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ransom</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> [a </span><span class="font7">corresponding price, a substitute] for all”. (1 Peter 1:33; 1 Timothy 2 . G) Building up on this sure foundation the gold, silver and precious stones (1 Corinthians 3: Ills ; 2 Peter 1 : 5-11) of the Word of God, its further mission is to “make all see what is the fellowship of the mystery which . . .has been hid in God, ... to the intent that now might be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of God”—“which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed”.—Ephesians </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">3:5-9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It stands free from all parties, sects and creeds of men, while it seeks more and more to bring its every utterance into fullest subjection to the will of God in Christ, as expressed in the ho'y Scriptures. It is thus free to declare boldly whatsoever the Lord hath spoken—according to the divine wisdom granted unto us to understand his utterances. Its attitude is not dogmatic, but confident; for we know whereof we atlhm, treading with implicit faith upon the sure promises of God. It is held as a trust, to be used only in his service; hence our decisions relative to what may and what may not appear in its columns must be according to our judgment of his good pleasure, the teaching of his Word, for the upbuilding of Ills peonle m grace and knowledge. And we not only invite but urge our readers to prove all its utterances uy the infallible Word to which refereme is constantly made to facilitate such testing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the church is “the temple of the living God”, peculiarly &quot;his workmanship” ; that its construction has been in progress throughout the gospel ace—ever since Christ became the wo:Id's r.cdoemer and the Chief Corner Stone of his temple, through which, when Liiii-Iicd. Gods blessing shall &lt;orue “to all people”, and they find access to him.—1 Corinthians 3: 1G, 17; Ephesians 2:20-22; Genesis 2S:14 , Gaiananr 3'29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That meantime the chiseling, shaping, and polishing of consecrated believers in Christ’s atonement for sin, progresses; and when </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">last of the'-e “living stone' ', “elect and precous,” shall have been made icady, the great Master Woikman will bring all together in the fust resurrection . am! the temple shall ne tilled with his glory, and be the meeting place between God and men throughout toe Millennium—Revelation 15.5-S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the basis of hope, for the church and the world, lies in the fact that “Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">every </span><span class="font7">man,” “a ransom for all,” and will be “the true light which bghteth </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">every man that cometh into the world”,</span><span class="font7"> “in due time”.— Hebrews 2:9, John 1 9; 1 Timothy 2 5, G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the hope of the church is that she mav be like her Lord, “see him as he is,” be “partakers of the divine nature’,’ and share his gloiy as his joint-hcu—1 Jolin 3 J, John 17.24, Romans b.17, 2 I’eter 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the present mission of the church is the perfecting of the saints for the future work of service: to develop in herself every giace , to be God s witness io the woild , and to picpaic to be kings and priests in the nest age.—Ephesians 4:12; Matthew 24: 3 1 , Revelation 1 : G . 20 , 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That the hope for the world lies in the blessings of knowledge and opportunity to be brought to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font7"> by Christ’s Millennial kingdom, the restitution of all that was lost In Adam, to all tne willing and obedient at the bands of their Redeemer and his glonhed church* when all the wnlfully vvi'cked v.ill be </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Uc^lioyed.—</span><span class="font7">Acts 3:19-23; Isaiah 33.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark7"></a>WHO IS WISE?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.&quot;—Psalm 90:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">W</span><span class="font10">ISDOM is one of the divine attributes. Divine wisdom always operates in exact harmony with justice and love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">According to the world, wisdom is the possession of common sense and the using thereof in a skillful manner to accomplish the end in view. This is not the kind of wisdom that is always profitable. It is not the wisdom which the Psalmist here mentions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The proper kind of wisdom is knowledge applied in </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">manner that will result in the greatest amount of good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is a wide distinction between knowledge and wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Knowledge is that which is gained by instruction, by enlightenment or learning. Knowledge is usually the result of storing the mind with the thoughts of other men. It is a material with which wisdom builds. Knowledge often makes one proud that he has learned so much and therefore knows more than others. Knowledge when applied according to worldly wisdom more often than otherwise produces pride, haughtiness and love for self; hence turns the heart in an unwise course. One who has acquired some knowledge and uses that knowledge in a wise way is humble of mind. One may be a learned person and yet be very unwise. Men of great reading who have filled their minds with w’hat other men have said or written are said to be learned. But it does not follow at all that such are wise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For instance, it is quite the usual thing for the clergy of our day to be termed learned men, i.e., men who have read all about the history of the world, about the sayings of other men both ancient and modern. When they apply this learning in an unwise course, these learned men become higher critics and infidels or agnostics concerning God’s Word. It was not the knowledge that hurt them, but the application of knowledge according to the worldly standard and not according to the divine standard. Such have become worldly-wise. These Ty Wisdom know not God’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The text under consideration is a part of a prayer of Moses, the meekest of the meek. To be meek means to be teachable, having a sincere desire to be led in the right way that good may result. In gaining wisdom the heart is involved. The heart is that faculty of the being which induces action. It is the seat of motive and the seat of affection. To become wise, then, means that the heart must be pure. It must be unselfish and action must be induced by love for God, for his truth, for righteousness, and for his holy arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">THE BEGINNING OF WISDOM</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Because of man’s imperfection resulting from inheritance of the effects of father Adam’s wrongful course, man is not naturally wise. Wisdom must be acquired. Some are born with greater endowments for the acquiring of wisdom than others. Comparatively few of the human race have ever followed the course of wisdom. The god of this uoild (Satan) has blinded the mass of mankind by false philosophy, false sophistries, pride, ambition, false and faithless religion, and by various other improper means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Psalmist v rites: “The fear [reverence] of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom”. (Psalm 111:10) Obedience to the Lord leads to greater wisdom. Before one can begin to grow wise he must believe that Jehovah is God and is the rew’arder of them that diligently seek him; that his ways are right and his Word is truth. Moses plainly showed that such was his condition of heart. He extolled Jehovah and worshiped him in sincerity and truth. He contrasted the greatness of Jehovah vith the smallness of man.—Psa. 90: 1-G, 16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">FALSE WISDOM</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To be cunning, crafty, or wily, is not to be wise: and yet this is what the world generally understands as wisdom. Knowledge unwisely applied leads to disaster. Knowledge wisely applied leads to joy and life eternal. This divine rule and its results are strikingly set forth in the Word of God. Lucifer has applied his knowledge in a wrongful way. The Logos applied his knowledge in a wise way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Lucifer was a creature of unusual ability and clothed with some power, as the Scriptures show. He must have possessed the knowledge of how the human race would be propagated and in due time populate the earth. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font10">knew it was the will of God that man should have </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">do</span><span class="font10">minion over the earth and be a glory to his Creator. Had his heart been right he would have applied his knowledge in a wise way and would have gladly obeyed the divine vill, and his action would have been m harmony theievith. But it is written of him that he had a bad heait; that ni Ins heart he meditated a usurpation of God's authority and set about to usurp that authonty.—Isaiah 14:12-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The condition of heart thereby exhibited by him caused Jehovah to change his name from Lucifer to Satan, the dragon, the serpent, and the devil; dragon meaning devotner, Satan opposer or adversary, serpent deceiver, and devil slanderer. He has since been the violent opponent of Jehovah, has attempted to counterfeit every part of the divine plan, and has applied his knowledge to carry out his selfish and wrongful schemes. Establishing a false religion as a counterfeit of the true and seizing the governments of earth, he became the god of this world. Hence the wisdom that is of the world is unrighteous and devilish and contrary to the divine wisdom.—1 Corinthians 1:21-24; 2 Corinthians 4:3,4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TRUE WISDOM</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The beginning of God’s creation was the Logos. He is the connecting link between Jehovah and all of his creation. His knowledge necessarily surpasses that of all creatures because he is the active agent of God who created all tilings that have been created. In every way the Logos has used this knowledge wisely. His heart being always pure toward Jehovah, it is always his delight to do Jehovah’s will. Because he has always done that which is pleasing in the Father’s sight, his name is used as a synonymous term for w isdom. Being in the form of God, he did not permit a selfish desire in his heait to cause him to usurp any part of the dominion or glory of God; but with delight, and in obedience to his Father's holy will, he divested himself of heavenly glory and honor and became a man, alike in form and nature to sinful men of earth, yet without sin. It was humiliating to become the associate of such vile, imperfect creatures as humankind; yet he loved mankind because he desired to do them good in harmony with his Father’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As a man his knowledge was limited to the sphere of a perfect human being. At the time of his baptism in the Jordan the heavens (higher things) were opened unto him. He learned the divine purpose that he should be the Redeemer of the human race and gather unto himself a bride, the church, and in due time destroy Satan’s power and influence and restore the humankind to that which was lost. To accomplish this he saw that it meant to him suffering and death; yet he said: “I delight to do thy will, 0 my God; thy law is written in my heart”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When hungry, worn and weary after his long fast, Satan appeared unto him and tried to induce Jesus to us his knowledge and energy in an unwise and improper way. This Jesus spurned, declaring his purpose to be guided by the Word of God, as it is written. He did this because his heait was pure. He loved the Father and the Father loved him. Applying his heart wisely, then, he determined to be and was faithful unto death. This faithfulness subjected him to reproach, to slander, to abuse, to wicked persecution and ignominious death. These things were heaped upon him by Satan and his emissaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Was Jesus a learned man? As the world know’s learning, he was not. He never had attended a theological school. No human institution had conferred upon him the title of doctor, or any other title; and this was one of the excuses for heaping abuse upon him and for the charges leveled against him by the Pharisees. Because of his natural endowments, and because he was filled with the holy spirit, his knowledge far exceeded that of the men of learning of his time. The doctors of the law and the inters of the Jews knew- the text of the Scriptures, but they did not apply such knowledge to make them wise. Jesus knew the text and without doubt possessed the wisdom that came from properly applying the knowledge. He did not boast of his great learning, or of his -wisdom, as did the Pharisees and others of the so-called learned Jews. He gave all credit to his Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At a feast of tabernacles in Jerusalem Jesus appeared in the temple and taught the people. Imagine how these worldly-wise Pharisees and doctors and scribes must have scowled and manifested a displeasure because of this unlearned one (according to their standard) teaching. They said: “How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?’’ Suppose Jesus had been unwise like his adversaries. He would have boasted of his own learning. But possessing and exercising divine wisdom, he said: “My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, wfliether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory; but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.” (John 7:16-18) Again: “The word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father’s which sent me”.—John 14: 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is written: “To obey is better than sacrifice”. (1 Samuel 15:22) Jesus made the supreme sacrifice of himself and that was pleasing to Jehovah; but that which was most pleasing to Jehovah was the complete obedience of his beloved Son. Jesus knew from the beginning of his earthly ministry that the pathway before him was one of suffering. He went forward. He suffered from physical discomfort. He suffered by virtue going out from him while ministering to others. He was subjected to the greatest indignities at the hands of Satan’s instruments. He might have avoided all of these discomforts and might have exercised his power to destroy his enemies, but that would ha\e been an unwise course 6ecause it was the Father’s will that he should do otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">AVIion he reached the hour of his supreme suffering he did pray unto the Father: </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“0 my</span><span class="font10"> Father, if it he possible, let this cup pass from me: nevcitheless </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">not as I will,</span><span class="font10"> but </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">as Ikon. mil”.</span><span class="font10"> (Matthew 26: 39) God permitted his beloved Son to suffer. “Though he were a Son, yet learned lie obedience by the tilings which he suffered; and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.” (Hebrews 5:8.9) Thus is demonstrated the announced principle that obedience is more pleasing than sacrifice. Furthermore, this shows that the reverence of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom, and that full and complete obedience to Jehovah, even unto the greatest sacrifice, is the end or completion of wisdom. Hence it is written: “Wisdom is the principal thing”.—Proverbs 4:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TWO MASTERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are but two masters: The master of sin and death, Satan the devil; and the Master of truth, the Lord Jesus. This great contrast of the two is made in the Scriptures for the teaching of the people of God, that they might properly apply their hearts unto wisdom. Everything written is written for their learning. (Romans 15: 4) It follows, then, that every one is the servant of one or the other of these two masters. St. Paul writes: “Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?” (Romans 6:16) It is written: “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent” (John 17:3), “m whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge”.—Colossians 2:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To gain worldly knowledge and apply it according to the worldly manner may develop in one cunning and craftiness, but will lead to disaster. To have knowledge of God and Jesus and apply it in the wise way according to the divine standard leads to life and endless happiness. The Word of God is given for the instruction of men in the way that leads to wisdom and to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER EXAMPLES</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The children of Israel were God’s chosen people. Sometimes that nation pursued a wise course, but more often an unwise course. Had the Israelites been wise, they would have adhered strictly to the true religion, always recognizing Jehovah as the true God and joyfully obeying his commandments. They yielded, however, to the seductive. influence of the other master, Satan, and were led away in unwise paths, embracing a false religion and following after false gods. They had the promise of Jehovah that obedience would lead to endless blessings. (Exodus 19:5) Had their hearts been applied io wisdom they would have been obedient to their covenant; but they were not. Their rulers and teachers and leaders became wise after the Satanic order of wisdom, and led the masses into wrong paths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When Jesus came to his oven people he found that their teachers and i tilers claimed to be men of great learning, according to the world, and appropriated to themselves titles such as doctor, etc., and that they were self-centered, selfish, and wise in their own conceits. Their hearts were impure. For this leason Jesus did not choose any of them to be his disciples. Those whom he did choose wore men in oiduiaiy walks of life, fishermen and craftsmen. They had not attended theological schools. They were unlearned men according to the Pharisees’ standard; yet, with but one exception, they became wise men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Concerning Nathaniel, Jesus said: “'Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!” (Jolm 1:47) Thore was nothing about that Israelite that was cunning and wily and diplomatic. He was a humble and wise man. Because eleven of these did apply their hearts to wisdom, file Lord has made them mighty ones in his kingdom. Their earthly wisdom did not’help them at all, however, to get such exalted positions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">APPLIED UNTO WISDOM</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">St. Stephen is an example of one who applied his heart unto wisdom. He was not a learned man, but being full of faith and the spirit of the Lord, his arguments were so powerful that the debaters of the synagogue of the Libertines, the Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and them of Cilicia and of Asia, were not able to resist him. (Acts 6:9. 10) These worldly-wise clergymen thought they would soon squelch poor Stephen; but being unable to do it with their own knowledge, and their hearts being impure, the devil imparted to them his v isdom of cunning and wickedness and they sot about to destroy Stephen in that manner. They hired men to swear falsely against Stephen and caused him to be. arrested and brought before the supreme court of their land. In that august body sat what many supposed to be the men of greatest learning and wisdom in all Israel. Those worldly-wise doctors and judges heard the false witnesses testify against Stephen, wrongfully convicted him, and sent him to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Stephen’s heart was applied unto wisdom; and because of his faithful obedience to the Lord and the witnessing to his cause, the Lord granted him a vision at the moment of supreme test; and looking up into heaven, he said: “Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God”.—Acts 7: 56.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Sometimes a man of learning and knowledge concerning earthly matters becomes wise. Saul of Tarsus was a learned man, but not a wise man during the early part of his life. Doubtless he had an honest heart and his persecution of Christians was based upon the belief that he was doing right. In due time when the eyes of his understanding were opened and he applied his heart to pure wisdom, the Lord sent him forth as a special messenger to bear his name before the gentiles and kings and the children of Israel. (Acts 9:15) Thereafter his love and devotion were to the Lord and to his cause. He went forth as a humble messenger of the Lord and spoke in language that others could understand. He specially avoided using language that his hearers could not understand. (1 Corinthians 14:28) When he went to the friends to speak to them, or when he wrote an epistle to them, he did not expatiate about his great knowledge of Arabic, Sanskrit, Syriac, or any other language except the one they understood. He did not tell them what a great lawyer he was, or give them a lecture on criminal or medical jurisprudence. He did not come to them in the excellency of his own speech and parade his own learning before them; but on the contrary he said: “I am determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. . . . My speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit and of power; that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.” (1 Corinthians 2: 2-5) This is an example that all Christians would do well to follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">THE HIDDEN WISDOM</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is a temptation to man to exhibit his own learning before others. This is not a wise course. When we speak or write it should be in such phrase as can be understood by our hearers or readers, that they may be edified. It is quite probable that St. Paul was as learned as any member of the Jewish Sanhedrin; but he did not speak with the wisdom that they spoke with. On the contrary, he says: “We speak . . . not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to naught; but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory, which none of the princes [riders] of this world knew”. (1 Corinthians 2:6-8) The princes of this world did not have such wisdom because they had not the spirit of Christ. Their hearts were applied in the wrong direction. Their love was for the honor and plaudits of men. St. Paul applied his heart to wisdom, his love being for God and for Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There never was a man in this world who thought himself wise according to worldly wisdom but that was a fool in God’s sight, “because the foolishness of God is wiser than men”; “for it is written, . . . Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?” (1 Corinthians 1:19, 20, 25) The preaching of Christ in the eyes of the worldly-wise is foolishness; hence the higher critics deny God’s plan, deny Ins Word, and deny the great Redeemer. For this reason we see “that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called; but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the [worldly] wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to naught things that are; that no flesh should glory in his presence”.—1 Corinthians 1: 26-29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“NONE OF THE WICKED SHALL UNDERSTAND”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">More than five years have passed since Brother Russel died, and yet many of the so-called orthodox clergy continue to malign, slander and libel him. It is unusual to defame a man long after his death. When such a course of defamation is pursued there must a reason. What is that reason? Have m mind that there are but two masters, and that the name of one of these masters is the devil, which means slanderer; and his children do his will. (John 8: 44) On the other hand, if Brother Russell was a special servant of the Lord and rendered faithful service, then it would be expected that because of his faithfulness he would be persecuted by the offspring of the devil. Jesus said: “The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you.” (John 15: 20) It will bo disputed by some even who have come to a knowledge of present truth, that Brother Russell occupied any more peculiar relationship to the Lord than any other servant or follower of Jesus. In him vie find another example of one who applied his heart to wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">What was his peculiar relationship to the Lord, and why was and still is he the special target of the adversary? Let us examine the evidence here upon these points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Just before the crucifixion of our Lord he said to his disciples that he was going away and would return again and receive the faithful ones unto himself, that they might m due time be with him where he was going. From Pentecost forward Christians have looked for the return of our Lord. St. Paul expressed it as his greatest desire that the Lord might return and that he might be with him. He declared that at the Lord’s return he would not only reward St. Paul with a crown of righteousness, but likewise would grant a crown at that time to all who would love his appearing. Christians for </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">long time v aited and prayed and hoped for that blessed time to come. AH those who have been specially watching for it had the promise of a blessing, particularly those who should survive that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">God caused his holy prophets of old to write concerning the coming of the Messiah, but the prophets did not understand their own writings. It was not due time for them to understand. Would the time ever come when the true watchers would understand? Yes; God said </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">one of his holy prophets: “Go thy way, Daniel, for the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end. . . . None of the wicked shall understand; but the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">tbise</span><span class="font10"> shall understand.” (Daniel 12: 9, 10) The devil is that wicked one; and, as we have stated, his name signifies slanderer. If we find, then, some engaged m slandering and defaming the name of one who was striving to follow the Lord, and those who are engaged in this slandering do not understand the divine plan, it is easy to determine to which class they belong. If they were wise, they would understand and not scoff. If they are other than wise, they cannot understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">THE WISE SHALL UNDERSTAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Daniel the prophet is caused to utter the key words by which the “time of the end” may be definitely located. He wrote prophecy, which means that the spirit of Jehovah operating upon Daniel’s mind caused him to describe certain events that would take place in the future, and when these events come to pass such would be conclusive proof that the time foreshadowed by him had arrived. Daniel wrote in advance the history of several world powers from Babylon until the “time of the end”, which latter time he marked thus: </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“At the time of the end</span><span class="font10"> shall the king of the south push at him; and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over. He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.”—Daniel 11: 40, 41.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The fulfillment of this prophecy fixes the beginning of the “time of the end” because the prophecy .so states. The king of the south here mentioned refers to Egypt; while the king of the north refers to Great Britain, which was then an integral part of what had been the Boman empire. Napoleon, fighting his battles in Egypt, gained great victories; but at the same time the British, under the leadership of Lord Nelson, were making an effective attack upon Napoleon’s forces at sea. This campaign began in 1798 and Napoleon finished it and returned October 1, 1799. Therefore 1799 is marked as the beginning of the “time of the end”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Still another method is given by Jehovah to Daniel of fixing the beginning of that period of time. God caused Daniel to describe in symbolic phrase four great world powers, which are symbolized by the term “beast”; and the fourth beast is described as “dreadful and terrible”. The three component elements that go to make up the “dreadful and terrible beast” are, to wit: commercialism, professional politicians and apostate clergy, or ecclesiaslicism. This union took place amongst these component elements for the first time in. 539 A. D., at the time of the overthrow of the Ostrogothic monarchy, and was followed shortly by terrible persecution of Christians. The Lord showed Daniel that from the time of this union or formation of the “dreadful and terrible beast” to the “time of the end” would be 1260 years; thereby marking 1799 again as the date of the “time of the end”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mark now that the second appearing of the Lord is the chief thing discussed in Daniel’s prophecy in the twelfth chapter. The coming of the Messiah is the most blessed time for which Christians have looked forward. The Lord gave to Daniel the key by which it could be determined when that blessed time should begin. He caused him to write: “Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days”—symbolic days, or 1335 literal years. Counting the time, of course, from 539 A. D., the point from which the terrible beast began its operations, forward 1335 years, brings us to 1874, the blessed time for which the watchers were asked to wait. At this time the Lord was due to be present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Fulfilled prophecy consists of historical and physical facts, which are indisputable. Such facts never stultify themselves. While we have a line of Bible chronology showing the presence of the Lord due in 1874, even if wo did not have this the evidence given by fulfilled prophecy clearly marks the date of the Lord’s second presence. Having now in mind God’s unchangeable promise, that during the “time of the end” the wise should understand, and added to that the testimony of St. Paul that greater light would bo given to the watchers at the end of the age, it is to be expected that some one in the world, waiting and watching for the coming of the Lord, would be numbered among the wise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">KNOWN BY THEIR FRUITS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Like fulfilled prophecy, circumstantial evidence is one of the most conclusive ways of making proof of a question at issue. If, then, we find the circumstances around </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">certain person that exactly fit conditions foretold in prophecy, the fulfillment of the prophecy shows the time definitely; while the circumstances in connection therewith locate the person or persons in connection with the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There lived in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, in the early seventies a young man engaged in the mercantile business, by the name of Charles Taze Russell. He was fully consecrated to the Lord. He was not a learned man as the world terms learning. He was not a university graduate; yet he was a careful student and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font10"> diligent searcher for truth. Above all, he was applying his heart in the direction of knowing the Lord. He was taking a proper course in order to be wise. “By their fruits ye shall know them.” (Matthew 7: 20) While he watched and studied, waited and prayed, the Lord further illuminated his mind; and it was about 1875 when he became convinced of the second presence of the Lord, and in 1877 he wrote, published and widely distributed </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">booklet entitled “The Object and Manner of Our Lord’s -Return”. We believe without question that this was the first publication that ever announced the Lord’s second presence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In 1879 ho began the publication of The Watch Tower and Herald of Christ’s Presence, the subtitle expressing his confidence in the fact that the Lord was then present. Since then The Watch Tower has continued to be published regularly and is the only paper that has ever persistently and consistently announced the second presence of the Lord. Jesus said: “Howbeit, when the spirit of truth is come it will guide you into all truth”. (John 16:13) Fully consecrated to the Lord, begotten and anointed of the holy spirit, his heart devoted to the Lord, Brother Russell continued to search and write; and becoming convinced from an examination of the Bible that Jehovah has a divine plan which he is working out in an orderly way, in the year 1881 he wrote “Food for Thinking Christians”. In the same year he wrote “Tabernacle Shadows of the Better Sacrifices”. This was the first time that any student, as far as we know, had applied the types and shadows connected with the sacrifices of Israel at their proper place and showed how they foreshadowed the sin-offering on behalf of the world, and how the church in due time would have a part in that sin-offering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“SOME AN HUNDREDFOLD”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In 188G he wrote and published “The Divine Plan of the Ages”, Volume 1 of Studies in the Scriptures, a more elaborate and detailed statement of God’s great plan of salvation. In 1889 he wrote and published Volume 2 of this series, “The Time is at Hand,” explaining the “times and seasons”, the Bible chronology, the “times of the gentiles”, the parallel dispensations, etc. In 1891 he published series 3 of the Studies in the Scriptures, “Thy Kingdom Come,” clearly and fully explaining the prophecies relating to the coming of the Messianic kingdom, the time of the end, the cleansing of the sanctuaiy. the time of the harvest, the work of the harvest, the deliverance of the church and the restoration of Isiael.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In 1896 he published a small book on “What Say the Scriptures about Hell”, exposing the defamation that Satan had heaped upon Jehovah’s character, and removing fear and dread from hundreds of thousands of minds. In the same year he produced the booklet on the “Chart of the Ages”, explaining the ages and dispensations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In 1897 he wrote and published the fourth series of Studies-in the Scriptures, “The Battle of Armageddon,” foreshadowing the great trouble which has since come upon the world and which is now in progress. The same year he published,a small book on “What Say the Scriptures about Spiritism”, giving the Bible explanation of the so-called communication with the dead. The Lord had promised that “the path of the just is as the shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day”. The light continued to increase, because the “time of the end” was here and God v as fulfilling his promise that the wise should understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Because greater light was shining upon God’s Word, Satan was active in trying to blind the minds of God’s people, particularly their leaders. The evolution theory began to get a strong foothold in the churches and amongst the preachers. Higher criticism began to be rampant; and in 1898 Brother Russell wrote and published “The Bible versus the Evolution Theory”, thus exposing Satan’s attempt to destroy faith in the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In 1899 he wrote and published in Volume V of Studies in the Scriptures that wonderfully clear explanation of the “Atonement Between God and Man”, clarifying the philosophy of the ransom sacrifice and the sin-offering, and the witness and operation of the holy spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In 1900 he again wrote and published a small book on “Our Lord’s Return”, explaining the matter of Christ’s second presence in greater detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In 1904 he published the sixth of the series of Studies in the Scriptures, “The New Creation,” which deals with the call, begetting, anointing and development of the church, and the government and discipline in the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In 1914 he produced and published the Scenario of “The Photo-Drama of Creation”, which has had a tremendous circulation throughout the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He had written much in The Watch Tower and other publications which was afterward used m compiling the seventh of the series of Studies in the Scriptures, “The Finished Mystery,” which was published after his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">THE TIME OF THE HARVEST</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jesus said that the age would end with a harvest, at which time he would be present, and that he would then send forth his messengers to gather together his elect. (Matthew 13: 24-30; 24: 31) It is to be expected that the Lord would have some witness in the earth at the time of the harvest to make announcement of the fact of his presence and of the harvest. Here is some more circumstantial evidence which is proof conclusive; some more physical facts that speak louder than audible words, to wit: It was Brother Russell who announced the time of the harvest and the presence of the Master of the harvest. It was he who first went forth throughout the land crying out, ‘The harvest is here; go ye into the field and labor’. And thousands of others taking up the slogan joined in the proclamation of the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jesus plainly said that during the time of his presence he would have a faithful and wise servant whom he would use to give meat to the household (of faith) in due season. Every one today who has a knowledge of the divine plan of the ages must truthfully answer that he derived that knowledge from studying his Bible in connection with what Brother Russell wrote; that before such time he did not even know that God had a plan of salvation. Every person who today is rejoicing in the light of the truth of God’s Word realizes that the Lord brought to him that truth, unfolding it through the ministrations and work begun by Brother Russell shortly following the presence of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Was he a servant of the Lord? No one who knew him and who tells the truth can deny the fact that he was </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">servant, because he gave his time over to service. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font10">devoted all of his earthly possessions that others might gain a knowledge of God’s plan. He devoted his life from the time of his early manhood until his death </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font10">going throughout the earth serving others in the name of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A FAITHFUL AND WISE SERVANT</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Was he faithful? This question must be answered in the affirmative. Faithfulness means to follow loyally and constantly the course that one starts out to follow, viz., a devotion to the Lord and his cause. Never for one moment did he deviate from the faith once delivered to the saints. He put forth every power within him to remoie from the minds of the people the foul stain on Jehovah’s character placed there by Satan and his emissaries, many of which emissaries paraded before the people as representatives of Christ. He turned on a flood of light from the Word of God and “put the fire out of hell’’, giving its true, Scriptural meaning. He hold ioi th before the people that God is love and that Jesus is the express image of the Father, the great Redeemer </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font10"> man, the head of the church, the King of kings and Lord of lords. He made clear the philosophy of the ransom sacrifice and the sm-offiering. He preached consistently justification by faith through the blood of Christ alone; sanctification by the washing of the Word and follow mg in the footsteps of the Master. He made clear to searchers for truth the true relationship of the church to her Head and Master. He explained covenants and brought to light the true import of the Abrahamic promise and the restoration of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Two great truths had long been hid under the rubbish piled upon them by worldly-wise clergymen blinded by the adversary, namely, the Abrahamic promise and the restoration of man. God used Brother Russell to bring joy to millions of hearts by unearthing these great truths and bringing them again to light He was used to put into the minds of the people a clearer understanding of the divine arrangement than any man of modern times. And why ? The answer is, Because the Lord is present; the end of the age is here, and Jehovah is making true his promise that then the wise should understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">WISE TOWARD GOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Was he wise? As the world understands that word, particularly as defined by worldly clergymen, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">he was not.</span><span class="font10"> And thank God he was not. Had he possessed great worldly wisdom, such as that employed by his defamers, the Lord would never have used him. Be it noted that these so-called learned clergymen charge against him that he was not learned in the Greek and Hebrew. That charge is true. The facts demonstrate beyond a doubt that the majority of men who possess a knowledge of Greek and Hebrew take themselves too seriously. They begin to think they know so much that they must bring forth something startling to upset what somebody else has done. They depart from the Lord’s way and lean to their own understanding, contrary to his Word. (Proverbs 3:5, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">6) </span><span class="font10">They usually speak and write in such phrase that the ordinary mind cannot grasp it; and this they do hoping to magnify their own wisdom in the eyes of others. Because they believe they have greater wisdom than others they make statements in </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">dogmatic form, regardless of whether right or wrong, depending on the matter being swallowed by others because not able to fathom this supposed wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Satan takes advantage of these things and leads them into error deeper and deeper; and if they ever had any faith in God’s Word it is soon destroyed. They have taken the wrong course because of self-love, because of desire for approval by others, a desire to be thought great and wise. They have applied their hearts unto selfishness and have not applied them unto wisdom— not that the knowledge of Greek and Hebrew or </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">any </span><span class="font10">other learning is in itself wrong or detrimental. It becomes detrimental only when one permits himself to become wise in his own conceit by reason of possessing such knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Brother Russell was not that kind of man. His heart was completely devoted to the Lord. He realized his dependence upon the Lord and joyfully laid all of his burdens at the feet of Jesus. He numbered his days and applied his heart unto wisdom; and the Lord made him wise. Christ Jesus was made unto him wisdom. (1 Corinthians 1:30) To him was the promise fulfilled: “When the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth”.—John 16:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The indisputable facts, therefore, show that the “time of the end” began in 1799; that the Lord’s second presence began in 1874; that the harvest followed thereafter and greater light has come upon the Word of God. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font10">this connection, then, let us note the words of Jesus: “Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season? Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.” (Matthew 24: 45, 46) It must be conceded, then, that at the end ot the world, at the “time of the end”, during the presence of the Lord, during the harvest, he would have in the earth a servant who would be faithful and wise. The physical facts show that Brother Russell met every one of these requirements. This prophetic utterance, then, has been fulfilled. Therefore fulfilled prophecy, or physical facts, and the circumstantial evidence are conclusive proofs that Brother Russell filled the office of that faithful and wise servant. He applied his heart unto wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">EDUCATION NOT ALWAYS WISDOM</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Ever and anon some one, yielding to the seductive influence of the adversary, concludes that he must, because of his own construction of some Greek or Hebrew word, or something that he has found in secular history, overturn some teaching of the truth; and he is bound to exhibit his own wisdom to others, even though it upsets the faith and confidence of God’s people. Who would be interested in inducing any human being to take such a course that would result in injury to the faith of any of the Lord’s little ones ? Remember again that there are but the two masters, and that Satan the devil is interested in destroying all faith in God and in his Word. Let none of the Lord’s sheep become discouraged when these things arise. They will come periodically and they operate as tests to those who are consecrated unto the Lord. Let each one, then, consider how the Lord has led him and how the Lord has unfolded his truth at the end of the age, and witness these disturbances only as another evidence that the Lord is dealing lovingly with his own people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some will arise from time to time who dispute the chronology of the Bible, deny the presence of the Lord, deny the resurrection of the saints, deny the harvest period is here, and deny that the church is the bride of Christ, etc. They will base their conclusions largely upon human reasoning. This is not the wisdom that cometh from above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Let the indisputable physical facts, the fulfilled prophecy, forever put to silence those who would become wise in their own estimation. If we had no chronology at all, or if our calculations concerning chronology are wrong, yet fulfilled prophecy, circumstantial evidence, is proof conclusive of these great fundamental truths: the presence of the Loid, the harvest of the saints, the end of the world, and that the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Let each one who has the truth ask himself, From whence did I get it? He must answer, I obtained it by reading the writings of that faithful and wise servant who interpreted and unfolded to me the divine plan. Is it reasonable, then, that the Lord would use the agencies he has used during the past forty years to illuminate the minds of consecrated Christians and lead them along the way and then permit it to appear that all these agencies are fraudulent? It is wholly unreasonable. It is wholly unlike the Lord. Then let all who have obtained a knowledge neglect not the applying of their hearts to the acquiring of wisdom by filling their minds again and again with the precious truths contained in the Studies tn the Scriptures and other writings of that faithful and wise servant; and by devoting themselves to the Lord and to his cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In our next issue w'o will have something to say about the practical application of the hearts of God’s people unto wisdom.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark9"></a>DECENTLY AND IN ORDER</span></h3>
<p><span class="font4">A</span><span class="font10"> LETTER from one of the consecrated states that in the Berean class the leader oftens reads a question, several answer it, and then pass questions back and forth between each other. When the leader starts to speak some talkative sister interrupts him and docs most of the talking. The question is then asked, How should a Berean lesson be conducted?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Apostle admonishes us to do everything decently and in order. Occasionally a sister is found in the class who is zealous, yet who talks too much, meaning well, but who does not act wisely, creates disorder in the class and prevents others from having a proper opportunity of expressing their thoughts. The correct way to conduct a Berean lesson is this: After opening with devotional service, the leader should propound the question and call upon certain ones for answer, not always the same ones, of course. Where there are as many as fifteen in the class, the leader may call on four or five to express their views briefly, and then, give those opportunity to speak who have not spoken and who desire to speak. No one should be permitted to speak twice upon the same question, unless there is some special reason why the chairman should grant the privilege. Then the leader should briefly sum up, and while he is stating his thoughts he should not be interrupted by any one. Members of the class should address themselves to the chairman when propounding a question and not to other members of the class. It is manifestly unjust for one or two to attempt to do all the talking, and the leader should not permit this, but firmly, yet kindly, say: ‘We will have one speak at a time and speak only once on each question’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After the leader has summed up briefly, then he may call on some one in the class to read the printed comment pertaining to the question at issue. One question finished, then another should be taken up in an orderly way; and so on, throughout the lesson.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“WE HAVE NO SUCH CUSTOM”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">UE ST ION: </span><span class="font10">In a praise, prayer and testimony meeting where one arises to give a testimony is it necessary to address the chairman before speaking by saying, Dear Brother A, and then proceed with the testimony ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font10"> Such formality is not at all necessary. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font10">testimony meeting is not a political meeting or business meeting that requires such formality; but the leader should encourage every oue to testify who desires to v ith the least formality possible. When one arises to testify the leader may recognize him merely by a nod of the head, if there are a number present, or by merely calling his name if </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font10"> small company; and then the one so recognized should proceed with his or her testimony. Such formalities as addressing the chair should not be required in any class. All speaking should be spontaneous and from the heart, having a desire to grow in grace and build up one another on the most holy faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“IN JESUS”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font10"> In The Watch Tower for May 15, page 153, col 2, par. 2, the statement was made, ‘‘the expression ‘in Jesus’ is not found in the Scriptures,” and I am wondering how this compoits with the passage in Ephesians 4:21, which speaks of “truth in Jesus”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font10"> The question is well taken. The statement in the Watch Tower referred to is technically wrong; for the expression “in Jesus” does occur in the passage cited, as also in Romans 3: 26—“the justifier of him that hath faith </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">in Jesus”.</span><span class="font10"> But, we submit, there is no statement of Scripture which says that one individual is m another individual; and that is the subject of the paragraph referred to. This limitation could have been better stated than left to be understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The New Testament writings also malm use of such eipiessions as: “the spirit of life </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font10"> Christ </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus” </span><span class="font10">(Romans 8:2); “redemption </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font10"> Christ </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus”</span><span class="font10"> (Romans 3:24); “patience of hope </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font10"> our Lord </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus” </span><span class="font10">(1 Thessalonians 1:3); etc. These are all understandable. But even as regards individuals the Bible speaks of “the sanctified in Christ Jesus” (1 Corinthians 1: 2), “the faithful in Christ Jesus” (Ephesians 1: 1), “helpers m Christ Jesus” (Romans 16:3), etc. These must be understood in harmony with the facts. As we have been “baptized into Jesus Christ” ((into subservience to him who is the Head over his anointed body) (Roman 6: 3), so we “are in Christ Jesus” (in the anointed body over which Jesus is the Head) (1 Corinthians 1:30), and consequently “all one in Christ Jesus”.— Galatians 3:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Greetings in the Lord Jesus” or “in Christ Jesus” would be perfectly proper, since they signify ‘in the name of the Lord Jesus’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">AT HOME IN THE BODY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font10"> What does the Apostle mean by the expression in 2 Corinthians 5: 6, “While we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font10"> His meaning is apparent from the context. The following words give us the reverse of the thought which is in verse 6. Verse 8 speaks of being absent from the body and at home with the Lord. Manifestly the one statement describes the condition beyond the vail when our dwelling place will be heavenly; with equal clearness verse 6 speaks of our present dwelling place or condition as being earthly. The localized meaning of the words “at home” as referring to a comfortable feeling cannot be forced into this passage; and nothing is gained if it is. The passage becomes perfectly simple if “at home” is read ‘dwelling’ or ‘housing’, and this is the basic meaning of the Greek text. Word for word the Greek reads: “Knowing that indwelling in-the body we-are-out-dwelling away-from the Lord, . . . and we-are-pleased rather to-be-out-dwelling out of the body and in-dwelling in-the-presence of-the Lord”. Now a third thing is present which fills up our lives in this camping-out condition, and that is: “Weare-ambitious whether in-dwelling or out-dwelling, wellpleasing to-him to-be”. That is, while we are camping out m a tent we are, naturally, not in our eternal home; this is the time for the hope but not the fulfillment. But when we are in the heavenly home we shall not be in a tent; for “flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God”. “For indeed we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened; not for that we would be unclothed, but that we would be clothed upon, that what is mortal be swallowed up of life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ELECT AND VERY ELECT</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font10"> Do the Scriptures use the terms “elect” and “very elect” in contrast with each other, as signifying the great company and little flock?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font10"> A double usage of the word very in the English language has given occasion for the playful employment of it among many of our readers in a way not supported by the Greek text at all. The passage which speaks of ‘deceiving if it were possible the very elect’ (Matthew 24:24) signifies merely ‘deceiving if it were possible </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">even</span><span class="font10"> the elect’. Jesus spoke of the ‘very hairs of our heads being numbered’. Docs anyone think for a moment that our Master meant by those words to teach that there are </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">hairs</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">very hairs,</span><span class="font10"> differing in variety and kind from each other? Certainly not. He merely meant: ‘Even the hairs of your head are numbered’. There can be no purpose whatever served by a using of the expression “the very elect” as though it meant something different from the elect; for such </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font10">not the case.—See Mark 13: 22.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">April 9 — 2 Kings 11:1-17--</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ATHALlAH’s </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">bloody reion— jehosheba’s faith</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">G</span><span class="font10">OO often uses very small incidents to effect his purposes. O&quot;ce he used the tears of the infant Moses to touch the heart of the daughter of Pharaoh (Exodus 2:G) In this lesson he uses the affection of a sister of the murdered king for her nephew, Joash, an infant in arm-, to preserve the isihrnkpn hue from Dai id to the Me=<sup>r</sup>-iah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">God had made a promise concerning the descendants of David (2 Kings 8:19; Isaiah 7:0, 7; Jeremiah 33:18-26), and all the Athaliahs that ever lived on earth could not make void the smallest promise of God</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Between the last lesson and this one came the reigns of Jehoshaphat. Jehoram, and Ahaziah. Jehoshaphat was one of the best kings that Judah ever had, but lie made the great mistake of forming an alliance with the idolatrous northern kingdom under Ahab and Jezebel. And, as was the custom, this alliance was sealed by the marriage of Je-horam, son of Jehoshaphat, with Athalmh, daughter of Ahab. This Athaliah wellnigh wrought rum in Judah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">THE GREAT CONFLICT</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Since this story of the preservation of Joash forms one of the links in the chain of Satan’s efforts to thwart God’s purposes concerning the promised seed, ,t nrij be well to remind ourselves of the previous attempts which he had made. In each case the human agent had some personal interest of his own to serve, while Satan had his own great object in view. In each case God interfered to inert the evil and the danger, of which his servants and people were often wholly ignorant. The following assaults of Satan, up to the time of Joash, stand out prominently in the divine record. They aimed at:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The destruction of the chosen family by famine—Genesis 50: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The destiuction of the male line in Israel—Exodus 1: 10: 15, 16; 2:5; Hebrews 11: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The destruction of the whole nation in Pharaoh’s pursuit. —Exodus 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After David’s line had been singled out (2 Samuel 7) the devil selected it for special assault.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One sally was in the union of Jehoram and Athaliah. Thon, after the death of Jehoshaphat, Satan made a most determined effort; for the course of things was being narrowed down within smaller limits, and every blow was intended to count. The “seed” was, so to speak, passing through a narrow defile, with the enemy perched on the vantage ground above, ready to hurl clown death and destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jeho’-nm “slew all his bretlnen”.—2 Chronicles 21:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Aiabians came and slew all his sons (2 Chronicles 21:16, 17: 22:1); and “there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz [Ahaziah], the youngest of his sons”. These are significant woids, and by them the Loid imp:esses upon us the fact that his faithfulness icsted at that time on two lives—.Tehoiam and Ahaziah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehoram and Ahaziah die, and Athaliah “aiose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah” (2 Chronicles 22:10), or thought she had, “but Jehosheba the daugh-</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">THE HIDDEN KING</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Pictiwe what would have happened but for this divine interposition. The promise of God would have failed; the faithfulness of his word would haie fallen into disrepute; his- counsels w’ould have come to nothing. All hung on one life, and that the life of an infant less than a year old. Satan’s designs had so tar succeeded that all depended on the life of one small child. God therefore took a hand in the pieservation of that life. Nothing could destroy it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Picture the feelings of the godly in Judah who knew nothing of the rescue of the heir, who thought all had failed ! Picture the joy with which the secret news was passed from mouth to mouth, ‘The king is not dead—he is alive—and will be manifested in due time’ Therefore the message which was given to Jelioinda and which he was to pass on to the faithful was: “Behold the king’s son shall reign, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">as the Lord hath said,</span><span class="font10"> of the sons of David”. (2 Chronicles 23:3) Everything depended on what the Lord had said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The six jears soon ran their course; the seventh year came; the king was manifested; the promise fulfilled and the faithfulness and power of Jehovah were vindicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">So with faithful believers in Christ Jesus throughout- this gospel age: Like Jehosheba, their hearts have been occupied with the glouous person of the king, him upon whose life all was made to hang. Their life has been hid, not in one of the chambers of an earthly temple, but hid with Christ in God, on high. Also, like .Tehoiada doubtless did, they have been going forth among the people, initiating many into the blessed secret that the King is not dead, that the divine purposes live in the living heir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Behold, the King’s Son shall reign, as the Lord hath said.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“TREASON! TREASON!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Athaliah, the one who of all in the kingdom w<sup>r</sup>as most guilty of treason, cried, “Treason! treason!” when she heard the blare of the trumpets which announced her grand-on as king. The plans had been so well laid by the high priest and so thoroughly cooperated in by the guard and heads of families in Judah, and, above all, so guided and blessed of the Lord, that everything was done before Athaliah ivas aware. She herself was slain. Having herself used the sword so mercilessly, she perished by it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“And Johoiada made a covenant between Jehovah and the king and the people, that they should be Jehovah’s people; between the king also and the people.” Even so will the great Messiah, acting both as High Priest and King, establish the arrangement whereby the people shall be God’s people and he their God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Blest thought ! each conflict here, each bitter strife, Shall but add sweetness to the cup of life;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Each heavy stroke shall but God’s child prepare</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">There, where the things winch darkly now I see, Shall be in perfect light revealed to me.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">R</span><span class="font10">ATHER more time seems to be required for the masculine mmd to reach the position of implicit trust than for the feminine mind. Man calls for more evidences, more proofs: and our Lord was not unwilling to give these to his apostles after his resurrection. It was a very small token which convinced Mary of the fact of her Lord’s resurrection ; and the thought of any honor at being the first to discern it was completely lost sight of in the blessed fact itself, the fact that her Lord again lived. Quite probably if one of the eleven had been the first to meet the Master after his resurrection, that one would have had difficulty in forgetting it. Yet Jesus did not choose Mary to be one of his apostles. Why not? Because quickness of discernment was not the only requirement for apostleship. Our Lord does not expect just the same qualities and qualifications in each one. The natural mind inclines to look for military precision, rigid conformity to an outward standard. But the Master’s way is to expect from each individual only vhat that one is able to perform. This is the happy way for us, too, if we can only learn it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mary's work of announcing the fact that the Lord had risen was necessary to enable the slower minds of the apostles to accommodate their logic to the fact. Had the appearance of our Lord on the evening of his resurrection day in the upper room been the first manifestation and information respecting ins new estate, we can readily suppose that it would not have produced the faith and joy that did result. Wonder, astonishment, and reasoning required the entire day for their exercise; and by the time our Lord showed 1ns hands and his side this culmination of evidence was convincing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">BEHIND CLOSED. DOORS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jesus had been taken from the disciples, and it was natural for them to apprehend that the Jews would next attempt to wreak their vengeance on his followers. Hence they met in the evening, and behind closed doors, lest the Jews should bring against them the same charge of sedition that they had brought against the Lord Jesus. We are not certainly informed as to the object of their assembling, but it is quite reasonable to suppose that it was to talk over the events which had just occurred ; to deliberate about their condition, and to engage in acts of worship. This was the first meeting of Jesus’ disciples on the first day of the week </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">which ue have any knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">First of all it was necessary for our Lord to establish the proof of Ins resurrection, and that could be done only </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font10">his appearing as he was when lie died. This he did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Suddenly, while the disciples were thus deliberating or worshiping, Jesus appeared in their midst, saying. “Peace be unto you I” </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Ihs</span><span class="font10"> sudden appearance, liis </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">sudden</span><span class="font10"> appear</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ance, </span><span class="font10">and his sudden </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">appcaiunce</span><span class="font10"> had probably startled them. He addressed them in such a way as to allay their fears and to assure them that he was their own Savior and Friend. Doubtless these words of reassurance began to take on a new’ meaning. They began indeed to find a peace for their troubled hearts which they had not known for some time. Since they realized their Master to be again alive they could well have peace; for they had learned to have confidence in him and his love. And they intuitively realized that all things would work together for good to them, under liis care, though as yet they knew not how. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">And </span><span class="font10">so it is still. It is only those who realize Jesus to be</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">-i 3j.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">their Redeemer and Lord, who died and who rose on their behalf, and who have been chosen of him to be his disciples, only such can really receive of his peace, only such can have the peace of God keeping guard in their hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When our Lord was about to leave his disciples in death he had said, “My peace I give unto you,” and now’ his first words after coming forth from death and when meeting with tlie group, were also of peace. “Peace be unto you!” He is indeed the Prince of Peace, and the grace of peace which he gives to liis faithful disciples is a blessing beyond all measure, such as the w’orld can neither give nor take away. But this peace is measurably dependent upon certain conditions of the heart: first, faith, trust in God; second, obedience, an effort to do those tilings w’hich are pleasing in his sight. To such and such only comes the heavenly peace; and m proportion as either the faith is lost or the obedience is lacking the peace flies away. Whoever, therefore, believes himself to be a child of God, who trusts in Jesus and is faithful in his service, should expect the Lord’s peace to rule in his heart, giving him rest, no matter what his circumstances or condition in life. If any of this class are without the peace, they may look to it and repair the difficulty, insofar ay in them lies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another lesson here is, that however much contention and strife his message, tlie truth, stirs up among men, our Lord himself was always peaceably disposed, and a peace-maker as respects others. And so all of liis disciples are to be. “Blessed are the peacemakers; for they shall he called the children of God.” Whatever of strife may come in contact with the Lord’s people should not be of their production or cultivation. And even when they speak the truth, which wall necessarily cause strife, they are directed to speak the truth in love, meekness, in gentleness, and with long-suffer-’ng and patience, not in strife; for “the servant of the Lord must not stiixe”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“SO I SEND YOU”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Immediately after speaking peace to the troubled disciples Jesus spoke of a commission. &quot;As my Father hath commissioned me. even so dispatch I you.” The two words for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">send</span><span class="font10"> are not the same. The former implies that the Father had sent his Son alone into the world, but that he would dispatch them as with an escort, and that escort would be his spirit. “Receive ye [the] holy spirit.” The article </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span class="font10">is wanting in the Greek, and refers simply to an effusion of the spirit, giving them miraculous discernment of motive and authority for judgment, much as the ancient prophets had possessed. Apparently this power from on high was not limited to the apostles, but came also upon “them that were with them”. (Luke 24- 33; Acts 1: 14; 2:1) Evidently Joseph Barsabbas and Matthias were in the group (Acts 1:21, -22), as well as others. The act of breathing was symbolic and signified an importation of power fiom tlie breather.—Ezekiel 37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Whose soever sins ye forgive, they are forgi\en unto them; whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.” However we may interpret this promise, it was specific and not general. It was a special gift connected with this breathing, and should not be looked for after the miraculous period passed. Even this was not the fuller endowment of the spirit which came later at Pentecost (Acts 1:5), and under which baptism they were begotten as new creatures and empowered for a special testifying work—in harmony with other regulations which the Master also made. Indeed this initial breathing and pronouncement seem to have been a kind of sign or pledge that they should be more fully endowed a few weeks later. It would serve all their needs in the meantime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But even if this promise be limited absolutely to the eleven apostles (or to the ten then present), it surely gives no such preeminence in the matter of remitting sins which is claimed by the church of Rome. The same power was conferred on each one. Our Lord gives no one of them any peculiar authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The meaning of the passage is not that </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">man</span><span class="font10"> can. forgive sins—that belongs only to God (Isaiah 43:23); but the meaning is that they should be </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">inspired</span><span class="font10"> or specially and miraculously guided in the matter mentioned. This commission is quite different from the authority which the Roman church claims of remitting sin and of pronouncing pardon. Rather, the apostles were to be taught by the holy spirit as to what terms, to what characters, and to what temper of mind God would extend forgiveness of sins. In every instance they would lay down such directions respecting sins and their forgiveness as would be in full accord with the divine arrangement—that thus they might act as mouthpieces of God, explaining to men the nature of sin and the terms of its forgiveness. This view we know Is fully borne out by the facts in the case. The apostles did define sin and the terms of forgiveness, justification, reconciliation, etc., in a manner entirely plain, in such a manner as our Lord himself never explained; because he left this work for his representatives to accomplish in his name and under the guidance of the holy spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“EXCEPT I SHALL SEE”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But Thomas was not with the others when Jesus appeared on that Sunday evening. Possibly he was too deeply enshrouded in gloom to come together with the others, some of whom had hastened back from Emmaus to be there. This incident about Thomas should be an encouragement to al) pessimists, to all people who possess small natural hope; for he -was inclined to look on the dark side of things. In each of his three mentionings in the Gospel of John is found testimony to this effect. He was willing to go back with the Lord into Judea, but he was just certain that the visit would result disastrously. (John 11:16) Again, when our Lord was saying, “Whither I go ye know, and the way ye know,” Thomas was thinking, T can’t understand at all what he is driving at; I fear I shall never get where he is If he goes away’. He felt convinced that things were going to turn out wrong and now, after his Master’s death, he was sure they had so turned, and life could never be bright again. ‘What’s the use going down to that meeting merely to exchange condolences? I stay right here.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Our Lord understood Thomas: he knew what was i.i man. He did not commend Thomas for incredulity. Unbelief in the Lord’s promises is always a fault; but it is a fault which has many excusable causes In imperfect men. It is probable that the ground for Thomas’ unbelief was his deep grief and that despondency which fills the mind when a long-cherished desire is completely frustrated. In such a case it requires proof of uncommon clearness and strength to overcome the despondency. Thomas has been much blamed, but he asked only for proof that would be satisfactory in his own circumstances. Taken abstractly, the testimony of ten disciples should have been sufficient; that was five times as much testimony as was required by the law to condemn a man to death. But problems are not always abstract. To render just judgment the temperament of the individual, the specific condition of his mind at the time of an act, past expediences, natural endowment, as well as the act itself, must be taken into consideration. No human judge can do this perfectly. And our Lord was not interested in displaying the flaws in Thomas, whatever they may have been, but rather in convincing him of the fact that his Master was alive. How kind, how gracious the Savior is I</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">'1 Ins instance shows, what all the conduct of the apostles proves, that they had not </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">conspired</span><span class="font10"> together to impose on the world. Even they were slow to believe, and one of them refused to believe even on the testimony of ten of his brethren. How unlike this to the conduct of men who might agree to foist a fictitious story on mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A WEEK OF WATCHING</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Another week went by, and by that time Thomas was able to emerge sufficiently fioin his state of blues to meet with the other brethren. Maj be, after all, there was some ground for the belief so tenaciously held by those whom he had long known and uho had nothing to gain by being implicated in an imposture. Anyway, he would go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Lord had been Matching him all the week, knew what he had been turning oxer in his mind, and felt sympathetically toward his yearning to be convinced of what he dared not trust to reason. Again the doors were shut; and again Jesus appeared in their midst, thus showing that he had the spirit body; again his reassuring words of peace; again the wound marks, significant of his past suffering. In short, the scene of a week before was reenacted, but with the lime-light on Thomas. The Master’s words, “Be not faithless, but believing,” were intended to encourage the gloomy apostle. The word for tie is literally </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">become, </span><span class="font10">and therefore does not signify that Thomas was devoid of all faith. But it did contain a warning that if he continued in the same way he had been, his faith would finally ebb away. The play on the two adjectives is lost in English. It can be awkwardly approximated by reading it “Become not believingless but believing”—Don’t let this discouragement get the best of you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As soon as he saw the marks of his Master’s suffering, Thomas’ whole being vent out to him in deepest devotion and worship, crying, “My Lord and my God I” This is the first testimony to the divineness of the risen Lord. Jesus was -was no longer a human being, and the name God is expressly gixen to him by one of his own apostles. There is no evidence, as some have supposed, that this was a mere expression of surprise or astonishment. The language </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font10">addressed to Jesus himself: “Thomas said </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">unto him&quot;.</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> The </span><span class="font10">Savior did not reprove him or check him as using any improper language. If he had not been divine, it is impossible to reconcile it xx ith his honesty that he did not rebuke his disciple. No merely pious man would have allowed such language to be addressed to him. The Savior proceeds immediately to commend Thomas for believing. But what </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font10">the exidence for his believing? It was this declaration, and this only. This passage, proves, therefore, that it is proper to apply to Christ Jesus the name Lord and God, as the early church did, Stephen praying to him.—Acts 7: 59.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jesus approves the faith of Thomas after having seen </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">wounds, but more highly commends the faith of those </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">who </span><span class="font10">should believe -without having seen. This was by way of encouragement to us, that we should not ask for more </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">proof </span><span class="font10">than he has already given, which is fuller now than it </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font10">when Thomas doubted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“What though with weariness oppressed? ’Tis but a little and we rest, This throbbing heart and burning brain Will soon be calm and cool again;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Night is far spent and morn is near— Morn of the cloudless and the clear.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">FINDS THE HARP A STIMULUS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Deab Brethren :</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I must write you, expressing my gratitude to the Society, Brother Rutherford, and every brother and sister who had any part whatever in the preparation of The Harp of God. I have had three spiritual thrills and stimuli since Brother Russell left us: The Finished Mystery, the Millions booklet and now The Harp. Each one begat in me an increased desire to pass these blessings to other hungry hearts and minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I believe The Harp will be found a very strong and convincing array of evidence of the Lord’s kingdom. Surely sincere Christians who read it w ill realize they cannot gainsay it. More power to your arm ! Have not heard any complaint against The Harp yet, but as it is quite likely the adversaiy will in time manifest his displeasure of it, I want to register my gratitude now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With more Christian love than before to each one doing any part of the work at Brooklyn for the feeding of those in the field,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Your brother in the Lord, C. W. Gerdes.—</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">JOYFUL IN SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Greetings in our Master's name! may grace and peace be multiplied unto you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I received Tnc Harp of God which you had sent to me and we (Slater Hoskin and myself, being one in the work) thank you very much for lemembering us. We do not feel that we are worthy to be lemembeied in such a way. We do what little we can, but it seems to us very small when the harvest is so great. However, we know that it is not the amount of work that counts but the willingness to do and the love for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The district allotted to me here is about 100 miles in length in the mountains. I manage to get over it once a year, some of it oftener. I cannot take in the “drives” as outlined in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletins,</span><span class="font10"> but the people get the books and message so that they cannot say they were never told.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In canvassing a town last spring I forgot to ask where the ministers lived, so I soon was face to face with one at his door. He said, “I suppose you know' what I am”. I said, “No, sir”. When he told me I said, “Well, w<sup>T</sup>e should surely talk agreeably on the Scriptures, and even if we differ on some things we can agree to disagiee and part as friends”. But we had talked only a few minutes when he began to rage He struck the door so haul that I looked to see the laige glass tail to the flooi. Then his wife appeared and said to me, “Yon have no business here; if I had a gun I would shoot you!” I did not speak to her, and be quieted down. I then explained what 1 was bringing out of the Scriptures He found no fault with the explanation, but said, “You have been in jail [in 1918] and ought to be there again and all the Russellites M hat are jou doing in this town among Christians'' Wh.v don’t jou go to the heathen and talk Io them?&quot; (I felt that I </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">itas</span><span class="font10"> talking to one) The next day (Sunday) he warned his Hock oi me from his pulpit. I sold what books I had, came home, and shortly utter 1 received a letter saying that this Methodist preacher was going about telling the people that I was the worst fraud that ever struck that town and that I ought to be shot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I soon packed up more books and was on the spot again. In four days I sold all I had. I never made better sales and never had a more glorious time canvassing. Some of the people even exclaimed, “I know that you are a man of God!” and asked if they could help me that I might not want for anything. Others said to their fellow worknen, “That man has the goods; buy the books; they give vs plain facts.” etc. None of these were Bible students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I was arrested on July 18, 1918 for “sedition”. That night a government official informed me that I was “the head Bible Student here”, and that they had been after me lor months and that now they had gotten me “the others w'ould be afraid and keep quiet”. Two days later my so-called trial started. The Crown evidence was taken. One of the witnesses gave me as good a reputation as one person could possibly give another, saying that the only thing wrong with me was that I talked Bible every day of the week and might be going astray in my mind. He was a policeman. I w'as left free over Sunday on $2,000 bail. On Monday my evidence was taken. The Crown prosecutor would not allow Scriptures to be used and said he would not permit that old Bible stuff. But the judge said, “The best and most intelligent minds in the past and present have tried to understand those prophecies but have been unable, and I am doubtful if anyone can; but I will allow this man’s evidence”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I told them of how God chose out Abraham from among the heathen, and how the twelve tribes were God's chosen people. Then out of these chosen people he chose one tribe for a special work. They had to take care of the oracles of God while the other eleven tribes had to do the fighting, and that they dared not number one man for war out of the tribe of Levi; and that where there is a type there is always an antitype, and that the clergy had failed to be the antitype and w'e had taken their place and was taking care of the oracles of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">My lawyer said that I had not broken any order in council, nor spoken against the government. The judge said, “Tins man teaches love, and we want the men to fight; besides, he has a very strong mind and may influence thousands so that the Germans will come over and take our country. I think he had better be put w'here he cannot talk to the people.” So he fined me $100 and cast me into jail for six months. I w’as released on Christmas, early in the morning. All classes of people, wherever I go, say they know that I suffered as a Christian. Yes, it hurts, but it is glorious, and if we are willing to be used by him he w'ill do more witnessing through us in a few days, than we could do in a life time in the way we would like to take. “Oh, to be nothing, nothing, only to lie at his feet!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We are always glad to receive The Watch Tower It seems to us just the same as when our dear Pastor was&quot; the editor; always giving the household of faith the meat as it becomes due; a little brighter light in each Tower as we near the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some of the dear fi lends are thinking that all, or nearly all, of the bride class have passed beyond the veil. Those entertaining this thought (I believe) are not taking an active part m the work and feel they are not called to go out and sell books I cannot get such a thought to stick for one minute on the top of my brain I am the same today as in the years gone by—happy and rejoicing in the work, with the Lord leading on to sure victory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After reading The Hard of God it makes me think it is the Inst book to be sent out, as it is made so plain for both the spnit-begotten and the earthly, that even though one may be foolish he may not err therein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Remembering daily in our prayers the Bethel family and the dear saints everywhere, also asking to be remembered at the throne of grace, we remain,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Your brother and sister in his service,</span></p>

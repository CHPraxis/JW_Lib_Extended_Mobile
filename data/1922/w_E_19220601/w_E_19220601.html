<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">THIS JOURNAL AND ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS Journal !s one of the prime </span><span class="font6">factors or instruments in the system of Bible instruction, or </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Seminary Extension”, now belnf </span><span class="font6">presented in all parts of the civilized world by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, chartered A. D. 1884, “For the Promotion of Christian Knowledge”. It not only serves as a class room where Bible students may meet in the study of the divine Word but also as a channel of communication through which they may be reached with announcements of the Society’s conventions and of the coming of its traveling representatives, styled “Pilgrims”, and refreshed with reports of its conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our “Berean Lessons” are topical rehearsals or reviews of our Society’s published Studies most entertainingly arranged, and very helpful to all who would merit the only honorary degree which the Society accords, viz , </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Vcibi Dei Minister</span><span class="font6"> (V. D. AI ), which translated into English is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Minister of God’s 'Word.</span><span class="font6"> Our treatment of the International Sunday School Lessons is specially for the older Bible students and teacheis. By some this feature is considered indispensable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This journal stands firmly for the defense of the only true foundation of the Christian’s hope now being so generally repudiated •—redemption through the precious blood of “the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ransom</span><span class="font6"> [a corresponding price, a substitute] for all”. (1 Peter 1:19; 1 Timothy 2 : G) Building up on this sure foundation the gold, silver and piecious stones (1 Corinthians 3: Ills; 2 Peter 1:5-11) of the Word of God, its further mission is to “make all see what is the fellowship of the mjstery which. . .has been hid in God, ... to the intent that now might be made know’n by the church the manifold wisdom of God”—“which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed”.—Ephesians 3:5-9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It stands free from all parties, sects and creeds of men, while it seeks more and more to bring its every utterance into fullest subjection to the will of God in Christ, as expressed in the holy Scriptures. It is thus free to declare boldly whatsoever the Lord hath spoken—according to t^e divine wisdom granted unto us to understand his utterances. Its attitude is not dogmatic, but confident; for we know wheieof we affirm, treading with implicit faith upon the suie promises of God. It is held as a trust, to be used only in Ins service; hence our decisions lelative to what may and what may not appear in its columns must be according to our judgment of his good pleasuie, the teaching of bis Word, for the upbuilding of his peonle in grace and knowledge. And we not only invite but urge ouc readers to prove all its utterances by the infallible Word to which reference is constantly made to facilitate such testing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the church is “the temple of the living God”, peculiarly “his workmanship” ; that its construction has been in progress throughout the gospel age—ever since Christ became the world’s Redeemer and the Chief Corner Stone of his temple, through which, when finished, God's blessing «=hall come “to all people”, and they find access to him.—1 Corinthians 3:16, 17; Ephesians 2:20 22; Genesis 28 : 14 ; Galatians 3 : 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That meantime the chiseling, shaping, and polishing of consecrated believers in Christ’s atonement for sin, progresses; and when the last of these “living stones”, “elect and precious,” shall have been made ready, the great Master Workman will bring all together in the fust resurrection and the temple shall be filled with his glory, and be the meeting place between God and men throughout the Alihenmum.—Revelation 15:5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the basis of .hope, for the church and the world, lies in the fact that “Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">every </span><span class="font6">man,’\ “a ransom for all,” and will be “the true light which lighteth </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">every man that cometh into the world”,</span><span class="font6"> “in due time”.—• Ilcbiews 2:9; John 1.9 ; 1 Timothy 2:5, G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the hope of the church is that she may be like her Lord, “see him as he is,” be “partakers of the divine nature’,’ and share his gloiy as his joint-heir—1 John 3.2; John 17:24; Romans S.17, 2 Peter 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the present mission of the church is the perfecting of the saints for the future work of service; to develop in herself every giace to be God’s witness to the world; and to prepare to be kings and pnests in the next age.—Ephesians 4 :12 , Matthew 24: 14 , Revelation 1 : G ; 20 G.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the hope lor the world lies in the blessings of knowledge and opportunity to be brought to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font6"> by Christ’s Millennial kingdom, the restitution of ail that was lost m Adam, to all the willing and obedient, at the bands of their Redeemer and his glorified church, when all the wilfully wicked will be </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">destroyed.—</span><span class="font6">Acts 3:19-23; Isaiah 35.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Them that had escaped from the sword carried he [Nebuchadnezzar] away to Babylon, where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia: to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths; for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath to fulfill threescore and ten years.&quot;—2 Chronicles 36: 20, 21.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font18">F</span><span class="font9">ROM time to time Bible students who quite evidently are either unfamiliar with all the teachings of present truth or unappreciative of the thoroughgoing convincingness of what has been brought out through the Society, “discoxer&quot; some “error” m proved present truth. Without waiting to communicate with the Society, which could help them, and without making a thorough search, and xx ithout properly ascertaining the weight of evidence published and the insubstantiality of their own “findings” (1 Timothy 3 : 6; 2 Timothy 4:4), they rush to communicate their “new” ideas to others. A few others, no better grounded in the truth than these mistaken leaders, follow their injudicious course, and are led into a state of uncertainty and doubt; and some of them, especially of the leaders, forsake the way of present truth, abandon the opportunities and privileges of co-xvorking with God (2 Corinthians 6:1) and of suffering with Christ (Philip-pians 1:29), separate themselves from those in present truth, lightly leave their crowns to others (Revelation 3:11), and make shipwreck of their glorious hopes. (1 Timothy 1:19) The uniform experience in all such abandonments of the faith and in the divisions so inaugurated is that they start out with a loud noise of professions of loyalty to abstract truth and soon diminish in numbers and zeal until either wholly scattered or settled down into a state of inactivity—of “waiting upon the Lord”, as they are pleased to term their sloth fulness in service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On account of their smallness of numbers, each of these groups regards itself the “little flock”. There are a dozen such schismatic “little flocks”, characterized by an increasing littleness and by an absence of the predicted glorious activity in the warfare of the Lamb with the beast. (Isaiah 61:2; Revelation 17:14) The result is a slight temporary diminution of the amount of work done in his name, with a more than compensating increase of zeal among those holding the faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These occurrences are the periodic siftings and shakings which the Lord has foreknown and which are evidently necessary to cleanse and purify the church; for “there be divisions among you. . . . There must also be</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">heresies among you, that they which are [divinely] approved may be made manifest among you.” (1 Corinthians 11:18, 19) If any finally decide that they do not desire to remain with us in our service of the Lord, they must follow their own consciences; but we may rest in the Lord, assured that, whoever they may be that leave us, “they went out from </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">us,</span><span class="font9"> but they were not of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">us;</span><span class="font9"> for if they had been of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">us,</span><span class="font9"> they would no doubt have continued with </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">us:</span><span class="font9"> but </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">they</span><span class="font9"> went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">us&quot;.</span><span class="font9"> (1 John 2:19) These are the promised shakings which will shake everything except that which cannot be shaken. (Hebrews 12:27) Hoxvever, let the church fear not the siftings and shakings; for these are part of the divinely-promised work of the complete cleansing of the church as it approaches the end of the way. (Matthew 13:41; Revelation 1:15) Rather let the church of God rejoice at these evidences of the Father’s attention to its welfare.—John 15: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">WHEN DID THE SEVENTY YEARS BEGIN?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This time it is the matter of the date of the beginning of the seventy years’ desolation of Judea and of whether it was all </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">desolation</span><span class="font9"> or all </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">captivity.</span><span class="font9"> This is testing the faith of some. This has been fully and adequately covered by Pastor Russell in “The Time Is at Hand”, pages 51, 52, and m great detail in Dr. John and Morton Edgar’s “Great Pyramid Passages”, Volume 2, pages 29-37, to both of which works we refer our readers. But for the benefit of those not having all the information at hand we will review the salient points, to bring them again clearly to remembrance.—2 Peter 3:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">SEVENTY YEARS’ DESOLATION, NOT CAPTIVITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Concerning the desolation Pastor Russell says: “Usher dates the seventy years’ desolation eighteen years earlier than shown above. ... He evidently makes the not uncommon </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">mistake</span><span class="font9"> of regarding those seventy years as a period of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">captivity,</span><span class="font9"> whereas the Lord expressly declares them to be seventy years of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">desolation</span><span class="font9"> of the land, that the land should lie 'desolate, without an inhabitant’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The seventy years were years of desolation, not cap-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">tivity. This is shown in the Scriptural historical record, which cannot be otherwise understood, and according to which the seventy yoais did not begin until </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">after</span><span class="font9"> the overthrow of the last king, Zedekiah, in 606 B. C.: “Them that had escaped from the sword carried he [Nebuchadnezzar, m 606 B. C.]away to Babylon, where they were servants [for seventy years] to him and to his sons, until the reign of the kingdom of Persia [under Cyrus, 536 B. C.] to fulfill the woid of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths for as long as she lay </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">desolate</span><span class="font9"> she kept sabbath, to fulfill </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">threescore and ten</span><span class="font9"> years'&quot;. (2 Chronicles 36 20, 21) This pas-age peaks, of simultaneous desolation, servitude and captivity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Other passages showing th.it desolation means “'without an inhabitant” are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“To make thy land </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">desolate</span><span class="font9">. and thy cities shall be laid waste </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">without an inhabitant. '—</span><span class="font9">Jeremiah 4: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“I will make the cities of Judah </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">desolate, without an inhabitant&quot; -</span><span class="font9">-Jeremiah 9: 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“In this place, which ye say shall be </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">desolate, without man and without bea^t,</span><span class="font9"> even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of- Jei usalcm.’’—Jeremiah 33:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“I will make the cities of Judah a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">desolation without an inhabitant.&quot;—</span><span class="font9">Jeremiah 34: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Others that might be quoted -are Jeremiah 2:15; 44:22; and 51: 37, all showing that the predicted seventy years’ desolation meant -a period of that length in which the land should be “without au inhabitant’’. This state was never reached, or even begun, until after the overthrow of Zedekiah, the removal of the people to Babylon, and the flight of the small remnant into Egypt for fear of the Chaldeans (Jeremiah-43: 1-7), leaving the land, as divinely predicted, “desolate, without an inhabitant,” for “threescore and ten years”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HISTORICAL CONFIRMATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Jewish historian Josephus, writing after the occurrence and expressing the knowledge of all Jews— who certainly were conversant.with the facts—say's that the seventy years were years of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">desolation after</span><span class="font9"> the fall of the city under Zedekiah: “He [Nebuchadnezzar] reduced them all, and set our temple which was at Jerusalem on fire [2 Chronicles 36:19-21], nay, removed our people entirely out of their own country, and transferred them to Babylon; when it so happened that our city was </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">desolate</span><span class="font9"> during the interval of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">seventy years,</span><span class="font9"> until the days of Cyrus king of Persia”.—Apion 1:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In another place Josephus reiterates his statement as to the seventy years of desolation: “But the king of Babylon, who bi ought out the two tribes [Judah and Benjamin], placed no other nation in their country', by which means all Judea and Jerusalem, and the temple, continued to be a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">desert for seventy years&quot;.—</span><span class="font9">Ant. X, 9:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It ia quite obvious that a Jewish historian, even though not inspired, would not record the seventy years as a &quot;desolate” or “desert” state which began </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">after</span><span class="font9"> the destruction of Jerusalem, had this not been the actual condition, as generally known by Ins people. It may have been possible for Josephus to be unceitain m some details of obscure dates, but it is beyond the bounds of possibility for him to have been mistaken about such an important, outstanding fact of his people’s history. The Jews of that time were far more likely to know the simple fact, whether those were seventy years of desolation or of captivity', than is some over-zealous but less informed or misinformed scholar, doctor of divinity, or student of the present day. For our part, we prefer to take our stand with the divinely directed mediator, Moses, the inspired prophet Jeremiah, and the ancient lu=torian of the Jewish nation, all of whom agree that these “seventy years” were years of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">desolation,</span><span class="font9"> rather than of captivity—the captivity beginning at an earlier date and being a different thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">o &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">DETAILS OF PROPHECY AND FULFILLMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the inspired prophecy of Moses one of the important sabbath rests was the fiftieth year: “A jubilee [sounding of silver trumpets] shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which gioweth of itself m it, nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed. For it is the jubilee; it shall be holy uuto you; ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.”—Leviticus 25: 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Jews, through unbelief in God’s promised abundance, failed to give the land its sabbath rest on even one of the nineteen jubilees which transpired between their entrance into Palestine (1575 B. C.) and the overthrow of Zedekiah (606 B. C.). God foreknew this unbelief, and foretold, through the prophet Moses, that if they failed to keep the law of the jubilee the land was destined to have its divmely-appoinfod jubilee rest through a coming desolation, during which he would scatter them among the nations, a year of desolation without an inhabitant for each neglected jubilee sabbath year: “And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste. Then shall the land enjoy- her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye be in your enemies’ land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths. As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest m your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.”—Leviticus 26: 33-35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The accurate Bible student will not overlook that the prophesied sabbath rest for the land combined a desolation of the land with absence of the Jews from that land. This combined requirement never began until after the overthrow of Zedekiah m 606 B. C. It would be a denial of the prophecy of Leviticus to assert that the mere captivity of some of the Jews, their mere servitude as a tributary nation, met the divinely-foretold “'desolation without an inhabitant”. The prime requirement was </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">desolation,</span><span class="font9"> not captivity or servitude— </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">desolation combined with captivity and servitude</span><span class="font9"> was the divine penalty. To insist that this seventy year prophecy means servitude without </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">desolation</span><span class="font9"> of the land is to ignore the Word of God given thiough Moses, and no such idea can be true nor can those adhering to it have God’s blessing on their course. As will be shown, this notion lest; upon pagan and demonistic support and leads into other errors, a moiass of doubts, and ultimately into higher criticism and infidelity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PROPHECY AND FULFILLMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As the appointed time for the desolation and sabbatic rest of the land approached, the Lord, m harmony with his policy of informing of evils to come, revealed through Jeremiah, without’stating when, that the period of contemporaneous desolation, servitude, and captivity was to be seventy years, thus also indicating the total length of the jubilee system as 50 x 70, or 3,500 years: “And this whole land shall be a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">desolation,</span><span class="font9"> and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years. And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the Lord, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual [lasting] desolations” — as Mesopotamia still is.—Jeremiah 25 : 11, 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“After seventy years be accomplished [by the entire nation] at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.”—Jeremiah 29 : 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The historic record of fulfillment of seventy years desolation is plainly stated in the Bible, as well as m Jewish history: “As long as she [the land of Palestine] lay </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">desolate</span><span class="font9"> she kept sabbath, to fulfill </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">threescore and ten years”.—2</span><span class="font9"> Chronicles 36 : 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It would be a quibble to assert that this does not mean seventy years of sabbath rest in desolation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The date for the beginning of the seventy years’ desolation of Jeremiah’s prophecy was not understood clearly at the time by either the Prophet or the people. It was not until the first year of Darius the Mede, (538 B. C.) that Daniel began first to understand from a study of the Books of Jeremiah and Leviticus that the seventy years of desolation were then up: “In the first year of his [Darius’, 538 B.. C.]reign, I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">desolations of </span><span class="font9">Jerusalem”. (Daniel 9:2) As usual, the prophecy was not understood until its fulfillment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Daniel, as a wise and successful governor, came at once into high favor with Darius the Mede (Cyaraxes II—538 B. C.) and then with Cyrus (536 B. C.), and doubtless did something toward influencing the Persian monarch’s mind favorably toward the Jews, in bringing to an end the seventy years’ empty desolateness of their land. Cyrus pennitted part of the Jews to return that year. Part of them remained captive and did not return till the seventh year of the reign of Artaxerxes (Lzia 7—467 B. C.) and others till the twentieth year of the same king. (Nehemiah 2—454 B. C.) So long were some still m captivity that, according to later history, they wondeied if the “seventy years” were not figurative, and many never returned from captivity. If the captivity of some of the Jews and not the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">desolation </span><span class="font9">of Jerusalem and of Judea constituted the chief feature in the seventy-years prophecy, then the question might be properly asked, Has the period yet ended?—for some </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">never</span><span class="font9"> returned to their own land. Such considerations show how the neglect or perversion of some part of the Biblical statements both makes the Word of God of none effect and leads off into endless doubts and confusing questions. This is characteristic of the deceptive methods of demons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">NO CAPTIVITY UNDER JEHOIAKIM</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Bishop Usher, and others following his lead, have fathered an unscriptural idea that there was a captivity of the Jews by Nebuchadnezzar in the fourth (or third) year of Jehoiakim (625 B. C.) 18 (or 19) years before the seventy years’ desolation began at the fall of Zede-kiah (606 B. C.). They nnagine that the seventy years’ desolation were seventy years’ captivity, dating from the fourth (or third) year of Jehoiakim, and consisting of 18 (or 19) years’ captivity alone plus 52 (or 51) years’ captivity and desolation combined. The fact is, as seen from the above mentioned Scriptures, that there were seventy years of captiv ity </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">coincident</span><span class="font9"> with seventy years’ desolation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The effect of this misconception upon the chronology of the Bible would be to show that the desolation was nineteen years shorter than it really was, or that we count the nineteen year period twice, and thus make the period of time prior to the desolation nineteen years too long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">NO CAPTIVITY NOR VASSALAGE IN 625 B. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A doctrine should never be based on a passage of doubtful meaning, reading, or authenticity. This error is based upon the reading of a passage which is inharmonious (1) with the rest of the Scripture record of the attacks by Nebuchadnezzar upon Judea and Jerusalem, and (2) with other Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A little scrutiny of Daniel 1:1, 2 shows that there is something the matter with it. The passage in our Common Version reads: “In the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">third</span><span class="font9"> year [626 B. C.] of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it. And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God, which he carried into the land of Shinar, to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure h'mse of his god.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These events, as we shall see, actually took place in 617 B. C.—Jehoiakim’s eleventh year—and included (1) the attack by Nebuchadnezzar </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">three years after Jehoiakim began paying tribute</span><span class="font9"> (620 B. C.) ; (2) the taking of some of the Temple vessels to Babylon in 617 B. C. when Jehoiakim’s eleventh-year and Jehoia-</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">chm’s</span><span class="font9"> three-months reigns were forcibly ended by Nebuchadnezzar (617 B. C.) ; and (3) the first taking of the first captives to Babylon at the same time. This was eleven years before the final captivity and the beginning of the “desolation” of the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The foreign relations of Jehoiakim were briefly as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For eight years (628-620 B. C.) he was tributary to Egypt or at least non-tributary to Bain Ion : “And Phar-aoh-nechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. . . . And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaoh-nechoh.”—2 Kings 23: 34, 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In his eighth year Jehoiakim was forced to begin paiing tribute to Balnlon. During his eleventh and last war. which would be the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">third</span><span class="font9"> year of his vassalage to Nebuchadnezzar (617 B. C.), he attempted an alliance vv i+li Eg\pt. and refused to pay the promised tribute to B.ibvlon. This course brought upon him the wrath of Nebuchadnezzar, a Chaldean invasion, his own death, and the captivity of Ins successor, Jehoiachin, many Jews, including Daniel. (2 Kings 24:12) Zedekiah vas then placed upon the throne as Nebuchadnezzar’s vassal, and reigned eleven year?, until dethroned in 606 B. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">THIRD YEAR OF JEHOIAKIM’S VASSALAGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A discrepancy in Daniel 1:1, 2 is manifest in the date, “the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">third</span><span class="font9"> year of Jehoiakim” (626 B. C.); for this would have been one year prior to the beginning of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign,'which began in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">fourth </span><span class="font9">year of Jehoiakim (625 B. C.), when Nebuchadnezzar defeated Pharaoh-nechoh of Egypt: “Against the army of Pharaoh-necho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchcmish, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon smote in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">fourth</span><span class="font9"> year of Jehoiakim”. (Jeremiah 46:2) “The </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">fourth</span><span class="font9"> year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah king of Judah, that' was the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">first</span><span class="font9"> year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.”—Jeremiah 25:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Carchemish is by the river Euphrates in the land of Mesopotamia or Babylonia. The king of Egypt had passed by Judea and was some 400 miles to the east. Babylon at this time was not a world power but this victory by Nebuchadnezzar broke the power of the king of Egypt, and Nebuchadnezzar was quick to follow his advantage and drove the king of Egypt back to his own mnntry, thus changing the nominal control of Palestine from Egypt to Babylon. Pharaoh-necho was probably three or more years on this campaign.—Compare 2 Chronicles 35 : 20; 36 : 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The two dates—third and fourth years—cannot be reconciled; and as the fourth year was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar, we must conclude that the “third year” mentioned in Daniel 1: 2 refers to another </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">third </span><span class="font9">year than the third year of Jehoiakim’s reign proper— the third year of his vassalage to Babylon, which began in 620 B. C. and ended with his rebellion and death m 617 B. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">According to the Jewish historian Josephus, the reign of Jehoiakim included no Chaldean attack on Jerusalem in'the first year of Nebuchadnezzar (Jehoiakim’s fourth year—625 B. C.), but the first attack came four years later, in Nebuchadnezzar’s fifth year (Jehoiakim’s eighth year—621 B. C.), and the vassalage of Jehoiakim’s country dated from that or the next year (620 B. C.). This clarifies Daniel 1:1, 2, showing “the third year” to refer to the third of Jehoiakim’s relations with Babylon, and not to the third year of his elevenyear reign. Josephus says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Now in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim [625 B. C.] one whose name was Nebuchadnezzar took the government over the Babylonians, who at the same time went up with a great army to the city Carchemish, which was at Euphrates, upon a resolution he had taken to fight with Neco, king of Egypt, under whom all Syria then was. . . . The king of Babylon passed over Euphrates, and took all Syria, as far as Pelusium, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">excepting Judea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“But v hen Nebuchadnezzar had already reigned four years [621 B. C.] which was the eighth of Jehoiakim’s government over the Hebrews, the king of Babylon made an expedition with mighty forces against the Jews, and required tribute of Jehoiakim, and threatened, upon his refusal, to make war against him. He was affrighted at his threatening and bought his peace with money, and brought the tribute he was ordered to bring /or </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">three years</span><span class="font9"> [until Jehoiakim’s eleventh and last year, 617 B. C.J</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“But </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">on the third ycai</span><span class="font9"> [Daniel 1:1], upon hearing that the king of the Babylonians made [or probably planned] an expedition against the Egyptians, he did not pay his tribute; yet was disappointed of his hope, for the Egyptians durst not fight at this time.”—Ant. IX, 6:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Bible record of this is in 2 Kings 24:1—25: 7. Josephus makes no mention of an attack on the Jews by Babylon in 625 B. C., but specifically says that Judea was excepted then from the general attack. The Jews, on account of their numbers and the strength of their inland and easily defended mountain position, were let alone for four years (until 621 B. C.), after which their vassalage to Babylon began. There was no captivity of the inhabitants until the fall of Jehoiakim and of Jehoiachin in 617 B. C. This is according to Jewish records, but the commonly accepted idea ignores Jewish history for the reason that it cannot make them agree with the notoriously untrustworthy pagan records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The “third year of Jehoiakim” (Daniel 1:1) was therefore the third full year of his vassalage to Nebuchadnezzar which was the end of his eleven-year reign (617 B. C.). The Daniel 1:1 record was written </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font9">Babylon and took the Chaldean viewpoint of the third year of Jehoiakim’s relationship with Babylon. The events which then took place agree with the Scriptural record of the taking of some of the Temple vessels and of many Jews captive into Babylon in 617 B. C., eleven years before the desolation;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRST CAPTIVITY BEGAN 617 B. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The record of the historian Josephus of the captivities of the Jews m 617.B. C.—the first of the captivities— is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">‘■Now a little time afterwards [617 B. C.], the king of B.ibj Ion made an expedition against Jehoiakim, whom he lecened [into the city], and this out of fear of the foregoing predictions of tins prophet [Jeremiah], as supposing that he should suffer nothing that was terrible, because he neither shut the gates nor fought against him; yet, when he was come into the city, he did not observe the covenants which he had made, but he slew such as were in the flower of their age, and such as were of the greatest dignity, together with their king Jehoiakim, whom he commanded to be thrown before the walls, without any burial, and made his son Jehoiachin king of the country and of the city: he also took the principal persons in dignity </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">for captives, </span><span class="font9">three thousand in number, and led them away to Babylon, among whom was the prophet Ezekiel, who was then but young.”—Ant. N, 6 : 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Bible record of this captivity at the close of Jehoiakim’s reign is given in 2 Kings 24: 2-6; 2 Chronicles 36: 6; Daniel 1:1, 2; and Jeremiah 22:13-19. In this matter many writers on this subject have been misled by attempting to harmonize these events with unreliable pagan records. The pagans in all their affairs were under demomstic influence, and to attempt to follow them in doubtful matters is to fall into error and entanglement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the same year (617 B. C.), three months later, took place the second part of the initial captnity of the Jews, under Jehoiachin, to Babylon. (Jeremiah 52: 28) This is described by Josephus as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“But terror seized on the king of Babj Ion, who had given the kingdom to Jehoiachin and that immediately; he was afraid that he should bear him a grudge, because of his killing of his father, and thereupon should make the country revolt for him; wherefore he sent an army and besieged Jehoiachin in Jerusalem ; but because he was of a gentle and just disposition, he did not desire to see the city endangered on his account, but he took his mother and kindred, and delivered them to the commanders sent by the king of Babylon, and accepted of their oaths, that neither should they suffer any harm nor the city, which agreement they did not observe for a single year; for the king of Babylon did not keep it, but gave orders to his generals to take all that were in the city captives, both the youth and the handicraft men, and bring them bound to him; their number was ten thousand eight hundred and thirty-two; as also Jehoiachin, and his mother and friends; and when they were brought to him, he kept them In custody, and appointed Jehoiachin’s uncle Zedekiah to be king”.—Ant. X, 8:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Bible record of this is in 2 Kings 24:10-17; </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">2 </span><span class="font9">Chronicles 36: 9, 10; and Jeremiah 52: 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">After the departure of Jehoiachin and the Jewish captives to Babylon, some false prophet? among them at Babylon kept the minds of the captives in unrest by predicting only a brief captivity. To quiet this unrest Jeremiah, in 617 B. C., in a letter (Jeremiah 29:1-23) counseled the captives to settle down and make themselves as comfortable as possible in anticipation of a long period away from home, because the seventy years —to begin in 606 B. C.—-were surely to be accomplished at Babylon. (Jeremiah 29:10) No one knew then when the seventy years were to begin. This was not understood by Daniel till the first year of Darius. (Daniel 9:1, 2) It is asserted that Jeremiah’s letter (617 B. C.) marked the beginning of the “seventy years”; but this is not the case. As a matter of fact, the Prophet had uttered this very warning in 625 B. C. (Jeremiah 25:1-38; 29:11,12), eight years before there was any captivity at all; for Judea and Jerusalem were not molested in 625 B. C. nor until four years later, when Jehoiakim, under fear of Nebuchadnezzar’s threats, became a tributary vassal to Babylon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The various nations also were to serve Babylon seventy years, but the servitude of different nations began at different times, from Plnlistia in 625 down to Tyre in 606 (or 605) B. C., the latter city’s preliminary siege beginning (618 B. C.) thirteen years before its fall (605 B. C.) according to the article on </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Nebuchadr nezzar</span><span class="font9"> in “Smith’s Bible Dictionary”. The predicted seventy years’ servitude of </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font9"> the nations was, however, practically coincident with the seventy years’ desolation of Judea, though some served more than seventy years. No one date prior to 606 B. C. can be set as meeting all the requirements of the prophecy of Jeremiah 25: 13-28. A seventy-year period upon Tyre had been prophesied by Isaiah (23: 15-18) ; and as this agrees in terms with the Jeremiah prophecy (Jeremiah 25: 11, 22), the seventy years’ servitude of Tyre to Babylon could not have begun earlier than 606 or 605 B. C. Any close examination then of the facts shows that not even the prophecy of seventy years’ servitude or captivity upon the nations began to be fulfilled on </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font9"> of them in 625 B. C. nor earlier than 606 B. C. The expression of Isaiah 23:15 is that “Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years [as an independent people], </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">according to the days of one king</span><span class="font9"> [kingdom, empire]”. Knowing that in prophecy “king” is often used for “kingdom” (Daniel 11:11-14, etc.), the “one king” evidently refers to the seventy-year dominion of Babylon from 606 to 536 B. C. No other explanation of these passages meets all the conditions of prophecy and fulfillment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A further difficulty comes to light in comparing Daniel 1 with Daniel 2. In Daniel 1 the statement is that the four Hebrew lads were given three years training before presentation to the king. (Daniel 1: 5, 18-20) In Daniel 2:1 it is stated that Daniel was brought before the king and revealed and explained the image dream in Nebuchadnezzar’s </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">second</span><span class="font9"> year, which would thus have been a year or two before they were present&quot;! to the king as recorded in Daniel 1:181 The Variorum Bible foot-note reading for “second” is “twelfth”, the “second” being evidently a slip of a copyist's pen, like the slip of the pen from eighteen to eight in 2 Chronicles 36: 9 and 2 Kings 24: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The “twelfth” year of Nebuchadnezzar agrees with the facts. It would be in the year 614 B. C. (625 </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font9">us 11 equals 614), three years after the captivity of Daniel and the other three Hebrew lads, Ezekiel and others, and the expiration of their three years’ training — three years after 617 B. C., or 614 B. C. (Daniel 1: 5, 19) Thus the disclosure of the truth about Daniel 1:1 and 2: 1 removes the entire foundation for the notion that the Hebrew captivity began in 625 B. C. and that 625 B. C. was the beginning of the 70 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">No one knew better than the captive Jews in Babylon when their captivity began. They never dated the initial captivity from the first year of Nebuchadnezzar (625 B. C.), but from the end of Jehoiachin’s three-months’ reign and the beginning of Zedekiah’s (617 B. C.) a date which by no method of reckoning can be made the beginning of a seventy years’ captivity. References to this are numerous in Ezekiel, as, “the fifth year of king Jehoiachin’s captivity” (Ezekiel 1:2), “in the five and twentieth year of our captivity”(Ezekiel 40:1), and numerous other verses. The captive Jews knew nothing of a captivity beginning in Jehoiakim’s fourth year, or Nebuchadnezzar’s first year. If there had been such a captivity it would naturally have been mentioned elsewhere than in the doubtfully-dated Daniel 1:1. These facts dispose of the assertion that the seventy years’ captivity began in 625 B. C., and show that so far as the Bible and Jewish history are concerned our chronology, which places the beginning of the “seventy years” in 606 B. C., is correct.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark7"></a>GENERAL CONVENTION AT CEDAR POINT</span></h3>
<p><span class="font18">D</span><span class="font9">URING the past two years there has been a great demand for another geneial convention. The high cost of transportation and of hotel accommodations has been the chief cause for not holding such a convention. But realizing the importance of a general assembly of the Lord’s consecrated ones for a season of fellowship together, an effort has been put forth to arrange for a general convention for 1922.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The convention held at Cedar Point, Ohio, m 1919, is generally conceded to have been the greatest ever held during the harvest period, and frequently the brethren are heard to say that they long for another such convention. We are glad to announce that arrangements are practically complete for holding another general convention at Cedar Point on beautiful Lake Erie, beginnmg September 5 and continuing for eight, and possibly ten, days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">TO BE AT CEDAR POINT, OHIO</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Cedar Point is situated on a narrow peninsula jutting out from the Ohio mainland into Lake Erie. It has the advantages of the lake from three sides. For quietness and seclusion we know of no better place. The friends can be practically alone during the convention and have sweet fellowship together. The grounds are situated some two miles across the bay from Sandusky, Ohio, which is reached by ferry, as well as by a roadway; and those who will attend from the outside will be people who are truly interested in knowing something about God’s Word, and it will be a real joy to have them present and render any assistance we can to them in understanding the divine plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Boeckling Company, desiring to show its appre-cii tion of the Bible students, has arranged to let the Association have the exclusive use of the hotels, halls, grounds, etc., of Cedar Point for its contention, which will begin September </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">5 </span><span class="font9">at noon. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">On </span><span class="font9">this peninsula are situated two good hotels, The Breakers and The Cedars, which accommodate approximately 3800 people. Good accommodations can also be had at Sandusky. A flat-i ate of $2.00 per day has been made to all of the brethren attending the convention. This will include room and three meals, to be served of first-class food. When the capacity of the hotels and other accommodations on the peninsula are exhausted, the overflow will be placed m Sandusky in private homes and hotels; and the management of Cedar Point has agreed to provide these quarters at the same rate, and to transport by boat all who will necessarily have to go from Sandusky to Cedar Point, back and forth, free of charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We shall have the exclusive use of the auditoriums, which have been improved since we were there before. The weather is usually ideal in the first part of September; and we may find it advantageous to hold outdoor meetings, as was the case m 1919.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There are a number of colporteurs and others of the Lord’s dear consecrated ones who may find it difficult to get to the convention and pay their expenses. Hence an arrangement has been made that the management of Cedar Point will employ approximately two hundred to assist in taking care of the rooms, checking the linen, assisting in the dining room and the kitchen. Ablebodied brothers and sisters can engage in this service if they so desire, and for this assistance will receive their room and board free. Those who wish to engage in this work should make application to our Convention Committee in advance of the time of the convention. It is the Association’s desire to have all the colporteurs in the United States and Canada to attend this convention, if possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">MEETINGS FOR FOREIGN FRIENDS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In addition to the English-speaking brethren, it is the desire to have the foreign brethren attend this convention, also; and they will have their separate meetings in their separate tongues, addressed by able brethren in their respective languages. It is our hope to have every Pilgrim brother in the United States and Canada attend, and probably some from foreign countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We make this early announcement of the convention in order to enable the friends to begin to make preparation for their vacations, etc., that they may attend this general contention. Because of the expense, we are not encouraging local conventions to be held between now and September 1, but believe it would be pleasing to the Lord for us to concentrate our efforts toward making the Cedar Point Convention the greatest ever held.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Society has provided a regular committee on arrangements, who will have charge of the details for the convention. Those desiring special information should address the Convention Committee, 18 Concord Street, Brooklyn, New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Transportation facilities for Cedar Point are first-class. Three trunk railways, through Sandusky, besides electric railroads and steamship companies, operate lines there. This year we have succeeded in getting a special rate from the railroad companies without the necessity of the certificate plan, and the friends will be enabled to buy their round-trip tickets at their home station; so there will be no loss of time or confusion at Cedar Point in validating certificates and purchasing tickets. The special rate without certificate is obtainable under rules which must be exactly observed. The rules will be published in detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In addition to the Bible Students, all Christians who believe in the Lord Jesus as our great ransom-sacrifice, and who love the Lord, will be welcome to this convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And now, dear brethren, let us one and all present the matter before the throne of heavenly grace, and ask the Lord to make this convention one of great blessing to all who shall attend and a splendid witness for his cause. The kingdom of heaven is here! Let us rejoice and be glad, and with gladness tell it out to others.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ZEEEKIAH LAST TYPICAL KING-TYPICAL KINGDOM OVERTHROWN—BEGINNING OF THE “TIMES OF THE GENTILES”-JERUSA</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">LEM BURNED, TEMPLE DESTROYED, LAND LAID WASTE — PBOPHECIES OF JEREMIAH AND EZEKIEL LITERALLY FULFILLED.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“Be not deceived; God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soiceth, that shall he also reap.&quot;—Galatians 6:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">, On' many valuable lessons in life might be learned </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">i </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">j</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font9">by observation! It seems to be a trait of fallen humanity to give little or no heed to the lessons that might be drawn from the experiences of others, no matter how similar the conditions may be. “Others were foolish ; I’m too wise to be caught in that way” seems to be ingrained in human nature. Many in present truth, even, are slow to learn valuable lessons by observation. Doubtless the adversary is quick to foster such a spirit of self-reliance and disdain for advice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">SCHOOL OF EXPERIENCE NEEDED</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For nearly one thousand years God had been dealing with </span><span class="font8">the </span><span class="font9">Israelites as his people, administering punishments </span><span class="font8">oi </span><span class="font9">siioweung blessings, aci-c.’Uing to their disobedience or loyalty. Zedekiah must have been familiar with these records of national history. The recent experiences of his own brother, Jehoiakim, and his nephew, Jehoiaelun, must still have been fresh in his mind. Jehoiakim had broken faith with King Nebuchadnezzar and b id lost both his throne and his life. Jehoiachln was then languishing in a Babylonian prison. Yet in the face of all these known facts, Ezekiel informs us that Zedekiah had deliberately broken his covenant with King Nebuchadnezzar, and that this was the immediate cause of his downfall. God would not hold him guiltless for breaking a solemn covenant even with a heathen king. (Ezekiel 17:11-17) How deeply this lesson should be impressed upon the minds of all who have made a covenant with Jehovah! He assures us he will be faithful to keep his part of the covenant and expects us </span><span class="font8">to </span><span class="font9">keep our part to </span><span class="font8">the very best of our </span><span class="font9">ability—perfectly in heart at least.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Zedekiah had treacherously entered into a league with the king of Egypt with a view to throwing off the Babylonian yoke. When Nebuchadnezzar learned of it he deter</span><span class="font8">mined to bring Zedekiah to his senses. God had foretold </span><span class="font9">that the Israelites would have to serve the king of Babylon, but apparently Zedekiah had as little faith in the Word of God, as do many today nue n'utess with their lips to be his followers, but whose beans are far from him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">WARNINGS UNHEEDED ' l.vi-T.ER FOLLOWS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Nebuchadnezzar besiege''. Jei.salem for about eighteen months before it capituluied Famine and pestilence weakened the defenders and the c'ty was taken and destroyed. God’s time tor pun.sliment had come ami n, thing could stay it ionger. (Jeremiah 37:6-10) Zedeki.d: e.’ii'.we'ed to escape, but was soon captured. He and the rei ninder of the Israelites who had been left from the ou« de-n-.rtaiion e’ en years before, were taken to Br., ■ with the exception of a few of the poorest or the peoph Ged-aliah </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">wiin</span><span class="font9"> appointed ruler over this remnant, but he was assassin.i'ed within two months by one of Zedekiah’s cousins Fearing the wrath of Nebuchadnezzar, those who were lett fled into Egypt thus leaving the land &quot;desolate, without an Inhabitant,” as God had spoken through his prophets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PROPHECIES FULFILLED LITERALLY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jeremiah had said: “Thine eyes shall behold the eyes </span><span class="font8">of </span><span class="font9">the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shall go to Babylon,” (Jeremiah 34:3); while Ezekiel had foretold: “I will bring him to Babylon, to the land the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it; though he shall die there”. (Ezekiel 12:13) If he had been inclined to doubt these prophecies at first, no doubt he had good reason and opportunity to remember and believe them later, as he languished in a Babylonian prison. He had seen Nebuchadnezzar and spoken to him “mouth to mouth”, had seen his own sons slain before him, and then had had his own eyes put out. Our Lord says that there will be others who have professed to be his followers, but who, having failed to heed his advice, will be found weeping </span><span class="font8">and </span><span class="font9">gnashing of teeth when it will be too late to change their course We rejoice to know that in no case will it be an endless torment. It was not in Zedekiah’s case. Death later relieved linn of his sufferings. When he awakens at the call of the Lord he will be more attentive to admonitions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">CRUELTY TO PRISONERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We digress a moment to notice the terrible' cruelty to which man can descend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Tn the has reliefs lepresentmg the capture of Lachish by, Sennacherib, the pusoners are shown, some pegged down to tha ground to be flayed alive—others having then eves put out. In one of the sculptures at Khosabad, Sargon lepiesents himself in person as holding a prisoner by a thong attached to a ring passed through his under lip. The.Mctiui kneels before him, while with a spear he pierces his eyes. Otheis are chained and, with hooks through their lips, are held awaiting their turn In other cases the king slays, the prisoner with his own spear. In another an executioner flays a captive chained to a wall It was especially in Persia that the cruel practice of blinding prisoners prevailed, and it is mentioned by most Greek historians. In Tin key it was formerly the custom for the Sultan on his accession, either to slaughter or blind his half-brothers that he might have no rnals or dangerous ones near his throne In modern Persia the Shahs have invariably, even up to the present century, put out the eyes of all their brothers who did not escape in time to distant provinces.”—Canon Tristam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The heart of man has not altered much during the past two thousand years. Modern treatment of prisoners is a trifle more considerate than the above; but public sentiment, not change of heart, appears to be the restraining influence. During the World War, almost unbelievable atrocities were committed against Christian conscientious objectors. Some were subjected to semi-starvation ; others to confinement in freezing cells in midwinter; others were hand-cuffed with “figure-of-eight” handcuffs with their hands behind the back. Some were kicked; others were clubbed and beaten with fists; and still others were drenched with ice cold water in zero weather and were denied toilet privileges ; some were manacled to cell doors; and others were swung by the feet with head down into the filthy latrines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">According to our latest information there are still nearly </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font9">hundred political prisoners in American prisons whose only crime was that they objected to war. The pendulum is now swinging to the other extreme; and everybody is rushing to be foremost in disclaiming war, declaring that they never did believe in it. How fickle is public sentiment! We recall the experiences of our Lord. One day they were acclaiming him as king; five days later they cried: “Crucify him”. This will continue until “he whose right it is” shall have fully established his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ZEDEKIAH THE LAST TYPICAL KING</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At the request of the children of Israel, God had told Samuel to anoint Saul to be their king. Various ones were permitted to occupy this throne for a period of several hundred years, but God claimed that the real throne belonged to him. (1 Chronicles 29:23) He would determine who should represent him typically. Both kings and people continued to manifest stubbornness and disloyalty. God frequently sent them messages of reproof, coupled with promises of blessings if they would even endeavor to live up to their covenant, made through Moses. But they would not listen, and persecuted and ill-treated his prophets and messengers. Finally God declared he would no longer permit any one to represent him as king even in a typical sense. His declaration through the prophet Ezekiel was: “Thou profane and wicked prince of Israel whose day is-come, when iniquity will have an end, thus saith the Lord God, Remove the diadem, and take off the crown; this shall not be the same: exalt him that Is low, and abase him that </span><span class="font8">is </span><span class="font9">high. I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: and it shall be no more until he come whose right it is, and I will give it him.”—Ezekiel 21: 25-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">TIMES OF THE GENTILES</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">God had foreknown what course his people would take and had recorded it prophetically by his servant Moses. He had even mentioned a time limit during which he would severely chastise them for their disobedience and disloyalty, namely “seven times”—2520 years. In order that his people at this time might have a sure understanding of the ‘times and seasons’ he marked this feature of his dealing with his typical people very prominently, both the beginning and the end, 606 B. C. and 1914 A. D. Later he had sent word by Jeremiah that the land </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font9"> have its appointed rest, viz., the seventy sabbath years that had been pi muled for in the law gnen at Mt. Sinai, to which they had agieed, but which they had not kept. We will not enter into the details of these chronological features here, as they are more tully covered by current articles bearing more directly upon that point. We merely remark that the times of the gentiles and the seventy years of desolation of the land begin at the same time, viz., 606 B. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PROPHECIES TO BE FULFILLED</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These records were not kept merely to satisfy curiosity or for ancient history. The Apostle informs us there was a divine purpose in it. “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">profitable</span><span class="font9"> for doctrine, for reproot, foi correction, for </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">instniction</span><span class="font9"> in righteousness; that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.” “For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">learning,</span><span class="font9"> that we through the patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.” “Now' all these things happened unto them for ensamples [types] : and they are written for our </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">admonition,</span><span class="font9"> upon whom the ends of the wo are come.” (2 Timothy 3:16, 17; Romans 15:4; 1 Corinthians 10:11) There are many prophecies covering the end of this age, and they are as sure of fulfillment as w<sup>r</sup>ere those referring to Zedekiah and the children of Israel. Every child of God should therefore give careful attention “to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip”. The fact that retribution—reward or penalty—is often delayed, is frequently presumed upon by the foolish, who vainly think they can sow' wild oats and never reap a harvest. Both individuals and nations have long ventured to act upon this hazardous and vain hypothesis. Well would it be if they would hearken to the Apostle’s warning: “Be not deceived: God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The operation of this divine law is more manifest upon classes and nations first, because their prominence gives them world-wide publicity; second, because their harvest must of necessity be in the present life, since as nations they will have no existence hereafter. A glance at the pages of history reveals the fact that all the nations of the past have reaped a bitter harvest. They had their rise, their struggles for existence, and their periods of flourishing. Then pride and fullness of bread caused them to become careless in their fancied security, only to sink in the scale of morals, until decline was followed by their complete fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All the nations of the world are now' approaching the most terrible crisis of their existence. It is a time of unparalleled and still increasing trouble. They are reaping w hat they have sown. Claiming to be God’s people, they have disregarded his Word, violated their own solemn vow's as written in their constitutions and laws. The results are manifest. God’s sentence has been given, and step by step the execution of it is being carried out Let every true child of God lift up his head and look up, realizing the dangers and the special blessings of this day of the Lord.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THE GENTILES--THE PBOPHET DANIEL’S TESTIMONY.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Blessed is the nation whose God is Jehovah.&quot;—Psalm 33:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font9">HE lessons of the past quarter have sketched some of the prominent characters of the latter, part of the reigns of the kings of Judah, which kings alone were in any sense Jehovah’s kings and which nation alone was his nation, ending with Judah’s oierthrow in tile days of King Zedekiah and the inaugui.ition of the seventy jears desolation of the land. These lessons have brought before us features of the reigns of the good kings Asa, Joash Hezekiah, and Josiah, and the ill-fated Uzziah and Zede kiah , they have presented Isaiah’s visions of Jehovah and of the Millennium; and they have concluded in logical order and sequence with Jeremiah’s bold message of Jerusalem’s impending doom, his trial for sedition, the mutilation and destruction of his prophecy, his impi nonment and the ruin of the whole land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">EFFECT OF JEREMIAH’S IMPRISONMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In our studies we have seen how the prophet Jeremiah represented our Lord Jesus in the dostne -cenes of his career, and how htiv also he represented the hodv of Christ In its concluding experiences as these experiences have come t the members of that body since the close of the times of the gentiles</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Th*<sup>1</sup> days of ocr years are threescore years and ten: and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is then strength labor and sorrow.” (Psalm 90:10) We will not that this is a direct reference to the fact that, after </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font9"> &quot;<sup>e</sup> appointment of 1844, the appointed days of gentile ule 'Oil b<sub>e</sub> 70 years, ending 1914, and that by reason of strength they would continue ten years more, but with great trouble, although this is the fact, and there is no disadvantage in noting the fulfillment. The prophet Daniel saw gentile rule pictured as a man (Daniel 4:24-32) ; and the gentile “man” bids fair “by reason of strength” to finish this full “fourscore years”, yet w’ith “labor and sorrow'”. The same general thought that gentile domination would continue beyond its appointed lease is conveyed by the same prophet Daniel (7:12) in his statement that “as concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time”—perhaps three and one-half years and seven years, </span><span class="font8">or </span><span class="font9">thereabouts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">THE LAND OF PROMISE DESOLATED</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">More than a thousand years had elapsed from the time when God had led Israel out of Egypt to be his covenant people; and during that entire period they had been rebellious. While he had manifested his favor toward them, It had been accompanied with chastisements, defeats in battle, captivity to surrounding nations, pestilence and drouth. During all that time God had kept faithfully his part of the law covenant, chastising them for unfaithfulness. but nevertheless hearkening in great mercy to their repentance and promise to reform, and both delivering and blessing them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now the time had come, however, to give Israel a more severe lesson than they had previously had. The Lord’s determination, as expressed through the prophets Jeremiah </span><span class="font8">and </span><span class="font9">Ezekiel, was that he would deliver them into the hands of King Nebuchadnezzar, that the land should He desolate for seventy years, and that King Zedekiah should be the last one to sit upon the typical throne of the Lord. (Jeremiah 25:8-11; Ezekiel 21:25-27) The Lord dealt very ten</span><span class="font8">derly with Israel, carefully giving them every opportunity </span><span class="font9">to learn the needed lessons. In the separation of the typical kingdom into two parts Judah, the loyal remnant, had an object lesson furnished them to notice the results of idolatiy in the disloyal ten-tribe kingdom For a time this experience was beneficial to Judah. Later they witnessed the captivity and dispersion of the ten-tribe kingdom because of continued disloyalty to Jehovah God—a lesson which should have been deeply impressed also upon the two-tribe kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Judah represented those Israelites who w'ere faithful to the Lord, those who trusted in the promises, all of w'hich confeied in the tribe of Judah; and many of the faithful oi the ten tribes had moved into the territory of the smaller kingdom Yet with all these lessons, and with the instructions of the prophets, the history of the nation is one long record of unfaithfulness to their great King, Jehovah God. Now the rime had come for the change which God saw best to bring upon them; and nothing could divert the impending doom. Nevertheless, they were given a hope that at the end of a certain period—after seventy years of chastisement— the Lord would graciously bring those back who reverenced him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“THE TIMES OF THE GENTILES”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When God gave the law to Israel he plainly told them the terms and conditions upon which he would receive them as his people. If they would he obedient to the divine requirements, all w'ould be well with them. They would be prosperous, a rich nation, blessed of the Lord. But If they should neglect the divine law and become idolatrous, the Lord would oppose them and would deliver them into the hand of their enemies for chastisement. If they persisted in following the wrong course, he would finally punish them “seven times more”.—Leviticus 26: 18, 21, 24, 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Of course, God knew the end from the beginning. Nevertheless, divine patience was manifested throughout the experiences of the nation leading up to the overthrow of King Zedekiah’s government; for he was the last king of the Davidic dynasty to sit upon the throne of Israel. We have seen bow evil followed good, both in the kings and in the practices of the nation ; and how divine providence chastened the people, yet repeatedly brought them back from idolatry. Now had come the time for the complete overthrow of the national polity, for a period of “seven times”, as foretold by Moses, the mediator of the law covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We find that it is an accepted fact that in Bible symbolism a day represents a year; and that the Jewish year ha&lt;i twelve months of thirty days each. Thus each year symbolically represented three hundred and sixty years; and the seven years of chastisement foretold by Moses would represent 7 x 360 years, or 2,520 years. When therefore we read the prophet Ezekiel’s statement that the kingdom would be “overturned, overturned, overturned,” until Messiah should come, we are to understand that the period of the overturned condition of the Jewish polity would be 2,520 years, beginning with the time when the crown was removed from King Zedekiah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some may point to the Maccabaean kings as an offset </span><span class="font8">to </span><span class="font9">this declaration that Israel had no king since the overthrow of King Zedekiah. We answer that the Maccabaean kings were not divinely appointed nor of the royal family. Others may remind us of the reign of the Herods at the beginning of the Christian Era. We reply that the Herods not only were not of the line of David, but were not Jews </span><span class="font8">at all; that they were Edomites—</span><span class="font9">descendants </span><span class="font8">of </span><span class="font9">Esan </span><span class="font8">who</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">ruled over the children of Israel as representatives of the Roman Umpire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">THE PROPHET DANIEL’S TESTIMONY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When God had lemoved the typical kingdom of Israel and his typical’ throne in the vvoild. he gave ovci the lease of earthly dominion to the gentiles. This lease of power, as set foitli in the prophecy of Daniel (chapter 4) was to continue for “seven times”—2.520 years. In other words, during the same period m which Israel would be undeigoing tiibulation and subjection, the gentiles would lie hating “seven limes” of piospcritt These gentile kingdoms hate practised and prospe.cd during the long pei iod of Isiael’s subjection and the ot ertui ned condition of God's typical kingdom Now the end of gentile power has come; their order is being dashed to pieces by the present King of glory.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">J</span><span class="font9">UST vht the Lord should hate so <sub>(</sub>,tmiiiled matters that the gentlemen who choose the Sunday School Lessons should have sek tied lessons whiih bear so dncctly upon the Imitest woik a d the peisonahties the Loid has used in that work is not foi Us to sat; but we cannot doubt, and do not doubt in the least, that we aie m Ilie hnivest time and that the book of Ezekiel was wutten for that time and tor no other, tor it has nevei previously been understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It we aie living in the close of the harte-t pei iod, and if Pastor Russell was the Lord’s “faithful .ami \ ise servant” it would be most leasonable to hnd.tli.it tins book of -Ezekiel would discuss his ttoik and its ielation to God's great plan of the aces, and so we find</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Me do not say that the prophet Ezekiel always typified Pastor Russell That would not be the pioper way to express the matter. What we do say is that the prophet Ezekiel foi eshadowed the office of a watchman m spmtual Israel at the end of the gospel age, the same oll.ee which our Lord had in mind when he made mention of the faithful and wise sei v ant. and we hold that I’astoi Russell filled both offices, or, lather, that the otlices are one and the same. The servant was faithful because he was a faithful watchman</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Pastor Russell took a firm stand for God’s Word and stood steadfastly for it at all times before friends and befoie enemies. Its spirit, power, influence, was the spirit, power, influence, that radiated from his countenance and from ins works</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“A WORK —A STRANGE WORK”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Pastor Russell was called not to do a slum woik. a re-vivalistic woik, a work among non-Christians He was called to do a woik in spiritual Israel similar to that performed by our Lord and the apostles among Jewish leligion-ists in the end of the Jewish age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">God’s professed people have always been notoi lously impudent. They consider that the mere fact that they are professed worshipers of God should be sufficient to insure their standing. For anyone, prophet or priest, teacher or layman, to intimate that they have aught to learn, or any steps to retrace, they consider it an insult. And as it was foreseen by the prophet Ezekiel that those to whom he bore his message would not hear, so Christ bore witness to the same fact not only as respects his own ministiy but as respects the ministry all the way down the age and at its close</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Pastor Russell beheld the same lethargy P&gt;ut Christendom can never say that it knew- not of the things he taught; for rhey were the most widely spread religious teachings of our lime. In the newspapeis, in the theatres, on the billboards, m many millions of tracts distributed gratis, and in millions of home libraius lie hoie wilncss to the solemn fact that the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">NOT AFRAID OF THE FACE OF CLAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Fea, lessness of man was one of his marked characteristics, and the bitter and poisonous words of his enemies, many of whom would glad'v hive seen him burned alive, had no weight with him. ,o-copt to make him the more zealous to proclaim the whole truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It was his meat to know and to do the Father's- will; and suiely the food which the la.ivenly Father gave to and which he in tin n handed out to the waiting hcarfSlf! of faith lias been meat which the woikl knew- not of, a message which, though the most optimistic message that evei came to humankind, as far as its outcome is conceited disclosed that the Scnptural path to those future blessings lies tinough the deepi-st and darkest valley that mankind will ever have to pass through—a time of anarchyin which eveiy human remedy will have been proved unavailing</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">P.tsior Russell was continually finding in God’s Word tlye treasuics which God hid there for that very purpose; and whatever lie found was not meicly- lood for his mind, but meat for his soul. That he loved the truth and lived the truth no one that knew him could possibly- question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The motive which actuated him to travel the lengths and breadths of Christendom proclaiming “The Overthrow of Sal an's Empire.” “The Battle of Armageddon,” “The Oathbound Covenant,” and other of his favorite lectuies was not that of fame; for he hail more of that than any man could wish. It was a motive of love, a desire to reach all the heaung ears and to bless all the longing hearts with the message of truths now due.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HEATHENDOM WOULD HAVE HEEDED</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It was literally tine, as prophesied by Ezekiel, that if Pastor Russell had gone with his message to heathendom it would have been received, for the reason that it is an infinitely more reasonable message than anything from either heathen or Christian sources that has ever reached these unfortunates. In Japan, India, and China the natives were so eager to hear more that it was with difficulty he could maintain his prearranged schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It was true also that the forehead—the mind—of Pastor Russell was like adamant against the foreheads of all who opposed the message of the truth. No argument can stand before the truth, no answer can be made to it; for truth is irrefutable. Like the diamond it cuts its way through all opposition ; and in the end the message that Pastor Russell boie will be found to be the one true ‘everlasting gospel which shall be to all peoples, nations, languages, and tongues’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">l’astoi Russell’s approach to those in spiritual captivity vvas a kindly approach, but it.vias a bold one, and a foice-ful one. lie knew that the Lord's blessing vvas being pouied out upon his efforts, and in the Lord’s strength and with burning real in his heart he made the utmost endeavors to extend the message by every possible means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">THE DIVINE APPOINTMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As Ezekiel sat by the river Chebar seven days waiting for the Lord's word, and vvas then appointed a watchman in Isiael, so we can see that there vvas a period of seven years, ending in 1881, during which Pastor Russell vvas waiting upon the Lord for the further light which arrived in the fall of that year. That year marks his full appointment to the stewardship which the Lord placed in lus hands. It.vvas the year of the publication of “Food for Thinking Christians” (the original form of Volume I of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Schip-tuke Studies)</span><span class="font9"> and of “Tabernacle Shadows”. It vvas the year when the associate editors’ names were dropped from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower,</span><span class="font9"> and Brother Russell announced that hencefoitli he would recognize a lesponsibility to the Lord for whatever appeared m its columns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As Ezekiel was to give warnings to Heddy Israel, so Pastor Russell circulated tens of millions of warnings, setting forth the correct Scriptural teachings on the subject of the wages of sin and kindred topics—warnings which it would have been well for the religious teachers of our day if they had believed and heeded. The world is madly rushing on toward anarchy because its religious leaders have pieterred to believe a lie rather than the plain statements of God’s Word. A humble acknowledgement by the cleigy of our day that they had been misinformed on the subject of eternal torment, would have restored the faith of millions of men and women who now have no faith in anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thus the truth vvas, in a measure, bound, suppressed, held back from the people. Church members have been urged to get rid of every scrap of paper bearing the message of present truth; the truth has been preached against in practically every church in the English-speaking, Germanspeaking, and Swedish-speaking world. Yet it would have saved the world from the impending time of trouble. Now nothing can save the world, and the fault lies squarely where Ezekiel placed it, and where Pastor Russell placed it, with the false shepherds that have been more interested in the wool and mutton than in feeding the sheep. But in the end the truth will prevail; and even those who have bound, hindered, it many of them, let us hope, will ejoice m its light.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font11"><a name="bookmark15"></a>THE SETTING UP OF CHRIST’S KINGDOM</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">--July</span><span class="font9"> 9 — </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Daniel</span><span class="font9"> 2--</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SATAN’S EMPIRE PASSING — SETTING UP OF THE LOUD’S KINGDOM —- ANTITYPICAL SMITING OF THE IMAGE.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">‘The kingdom of the world is become the kingdom of our Lord' and of his Chnst; and he shall reign forever and ever.”— Revelation 11:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">F</span><span class="font9">ULFILLED prophecy clearly shows to the follower of Christ Jesus that the setting up of the kingdom of the Messiah is here, because the time has come for it to be set up. The reign of the Messiah is a reign of righteousness. The taking of Ins dominion and power might have been by an entirely peaceable means had the words of the Lord, as recorded in the Bible, been heeded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Israel vvas a typical people, and her experiences foreshadowed the experiences of Christendom. Through the prophet Jeremiah God warned Israel of impending disaster unless she would take heed to Jehovah’s admonition The words of Jeremiah antitypically apply now to Christendom, the leading part of the earthly organization of Satan’s empire. If the powers now operating and controlling the peoples of earth would heed the admonition of the Lord ex-piessed by the Prophet long ago, to cease exploiting the people, to be content with a reasonable compensation, honestly and fairly to lepresent the people, and openly and frankly to tell them the tiuth concerning God's plan, avoiding all wrongdoing, Messiah’s kingdom would be inaugurated in peace But the indications aie very .strong that these eaithly powers will not heed the Lord’s warning; hence there will be a time of tribulation such as never vvas since there vvas a nation, as Jesus fol etold—Matthew 24: 21, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">SATAN’S UNRIGHTEOUS EMPIRE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Satan established his empire upon the basis of unrighteousness, and has long ruled in the minds of the people, blinding them to God's purposes. He has sent millions in sorrow down to the grave. The members of the human race have become lus captives. He is the great, cruel prisonkeeper. Our Lord's kingdom, now being put into operation, will bind Satan, lestraining his power, and put him into a condition of impotent inactivity; and then the Lord will open the minds of the people to the true situation, relieve them from their thraldom of oppression and lead them over the highway of holiness, back to righteousness. He will open the great prison-house of death and cause the prisoners to come forth and show themselves. During this wonderful work Satan shall not be permitted to deceive the nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It would seem that no one could read the second chapter of Daniel, which constitutes today’s lesson, without seeing that the mauguiation of the Lord’s kingdom means the end of gentile dominion, the end of the powers that be, the end of Satan’s empire. I’erh ips it is for this reason that this most intei esting and foi cetul picture of the incoming of our Lord’s kingdom has been generally avoided by those who have selected the Sunday School lessons The chapter should be read frequently by all who are interested in God's Word. It contains j'ust the food needed in our day; for we have come to the time when the climax of history which it portrays is here, even at the doors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW DANIEL’S LIFE WAS SAVED</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">King Nebuchadnezzar employed and perhaps originated the rule of action used by the Roman and British empires m maintaining ordei throughout their realms. His courtieis were chosen from the various nations which he had subjugated As General Smuts, one of the generals in the Boer revolution, is now premier of South Africa, and as various Indian princes rule over sections of India, so Daniel was trained to serve in Nebuchadnezzar’s court; and when Nebuchadnezzar ordered the death of all his courtiers because they could not relate to him Ins own dream, and provide him with an explanation of its meaning, Daniel was included in the sentence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Acting with heavenly wisdom, Daniel gained a stay </span><span class="font8">of </span><span class="font9">execution for a night, while he joined with his three faithful comrades in prayer to the great Ruler of the universe that this dream and. its meaning might be revealed so that they might not be destroj ed with the other counsellors, and thus their opportunities of usefulness to God’s people be brought to an end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. The whole matter was revealed to Daniel that same night; and in the morning he stood before the king, modestly and truthfully disclaiming any wisdom on his own part in the matter, and giving all glory to the One who had come to his rescue in his hour of need, while he made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what had been his dream and what it signified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It will be interesting to note for a moment the setting </span><span class="font8">of </span><span class="font9">this incident. Daniel and his companions had been at Babylon about four years. They had completed their course of special instruction and had been presented to King Nebuchadnezzar and been commended as the brightest of their class, even brighter “than all the magicians and astrologers that were in his realm&quot;. Daniel was a young man, and probably was acting in a more or less humble court position. As this was the twelfth year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign the king had not yet become the head of gold. That position was not attained until seven years later, in the nineteenth year of his reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At least three objects were accomplished by this extraordinary occurrence. First, it brought before the heathen king and his courtiers a knowledge of the true God and his interest in human affairs and his ability to reveal secrets. Second, through it God caused to be written a record of his knowledge of future events. Third, God used it as a means to have his I wai servants, Daniel and his companions, exalted to positions of honor and trust. This would prove to be to the Babylonians a constant reminder of the true God. Incidentally it brought all the magicians and astrologers of the court under great obligation to Daniel ; for if it had not been for him their lives would have been forfeited It is not difficult therefore to imagine the impress on made upon the court and all Babylon by the sudden prominence given to Daniel and the God of the Hebrews by such a sudden change of affairs. Even Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face to worship the Hebrew youth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As Nebuchadnezzar represented Satan and his kingdom, and as he fell down to worship the representative of the true God, so shall Satan himself be compelled to fall down and prostrate himself before Jehovah’s Son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When Nebuchadnezzar finally became the head of gold, no doubt he remembered his dream and its interpretation; and in his pride he ignored the interpretation. But God again made him acknowledge the Creator’s power to do as he wills, and that, as recorded in the third chapter, he could still preserve his servants that served him. Such noble examples of faith should stimulate every true follower of the Lord to greater love and loyalty. Let the kings of earth be the feaiful and trembling ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">CHRISTIAN VERSUS WORLDLY VIEWPOINT</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Christian ideal of society and of government within the church and outside of it is that of a brotherhood under the one Master, Christ. But, as our Lord explained, that is not the ideal of the unregenerate mind. The standards of Satan’s impne and of the Lord’s kingdom are as far apart as the east is from the west. Our Lord compares the </span><span class="font8">two </span><span class="font9">in Matthew’ 20: 25-28, saying, </span><span class="font8">“Ye know that the princes </span><span class="font9">of the gentiles exercise </span><span class="font8">dominion </span><span class="font9">over </span><span class="font8">them, and they that </span><span class="font9">are great exercise authority upon them. But it shall not </span><span class="font8">be so among you: but whosover will be great among you, let him be your </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">servant;</span><span class="font8"> and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">slave:</span><span class="font8"> even as the Son of man came </span><span class="font9">not to be </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">served,</span><span class="font9"> but to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">serve,</span><span class="font9"> and to give his life a ransom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Hence, Daniel approached Nebuchadnezzar’s dieam trorn the king’s own standpoint and declared that the image which he had seen, with its head of gold, arms and breast of silver, belly and thighs of brass, legs of iron, and feet part of iron and part of clay, was a great image. e\en as the gentile kingdoms have seemed great in the eyes of the world; that its brightness was excellent, even as the glory of these kingdoms has seemed excellent to those who have borne rule over them; and that the form thereof was calculated to make one slink out of sight in terror. This, all can agree, bus been a marked characteristic of all the kingdoms of the world which have borne Satan’s likeness and been part of his dominion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">REMOVING THE VENEER</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We do not need to remind the readers of this journal that the head of gold represented the Babylonian empire, the arms and breast of silver the Medo-Persian empire, the belly and thighs of brass the Grecian empire, the legs the Roman empire, and the feet, iron mingled with clay, those governments w'hich, in the early part of 1914, were still animated by the spirit of the Roman empire, w'ere still more or less under the influence of the Roman religion, and were all falsely claiming to be Christ’s kingdom, even as clay looks like stone but is a poor imitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Nor do we need to point out that the stone which was cut out without hands is the true kingdom of God, w'hich comes into existence not by human power but by the power of God. It is this stone which, cracking aw’ay the thin, hypocritical, ecclesiastical “clay” from the kingdoms of this world, reveals their true origin, and causes their fall. And it is the stone which, at God’s set time, smites the image suddenly, grinds it to powder, and takes its place as the governing power among men. The stone becomes a great mountain and fills the whole earth. Here, then, we have a divinely given explanation of the fact that the word “mountain” when used in prophecy signifies a kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">DATE OF THE SETTING UP</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We make a distinction between the time of the setting up of God’s kingdom and the time of the smiting of the image. The setting up comes first and the smiting follows, even as, in the case of the Babylonian, Medo-Persian, Grecian and Roman empires, each of these was set up before It overthrew its predecessor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We date the period of the setting up, not from Pentecost, as claimed by some. True, the members of the kingdom have been in process of preparation since that date; but our Lord had not yet received for himself the kingdom, and had not returned to set it up in the earth. We do not even date it from 1874; for, as we understand it, the proper time for him to offer himself to Christendom </span><span class="font8">as </span><span class="font9">their king had not yet arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">That time came 1845 years after our Lord had ridden into Jerusalem and offered himself to the Jews as their king, in the spring of A. D. 33. And it was in 1878, then, that the process of setting up the kingdom began. There our Lord raised the sleeping saints from the tomb and joined them to himself, while his members upon the earth continued the work of making ready the remaining members of the body and of giving a world-wide witness of the coming change of dispensation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some might be disposed to think that the kingdom Is now all set up. But we do not so view the matter. These would argue that the great wind which blew away the gold, the silver, the brass, the iron, and the clay, like the chaff from the summer threshing-floor, was the World War. But we point out that some members of the kingdom class are </span><span class="font9">Still on the earth and that even since 1914 there is still some life, a little, in the Persian empire; some, a little, in the Grecian empire; and some in the remnants of the Roman empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sighting of the image still future</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We therefore wait until the stone class is all completed, and all joined to the Lord, before we can look for a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">complete</span><span class="font9"> fulfillment of tins picture, although a great pre-liiiiin.iiy vvoik is going on, and we doubt not that much of the veneer of ecclesiastical fraud which has covered the claims of earth’s kingdoms to be part of Christ’s kingdom has already been i emoved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is a great com tort to know that man’s efforts to rule during the times of the gentiles (and to a degree since) wete not in defiance of Jehovah, but by Ins permission until 1914 and since that time by ins toleration, and that now, shortly, the power which is rightly </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font9"> will be exercised for man’s deliverance from all his enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Unlike the gentile kingdoms, whose power has shifted from one to another, Daniel makes it plain that the Lord’s kingdom shall not be left to other people, that it will </span><span class="font8">have </span><span class="font9">no successors, for it will take the place of all other governments that have ever existed in the world or that now exist, and it shall stand forever and ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And finally Daniel sums up, for Nebuchadnezzar’s instruction, and for ouis ‘•Forasmuch as thou savvest that the stone was cut out without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hei eafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Our text is quite to the point. The kingdom of the world has been Satan’s kingdom. It is taken from him by Messiah, in a gieat time of trouble; and it becomes the kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. There are stages m this process. The work as a whole is done suddenly, but not instantaneous!} It is characteristic of the laird to do things by processes. The process of removing gentile rule is under way, and the day of the Lord is at hand. Would that all might see it and bend, as they must, to his righteous will.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Just a line of appreciation of the beautiful spirit manifested in </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Wvilh Tow tr.</span><span class="font9"> I have just finished rereading the .iitide. Approved Workmen”, in the January 15 issue. There aie certainly some very helpful thoughts in that article. I feel very grateful to my Father above for the tools he has provided, and I feel further thankful for the instructions he gives us in their use through </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font9"> and the brethren in Christ. It is my earnest and sincere desire to become an approved workman. This is also my prayer on behalf of those whom the Lord has placed in positions of great responsibility; and not only those, but all those that love the appearing of our Lord and Savior. I am learning to appreciate more and more that each one of the saints is a channel for the holy spirit </span><span class="font8">of </span><span class="font9">truth. </span><span class="font8">A </span><span class="font9">good channel has no stagnant water in it, but </span><span class="font8">is </span><span class="font9">ever receiving the pure water and passing it on to others to be refreshed and quickened. So all the true disciples are springs of water flowing out to all. But only as we are in close communion with our Head can we pass the life-giving draught on to others. May we each one keep in contact with the great reservoir through humility and patient endurance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">With fond anticipation for the great love-feast in the kingdom, I remain,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Your brother through the atoning blood,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Frank Fekel, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">If, J.</span></p>

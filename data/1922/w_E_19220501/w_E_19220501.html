<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">THIS JOURNAL AND ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font6">HIS journal Is one of the prime factors or instruments iu the system of Bible instruction, or “Seminary Extension”, now bo‘n* presented in all paits of the civilized world by the Watch Tovvlr Bidte &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, chaiferod A. D. “Lor the Promotion of Christian Knowledge”. It not only serves as a class room where Bible students ma&gt; meet in the study ol .ie thine Word but also as a channel of communication through which they may be reached with announcements of the Society’s contentions and of the coming of its tiaveling icpresentatives, styled “Pilgrims”, and refreshed with reports of its conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our “Berean Le*son*” are topical rehearsals or reviews of our Society s published Studies most entertainingly arranged, and very helpful to all who would meiit the only honorary degiee which the Society accoidb, viz, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Veibi Dei Minister</span><span class="font6"> (V. D. AI.), which translated into 1 nghsh is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Minister of God’s Word.</span><span class="font6"> Our treatment of the International Sunday School Lessons is specially for the older Bible students and teacheis. By some this feature is consideied indispensable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tin* journal stands fiimly for the defense of the only true foundation of the Christian’s hope now being so generally repudiated —redemption through the precious blood of “the man Chnst Jesus, who gave himself a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ransom</span><span class="font6"> [a corresponding price, a substitute] tor all’. (I Peter 1:19; 1 Timothy 2 : C) Building up on this sure foundation the gold, silver and precious stones (1 Corinthians 3: 1115, 2 L’eter 1:5-11) of the Word of God, its fuither mission is to “make all see what is the fellowship of the mystery which. . .has been hid m God, ... to the intent that now might be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of God”—“which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed”.—Ephesians 3:5-9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It stands free from all parties, sects and creeds of men. wIdle it seeks more and more to bring its every utterance into fullest subjection to the will of God in Christ, as expressed in the holy Scriptures. It is thus free to declare boldly whatsoever the Lord hath spoken—according to the divine wisdom granted unto us to understand his utterances. Its attitude is not dogmatic, but confident; for we know wheicof wc affirm, treading with implicit faith upon the sure promises of God 31 is field as a trust, to be used only in his service: hence our decisions relative to what may and what may not appear in its columns hum be according to our judgment of Ins good pleasure, the teaching of his Word, for the upbuilding of his people in grace and knowled’e. And we not only invito but urge oug readers to prove all its utterances by the infallible Word to which referente is constantly made to facilitate such testing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the church is “the temple of the living God”, peculiarly “his workmanship” ; that its construction has been in piogress throughout the gospel age—ever since Christ became the world’s Redeemer and the Chief Corner Stone of his temple, through which, when finished, God’s blessing shall come “to all people”, and they find access to him.—1 Corinthians 3 : 1G, 17; Ephesians 2:20-22 ; Genesis 2S : 14 ; Galatians 3:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That meantime the chiseling, shaping, and polishing of consecrated believers in Christ’s atonement for sin, progresses; and when the last of these “living stones”, “elect and precious,” shall have been made ready, the great -Master Workman will bung all together in the first resurrection : and the temple shall be filled with his glory, and be the meeting place between God and men throughout the Millennium—Revelation 15:5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the basis of hope, for the church and the world, lies in the fact that “Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">every </span><span class="font6">man,” “a ransom for all,” and will be “the true light which bgbteth </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">every man that cometh into the woild”,</span><span class="font6"> “in due time”.— Hebrews 2:9; John 1:9 ; 1 Timothy 2:5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the hope of the church is that she may be like her Lord, “see him as he is,” be “partakers of the divine nature’/ and share his gloiy as bis joint-heir.—1 John 3:2; John 17:24; Romans 8:17; 2 Peter 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the present mission of the church is the perfecting of the saints for the future work of service; to develop in herself every gi ace, to be God’s witness to the world; and to prepare to be kings and priest* in the next age.—Ephesians 4:12; Matthew 24: 14 , Revelation 1:6; 20:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the hope for the world lies in the blessings of knowledge and opportunity to be brought to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font6"> by Christ’s Millennial kingdom, the restitution of all that was lost in Adam, to all the willing and obedient, at the bands of their Redeemer and Ins glorified churchy .when all the wilfully wicked will be </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">destroyed.—</span><span class="font6">Acts 3:19-23; Isaiah 35.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">As heretofore announced in The Watch Toweb, Brother Driscoll has been perfecting a miniature moving picture machine for the purpose of projecting pictures in homes, school houses, etc. Agreeable to the former notice In The Wai ch Tower. we publish the following notice, which we lune recened from Brother Driscoll. All communications concernin&quot; these machines and pictures should be addressed &gt;is indicated</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Kinemo moving picture projection machine, intended for inexperienced persons to operate, has been completed and quantity production started. For illumination, the projector is equipped for connecting up with the ordinary house electric lighting service. In the country, or elsewhere, where no electric service is available, an extension cord can be connected with .my automobile headlight socket or storage battery and good illumination secured. When piojecting, the operator can stop indefinitely on any picture or title to make explanatory remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The machine weighs only ten pounds and whether used exclusively at home or taken to the home of neighbors or friends in town or country, will well serve for witnessing the truth in a way that will be remembered and talked about. Films to be sent out with the projector, are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Palestine, showing scenes taken in connection with Brother Butherford’s recent trip, proving the fulfillment of prophecies respecting the return of the Jews to Palestine.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark7"></a>THE GENTILE TIMES</span></h3>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then 1 will punvsh you seven times more for your sins.&quot;— Leviticus 26:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A NOTHER test is on. Who will weather the storm? X—\ It is a test of faith. “According to your faith be</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">^it unto you.” During the time of the harvest there have been special tests of faith at fixed intervals. Call to mind the shaking that came with the discussion, in this journal, of the covenants. Then came the shaking relating to the Vow ; then followed another shaking with the fuller discussion of consecration and justification; then follow ed the test concerning the Seventh Volume; and then another test in 1918 concerning the harvest and the work. From all these fiery tests the greater majority of the coir-eciated have emerged unscathed; but some, because of bitterness of heart, have become blind of vision, gone out of the truth and back into the world, being led away by the error of the w icked. There is a reason for this. Let us examine the facts concerning the reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Lucifer was a ci nature of light and power and of great beauty. Beholding his own beauty and being impressed with his own wisdom and ability, he concluded to put into operation a plan of his own, different from God’s arrangement and the earning out of which would make Lucifer great like unto Jehovah. In his heart he became disloyal to God, turned away from the light and truth, and became the wicked one. I’jobably Ins intentions were good when he first began to exercise his wisdom and to be impressed with his own importance. Ambition turned him blind and embittered his heart. Since then he has sought by fraud and deceit and other wrongful means to tinn all away from Jehovah. God has permitted this deflection of the great and brilliant creature Lucifer to be made prominent in his Word for some good purpose. The evident purpose is, that all of his other intelligent creatures might learn the proper lesson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">AMBITION’S FRUITAGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Ever and anon there arises some one who has been following the Lord, for a time at least, who possesses a measure of beauty of mind and character, and possibly of person—one who takes himself too seriously. He succeeds in convincing himself that the Lord has appointed him to look after things divine and to lead God’s people out of the wilderness. As he goes on m this way, he becomes convinced m his ow n mind that the 1 ,ord mad° a mistake m selecting Brother Russell as that servant; and this doubt leads to the conclusion later on that Brother Russell was not “that servant” at all lie begins to doubt what Bi other Russel) wrote, and so expresses himself. Now he disregards the Loid's V. ord, which says: “Trust in the Lord with all tnine h; art; and lean not unto thine own understanding In .ill thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.” Thus disregarding this admonition, and being led on by the subtle influence of the adversin. he convinces himself that it is his solemn duty to undo all the things that Brother Russell taught and to turn the church’s vision in the right waj. He prepares a manuscript and charts in support of same, setting foith his views. Submitting it to others and being advis'd that his thoughts are wrong, he constiues this to mi an a de-irc to prevent him from permitting hi- light to 'lune, and disregards such advice. So thoroughly i&gt; he impressed that he mud thus teach the people and undo that which has been taught, that he begins the publication of his thoughts and to send these forth to the consecrated. His aigiiments seem plausible to those who make only a superficial examination, and especially to those who have ioigoltcn what they were taught. Doubt arises in the minds of some who thus read. Now the test is on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">QUESTIONS DISCUSSED YEARS AGO</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">About a year ago there began some agitation concerning chronology, the crux of the argument being that Brother RiuseU was wrong concerning chronology and particularly in error with reference to the gentile times. More than fifteen years ago these questions were raised and thrashed out, and so clearly did Brother Russell set forth the facts in Volume II of Studies in the Scriptures and in The Watch Tower, that it seemed a waste of time and space now’ to further discuss the matter m this journal; and the subject was dismissed on that ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Seeds of doubt once sown and permitted to gmminate in the heart grow until the doubter turns to ait ism</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">or positive opposition. If the person holding the doubt takes himself too seriously, thinking more highly of his own importance than he should think (Romans 12: 3), or where he permits bitterness to abide in his heart, darkness is almost certain to ensue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Agitation concerning the error in chronology has continued to increase throughout the year, and some have turned into positive opposition to that which has been written. This has resulted in some of the Lord’s dear sheep becoming disturbed in mind and causing them to inquire, Why does not The Watch Tower say something? Is not its silence tantamount to an admission that our chronology is wrong?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">From time to time the question of publishing something in this journal has been considered. Each time the Lord has seemed to interfere, until now. Why should such be the case? Our opinion is that the Lord has permitted the delay in the reviewing of the question of chronology since the agitation was begun in order to give those who had the wrong condition of heart an opportunity to manifest themselves, and to give the others an opportunity to have their faith tested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">FAITHFULNESS IS LOYALTY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To be faithful means to be loyal. To be loyal to the Lord means to be obedient to the Lord. To abandon or icpudiate Ilie Lord’s chosen instrument means to abandon or icpudiate the Lord himself, upon the prin-ciji'e that he who rejects the servant sent by the Master thoieby rejects the Master.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There is no one m present truth today who can honestly say that he received a knowledge of the divine plan from any source other than by the ministry of Brother Russell, either directly or indirectly. Through his prophet Ezekiel Jehovah foreshadowed the office of a servant, designating linn as one clothed with linen, with a writer's nikliorn by his side, who was delegated to go throughout the city (Christendom) and comfort those that sighed by enlightening their minds relative to God’s great plan. De it noted that this was a favor bestowed not by man, but by the Lord himself. But ni keeping with the Lord’s arrangement he used a man. The man who filled that office, by the Lord’s grace, was Brother Russell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jesus dearly indicated that during his second presence he would have amongst the church a faithful and wise servant, through whom he would give to the household of faith meat in due season. The evidence is overwhelming concerning the Lord’s second piesence, the time of the harvest, and that the office of &quot;that servant” has been filled by Brother Rusnell. This is not manworship by<sup>r</sup> any means. It matters not who Charles T. Russell was—whether he was a doctor, a hod-carrier or </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">seller of shirts. St. Peter was a fisherman; St. Paul </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">lawyer. But these matters are immaterial. Above all, these men were the chosen vessels of the Lord. Regardless of his earthly avocation, above all, Brother Russell was the Lord’s servant. Then to repudiate him and his work is equivalent to </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">repudiation of the Lord, upon the principle heretofore announced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">FULL TEST OF FAITH</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But every one who has a desire in his heart to shine at the expense of the reputation of the Lord’s chosen servant, or who meditates the building for himself of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">reputation amongst men that it may be said of him that he was particularly wise — such a one is almost certain to have an opportunity to attempt to realize his desires. Every one of the consecrated who has the inclination of heart to follow such self-constituted leaders is almost certain to have an opportunity to have a full test of his faith. For this cause there arise from time to time conditions which operate as a test </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">the faith of God’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Again the test is on. This time it is on chronology. And following this lead, it will be found that the road of doubt and opposition will carry one into doubting the second presence of the Lord, the time of the harvest, the office of “that servant” and the one who filled it, the evidences of the end of the world, the inauguration </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">the kingdom, the nearness of the restoration of man, and finally to a repudiation of God and our Lord Jesus Chn&gt;t and the blood with which we were Ik,light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The opening crevice for the enemy thus to blast at the Rock of Ag is is now made by the rai-nig of the qui -l ion concerning the gentile time-' Some thus nn-pre -cd with their own vi-dom begin to hold fcith the argument that the gentile Innes h'-gan w itli the beginning of the reign of Nebuel’adiie/.zai m the year 625 B. C.; hence could not end m 1914 ; hence the present work of the church is wiong, and the course of action should be reversed. The holding of such views blinds one to the present events, minimizes the importance of the tremendous-evidences of the end of the age, causes those who have been active to cease to be witnesses for the Lord, and being thus led away by the error of the wicked one, they fall away from st adhr-tiiess.—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font9"> Peter 3: 17, 18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">With giatitude to God lor what he has done for us, with supreme love for him. with a heart’s sincere desire to be led by him, with humble and sincere supplication that he bold us by the hand and keep us m the light, let us come to an honest examination of the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“TIMES”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The word ‘ gentile” is a term used to distinguish the nations of earth aside from the Jews, the Jews being God’s cl-osen people, with whom he made a covenant. The “gentile times” is a period of time during which the gentiles shall exercise imperial or kingly power over the affairs of earth. God constituted Israel his chosen people above all other peoples. (Exodus 19:6) This favor they were to enjoy provided they remained obedient to the Lord Jehovah. For their disobedience he permitted them to be punished from time to time, the punishment being inflicted by other nations. (Judges 3:14; 4: 2, 3; 10: 7, 8; 13 : 1) Jehovah warned the nation of Israel that should they fail to profit by these chastisements thus inflicted, he would punish them </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">seven times.</span><span class="font9"> “If ye -will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sms.”—Leviticus 26:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font9">“time”, as used in the Scriptures, has reference to </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">year, either symbolic or literal. Symbolic time is reckoned according to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9"> lunar year of 360 days. (See </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A 89.) The </span><span class="font9">rule for counting symbolic time is a day for a year. (Numbers 14: 33, 34; A-91) One </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">time</span><span class="font9"> being 360 years in duration, seven </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">times</span><span class="font9"> would be a period of 2520 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">With Israel God established the true religion, commanding that the people should worship him and have no other god. (Exodus 20:1-3) Satan, the prince of devils and the ruler of the gentile nations, established vith those nations the false religion; and the gentiles were taught to worship devils, symbolized in various foims and images. Jehovah erected a shield for the children of Israel by providing in his law the severest penalty for worshiping dev iE. Time and time again Israel went off after the false religion, worshiping the demon gods; and for this they were punished.—Lev iti-Cib 26: 1-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It must be apparent to all careful students that the period of the gentile times would be a penod of great punishment to Israel, and that that period of time must begin with some specific punishment marking the beginning of the gentile times definitely and must continue for a definite period of seven times, or 2520 years. The question at issue is, When did this period of the gentile times begin and when is the end thereof<sup>?</sup> These facts cannot he proven by profane history, because such history is made by men who acted as agents of Satan’s empire and hence were unreliable; for Satan is the father of lies. (John 8:44) Let everyone who wishes to be bound by such authority do so : but surely all Christians will want to stand by the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Au absolutely safe rule to follow, therefore, is this: Wbeie the testimony of the Bible is clear and plain, follow that always. Where secular or profane history is corroborated by the Bible, such testimony may be considered for what it is worth as cumulative evidence. Where secular or profane history is contrary to the Bible, follow' it never.— Romans 4:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">OPPONENTS’ CONCLUSIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To av oid auy confusion we will state that the dates B.C. in this article signify the number of years before Christ, as v\e have beeu accustomed to stating them; exactness might, however, sometimes call for the previous year, as the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">name</span><span class="font9"> of the year, as distinguished from the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">number</span><span class="font9"> of full years elapsed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Those who have attempted in recent months to prove that the chronology as prepared and published by Broth</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">er </span><span class="font9">Russell is wrong make statements not only contradicting Brother Russell, but contradictory in themselves. Some of the Lord’s dear children have permitted these contradictory and conflicting statements to disturb their minds. This has been the result of a failuie to study carefully the evidence as set forth m the Bible and in the Studies in the Sckh’tukes. We v]«jk of them here as opponents because opposed to or coni indicting the chronology we have. The conclusion of some of these is as follows, to wit: “That the divine base of power to the gentiles began with the accession of Nebuchadnezzar to the throne in the year 606 B. C : hence the accession of Nebuchadnezzar to the throne marks the beginning of the gentile times, and the 2520 years therefore would run out m 1914”. Again they .state that “Zedekiah was taken captive and Jerusalem fell m the year 587 B. C.; thus showing that the lull end of the gentile times and the fall of gentile governments is indicated to take place m 1934&quot;. (It v ill be obseiu.d that this position is contradictory within itself.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another of the opponents says that Nebuchadnezzar began his reign in the-fourth yeai of .Jehoiakim; that the servitude of Israel to Babylon began the same year; that the desolation began in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar; that the fourth year of Jehoiakim and the first year of Nebuchadnezzar was 606 B. G ; and that the desolation began nineteen years thereafter, which shows the overthrow of Christendom m 193,1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Each of these opponents claims that the position taken </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">is supposed, by secular history</span><span class="font9"> and that theielore Biother Russell vias mistaken m his conclusions about the chronology. They also admit that </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">then method. of counting time changes the period of the l-ings</span><span class="font9"> from 513 years to 494 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">BROTHER RUSSELL’S CONCLUSIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The conclusion of Brother Russell, reached from a careful examination of the Scriptures, is succinctly stated in Volume II of Studies in the ScRirTinms, page 79, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The Bible evidence is clear and strong that the ‘tunes of the gentiles' is a period'of 2520 years, from the jear B C GOG io and including A. D 1914. This lease ot universal dominion to gentile governments, as we have already seen, began with Nebuchadnezzar—</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">not when Ins reign bemih, </span><span class="font7">but when (lie typical kingdom of the Lord passed away, and the dominion of the whole world was left in the hands of the gentiles The date for the beginning of the gentile times is, thereloie, definitely marked as at the time of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">icmoral of Ilic iioiin</span><span class="font7"> of God's typical kingdom </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">fiom Zeilcl. mil.</span><span class="font7"> their lasl king &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A carefid examination of the Biblical proof herein set forth demonstrates that in their position on chrono-ogy the opponents of Brother Russell are wrong, and that Brother Russell was right. In arriving at a conclusion, Brother Russell did not always state each Jop in detail; but his conclusions arc plainly and definitely stated and are based upon the Scriptures. Wo must indulge the presumption, therefore, that he pursued </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">sound course of reasoning in arriving at these conclusions if we find the conclusions are correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We now propose to prove that the gentile times, a period of 2520 years, began in the year 606 B. C. and ended m the fall of the year 1914; and that the ouster proceedings began promptly thereafter and on time. In making this proof we rely upon the Bible and not upon secular or profane history. We consider the points in the order numbered hereinafter, as follows, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">POINT I: TENURE OF KINGS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The time and duration of the reign of the various kings of Israel is one of the Biblical methods of establishing the various dates in our chronology. Saul, Israel’s first king, began to reign in the year A. M. 3009. The total period of the tenure of the kings of Israel was, to wit, 513 years. The reign of the kings ended with the year A. M. 3522. No careful Bible students will dispute these facts. No other conclusion can be reached except by juggling the figures and ignoring the Bible statements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In Tub Watch Tower of May 15, 1896, page 112, is set forth a statement of chronology from Adam to 1914. These figures are given in </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Anno Mundi</span><span class="font9"> time. According to this calculation it is proven by the Scriptures there cited that Jehoiakim’s reign began in the yeai A. M. 3500, which corresponds to the year 628 </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">B. C. </span><span class="font9">The beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim, being definitely fixed, gives us a starting point from which to count the time and by which to determine the universal reign of Nebuchadnezzar and to reach a proper conclusion relative to the gentile times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The first year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, king </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">Babylon, was the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim. “The fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.” (Jeremiah 25:1; see also Jeremiah 46: 2) Since Jehoiakim’s reign began in 628 </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">B. C., </span><span class="font9">it follows that the first year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign was the year 625 B. C. There was no attack made upon Jehoiakim by Nebuchadnezzar in the year of 625 </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">B. C., </span><span class="font9">the first year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign. There could have been no attack as a king made by him earlier than that. It was in that fourth year of Jehoiakim’s reign and the first year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, to wit, the year 625 B. C., that the prophet Jeremiah delivered the divine decree pointing out that it was God’s determination to leave the land of Palestine desolate as a punishment upon Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">THE FIRST ATTACK</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font9">the fourth year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar (and therefore the eighth year of the reign of Jehoiakim), Nebuchadnezzar made his first attack against Jerusalem; and in that year Jehoiakim became the servant or vassal to the king of Babylon. Three years later, to wit, in the year 617 B. C., the same being the eleventh year of the reign of Jehoiakim, Nebuchadnezzar took Jehoiakim a prisoner and put him to death. The record reads: “Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign [628 B. C.] ; and he reigned eleven years [617 B. C.jin Jerusalem. In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">his servant three years',</span><span class="font9"> then he turned and rebelled against him [Nebuchadnezzar].” (2 Kings 23: 36; 24:1) “Against him [Jehoiakim] came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.”—2 Chronicles 36: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The carrying away of Jehoiachin to Babylon was in the year 617 B. C. Jehoiakim’s reign having begun in 628 B. C., and he having reigned eleven years,' necessarily it ended in 617 B. C. At that time Nebuchadnezzar was in the eighth year of his reign. Thus the Scriptures prove beyond any question of a doubt that the captivity did not begin in the first year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign; nor did the desolation begin there. It is therefore seen that it is utterlv impossible for the gentile times to have begun in the first year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, to vit, 625 B. C. No one claims that the gentile times began in 617 B. C., the year Jehoiakim vas taken and put to death, as indeed such a claim could not be successfully made in view of the evidence hereinafter set forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HISTORIC CORROBORATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is reasonable to suppose that the Jewish historian Josephus, being deeply interested in his own people, would be more reliable in fixing dates than would the historians of the gentile nations. We do not at all need the testimony of Josephus, but because it is corroborated by the Bible we cite it here for what it is worth. He plainly states that no attack was made upon Jerusalem at the beginning of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign. We quote from </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Antiquities of the Jews,</span><span class="font9"> Book X, Chapter VI, pages 365-367:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“In the fourth year of Jehoiakim, one whose name was Nebuchadnezzar took tlie government over the Babylonians; who at tlie same time went up with </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7">great army to the city Carchemish, which x\as at Euphrates; upon a resolution that lie had taken to figlit with Necho king of Egypt, under whom all Syria then was. And when Necho understood tlie intention of the king of Babylon, and that this expedition was made against him, he did not despise his attempt: but made haste with a great band of men to Euphrates, to defend himself from Nebuchadnezzar. And when they bad joined battle he was beaten, and lost many thousands of his soldiers. So the king of Babylon passed over the Euphrates, and took all Syim, as far as Pelusium, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">excepting Judea.</span><span class="font7"> But when Nebuchadnezzar had already reigned iour years, which was the eighth of .Telioiakim's government over the Hebrews, tlie king of Babylon made an expedition with mighty forces against tlie Jews, and required tribute of Jehoiakim ; threatening upon his refusal to make war against him. He was affrighted at his threatening, and bought his peace with money ; and brought the tribute he was ordered to bring for three years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“But on the thiid year, upon hearing that tlie king of Babylon made an expedition against the Egypt inns, he did not pay his tribute. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“A little time ulterwaid, tlie king of Babylon made an expedition against Jehoiakim, who received him into the city; and this out of fear of tlie foregoing predictions </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font7">Jeieimah, as supposing he should suffer nothing tliat </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font7">terrible; because be neither shut the gates, uor fought against him. Yet when he was come into the city, he did not observe the covenants he had made; but he slew such as were in the flower of their age. and such as were of the greatest dignity, together with their king Jehoiakim, whom lie commanded to be thrown before the walls, without any bimal, and made his son Jehoiachin king of the country, and of the city; he also took the principal persons m dignity for captives, three thousand in number, and led them away to Babylon. Among these was the piophet Ezekiel, who was then but young And this was the end of king Jehoiakim, when lie had lived thirty-six years, and reigned eleven But he was succeeded in the kingdom by Jehoiachin, whose mother was Nehusta, a citizen of Jerusalem. He reigned tluee months and ten day's&quot;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehoiachin reigned only three months and ten days, and was succeeded by Zedekiah, whose reign began in the year 617 B. C. “Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days m Jerusalem: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord. And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babv Ion, w ith the goodly vessels of the house of the Lord, and made Zedekiah, his brother, king over Judah and Jerusalem. Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.’' (2 Chronicles 36:9-11) Thus it is clearly seen that the reign of Zedekiah, which began in 617 B. C.. lasted eleven years and ended in 606 B. C. He was the last king of Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">POINT II: DECREE FOR PUNISHMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A decree means a judicial detei inination by one having authority, defining w'hat must be done. It means a sentence pronounced that must be enforced. Necessarily decrees are always entered before they are enforced. Jehovah pronounced through Moses a divine decree or judgment that should be enforced against Israel as a punishment, and the decree is in these words: “I will make your cities waste, and bring your </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">sanctuaries unto desolation,</span><span class="font9"> and 1 will not smell the savor of your sweet odois. Anil 1 will bring the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">land into desolation:</span><span class="font9"> and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.'’—Leviticus 26:31, 32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It must be conceded by all that the taking of certain of the Israelites as prisoner.-: and carrying them away to Babylon would not constitute an enforcement of this deciee. The putting to death of Jehoiakim m no wise fulfilled the decree. Besides after his death Zedekiah continued to be the king of Israel and reigned for eleven years. Surely during those eleven years the city was not in waste; nor were the sanctuai in desolation. Surely during that period the Jews oflcied their sacrifices in Jerusalem. When, then, in all the history of Israel do we find any record of the enforcement of this divine decree? The Scriptures answer that it had its fulfillment in the latter part of the reign of Zedekiah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">God had restated the decree of judgment against Israel through Jeremiah. Concerning Zedekiah the last king, we read: “He did that w'hich was evil in the sight of the Lord his God, and humbled </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font9">himself before Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the Lord. And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar. . . . They mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against his people. . . . Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees [Nebuchadnezzar], who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age: he gave them all into his hand. And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon. And they </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">burnt the house of God, and brake dov’n the wall of Jerusalem,</span><span class="font9"> and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof. And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons untd the reign of the kingdom of Persia: to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath,</span><span class="font9"> to fulfill threescore and ten years.”—2 Chronicles 36 : 12,13,16-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">NO CAPTIVITY BEFORE 617 B. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This occurred at the end of the reign of Zedekiah, to wit, in the year 606 B. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In corroboration of this we cite the further record dealing with the same subject matter, made by Ezekiel the prophet. Ezekiel counts the time mentioned in his prophecy from the date that he and other Jews were taken captive and carried away to Babylon. (Ezekiel 1: 1, 2; 8:1; 20:1) This captivity' began in the year 617 B. C. In the seventh year of that captivity, in the fifth month and the tenth day of the month, to wdt, about the first day of August, 610 B C., which was the fifteenth year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, the divine decree for the punishment of Israel was restated in other phrase by the pi ophet Ezekiel.—Ezekiel 20:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The same judicial determination of Jehovah as set forth in Leviticus 26:31-33 was restated by Ezekiel in the following words: “Therefore thus saith the Lord God Because ye have made your iniquity to be remem-beied. m that your transgressions are discovered, so that in ail your doings your sms do appear; because, I say. that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand. And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end, thus saith the Lord God: Remove the diadem, and </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">take off the crown;</span><span class="font9"> this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high. I will overturn, overturn, overturn it; and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it [to] him.”—Ezekiel 21:24-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">'1'liis restatement of the divine decree occurred four years before its enforcement. Brother Russell says that the enfoi cement of this divine decree marks the begin-nine of the gentile times; and Brother Unwell i*- light. —B-19, Ufl </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">2,</span><span class="font9"> 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">GENTILE TIMES BEGAN 606 B. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">God had promised that the sceptic should not depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh come. (Genesis 49: 10) It will be observed that the decree of punishment did not include the removal of the sceptre. It merely states: “Remove the diadem, take off the crown”. The crown is a symbol of imperial dominion or rulership; while the sceptre is a symbol of imperial authority or right. The enforcement of this divine decree, therefore, took away from Israel the dominion, which dominion should be enjoyed by the gentiles until the coming of him whose right it is, namely, Shiloh, the Messiah. The gentile times, therefore, could not possibly begin until the enforcement of this divine decree. (Ezekiel 21: 24-27) And since it was pronounced by the prophet Ezekiel while Zedekiah was the king, it conclusively proves that the gentile times did not begin with the captivity of Jehoiaknn or of Jehoiachin. but did begin with the overthrow of Zedc-kiah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">About August 1,606[606f]B.C., Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon broke down the city of Jerusalem and destroyed it, took Zedekiah and put out his eyes, and desolated the city and the land. (Jeremiah 39:2-9) Thus from another line of proof is definit &quot;h established that the divine decree was enforced m 606 B. C., ending the dominion of Israel and permitting the gentiles to establish a </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">universal</span><span class="font9"> dominion. Here, at this time, it was that Jehovah, figuratively speaking, withdrew from the stage of action and permitted Satan, through his representative, Nebuchadnezzar, to establish a universal cm pne. Here it w’as that Satan became the ‘god of the whole world’; and from that time forward his rule through earthly representatives is symbolized by a wild bea&lt;t.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">POINT III: DISCREPANCY EXPLAINED</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Opponents of Brother Russell’s conclusions on chronology attempt to show that the divine decree against Israel began to be enforced in the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim, and cite as authority Daniel 1:1, which leads: “In the thud year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it”. A careful examination of this text at once shows that there is a disci epancy. In the third year of Jehoiakim’s reign, as we have heretofore seen, Nebuchadnezzar was </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">not yet l-in&lt;i</span><span class="font9"> of Babylon. He did not become king until a year later (Jeremiah 25:1); and the plain Scriptural statements heretofore cited show’ that Nebuchadnezzar's first attack against Jerusalem began in the eighth year of the reign of Jehoiakim. Hence it was impossible for him to attack in the third year of Jehoiakim’s reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The proper and reasonable explanation of this Scrip-tuie (Daniel 1: 1) is tin.-,: That the “third .ycai&quot; here means the third ye&lt;u of the vassalage ol Jehoiakim to Nebuchadnezzar; or “th'' third year of Jehoiakim [as vassal king]”. It is plainly stated m the Scriptur s, as heretofore set forth, that in the eighth year of the reign of Jehoiaknn as king, Nebuchadnezzar came against him and Jehoiaknn became his seivant and paid tribute to Nebuchadnezzar </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">thiee yeius</span><span class="font9"> and then rebelled against him. (2 Kings 24:1) Therefore, it was exactly three years later the beginning <sub>o</sub>f his vassil.ige, to wit, the year 617 B. C., that Nebuchadnezzai besieged Jerusalem and took Jehoiakim, and at the nirne time carried away the prophets Daniel, Ezekiel, and others, including Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, whose names were changed by the king to Shadrach, Meshach, and Abcd-nego, respectively. Daniel wrote his prophecy while he was in Babylon; and it is quite apparent that he counted time from the date of the beginning of the vassalage of Jehoiakim as king. Manifestly, then, the aiguincnt of Brother Russell's opponents that the gentile times began during the reign of Jehoiakim must fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">POINT IV: NEBUCHADNEZZAR’S DREAM</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Again, opponents of the chronology as set forth by Brother Russell state that the beginning of the gentile times is marked by the accession of Nebuchadnezzar to the throne of Babylon, and m support of this contention cite Daniel 2: 1. This argument must likewise fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Daniel 2: 1 reads: “In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him”. The dream itself is set forth in verses 31 to 35 of the same chapter. Nebuchadnezzar the king had brought before him magicians, astrologers, sorcerers, and Chaldeans to interpret his dream, and all of them failed. “Then Arioch [the captain of the king's guard] brought m Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him. 1 have found a man of the captives of Judah, that w ill make known unto the king the interpretation The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art them able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?”—Daniel 2:25, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is utterly impossible for this transaction to have occurred in the second year of the reign of Nebuihad-nezzar for the following reasons, to wit: (1) because Daniel, in the second year of Nebuchadnezzar, was </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">not in Babylon and could not then have been taken before the king:</span><span class="font9"> (2) because he was taken to Babylon in the year 617 B. C., which was the eighth year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar; and (3) because Daniel was not permitted to appear before the king until after he had been m Babylon </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">three</span><span class="font9"> years, according to his own testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The facts heretofore set forth definitely establish the correctness of reasons (1) and (2). We proceed to the examination of (3):</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the eighth year of his reign Nebuchadnezzar carried a«m to Babylon many of the Jews, among whom were Daniel and the three Hebrew children. The king gave an order unto Ashpenaz, the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of these Israelites ‘bn whom was no blemish, but well favored, and skilful in all w isdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability m them to stand in the king’s palace, and whom they might teach Ilie leaimng and the tongue of the Chaldeans”. In other w ords, those so selected were to be educated and framed. “And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank; so nourishing them </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">three years,</span><span class="font9"> that </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">at the. end thereof</span><span class="font9"> they might </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">stand before the Icing.</span><span class="font9"> Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Now </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">at the end of the days</span><span class="font9"> [to wit. three years] that the king had said that he should bring them in then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in be-foie Nebuchadnezzar. And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">theiefore stood they before the Icing.”—</span><span class="font9">Daniel 1: 3-6, 18, 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">DATE OF DREAM WAS 614 B. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">According to the king’s decree, this transaction of Daniel’s standing before the king could not have occurred until the end of the three years of instruction, which was, to wit, in the year 614 B. C. and m the eleventh year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar. Evidently it was about one year thereafter that Nebuchadnezzar had the dream in question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Now to remove all doubt as to the correctness of this conclusion, we find that the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Variorum</span><span class="font9"> rendering of this text (Daniel </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">2:1) is:</span><span class="font9"> “And in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">twelfth</span><span class="font9"> year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams,” etc. The circumstantial evidence produced by Daniel himself proves that the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Variorum</span><span class="font9"> rendering is correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The explanation of Daniel 2: 37, therefore, is that in the interpretation he told the king in substance that Jehovah had determined that he (Nebuchadnezzar) should be the head of the image observed. We are not left to guess about matters of this kind, because the apostle Paul plainly says that God “calleth those things which be not as though they were”. (Romans 4:17) Otherwise stated, Jehovah had determined that Nebuchadnezzar should occupy this position; but at that particular time Zcdekiah was the king, had been king for three years, and reigned thereafter eight years before Nebuchadnezzar really assumed the position as head of the image.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">POINT V: THE REIGN OF CYRUS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The argument hereinbefore made proves that the gentile times as a period is based upon the tenure of office of the Jewish kings. This evidence shows that it was the year 606 B. C. when the crown (power to exercise dominion) was taken from Israel, and a gentile king </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">peinutted to</span><span class="font9"> exercise that power. Now we introduce another line of proof by beginning at a later fixod date and counting back, measuring the time by unimpeachable Biblical testimony, which also shows the beginning of the gentile times to be 606 B. C. The latter line of proof is a complete corroboration of the former.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">God had foretold through his prophet Isaiah (see chapters 44 and 45) that the kingdom of the Babvlon-ians under Nebuchadnezzar would be overthrown and that then Israel would be returned to her own land. The Loid’s prophet even named the victorious king, Cyrus. The date of the beginning of the reign of Cyrus therefore becomes important.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The reign of Cyrus is shown by the testimony of many secular or profane historians. This testimony is heie cited for two reasons: (1) because there is &lt;-c.il cely a doubt about the coirectness of the date as slated ; and (2) because the date is coiroborated by the Scriptural proof. Hence the secular history may be used as cumulative testimony under the i tile. We give below a number of these authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">REIGN BEGAN 536 B. C., SAY HISTORIANS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Smith's </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Dictionaiy,</span><span class="font9"> under the title &quot;Captiv liics of the Jews”, pages 99 and'100, says: “The B.ibv Ionian captivity was brought to a-close by the decree of Cyrus, B. C. 536”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Sanford’s </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Concise Cyclopedia of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">IUIujiohs</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"> Knon ledge, </span><span class="font9">page 471. gives the date of the beginning of Cyrus’-reign as 536 B. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the Scriptures we read: “Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the Lord spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the Lord stirred up the spirit of CvriH king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also m writing saying, Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the Lord God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to build him an house m Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of all Ins people? The Lord his God be with him, and let him go up.” (2 Chronicles 36:22,23) “Then toso up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised; to go up to build.the,house of the Lord winch is m Jerusalem. . . . Also Cyrus the king htmi-H forth the vessels of the house of the Lord. wb-r- v-buchad-nezzni' had brought forth out of Jerusalem. . . . All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jeru-salem.”(Ezra 1: 5, 7,11)“And when the seventh month was come and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem. . . . They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia ”— Ezra 3 :1, 7; see also Ezra 5 :12-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This Scriptural proof shows that the Jews’ captivity to Babylon ended with the first year of the reign of Cyrus; and the secular historians above cited show that that year was 536 B. C. In the next succeeding point will be observed the Scriptural proof showing that the date 536 B. C. is correct, which proof also shows that the date 606 B. C. is the beginning of the gentile times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">POINT VI: DESOLATION NOT CAPTIVITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Much confusion has resulted from using the words captivity, servitude, and desolation as synonymous terms. The Jews were m captnity more than once and for different periods of time; but there was only </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">one </span><span class="font9">period of desolation. It is true that the Jews were in captivity during the period of desolation, but such captivity was merely incidental to the desolation. Their first captivity to Nebuchadnezzar began in the year 617 B. C.. and not until eleven years thereafter was the land made desolate, without an inhabitant. What God intended for us to understand must be determined by the language employed in his decree for the punish -menr of Israel. Therein he said “I will make your cities waste, and bring \our sanctuaries unto </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">desolation,</span><span class="font9"> and I will not .smell the «avor of your sweet odors. And I will bring the land into </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">desolation:</span><span class="font9"> and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.” (Leviticus 26:31, 32) Time and again the Lord restated the decree through the mouth of Jeremiah: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">“1 </span><span class="font9">will make Jerusalem heaps, and a den of dragons; and </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font9">will make the cities of Judah </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">desolate,</span><span class="font9"> without an inhabitant”. (Jeremiah 9:11; see also Jeremiah 33:10; 34:22) As heietofore seen, this divine decree was enforced with the overthrow of Zedekiah in the year 606 </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">B. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The period of this desolation of the land is fixed by the Scriptures as seventy years. The purpose of the enforcement of the divine decree as set forth m 2 Chronicles 36: 18-20 was “to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths; for as long as she </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">lay desolate</span><span class="font9"> she kept sabbath. to fulfill </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">threescore and ten years&quot;.</span><span class="font9"> (Verse 21) The prophet Jeremiah had said “This wdiole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years”.—</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Jere</span><span class="font9">miah 25:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">DESOLATE FOR SEVENTY YEARS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The proof heretofore adduced shows that the reign of Cyrus began in the year 536 B. C.; and that the first year of his reign marked the end of the desolation of the land, in which year he issued a decree for the rebuilding of Jerusalem. The Scriptures cited show that this period of desolation was to be seventy years in duration. Counting back, then, seventy years from 536 B. C. brings us to 606 B. C., completely corroborating the other line of proof showing that 606 B, C. is the date when the crown was removed from Israel, when the desolation began, and when the gentile times began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Incidentally, here we remark that much has been said about the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">nineteen years</span><span class="font9"> of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar before the overthrow of Zedekiah; and an attempt is made to show that this indicates that there is a parallel of nineteen years to be fulfilled with reference to the close of the gentile times and the complete fall of gentile governments. There is absolutely no justification for any such conclusion. It is not warranted by reason nor by Scriptures. The nineteen years have nothing whatsoever to do with the gentile times, their beginning, end, or the overthrow of governments. It has merely been injected to confuse the minds of some. We might as well say that because a cat has “nine lives” it would take nine years to kill all the cats, as to say that, because Nebuchadnezzar reigned nineteen vears befoie he overthrew Zedekiah, theietoic the oveithiow ot gentile dominion would be nineteen year- after 1914. 'Ilie argument is unreasonable, unscriptiiral, and nonsensical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">POINT VII: THE END — OUSTER PROCEEDINGS BEGUN</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Upon all the evidence there cannot be the slightest doubt about the gentile times. The Ica-e of universal dominion to the gentiles could not begin as long as there was a vestige of God’s typical kingdom. It matters not when the heathen king Nebuchadnezzar began his reign. The nineteen years of his reign so much spoken of are wholly mimalerial. foreign to the issue. The possession and exercise of imperial dominion by Israel, symbolized by the crown, ceased when that crown was removed, to wit, when the la=t ruler of Israel was dethroned. That occurred m 60(&gt; B. C. There the dominion to the whole world was left in the hands of the gentiles, which date is by every line of proof fixed as 606 B. C. There the period of gentile dominion began. Being seven symbolic times in duration, to wit, 2520 years, it ended in 1914 A. I).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But, say those who oppose Brother Russell’s conclusions, what has happened to show that the gentile times have ended? Are not -the gentile governments still exercising ruling power’ Are not things going on they weie from the beginning?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We answer. Everything has happened that the Lord foretold would happen With the close of the (Jewish) year 1914, he whose light it is took unto himself his great power and began his reign; the nations were angry, and the day of God’s wrath began.— Ezekiel 21: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">27;</span><span class="font9"> Revelation 11:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">GENTILE TIMES ENDED IN 1914</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On the first day of October, 1914, Brother Russell walked into the dining-room at Bethel and, elappmg his hands, announced m stentorian tones • “The gentile times have ended! The kings of earth have had their day 1” Brother Russell was right then. He was right when he wrote Volume II concerning the gentile times. If the contention of his opponents concerning chronology is right, then everything that transpired in 1914 and since must be disregarded as evidence of Messiah’s kingdom. It is admitted by them that the tenure of office of Israel’s kings must be changed in order to agree with some historians who were agents of Satan. Such a change would put out of joint all our chronology, and destroy the value of the dates 1874, 1878, 1881, 1910, 1914, and 1918. Such would be equivalent to saying, “Where is the proof of his presence?” “My Lord de-layeth his coming.”—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font9"> Peter 3:4; Matthew 24:48.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Is any Christian so blind that he cannot see what happened in 1914 and thereafter, evidencing the end of the gentile times? By way of illustration: </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font9">tenant holds a piece of property under a lease, which lease expires January 1, 1914. The tenant refuses to vacate. The landlord, in order to legally obtain possession, must institute ouster proceedings. God granted to the gentiles </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">lease of dominion for a term of 2520 years, which term or lease ended about August, 1914. Then came forward the Landlord, the rightful Ruler (Ezekiel 21: 27), and began ouster proceedings. <sup>T</sup>t is not to be expected that he would suddenly wipe erything out of existence, for that is not the way the Lord does things; hut that he would overrule the contending elements, causing these to destroy the present order ; and that while this is going on he would have his faithful followers give a tremendous witness m the moi Id, so that the teachable people might recognize the hideousness of Satan's empire and the blessedness ottered by the Messianic empire, to the end that many of these might be brought through the trouble and be ready for the restoiation blessings that are to follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">To this end, exactly on time, the ouster proceedings began in the World War, followed quickly by famine, pestilence, and revolution, the rehabilitation of Palestine by the Jews, persecution of Christians in various parts of the earth, offenses amongst those who claim to be Jesus’ followers, while the love of many waxed cold. All of these things Jesus stated would constitute a trying time, a trial of faith and patience, which would be so severe that only ‘he that endureth to the end should be saved’. (Matthew 24: 7-13) While these ouster proceedings are in progress, he commands his followers to tell the people that Satan’s empire has ended; that the gentile times have ended; that the world has ended, and here is the proof of it; that the kingdom of heaven is at hand; that the time of restoiation is here; that millions now living will never die, and that “this gospel [good news] of the kingdom shall be preached m all the world for a witness unto all nations, and then shall the end eome”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Are those who oppose the conclusions of Brother Russell concerning chronology obeying this command of giving the witness? Do we find those who are in harmony with his conclusions concerning the gentile times obeying this injunction and preaching the evidences of the kingdom and that millions now living will never die? Surely everything has happened exactly as the Lord said it would happen concerning the end of the gentile times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What will transpire in 1925? Wait upon the Lord and see. Be faithful to present privileges. Every Christian’s faith is on trial. “According to your faith lie it unto you.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark9"></a>TEXAS CONVENTION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font18">A</span><span class="font9"> FOUR-DAY convention of the Bible Students was held at Dallas, Texas, March 9 to 12, Pilgrim Brother Edward Stark serving as chairman. The other speakers were Brothers V. C. Rice, S. H. Toujian, G. R. Pollock, 0. Magnuson. Scott Anderson, A. H. Macmillan, and Brother Rutherford. The convention was attended by friends from Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Missouri, the largest number of friends attending on any one day being about five hundred. It was indeed good to be there, and on every face M<sup>r</sup>as observed the happy Christian smile. Frequently the remark was made: ‘This is the best convention I have ever attended’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">These conventions serve as a great uplift and strength to the friends, particularly the isolated ones. They have very little fellowship with others, and coming to a convention of several days is to them like transformation into an entirely different atmosphere. The testimony meetings gave strong evidence of this, the friends showing by their testimonies that they are not only rejoicing in the opportunities of service, but are growing in knowledge of the Lord’s plan and the fruits and giaces of the spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On Sunday morning a question meeting was conducted by Brother Rutherford and we append hereto a few of the questions and answers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font9"> Is Jehu a type of the great company?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font9"> No. The Scriptures clearly indicate that Jehu did not represent a spiritual class. Some time ago the Society requested the Pilgrim brethren not to discuss in their discourses Jehu in antitype, because it has been deemed a wise course to take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font9"> At a business meeting of the ecclesia should the chairman make a motion or vote upon the motion ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font9"> One occupying the chair should keep order, direct the proceedings of the meeting, etc.; but it would not be proper for the chairman while in the chair to make a motion. If he desires to make a motion or speak upon the motion he should leave the chair and invite somebody else to occupy it temporarily. 'Che chanman should not seek to exercise undue influence over the class, because of his position as chairman. As </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font9">voting upon the motion, he should not vote unless there is a tie, in which event he may vote.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Question:</span><span class="font9"> When one loves the Lord and the Lord’s people dearly , loves the principles of righteousness and truth, and yet finds m himself or herself a weakness that keeps the mmd often on eaithly things, can such a one be spirit-lr gotten ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Answer:</span><span class="font9"> Tin- question describes the condition of many who are spu it-begotten. The aposilo Pau) plainly says- “The flesh lu-teth against the spud, and the spmt against the flesh and those are conf i,in Ilie one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would’’. (Galatians 5:17) Again the Apostle -ay s: “1 know that m me (that is, m my flesh) dwell.-th no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to pei-form that which is good </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font9">find not. Foi the, good that I would, I do not but the exrl which 1 would not. that </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font9">do. Now if </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font9">do that I would not, it is no more </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font9">that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.’’- Horn 7’18-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The real battle-ground of the now cieature is m the mind, and the great battle that a new crcatum ba&lt; i&lt; to keep the mind off things earthlv and keep it on spiritual things. How, then, can a new cieature gam this victory? The apostle Paul answers that we mud got it through Jesus Christ our Lord. Our year text is exactly m line: ‘’'Thanks be to God. who giveth us the victoiy through our Lord Jesus Christ’’. (1 Corinthian.-, 15:57) Then says the Apostle: “Walk m the spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh”. (Galatians 5:16) That is to say, walk in the same direction the Lord walked, in the way of righteousness. Because of a failure, do not give up. If a mistake is made, if one, falls, remember the proverb: “A just [righteous] man falleth seven times, and riseth up again”. (Proveibs 24:16) Again remember that the Apostle says’ “These things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, w<sup>r</sup>e have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the nglitcous.” (1 John 2: 1) 'Thi- i- a part, of the Christian’s warfare. The Lord has giaeiously provided that if we come to him in time of need, asking for strength and help m his name, he will grai f it It is the one who continues in faith, and faithfully, patiently' endures to the end, that will gain the ciown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For lack of space all the questions answered aic not hole given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Sunday afternoon a public meeting at the Coliseum was adilre-sed by Brother Rutherford on “Millions Now Living Will Never Ihe&quot;. About 3.200 attended. The usual keen interest was manifested by the hearers, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">great many purchasing the books at the conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Withal, the convention was a splendid success from the spiiitual standpoint: and every one went away happy and rejoicing that they had been privileged again to have some fellowship in the spirit while this side the vail.</span></p>

Therefore we urge the friends to arrange for at least one public meeting during the visit of the Pilgrim. To this end a good, well-located, reputable hall show 1 be provided, special efforts being made for the public witness Sunday afternoon or evening, as it may be convenient to the clas«. Remember, dear brethren, the blessed privilege we have to be coworkers with the Lord m the proclamation of the message now due. Hence we ask your cooperation with us and with the Pilgrim brethren in this behalf.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark13"></a>GOOD HOPES FOR. 1922</span></h3>
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font9">HE work of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is the preaching of the gospel of Messiah’s kingdom. Every consecrated child of God is privileged to participate in this work. Brother Russell always outlined the work during the year m proportion as the Loid provided the money through his consecrated children. We continue to follow that example, as appropriate in the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Each one who has been enlightened by the truth appi eciates the fact that this blessing came to him as </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">gracious gift; and as he has a zeal for the Lord he appreciates his privilege of using time, energy, and monev m telling the message to others. Some are not blessed with endowments for going about and telling it </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font9">others, while they' are blessed with some money which they desire to use m the Lord’s service, to the end that hungry souls might be fed upon the precious truths, as </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font9">have been fed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The custom of setting aside each week so much to be used m the Lord’s service has always proved beneficial to the giver. A notice to the Society that you hope to give so much enables us to outline the work, based upon what is expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Since a large portion of such donations are used to defray the Pilgrim expenses, we have thought it wise to </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font9">let the notice for Pilgrim requests and the “Good Hopes” notice appear in the same issue of The Watch Tower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Heretofore it has been our custom to print one page</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">in The IVatcii Tower to be clipped out by' the friends and sent to us; but tin® defaces the issue, and some of the brethren have complained about this; hence we are adopting the present method. Upon receipt oJ this issue of The Watch Tower kindly write two cards, exactly alike. One of these jmt aside for your own record of what you have promised; the other send to us. Oi, if you prefer, put it in the form of a letter, keeping a copy of the letter for join own convenience. We suggest that it be brief and that nothing else be written except the following: “By the Lord’s giacc I Impe to be able to give to his work for spreading the gospel during the ensuing year the amount of .$ . &nbsp;&nbsp;..I will</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark15"></a>JEREMIAH TRIED FOR SEDITION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">--May 28 — Jeremiah 2G--</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of ■fchoiah &quot;—,)ei cm tafr 2G 13. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">EFFORTS TO THROTTLE FREE SPEECH--JEBEMIAH PREFIGURED JESUS—SHIFTING FROM BLASPHEMY' TO SEDITION— TERFVIIVH</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">REPRESENTED THE BODY ALSO.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">U</span><span class="font7">NDER the evil rule of King Jehoiakim, Jeremiah, under the Lord’s guidance, foretold the coming destruction of the city and temple. The effect of such a prophecy should have led the people to self-examination, prayer and fasting, and a full return to loyalty to God. But according to Jeremiah’s account it was a time of great moral delinquency lie pictures a terrible condition of the people — a prevalence of dishonesty, of slander, murder, adultery, false swearing and open licentiousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">’Die priests led the people in an angry attack upon the Prophet. He was arrested, charged with speaking evil of his city declaring its forthcoming destruction. How foolish Could merely the Prophet’s declaration bring the thing to pass? And if he were the Lord’s prophet could their assault upon him turn aside the divine intention But the spirit of sin is not the spirit of a sound mind as is ■■he s|kii it of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is noteworthy that it was the priests and the false prophets who, on tins occasion, called for the death of a true prophet And alas! this has not infrequently been the case Nearly all the persecutions of Jesus and his apostles and his followers throughout the age have come from professed sei vants oi God. What heart-searching this should biing to eveiy one of us lest, peradventure, we should be similarly overtaken in a fault and “be found lighting against God&quot;, and should bung upon ourselves severe condemnation No doubt these religious teachers twisted their reasoning faculties to such an extent that they considered then-course a just one—possibly’ they even thought that it was love on their pint for the people; or perhaps they persuaded themselves that they were moved in their persecution, not by hatied, envy, malice, but by’ love for God At all events their course shows what an easy matter self-deception is, and their mistake bids us beware and scrutinize carefully our own conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As Jeremiah told them of the time of trouble nearing, so some oi God’s people today are declaring that the greatest time of trouble evei known in the world’s history is at hand—that, ere it reaches its zenith, it will mean the most terrible anarchy, the only relief fiom which will be the establishment of Messiah’s kingdom in power and gieat glory. And there are some today so foolish as to think that the trouble can be put off or avoided altogether by silencing those who cal! attention to the Word of the Lord. (Daniel 12-1) Let us not be found fighting against God. He is mighty and will prevail, and all of his purposes, he assures us, will surely’ be accomplished</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jeremiah impressed the jurors, the princes of the people. He reaffirmed every' word that he had uttered and declared himself ready to die if need be; but he urged reformation. The princes, more just than the priests and false prophets, acquitted Jeremiah, although his winds condemned iliem So it has been at various times in the history of the tiiith. If it had not been for the moderation of the civil power many a reformer would have been put to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">JEREMIAH PREFIGURED THE CHRIST</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jeremiah’s offense was that he had said, standing in the com t of the temple, “I will make this house like Shiloh, and I will make this city’ a curse to all the nations of the earth”. Shiloh was the point at which the aik. i epi esenting the div ine presence, had remained from the time of the conquest of Canaan in the days of Joshua down to mid including the days of Samuel the prophet. It was m Shiloh that Samuel had his vision ot the coining judgment upon the house of Eli the high jaiest, and it was from this place that Ilie ark vveni foilh to be captured i.i battle by ihe Philistines Here Eli died, filled with dismay at Ihe I of the ark The message had jneviou-lv come to Jeieniiali: “Go ye now unto my place which was m Shiloh, wheie I set my name at the In-st and see vv 1ml I did to it loi ihe wickedness ot my people Israel”. (Jeiemiah 7:12) Nol a ruin remains standing to mark the site ot this ancient cilv.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ilovv very similar aie these words of Jeieniiali to the words of our Loid. As Jeremiah predicted that the temple would become iike Shiloh, a ruin from which the presence and the glory ot the Lord had utterly’ departed, so our Lord, viewing Herod- temple, had said to his followeis; “See ye not all these thing-’' Veiily I say unto you. ’I here shall not be left here one -tone upon another, that -hall not be thrown down.”—Matthew 24 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And as Jeremmh said “I. will make this city a cui-e to all the nations of tlie e.uth”; so our Loid said: “O Jerusalem. Toriisnlem thou that kille-t the piophets mid sionest them which are sent unto thee, how oiten would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathered! her chickens under hei wings and ye would not! Behold, your house is left unto you de-olate.”—Mal thew 23: 37. 3S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As the priests and the prophet- were the ones that stnied up the jieople against Jeremiah, so “the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false w.iiies-es against Jesus, to put him to death”. (Matthew 26.59) A- ihe formal charge against Jeremiah was that he had utfeied words in tlie name of Jehovah, and thu- ostensibly blasphemed, and had ulleied his wolds against Jehovah’s house, so it was alleged ag.iin-t our Lord Jesus that he bad committed blasphemy iMallliew 26:65) because of a series of similar statements concerning Jehovah’s house.—Matthew 26 61.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As all the people blindly coopeiated with the priests and prophets and “were gathered against Jeremiah in tlie house of the Lord” so the same jieople lli.it but five days previous bad strewn their garments in front of the Lord and said, “Ble-sed be the King that lomelh in tlie name of the Lord” (I.like 19-”8) were readv at tlie instigation of tile chief priests and rulers, to say respecting Jesus, “Away with this man, mid release unto us Barabbas”.—Luke 23 13-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As the princes of the people the civil magistiates, tried to appease the wrath of the p-tests and prophets and people against Jeremmh. so Pilate and Herod were both unconvinced that Jesus was a malefactor and made several attempts to accomplish ins release Pilate’s words are very’ plain on this point “Bi hold. I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man, touching those things whereof ye accuse him: no, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him”.—Luke 23 • 14, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">SHIFTING FROM BLASPHEMY TO SEDITION</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As the priests and tlie prophets argued before the magistrates and the people, saying: “This man is worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">city&quot;</span><span class="font7"> (verse 11), thus adroitly shilling the real ground of their accusation fioin one of blasphemy to one of sedition, so the chief pi’n-sts and elders and all the council n i-sed upon the accusation ot lihi-pbemy against Jesus “and said, He is guilty of death” (Matthew 26:66), but when they came before Pilate th*</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">charge was that he had called himself the King of the Jews (Mark 15:2, 12, 26), a charge not of blasphemy but of sedition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All the gospel accounts agree that the charge upon which Jesus was iound worthy of death by the chief priests and elders was one of blasphemy, but that immediately upon their access to the presence of Pilate “they </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">began</span><span class="font7"> to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a king&quot;. (Luke 23.2) And as they </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">began </span><span class="font7">with a charge of sedition, so they </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">ended,</span><span class="font7"> for the final argument that won Pilate over to do as they wished was the crafty statement: “If thou let this man go, thou art not Cmsar’s friend: whosoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against Ctesar”.—John 19:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As Jeremiah bore witness that the words he had uttered were not his own but that the Lord had sent him with the message, so our Lord testified, “I have not spoken of myself; hut the Fathei winch sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak”.—John 12:49.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As Jeremiah meekly submitted to his fate without protest. sajing. “Behold, I am in jour hand; do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you” ; so it is testified of our Lord bj the prophet, that “he was oppressed, and he w'as afflicted; yet he opened not his mouth; he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth”.—Isaiah 53:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But as Jeremiah solemnly warned those who had his fate In their hands &quot;Know ye for certain, that if ye put me to de.itli, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof”(verse 15), so Jcsti-s “when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept oxer it. saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thiue eyes. For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee: and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side;... and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another, because .thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.” (Luke 19:41-44) And a little later, when the plans of the priests and elders had carried, he said: “Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. For behold the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps that never gave suck.”—Luke 23 : 28, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These points of correspondency .between the experiences of Jeremiah and those of our Lord, (1) the declarations against God’s temple: (2) the declarations against the holy city; (3) the movement of the priests and elders against him; (4) the drawing of the people to the support of their machinations, (5) the intervention ot the civil authorities; (6) the accusation of blasphemy (7) shifted, in the presence of the civil authorities, to that of sedition; (8) the solemn witness that the message was from Jehovah; </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">(9) </span><span class="font7">the meekness of the messenger; and (10) the declaration that the fate of the city and its inhabitants was inextricably bound up with the decision that was in the process of the making—all these points, and others that could be deduced, indicate a purpose on the part of Jehovah that Jeremiah should in some sense of the word serve as a type of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">JEREMIAH REPRESENTED THE BODY ALSO</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As Jeremiah represented Jesus the head, so he represent</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ed </span><span class="font7">the body also, down at the tune when the declaration against the nominal spiritual temple is in order, which is now. And just as a declaration against the nominal ehurch involves not only the church, but the whole city which is associated with this nominal temple, or in other words the whole structure, ecclesiastical, political, financial and social, so the message of the Jeremiah class today inevitably' involves the other elements which go to make up the antitypical Jerusalem, the city which we sometimes call by the name Christendom, Babylon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As the Jeremiah class novv<sup>r</sup> proceeds to declare faithfully the coming days of vengeance upon the antitypical temple and city, so the first to take note of their activities and to plan against their hbeuies and their lives are the antitypical priests and prophets, the hereditary and the selfappointed religious rulers of the present time, the clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As the first stop of the clergy of his day was to try to draw the people to their support and into an attitude of hostility against Jeremiah, so we see even now going on about us a gieat effort put forth by' the cleigy to try to persuade the people that the Bible Students are the worst people m the world. So eager ate they in their efforts that in one city m eastern Pennsylvania where there are but five of this way in the whole town, and they' are among the finest people in the entire community, the pastor of one of the churches has recently preached a series of eight consecutive sermons against this little company, in the effort to stir the whole people against them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The next step in Jeremiah’s experiences was the intervention of tlie civil authorities. We saw' such an intervention during the World War, and without a doubt the charges then were blasphemy in the inner ciicles of eccle-siasticism : but sedition w'as the charge before the magistrates. These items are all fresh in the minds of those who have been in this way since the interesting experiences in the spring of 1918.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As Jeremiah solemnly declared that he was not uttering his own ideas, but was faithfully portraying the Word of God, so the Jeremiah class in 1918 declared and continue to declare that the message of present truth is not of human invention but is from the Lord and must be delivered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In this connection we recall tlie remarkable words of Pastor Russell in The Watch Tower seventeen years ago (Z’05-254) : “Occasionally, and only occasionally need we enter upon the role of Jeremiah to be announcers of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">evil conditions coming upon the world. Pei haps as we get down in the stream of time, nearer to the actual trouble, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font7">may see it to he </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">our duty</span><span class="font7"> to call attention to it more particularly. . . . When that time shall come, such advice will doubtless run counter to the wishes and ambitions of some who will then be in power, and it may be that </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font7">shall be </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">imprisoned</span><span class="font7"> or otherwise maltreated, after the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ex</span><span class="font7">ample of Jeremiah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As Jeremiah meekly submitted to his fate, even so the members of Christ should continue to do. Jeremiah long ago enacted in pantomine some of the experiences through which the church has passed and may yet pass in this, the most interesting period of the world’s history. We leave </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font7">history of Jeremiah at this point to continue it in subsequent lessons, which contain experiences of equal or even greater correspondency and interest to all of like precious faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Golden Text is a declaration that it is as obligatory upon us to mend our ways, our settled habits, as to amend the individual acts that go to make up those ways, those habits. None can defend themselves or others by saying of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font7">evil, discourteous, unkind, insincere speech or mannerism, ‘It is my way’ or ‘It is his way’. If the way is wrong, then why have such a way? </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Amend</span><span class="font7"> it You can do it. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font7">requires effort; effort leads to character; and without character none shall ever sit with Christ upon his ibrona.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">THIS JOURNAL AND ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS journal la one of the prime </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">factors or instruments in the system of Bible instruction, or </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Seminary Extension”, now being </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">presented in all parts of the civilized world by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, chartered A. D. 1884, “For the Promotion of Christian Knowledge”. It not only serves as a class room where Bible students may meet in the study of the divine Word but also as a channel of communication through which they may be reached with announcements of the Society’s conventions and of the coming of its traveling representatives, styled “Pilgrims”, and refreshed with reports of its conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Our &quot;Berean Lessons” are topical rehearsals or reviews of our Society’s published Studies most entertainingly arranged, and very helpful to all who would merit the only honorary degree which the Society accords, viz., Perbi </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dei Minuter</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> (V. D. M.), which translated into English is </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Minuter of God’s Word.</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> Our treatment of the International Sunday School Lessons Is specially for the older Bible students and teachers. By some this feature is considered indispensable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">This journal stands firmly for the defense of the only true foundation of the Christian’s hope now being so generally repudiated —redemption through the precious blood of &quot;the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ransom</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> [a corresponding price, a substitute] for all”. (1 Peter 1:19; 1 Timothy 2: C) Building up on this sure foundation the gold, silver and precious stones (1 Corinthians 3: Ills ; 2 Peter 1:6-11) of the Word of God, Its further mission is to “make all see what is the fellowship of the mystery which. . .has been hid in God, ... to the intent that now might be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of God”—&quot;which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed”.—Ephesians 3:5-9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It stands free from all parties, sects and creeds of men, while it seeks more and more to bring Its every utterance into fullest subjection to the will of God In Christ, as expressed in the holy Scriptures. It is thus free to declare boldly whatsoever the Lord hath spoken—according to the divine wisdom granted unto us to understand his utterances. Its attitude is not dogmatic, but confident; for we know whereof we afilrm, treading with implicit faith upon the sure promises of God. It is held as a trust, to be used only in his service; hence our decisions relative to what may and what may not appear in its columns must be according to our judgment of his good pleasure, the teaching of his Word, for the upbuilding of his people in grace and knowledge. And we not only Invite but urge our readers to prove all Its utterances by the infallible Word to which reference Is constantly made to facilitate such testing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">That the church is “the temple of the living God”, peculiarly &quot;his workmanship” ; that its construction has been in progress throughout the gospel age—ever since Christ became the world’s Redeemer and the Chief Corner Stone of his temple, thiouuh which, when finished, God's blessing shall come &quot;to all people”, and they find access to him.—1 Corinthians 3 :16, 17 ; Ephesians 2 :20-22; Genesis 28:14; Galatians 3 : 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">That meantime the chiseling, shaping, and polishing of consecrated believers in Christ's atonement for sin, progresses ; and when the last of these &quot;living stones”, &quot;elect and precious,” shall have been made ready, the great Master Workman will bring all together in the first resurrection ; and the temple shall be filled with his glory, and be the meeting place between God and men. throughout the Millennium.—Revelation 15:5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">That the basis of hope, for the church and the world, lies in the fact that “Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">every </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">man,” “a ransom for all,” and will be &quot;the true light which lighteth </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">every man that cometh</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> into </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the wot la&quot;,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> “in due time ’.— Hebrews 2.9; John 1.9 ; 1 Timothy 2:5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">That the hope of the church Is that she may be like her Lord, “see him as he is,” be &quot;partakers of the divine nature',’ and share his glory as bls joint-heir.—1 John 3.2; John 17.24; Romans 8:17, 2 Peter 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">That the present mission of the church is the perfecting of the saints for the future work of service: to develop in herself every grace; to be God’s witness to the world ; and to prepare to be kings and priests in the next age —Ephesians 4 3 2; Matthew 24: 14; Revelation 1:6; 20:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">That the hope for the world lies In the blessings of knowledge and opportunity to be brought to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> bv Christ's Millennial kingdom, the restitution of all that was lost in Adam, to all the willing and obedient, at the bands ot their Reueeiuet and ln» glorified church, when all the wilfully wicked will be </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">destroyed.—</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 3 :19-23 ; Isaiah 35.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;God . . . giveth us . . . victory through . . . Jesus Christ.”— 1 Corinthians 15:51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">[1922 Year Text]</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">V</span><span class="font8">ICTORY for the new creature means life everlasting on the divine plane. Victory for the peoples of earth at the end of the Millennial age will mean triumph over death and the grave. It will mean life everlasting in the perfect human state, with a dwelling place on the earth then made fit as a habitation for perfect man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Since the happy day of Eden was turned into sadness by expulsion for disobedience on the part of Adam, man’s fight has been against the great enemy, death. He has made a desperate struggle for life and his long experience has fully demonstrated that man alone cannot gain life for himself. He needs a friend, a helper, a deliverer. God has provided for him every need and in due time man shall know of this provision and have an opportunity of availing himself of its benefits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The instigator of sin and he who has the power of death, Satan, the devil, has ever fought against man’s upward development and has succeeded in blinding the mass of humanity to the beneficent provision God has made for his deliverance and blessing. At this time mankind is actually starving to death for knowledge of God. Truly, as the Prophet says, ‘there is a famine in the land for the hearing of the word of God’. The mighty battle is now on between the forces of darkness and the forces of light, and the light is breaking through. Never before has the light shone forth with such brilliancy to illuminate the Christian’s eyes as now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This light shining forth from the Lord is indirectly having its effect upon the world. And why are these things so ? Because the heavens are opened. The higher things are being made known. The faithful and true and righteous One, he who is King of kings and Lord of lords, has come forth and is judging and making war against Satan’s empire for the deliverance of the human race. It is the day of God’s vengeance upon the invisible empire as well as the visible; and the King of glory, warring against the strongholds of error and wickedness, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font8">marching on to certain victory. They that have been called and chosen and that continue faithful are warring on this side; and faithfully holding out to the end, they shall stand triumphant with the Lord, and through him victory will be complete. But be it noted that those who shall be victorious must continue faithful, not for a time, but unto death.-—Revelation </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">8</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Knowledge and an appreciation of God’s wonderful provision is the basis for our faith. Lest we should grow weak in faith and become weary in well-doing; lest we forget the power that is exercised in our behalf assuring victory to the faithful, let us again consider who this mighty warrior is under whose banner it is our privilege to fight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WHO IS CHRIST?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Life everlasting in happiness is the desire of every intelligent creature. It is written: “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent”. (John 17:3) Every one to whom life everlasting will be granted must come to a knowledge of the truth concerning God and Jesus Christ, the great Redeemer. The church is privileged to have a measure of knowledge now; and during his righteous reign, when the evil one is restrained, then ‘all must come to an accurate knowledge of the truth’. Then all will come to know the Lord, from the least to the greatest. And this knowledge and obedience to it will bring life everlasting to the seeker after life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah is from everlasting to everlasting, the Eternal One. (Psalm </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">41</span><span class="font8"> : 13; 90:2; 106: 48) There was a time, therefore, when God was alone. It pleased him to begin and continue his creation. It was his will that the one first created by him should have preeminence in ah things. This distinction, honor and glory he conferred upon him whose name first was the Logos, was afterwards called Jesus, and is now the Christ, the Lord of glory. He was the beginning, “the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God”. (Revelation 3:14) From thenceforth he became the representative or active agent of Jehovah in the creation of everything that was created. “All things through him came into existence, and without him came into existence not even one thing which hath come into existence.” (John 1: 3, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham)</span><span class="font8"> The image, the expression and representative of Jehovah, was the first brought forth of every creature. We can have some conception of his greatness and majesty when we read: “Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature; for by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things were created by him, and for him: and he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body, the church; who is the beginning, the firstborn, from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell.”— Colossians 1: 15-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He is designated “the Word of God”. As spokesman or mouthpiece of Jehovah, his title originally was the Legos. Dr. Alexander Clark has well said concerning hi- title Logos: “This term should be left untranslated for the same reason that the names Jesus and Christ are left untranslated. As every appellative of the Savior of the world was descriptive of some excellencies in his person, nature or work, so the epithet Logos, which signifies a word, a word spoken, speech, eloquence, doctrine, reason, or faculty of reason, is very properly applied to him.” “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with [the] God, and the Word -was [a] god. The same was in the beginning with God.” (John 1:1-, 2) “And his name is called the Word of God.” (Bcvelation 19:13) St. John in his epistle to the church speaks of him as “the Word of life”. Through him Jehovah speaks the word that brings life to mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In order that man might be redeemed from the curse of sm and death, the life of this mighty One was trans-fencil from the spirit to the human plane. Before his birth as the man-child, the angel of Jehovah brought to Marv, his earthly mother, the message: “He shall bo gieat. and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David; and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end”.—Luke 1: 32, 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When he reached manhood’s estate, as provided by the terms of the law, he became a qualified, perfect high priest; and was designated as “'the Lamb of God”, to be slain that man might be relieved from the great sin committed m Eden and the effects that resulted therefrom. When he entered upon his earthly ministry, his forerunner announced: “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sm of the world”.—John 1: 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Eden God had provided a tree of life, which produced perfect food and which would sustain the organism of man and keep him alive forever if obedient to God’s law. Because of disobedience man was removed from that tree of life and no longer permitted to feed upon its perfect food; hence m due time he died. Jehovah made a covenant with Israel m which he promised to that nation life if they would keep his covenant. The Psalmist states the rule of God concerning life thus: “Tiust in the Lord and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed”. Thus the Lord states that all who will have life must trust him, be obedient to his laws, and thus do good; and shall therefore be fed upon the bread that brings life everlasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When some came to Jesus to know what they might do in order to work the works of God that would lead them to life, he answered: “Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world. . . . I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.” (John 6:32-35) Thus he designates himself as that sustaining biead provided by Jehovah for the life of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Light is a symbol of lilo. while darkness symbolizes death. For four thousand years the world had been m darkness, and when Christ appeared he was the light shining m a dark place. Aad those who have observed and followed that light have been blessed -with the opportunities for life. To the Pharisees Jesus said: “I am the light of the w orld: he that follow eth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life”.(John 8: 12) To his disciples he said: “As long as I am in the world. I am the light of the world”. (John 9: 5) As a great light, he has guided the seekers after righteousness into the way of life everlasting. He is the “Light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world”. —John 1: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The way to life was closed before the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. Although God had made provision in his law' that a perfect human life might be given as a ransom or redemptive price for Adam and his race, yet of all the people of earth none of them could by any means redeem his bi other or give to God a ransom for him. (Psalm -19: 7) God sent his bei ).■ d Son Jesus into the world to open the way of lite, that thereafter whosoever of mankind would believe upon him &gt;hall not perish but have everlasting life. (John 3 1G) As a pei-fect man, he came to give himself a random for as many as would believe upon his name. (Matthew 20: 28) He came that the people might have life aud that the faithful might have it more abundantly.—John 10:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was sin that deprived man of the right to life. “The wages of sin is death.” Theie could be no release from this condition of death except another perfect man willingly permit himself to be put to death as an offering for sin. Hence Jesus was made “to be [a] sm [offering] for us, who knew no sm, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him”. (2 Corinthians 5:21) By the grace of God he tasted death for every man. (Hebrews 2:9) He was that holy, spotless one, without blemish. Man’s redemption is not accomplished by an imperfect one, by himself, nor by corruptible things, “I ut w ith the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot,” who for that purpose was foreordained before the foundation of the world.— 1 Peter 1: 19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Christ Jesus was not haughty, self-centered, or austere, proud or ambitious. He was meek and lowly of heart. He gave all honor and credit to the Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font8">came to do the Fatbei's will and in this he delighted. He was a sonant among-! those who had the privilege of fellow ship with him. As he stated ‘‘I am among you as he that servoth”. (Luke 22 : 27) Being obedient to the Father's will, he humbled himself to the ignominious death of the cross. He died, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God. (1 Peter 3:18) It was not possible that he should be held in death, God having loosened the pains of death and raised him up to life. (Acts 2:24) He arose triumphant over death and the grave, “and being so raised, God hath made him both Lord and Christ” —Acts </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">2 :</span><span class="font8"> 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The plan of Jehovah was kept secret and none were able to know it until his due tune. This tact Je.-us pictured to St. John in vision. The heavenlv Father is shown as seated upon the throne, holding in bis hand a scroll sealed within and without, repiesenting his plan, until some one would prove his worthiness io open the seal and therein become the executor of the divine airangement. Inquiry is made as to who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof. None weie found m heaven or eaith And because, of this tact the messenger wept much. But one of the prophecies of old speaking, said: “Behold, the Lion ot the tribe of Judah hath prevailed to open the book”. By proving his loyalty to God even unto death, he was not only made Lord and Christ, but was given the great honor of becoming the executor of God's great plan, to whom was justly given the title “the Lion of the tribe of Judah’’, and upon whom was conferred all power in heaven and in earth. (Matthew 28:18) And now lie is Lord of lords and King of kings. (Revelation 17. If) Ho i- the Christ, and ultimately to him every knee shall bow of the things in heaven and m earth, and every tongue shall confess Christ as Lord, to the glory of God the Father.—Phihppians 2: 10,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Having gained the most exalted position in the universe, which he will hold forever, subject only to Jehovah, m him and by him Jehovah laid the foundation for the new<sup>r</sup> cieation. He therefore is the solid rock upon which the new creation is building. “Behold, I lav in Zion a chief cornerstone, elect, precious [a sure foundation] ; and lie that believeth on him shall not be confounded.”(1 1’etei 2:6; Isaiah 28: 16) At Pentecost, Jehovah, by Christ, began the selection of other living stones, chi.-eling, prepaung and fitting them for a place in the building of God. It is these to whom God giveth the victory through Christ. As we observe the care with which these have been selected, the gracious and loving provision made for their beginning and development, our faith is made strong, that he who began the good work will finish it to his own glory. Therefore we may he a-siircd that it we are m Chnst, and abiding there faithfully to the end, we shall have the victory over all the enemies of the new creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Foreshadowing the preparation and development of the new cieation, God established the tabernacle and its services amongst the Israelites. The court surrounding the tabernacle represented the condition of human perfection. The on]} entrance into the court was by the gate. The gate pictured Christ, the only way of entrance into justification. “I am the door [Greek, gate] : by me if any man enter m, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pa-tnre.” (John 10. 9) Thus he shows the way that leads to life and the way for acquiring the poi feet food that sustains one journeying to the goal. Ho plainly states that he is the way and that there is none other “I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” (John 14: 6) All other ways are false. He is the only true way</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Christ is our wisdom. He leads us into the ways of life everlasting provided by Jehovah. “Of him are ye m Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.” (1 Corinthians 1: 30) When we came to the Lord, presenting ourselves in full surrender, he showed us the right way. He imputed to us his merit and thereby became our righteousness. And then he presents us to the Father. By the Father we were justified and set aside for the Master’s use, begotten to the divine nature, and the sanctification or development began, which continues until our complete deliverance when we shall have gained the victory through our beloved Head and Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He is the Bridegroom and the chinch is (he bride. (John 3 29; Revelation 19: 7) He has betrothed unto him the church Ins bride and given her precious promises of -haring with him the habitation which has been in preparation for many centuries. To her he says: “I will betroth thee unto me forever; yea. I will betroth thee unto me m righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving kindness, and m mercies. I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness; and thou shalt know the Lord.” (Hosea 2:19, 20) He is the Head over the church which is his body. Be it known, then, that he exercises the greatest degree of care and watchfulness over those who are thus betrothed to him by being begotten, anointed and baptized into Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Called to the heavenly calling, the Christian is directed that it is his privilege and duty to follow in the footsteps of Jesus, who is his example. “For even hereunto were ye called; because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.” </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 </span><span class="font8">Peter 2:21) Of necessity' such following entails suffering upon the one who follows. Journeying along the narrow way, he soon finds that he is hampered by his own imperfect organism, and as a new cieature is set upon by his enemies, the world, the flesh, and the devil. The new cieature thus finds himself engaged m a deadly battle. Hi- flesh is one of his enemies, while other enemies operate through the weaknesses of his flesh. The mind of the flesh wars against the new mind. The old mind was long in control of the organism, because born in sin and shapen in iniquity. But now the new mind, the mind of Christ, has taken possession and must control ; hence the warfare is on. “The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary the one to the other, so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.”—Galatians 5:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Experience proves that St. Paul was right when he says: “Ye cannot do the things that ye would”. To win the victory, then, over the flesh what shall I do? The apostle Paul answers: “Walk in the spirit [follow the way of Christ Jesus and by him gain the victory], and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh”. (Galatians 5:16) While the new creature must continue to fight against the wrongful tendencies, never yielding to his adversaries, he must not become discouraged because of inability to think, speak or act perfectly. You make a mistake and you are truly sorry for it. Now what shall you do? Go immediately unto the Lord. He is the merciful Christ. He is the High Priest of our profession; he knows and understands the infirmities of those who walk in the narrow way. (Hebrews 2:17) “Let us therefore come confidently unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help m time of need.”—Hebrews 4: 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The mmd is the battleground. It is the mind that must be tiansformed. (Romans 12:2) The success in the battle of the Christian, how ever, will depend m large measure upon what occupies his mmd. For this cause St. John writes: “My dear children, these things writ<sup>n</sup> I unto you that ye sin not”. By this he means that the new creature should have in mmd the things discussed in his epistle concerning the Lord Jehovah and the Lord Jesus, the development of the church and the glorious things that are set before its members. The mind filled with such things will add strength to battle against the adversaries. But while in the flesh the Christian is not perfect. If because of weakness he stumbles, he must rise up and go on in the battle. “A just man falleth seven times and riseth up again.” (Proverbs 24:16) Therefore we should not become discouraged, but press on. Hence St. John says to the church: “If any man sin, vve have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous”. (1 John 2:1) As Advocate or Counsellor he appears in the presence of God for us. Not only is he an Advocate, but he is a Friend also, a true Friend at court. He is a Friend that sticketh closer than a brother (Proverbs 18:24), always unselfishly looking after the interest of his followers. What must we as his followers do to be sure of his friendship? “He that loveth with a pure heart, and hath grace upon his lips, shall have the king for his friend.&quot;—Proverbs 22:11. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To be misunderstood is a part of the experience of the Chiistian. Jesus was misunderstood, even by those who walked with him in the flesh for more than three yrais. Many will misunderstand you as his follower, and you may be mistreated because of this misunderstanding ; but be not discouraged. This experience may be to give you an opportunity to develop long-suffering. Love is long-suffering and kind. As one of his followers, St. Paul says: “Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief. Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.” (1 Timothy 1:15, 16) As a follower of Jesus you may be misjudged and your motives impugned as evil. Let each Christian have in mmd that man is not his judge, but that all must stand before the judgment seat of Christ (Romans 14: 10), and it is he that judges with a righteous judgment, for he is that Just One.— Acts 22:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Satan, the adversary of the new creation, the devil, as a roaring lion walks about seeking whom he may devour. (1 Peter 5:8) His chief concern is to destroy the seed of promise. Working through the weaknesses of the flesh, the organism of the church this side the vail, he stirs up strife amongst the brethren. In tins way he endeavors to devour them. “If ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.” (Galatians 5:15) If each one of Christ’s followers would keep m mind his oi her proper relationship to Christ Jesus, and therefore his or her proper relationship to each other member, a more strenuous effoit would be put forth to avoid the controversies such as described by the Apostle, which anse amongst the brethren. The followers of the Master should see to it that they do not lend themselves as instruments to Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They must keep up the warfare against this enemv. Not only is the warfare against Satan and the flesh and the spirit of the world, but against principalities, powers, and a host of demons. (Ephesians 6: 12) But when the battle is raging with fierceness round about, figbti”us within and fightings without, then is the time for brethren to stand shoulder to shoulder, fighting for the gospel of Jesus Christ and never quailing before the adversaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Conscious of our own weaknesses, and seeing we are beset by such a host of enemies, how could we ever hope to win against such great odds? Of our own selves we could not win; but let each one keep in mind that only self can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Romans 8: 30) Greater is he that is for us than all that can be against us, and if we abide in him, victory is sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Christ is the Captain of our salvation (Hebrews 2: 10), and it pleased God in bringing many sons to glory to make him (the Captain) perfect through sufferings. Hence he knows how to sympathize fully with those who are being perfected through like experiences and is not ashamed to call them brethren. Let each one, then, be of good courage and know that God will give us the victory through Christ Jesus our Captain, our Redeemer and Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is the Mighty One who is leading the hosts of heaven against the entrenched hosts of darkness and wickedness. It is the last time. The great battle is on. His armies are following where he leads and victory tn him is sure. His followers may be sure of victory if the” abide in Christ and his Word abides in them. They that are with him in this warfare and that will be victorious are the called and chosen ones who continue faithful even unto the end. This means that their love for Jehovah and for Christ Jesus is supreme; and to love God and love Christ means that we will do his commandments with a joyful heart.—1 John 5: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He is Christ, the obedient one. He said: “I have kept my Father’s commandments and abide in his love. If ye keep my commandments ye shall abide m my love.” (John 15: 10) Not only did Christ Jesus keep the commandments of Jehovah, but he did it zealously; and this zeal and earnestness with which he proved himself the true and faithful Witness led to persecution. It is written concerning him: “The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up”. (Psalm 69: 9) As sons of God, members of the house of sons, each one must have that zeal peculiar to the Lord’s house, a loving, glowing zeal to do with our might what our hands find to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">OUTLOOK FOR 1922</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The year 1921 just closed was a year of wide witness for the truth. United in heart and in action, the members of the Lord’s army this side the vail have gone forth declaring the message: ‘The kingdom of heaven is here, millions now living will never die’. During the year colporteurs, sharpshooters, and class workers combined numbered almost 10,000 persons in the United States alone. This number of workers should be doubled during the year 1922 just opening. Every consecrated child of God, seeing and appreciating the fact that the kingdom of heaven is being set up, should eagerly grasp the opportunity to let others know about it and thereby be a faithful witness to the Lord and a comforter to those that mourn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These workers in 1921 called on 6,067,544 families; and counting 3.5 persons to a family, approximately 21,000,000, or about one-fifth of the population of the United States, were afforded an opportunity to hear the truth. Suppose the number of workers should be doubled during the year 1922, and these workers by putting forth a great effort should double the number of calls made, that would mean practically 84,000,000 persons would have an opportunity to hear the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is now on hand in possession of the classes a limited number of the combinations — “The Finished Mystery,” “Can the Living Talk with the Dead?” and “Millions” booklets—and these should be in the hands of the people within a short while. This will leave a clear field for the campaign to be made with the new book, “The Harp of God”. This book is specially adapted for beginners in Bible study and is proof conclusive that millions now living will never die. With this book the same ground that has been gone over can be again canvassed. Every one to whom a “Millions” booklet was sold last year should want “The Harp of God” this year. It contains the message that will comfort the sad and bring joy to the hearts of those who are looking for a better time. We should keep in mind that before any one can get life everlasting he must have a knowledge of God and of Christ. It is our privilege to help others get that knowledge. The principal work, therefore, is not to sell books, but to induce the people to acquire the knowledge that is necessary. Every Sunday school teacher will find the “Harp” book particularly valuable in the preparation and teaching of lessons in the Bible. Every Sunday school pupil will find it of great aid as a textbook. In the nominal churches and Sunday schools are doubtless yet many who have some faith in the Lord and who will want to know the. truth, and to whom the Lord will send the truth. The workers should see to it that these teachers and Sunday school pupils have the opportunity of providing themselves with the “Harp” book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Every class or ecclesia should inaugurate a Bible study amongst the young people of the consecrated, and assign some brother to teach, using the “Harp” </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">as a </span><span class="font8">textbook. Remember that the children now growing up have open minds, which minds should be prepared for the kingdom; and they should be made fit for the use of the princes in the earth in carrying on the new government. No parent could leave his children a greater heritage than to give it now a knowledge of the divine plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Your neighbor needs the truth and his children need the truth; and it is your privilege to give it to them. The “Harp” volume contains more than 1500 questions with answers. Encourage your neighbor to get the book and read it and to encourage his children to study, by giving them so many questions daily to answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Through the “Bulletin” announcement will shortly be made to the directors and workers of a systematic method of doing the canvassing. First the ground will be gone over with the combination until it is exhausted. Then will follow the canvass for the “Harp” book, with a card system of questions to be mailed each week by the classes to those interested, the purpose being to induce the purchasers of the book to read it, and then will follow the organization of classes. A third canvass will be made for the Studies in the Scriptures, the price of which will be greatly reduced so as to be put within the reach of all. Bible classes should be started in homes, and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">every</span><span class="font8"> brother who is able to teach should be given an opportunity to teach the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Brother Russell stated in 1916 that the purpose of the V. D. M. questions was to ascertain how many brethren had the qualification to teach. The time has come to put this into practical use. The operations for the year 1922 should afford an opportunity for every one that is qualified to teach to do so. There will be public lectures, private meetings, Bible classes, new ones being started. The people must know the truth. It is the Lord’s time and it is the Christian’s greatest privilege to make known this truth to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Beginning with 1922. the subscription price of The Golden Age is reduced to $1.00 per year, thus placing it within the reach of almost every one. An intensive campaign in due time will be earned on to put The Golden Age into the hands of hundreds of thousands of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">WORLD-WIDE CAMPAIGN</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On September </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">25,</span><span class="font8"> 1921, October 30 and December 11 there alter public meetings were simultaneously held m all paits of the United States and Canada, at which the message “Millions Now Living Will Never Die’&quot; was proclaimed. This united act,on has brought splendid results. The Lord’s blessing is upon it. It has afforded opportunity for all the Pilgrims, elders and other public speakers to give a witness for the truth. Up to this time this ci.ort has been confined to the United States and Canada particulai h ; but now in the near future it v ill be extended to every country in the world where the truth is known. The date hi- b-en set and the classes will be notified of the exact date through the “Bulletin”, for a world-wide proclamation on a certain Sunday afternoon of the mes-agc “Millions Now Living Will Never Die<sup>-</sup>’. It will be preached in every language m which the truth is now published and probably more. We invite the Watch Tower roadm-s. the consecrated brethren throughout the world, icgardless of language, to join in this proclamation of the message of the truth on the day appointed. Begin to make preparation for it immediate!}. There will be much advertising matter and many tracts for distribution. There will be service in procuring halls, arranging for the meetings, etc., and thus every one will be afforded an opportunity to do something. Even the crippled and those who are unable to leave their homes can participate by their prayers unto the Lord for his blessing, remembering the picture given in David’s experience, that they who stayed behind with the stuff should likewise be counted in the army, whose hearts and prayers are united with their brethren at the front.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Political campaigns have been waged between great contending parties amidst much excitement of the people, resulting in the putting out of one government and the bringing in of another. With the hope of bettering the condition of the people, monarchies have been overturned to be replaced by republics. Nations have fallen before nations and kingdoms before democracies in an effort on the part of the people to alleviate suffering humanity. But Satan, the god of this world, has oveireached all human effort. Now, however, a campaign is on such as the world before has never known and will never again experience. It is a figM between Satan and the allies of his empire on one sid~, against the Christ on the other side. God’s judgment is written aeamM Satan’s empire. It must fall. God will bring this great victory for righteousness through Christ, releasing the people from their thraldom. The whole creation has long been groaning and travailing in pain, waiting foi this dav. Let those who see it now lift up their heads and rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Christ comes to lead the woild into truth. “Moses truly said unto the lathers. A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto jou of your biethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear m all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.” (Acts 3:22) Christ is that great Prophet, now come to proclaim his message of deliverance to mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Christ has come as the great Priest. Of him it is written: “Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek”. (Psalm 110:4) He is that great Priest. There has never been one like unto him before; there will never be another like unto him. As the great Priest he will minister unto the people and bestow upon them the blessings long ago promised by Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Satan with his beastly organization in earth has oppressed mankind for ages. The rulers of the earth under his influence have exploited the people, subjecting them by violence and injustice. Christ comes as the great King now to rule m righteousness. (Isaiah 32: 1) “And the government shall be upon his shoulder,” and he will bring life and peace and happiness to mankind, for he is “the everlasting Father and the Prince of Peace”.—-Isaiah 9: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Christ comes as that “one mediator between God and men”; and he will mediate the new law covenant and through it will minister unto the people health, strength, life, and happiness. (1 Timothy 2:5) He will put the law of God in their minds and w rite it upon their heaits. --Hebrews 10:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Christ, therefoie, is the desire of all nations. (Haggai 2: 7) Long have they waited and hoped and prayed for relief, not knowing how it w<sup>r</sup>as coming; but now it has come.—Bomans 8 : 22, 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is under this mighty One, the King of kings, the Lord of glory, that his people on earth are now privileged to be enlisted. The members of his earthly army aie fighting the last desperate conflict. It is a fight for life — fightings within and fightings without. Within ourselves we cannot gain this victory; but God will give us the victory through Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence unto the end, rejoicing in hope. (Hebrews 3:6) Therefore Met us not be weary in welldoing, for in due season we shall reap if we relax not”. (Galatians 6: 9, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott)</span><span class="font8"> Will you gain the victory this year ? It is a fight of faith. According to your faith ba it unto you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The hope set before the Christian is life divine with all its attendant glory and honor. What a prize m prospect! Before the Christian can come to the fruition of his hopes he must prove Ins faithfulness unto the end. Absolute loyalty leads to victory. Appreciating the fact that he is on the Lord's side; that Christ Jesus is his true friend, he can truly say: ‘'Christ is my all; Chrvt is my life’. “Keep your heart with all diligence, for cut of it are the issues of life.’’ (I’lmcibs 4- 23) God will show forth his strength m behalf of those possessing a pert &lt;t condition of heart (2 Chronicles 16-9) 'Then let each soldier of the cross fighting under the banner of Christ Jesus, the Captain, remember that it is his duty not only to be loyal to the Captain, but a real friend to his brother, each member of the body. Let each one, therefore. «ee to it that peace prevails amongst those who profess his name and that a solid and united front be presented to the enemy, and all go forth in the battle rejoicing in the hope. “And above all these things put on love which is the bond of perfectness. And let the peace of God rule m your hearts, to the which also ve are called m one body; and be ve thankful. Let the word ct Chi 1st dwell m you richly m all wisdom.”—• Colossians 3; 14-16.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark5"></a>REPORT OF BRITISH BRANCH</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">My Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I ba'.e the honor and the pleasure of reporting to you respecting the work of the Lord in the British field for the past financial year, concluded October 31st There has been no outstanding event such as marked the end of our last financial year when we had the pleasure of jour visit, aid when we bad so large a public witness to the Truth now due, and to the coming of the kingdom of oui Savioi , but the year has been one of happy service in the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The figures herewith reported show both decreases and increas.es, but though there are decreases which must be put on icoord, I am glad to be able to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">say </span><span class="font8">that this does not at all indicate any flagging of zeal on the pait of the brethren. The jear has been a very trcing one for the British people owing to the great slum]) m trade, and to the du astrons coal strike, with its gicat and tumble consequences to the trade of the country and the community at large. Our dear colporteurs found that the gcncial unemployment almost precluded them from selling the Studies, and the workers generally have reported cases of lack of means which have been distressing to hear. Those who would have purchased books have not had money to buy necessary food. A few weeks ago a sister reported that she and another sister, working m separate districts of the town, were met with the statement, which they had no reason to believe was untrue, that not a man m either street had been m employment for many months; and jet m both those streets a considerable number of“ Millions” booklets w<sup>r</sup>ere sold. I think that I have not hitherto seen such joy in the work as has been shown during the past year by those who have actively taken up the message of the kingdom. Indeed, the gladness of heart and the joy of service have been so manifest that this favor of the Lord has been one of the special tokens of his love for the blessing of those who are following the lead that he has given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age work which began with the canvassing of the special issue No. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">27</span><span class="font8"> served the brethren splendidly. Those who took up that work put on courage as one clothes himself with armor. They felt by the grace of the Lord that they could now' witness for him in a waj' that had hitherto seemed impossible. Courage and faith and hope were strengthened. Then came the great privilege of canvassing with the “Millions” booklet, a message that all the brethren have felt was a joyous one; and this proved, as it weie, a God-given help to the colpoiteurs to enable them to tide over the difficult period of money scarceness. Now the brethren are taking up the selling of the Combination Set, and many are reporting good success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Below are given some details of the various phases of the w ork •</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Colpoiteur Work:</span><span class="font8"> For some time after your visit was concluded this work was fairly brisk, but with the coming of the winter season, and the aforementioned causes, money became so scarce that this phase of the work was carried on with difficulty. Then came the selling of the “Millions’’ booklet and many were able to enter in, or keep in the work who otherwise could not have done so. It was surety a blessing from the Lord for the workers, as well as the Lord’s message for those who have cars to hear—for the people. Our sales ot Studies is just below 40,000, the lowest figure for many years, but we sent out from the London office up the 31st October 178,500 “Millions” booklets, and nearly 15,000 “Talking with the Dead” booklets. Of course a good many of these books have gone to the classes and have been put into the hands of the public by the Golden Age workers, but a good number have gone through the hands of the colporteurs. At the present time there are on our books 97 colporteurs who claim to be giving the whole of their time to the work, and 28 who are giving part time, and at the moment there is a considerable number who are taking up the Auxiliary Colporteur Service. Under the circumstances these numbers are very encouraging. We are cheered by the thought that so many dear brothers and sisters are spending their energy in devoting their time and strength to the furtherance of the Lord’s work. It is evident that though times are difficult a young man or woman with energy and spirit, and the love of God in the heart, can make the colporteur service provide a means of livelihood while yet their whole time may be given in the direct service of the Master.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Pilgrim Service:</span><span class="font8"> This has been well maintained during the year. The number of visits made is 1712, a considerable increase on last year. There are at the present time nine brethren on our Pilgrim list, though it rarely happens that all can be used at the same time. W e can still say that these visits are of benefit and much pleasure to the brethren, and that the blessing of the Lord is on that branch of the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Public</span><span class="font8"> Witness: It is a pleasure to be able to report much activity in this side of the work. The total number of public meetings held during the year large and small which have been under the direction of the office is 929. Many of these meetings were arranged by the Motorcycle parties m what we call the Country Witness work, which has been, this year as last, a most profitable work when considered as a means of reaching and interesting the villagers and farmers who live far away from where there are any classes. Besides the foregoing we have had in cooperation with some classes, particularly the larger ones, a number of meetings held in the suburbs of the large towns, and in this way we have been enabled to give a very wide witness chiefly by the topic “Millions now Living will Never Die”. In connection with these meetings we have printed and distributed folders to the extent of 2,019,450. Each of these folders carries a message of Truth. Little leaflets 7x5| inches folded, carry %% pages of reading matter, and they have been a real witness for the Truth so that the brethren distributing them have not merely distributed advertisement of a meeting. We have had much evidence of interest aroused by the folders. In view of the fact that all the summertime wc have been holding meetings at the rate of 30 to 40 per week, and that arrangements have been made for continuing this work, it seems hardly possible to arrange at present for a series of simultaneous meetings, but we look forward to such an effort in the early part of the new year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The method of having “drives” or concerted efforts has proved a happy stimulus to the brethren and of much service to the work. Some of the classes have followed up a public lecture making use of the fact of the lecture as an introduction to their canvass. They naturally enough found people who knew what they were going to talk about and many who had not been to the lecture were glad to buy the message in the better form of the “Millions” booklet. Altogether the year’s work has proved a happy service for the Lord, and the blessing of the Lord is manifestly with the brethren and the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Volunteer Work:</span><span class="font8"> There has been no regular issue for volunteer service during the year, but we had on hand a good number of booklet tracts and during the year these have been distributed, the total number being 730,000. A good many of these tracts were on “Spiritism”, having been printed when spiritism was beginning to manifest itself so forcefully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Wc are now beginning the distribution of the Zionist article: about two million of these are being despatched, and will very quickly be in the hands of the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Finance:</span><span class="font8"> A statement of the Tract Fund Receipts and general expenditures therefrom is enclosed. As you will see this phase of the British work has about sustained itself during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As to the general situation and the prospect of continuing the present, and the future work, I think it could be truly said that the outlook is as good as ever it has been. The continued pressure of circumstances, and the disintegration of the present order of things are forcing to a new outlook, and it can be truly said that there are more people ready to listen to our message than ever. The topic “Millions now Living will Never Die” has been, and continues to be the most attractive we have had. This topic has drawn more intelligent audiences to our meetings than any topic we have hitherto had. The political outlook at the moment is dark, and the clouds of the labor world are always threatening, but the dark night in which no man can work is not yet upon us. The Lord is surely delaying the final break-up of this great Empire m order that his people can complete his work. The churches are helpless. The Church of England has been in conference in Birmingham during the past few days, and it has been very freely said amongst themselves that that Church had no light for the people, and that it v as torn by internal dissension. The Nonconfoi mists are merely beating time: indeed, it is clear that there is no force in the “religious” world. So though general circumstances are trying, and unemplovment rife, the lack manifested by the churches gives the Lord’s messengers their best opportunity of telling of the Truth now due, and of the immediate establishment of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We keep very busy in the office, but this pleases us; for it is what we desire, since it betokens activity in the Lord’s work. Our mail has been heavier this year than-ever. Letters received 25,069, and letters out 31,985 show a total of 57.,054 pieces of mail. We are glad of the privileges of cooperation with you in the Lord's work, and we all join in love to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I am sure the British friends would be delighted if you could say you were coming back soon, and personally I think that the coming Springtime would be a very favorable time for such a witness as we could give, and for such a stimulus to the work as your presence with us would be. We all send our warmest love and good wishes, and over remembering you at the throne of heavenly grace that the Lord may guide you in your work,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I am, my dear Brother Rutherford,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Your brother and servant, J. Hemeky.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark7"></a>REPORT FROM CENTRAL EUROPEAN OFFICE</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You will be pleased to know that our first efforts in Austria were greatly blessed of the Lord; and I hasten to inform you of the fact that we believe it was at the divinely appointed time that ve began work at Vienna. Brother Balzeieit gave the first lecture on the ‘‘Millions” in a hall holding 3,000 attendant-, and hundreds could not be accommodated. Twelve hundred addresses were left and 2,100 “Millions” booklets were sold. A good quantity of other literature vias also sold the same evening and such a rush for the books as never was experienced on this continent before. Brother Balzereit reports, telling us of the most respectfully listening crowd of people, attentively following and hungrily receiving the message, unique in its solemnne^s, and such an applause when closing that he never observed m Ins life anywhere. People stormed the platform asking questions and begging the speaker for fuither information. Several friends are now at work looking up the addresses while Brother V e’lorshaus, one of the Pilgrims, is continuing with public .-peaking, giving what 1-, wanted through the Word by the grace of God. Anol hei Pilgrim will again spend a period of two weeks time, woikmg among the Vienna people and bringing together all the interested one- to constitute a Bible class and to begin with the regular studies. This will be necessaiy for a basis to work from in that land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Brother Wellershaus writes from Vienna today: “The greatest difficulty here in Austria is because of the people living without the Bible and knowing nothing of the Bible—being Catholic, with few exceptions May the dear Lord give us wisdom to help these poor people out of the gross daikness wherein they live. They are so poor, and everything so high-priced, that it is almost impossible for anvone to buy a Bible. The dearth increasing day by day they grow less able, accordingly, to purchase books. I would therefore suggest that von announce in the Tower that every old or new Bible that could be spared by the friends, should be collected and shipped to Vienna: this people must have Bibles where ever they come from. I shall report of proceedings later, etc.” Signed, Carl Wellershaus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I wonder if it were possible, dear Brother, to get some second-hand Bibles, Elberfeld edition preferred, from the German friends in America. All Bibles of good translations are quite expensive today and a dozen or so from the states would surely help us greatly. We shall certainly do all in our power to get a lot of Bibles for the hungry after truth in that land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We thank you most heartily for the money just received, a draft for Er. 26,716.53 which will most thoroughly change our possibilities for the better, and the dear Lord has evidently led you wonderfully right, by drawing your attention to some of the half-forgotten districts m Europe, where Catholicism is stdl keeping the people in darkness as to the Bible and its teachings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We want to get this message humming in every land the Master opens up for us. Hungary no doubt is wanting the truth. My former brethren in the faith, the Apostolic Christians or “New Amish” (not Amish as usually known m America) .are represented by 20,000 in that land; so I do know Hungary is wanting the true light, and letters from over there are calling for same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dear Brother Rutherford, do you know a number of Doctors and Piofessois of the University of Zurich are greatly interested and are quite enthused over the Studies and the truth m general? Some are diligently reading the volumes. A peculiar “sign” of the times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Last Monday I spoke at Zurich m a hall holding 1,000, which was packed to the limit, on “Talking with the Dead?” Spiritism is overflowing Europe and we felt it was good to give a few lectures on that topic together with the “Millions”. The audience was very attentive. We do exactly as you suggested, organize study classes wherever we find people interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Your letter is a source of encouragement to me, dear Brother, and a blessing. Thank you very, very much for the words of kindness and brotherly admonishment. I am sure the Lord is blessing our every effort here and I never woiked harder m my life. I shall follow up with another report very soon. May the Lord bless you richly; and please remember me before the throne. You know' I do want the Lord’s help now more than ever, owing to the circumstances peculiar to Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With much love from the family and myself to yourself and all,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Your humble brother in Christ. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">C. C. </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Binkele.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">[Any of the brethren throughout the country who have German Bibles, particularly the Elberfeld edition, and who can spare them and desire to have them sent to Austria, please send them to this oflice or direct to the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society,</span><span class="font8"> Hbnggerstrasse 12, Zurich, Switzerland.]</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark9"></a>HIPPODROME MEETING, NEW YORK, DECEMBER 11</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">F</span><span class="font8">OR two weeks prior to December 11 the friends of the New York congregation labored faithfully and well in the distribution of one million folders containing, besides a brief witness for the truth as we understand it, an announcement of the public lecture which had been arranged to be given by the Society’s President in New York’s famous “Hippodrome” on the subject, “Millions now Living will Never Die”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Aside from the folders distributed from door to door, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">large showing on the bill-boards and in the newspapers was made; so that the publicity was quite thorough indeed. But while thus inviting the public to come, it was not forgotten to seek the Lord’s guidance and overruling providence in the matter; and much evidence of his blessing was observed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The day was fair, though not bright; and at two o’clock the doors were opened. By two-forty the great house was filled and those who armed after that time were necessarily turned away. The plat of the house shows 5650 seats. Besides these, six hundred seats had been placed on the stage, and in the orchestra pit, which were filled early All standing room was occupied • and counting these and those seated approximately seven thousand people were inside the budding. No accurate knowledge is had of how many were turned away, but the management of the building believed that about as many sought vainly to gam admittance as actually got inside</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The audience was particularly attentive and not infrequently showed decorous enthusiasm by applause at some of the more welcome points of the lecture As is the case in any large audience, some tew were displeased, but among those who gate expression to their views, by far the majority were comforted and en&lt; enraged by the hope of near relief from the world’s great distress and perplexity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Just prior to the beginning of the lecture and before the speaker came onto the platform a carefully worded canvass, in the form of an announcement, was made for the combination offer. “Milhous now Living will Never Die,” “Can the Living Talk with the Dead’” and “The Finished Mystery”. Experienced brethren had carefully placed a hundred and seventy selleis at advantageous points in the audience and in the lobbies. Those in the audience were seated and not known to be sellers until the meeting was over. Immediately at the close of the lecture the.v were busy in an unobstrusive way, merely saving, ‘The speci.il combination as announced’. In the lobbies single books weie on sale. Altogether 2901 copies of the books were sold, including seveial hundred disposed of in 1iout of the building Io those who could not get in In addition to these about nine hundred were sold on mail orders doming from the advertisements</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Altogether the friends of Gie.tter New York felt much encouraged that the Lord had seen fit Io bless their efforts to speak for him in a place where faith m God’s Word is very small</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark11"></a>JEHOVAH OR BAAL?</span></h3>
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">[CoM.'LUllETl FROM</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Idolatry was not a mere sin into which people gradually sunk: but it was a Satanic device into which people rose in older to gi atify the lusts of the flesh undei the cloak of lehgion. Baal (winch means glory and is associated with rhe splendor of the .sun) was elsewhere called Moloch Baal is a more specific and distinctive name of the same deity, as is seen by comparing Jeremiah 7.31 and 19.5. This consideration helps us to understand many places where the word Baal is used singly. In the last of the forty years of wilderness wandering Israel joined themselves to Baal-peor and &quot;ate the sacrifices of the dead”. (Psalm 106 2S) In the seventh or inmost shrine of the Moloch temples a large brazen image of that calf-headed god was placed, which was heated up on occasions, to which were sacrificed and by which were consumed the children of devotees. Connected with these offerings of children were minor sacrifices which were eaten by the members of the family of the dead. This was the terrible sin of Israel lust before entering Canaan. They sacrificed their living sons to Baal or Moloch and celebrated the event by eating the associated sacrifices. Solomon fell so far as to construct a temple to this god on the Mount of Olives across the Valley of Tophet from the city of his father. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Toph</span><span class="font8"> means a drum or tom-tom ii </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Inch was used in connection</span><span class="font8"> with these barbarous sacrifices to drown out the cries of the perishing child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These facts lend color to the incident befoie us; for Baal was not only the god of the sun, or celestial fire, but fire was also used in the most intimate of Baalite sacrifices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From morning, probably about nine o’clock or the hour of the morning sacrifice in the Temple, until noon the priests of Baal invoked their god. During this time Elijah said not a word The wild, heathenish outcries of the pagan prophets rang along the mountain side—“Baal, O hear us, and answer us!” But the sad comment is made: “There was no voice, nor any that answered”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Obtaining no response, no fiie from heaven, the piophets increased the vigor of their outcries and added to them the whirling, swirling dances which are still used in all heathen lands They jumped up nnd down about the altar until noon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Not all people could enduie such strenuous and violent exmcises. Pagan prophets, even now in the Client, are specially instructed in this sort of gymnastics. Their bodies aie kept lithe and supple by frequent anointings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ELIJAH’S TAUNTING</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At noon, w’hich was one of the seasons of prayer for</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">December</span><span class="font8"> 15 </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Issue]</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">devout Jews (Acts 10:9: Daniel 6’10: Psalm 55:17), Elijah began to taunt the unhappv prophets of the devil’s religion He shouted Io them that thev had better ‘call him louder’ Yes, he is a god all light, and he is very attentive to your pleadings. th.it is tally demonstrated bv the outcome of your morning's exertions But don't give up. Either Baal is m Ins hbr.uy thinking over wavs and means to hold his influence with the tuition or he has gone aside for some pinale matter. It may be also that he is giving audience to otheis. In any of these cases, let him knovv that this is an important thing It will not do for him to be in a profound reverie now when his name and prestige among the whole people are at stake. Call him louder Perhaps he is off on a hunting trip. But don’t let that fact discourage you, here is bigger game than anything he could bag in heaven. Shout’ Let him know that all is now in the balance. He cannot afford to lose all his credit and reverence on earth merely' to pursue doubtful quarry in the happy hunting grounds above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Stung by these taunts of Elijah, the priests of Baal gave themselves all the more ardently to the work of arousing their god, this time gashing themselves wfith knives and daggers until the blood spurted out upon their half-naked bodies. If Baal would not take notice of the bullock’s blood, perhaps he would of theirs. “But there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any' that paid attention ” But the dizzy orgy' proceeded with more or less of fervor u itil Elijah was ready with his sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some time before three o’clock Elijah called foi Ilie attention of the people, who by this time would be well wearied of the senseless and fruitless ravings of the heathen, prophets. He invited them to draw near Io the spot where an ancient altar of Jehovah lay in filin’. It was merely an earthen altar built during the time of the Judges or during the reign of Saul. Elijah took twelve stones, to remind the people of the fact that the divine promises were associated with the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">twelve</span><span class="font8"> tribes and not merely with the northern ten. These stones hp used as a cap or covering to the earthen altar. Around this altar he dug a trench deep enough to set a two-senh (twenty-one-quurt) measure in. Then he placed wood in propel ordei above the stones and, having cut the bullock in pieces, he laid it on the wood Then, to demonstrate positively that none of the bo.nlien deceptions were going to be piactiscd, he ordoted some of the people to draw four barrels of water Irom the spung-fed block nearby and to pom these on top of the s.oj iln.e and the wood. This order was lepeated yet a thud time,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">until the sacnfice, the wood, the altar, and even the trench round about were thoroughly drenched with water. These minute points establish beyond the possibility of a doubt the miraculous nature of' the subsequent fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH INVOKED</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then follows the calm, dignified prayer of the Prophet: “O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word. Hear me, O Jehovah, heai me, that this people may know that thou, Jehovah, art God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again” from idolatry to a i ecognition of thee. This formula comprising the names ot the three ancient patriarchs was intended to turn the minds of the people back io ihe first time it was used, where at the burning bush •hovah’s angel manifested himself as a flume of fire—Exodus 3:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then tell the tire from heaven. It consumed the burnt sacrifice and even the altar itself. The process of this consumption is very lemarkable; and calculated to remove the possibility of a suspicion that there was any concealed fire whatever. The fire </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">came down</span><span class="font8"> from heaven. The pieces of the sacrifice were </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">first</span><span class="font8"> consumed. The wood next, to show that it was not even by means of the wood that the flesh was burned. The twelve stones were also consumed, to show that it </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">«js</span><span class="font8"> no common fire, but one whose agency nothing could resist. The dust, or earth of which the altar was constructed, was burnt up. And the water that was in the french was, by the action of this fire, entirely evaporated. ’The action of the fire was, in every respect, downward, contiary to the nature of all earthly flames. Nothing can be more simple and artless than this description ; and yet how amazingly full and satisfactory is the whole account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This was a dramatic spectacle for the people and their interest in it was heightened by the long, boresome waiting of the day. The prophets of Baal were taken and slam by the Brook Kishon, either by Elijah’s hand or by his order. This was in fulfillment of one of the most terribly explicit of the statutes of Moses’ law which condemned to death those who endeavored to seduce the people to idolatry. (Deuteronomy 13.6-9) And why was not Ahab slain, since he was the most responsible of all in the gathering? The Prophet doubtless knew that he would be punished in a special manner. It was not many years before he too was killed.—1 Kings 22: 34-36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Elijah heard the sound of approaching rain. This was a miraculous hearing; for no one else had perceived it as yet, and the actual storm was many miles distant at sea. Ahab went up the mountain to eat and drink; but Elijah went to the top of the mountain to pray Most men, would have thought that they had done a day’s w'ork already, but Elijah was willing to be used as long as the Lord chose to use him. He prayed about the rain and sent his servant seven times to observe the Mediterranean. Only on the seventh observation was there a cloud visible. This was the sign Elijah looked for. He sent his servant to advise Ahab to move with all haste in his chariot to Jezreel. But while Ahab drove furiously to outrun if possible the blackening storm, the strength of the Lord rested on Elijah so that he w'as able on foot to outrun Ahab in his chariot and actually preceded him into the gates of the city. The distance was above eighteen miles.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">S</span><span class="font8">UDDEN was the information winch apparently m one dav overthtew the religion of Baal, destroyed his priests, revived the religion of Jehovah and brought Eli irih most pionimently before Israel. But. as before re-niniked, nlolatry was not something into which the people lell meiely through ignotance Idolatry was a system of playing to and vvoi-~lnpmg the desires of the flesh under the simulation oi leligion. Theie was no doubt about the evidence on Mount Carmel as to the propriety of Jehovah’s being God But the people had worshiped self so long that they liked it that way</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But even such of the people as had convictions lacked the courage of them, and consequently were easily brought under the influence of the corrupt national court in which Jezebel was the dominant figure. Her evil spirit and selfwill were courageous enough to combat anything, everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Humanly speaking she was on relatively secure giound. Having no conscientious scruples she was not bothered by having to considei the moral appropriateness of ways and means. Ahali had some conscience, but his principal business was in dodging it. This weakened him and made him moie a tool than a certain leader.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jezebel’s father was the powerful Phiemcian king- and this fact gave her assurance. For many, many times war had been made upon one country for supposed affionts to then foreign-born queen. In the impoverished condition of his country (after the thiee and a half years of thought) Ahab would not relish a clash with his father-in-law, especially since his own faith was not strong enough to seek Jehovah’s help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">JEZEBEL THE FURIOUS</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Ahab and all Israel seemed to be quite humbled at the outcome oi the fire test on Carmel and at the subsequent downpour ot ram. The waters descended. They drenched the parched giound they gathered in pools in the long-thirsty hollow s: they formed first in rivulets, then in streams and tori eats<sup>-</sup> and rushed along to gladden the stony beds which had missed them so long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But the storm outside was not greater in its way than the one that raged in the royal palace. Mutterings of disdain at her husband’s weak compliance with the commands of Jehovah’s prophet,-—gusts of passion at having been scorned and overlooked,—hot hissings of hate against Elijah for daring to slay the priests of a religion with which </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">she </span><span class="font8">was associated,—sporadic spittings of spleen against the people for allowing themselves to be convinced. — flashy flat Ings of fire from those Sidonian eyes, as black as her own heart was wicked<sup>-</sup> — such was the storm inside the palace and inside the vitals of Jezebel</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But the woman with the serpent tongue either did not dare to send and slay Elijah outright so soon after the fire and the ram, or else she was peistiaded by her husband to try something else first There was danger of civil war if too rash methods w ere followed. So the queen sent a special messenger to the Prophet with what amounted to an alternative edict—banishment or death, leave or die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So Elijah arose and went for his life. He saw it was best to give place to this storm, and to go to a place of safety. Maybe lie had thought that the miracle at Carmel would be the means of eftecting the conversion of the whole court and &lt;&gt;t the country: but finding himself mistaken, he was greaih discouraged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It lias been a very popular pastime in Christendom to poke inn at Elijah because he fled; but there seems to be no proof that this is the proper thing to do. Elijah was God's man, God’s special servant; and he had been under special guidance and care for at least three years. Those three jears had been more or less of a strain and especially had the nervous tension of the day just passed been little short of terrific — even barring the eighteen-mile run for which he was supernaturallj strengthened. Now he was in Jezioel the rain had come: the witness for Jehovah had been given as directed. What next?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">El nah was weary; lie was weak, he was disheartened at a lack of genuine response to the manifested power of the Lord; he was without definite divine distinctions what to do or where to go or stay. Humanly speaking, Jezebel was not only his queen, but she was vastly his superior in resources and he was honest enough to know it. Was not the Lord's hand oier David and yet did he not flee and wander about for years? Yes. Moreover, the Lord had not specifically told him to stay in Jezreel and he had no right to piesume on the Lord’s protection as long as a way of escape was open.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Lord allotted the situation to be so that Elijah would feel his own weakness, so that he would not be proud of himself and go crowing around about how </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">he</span><span class="font8"> had cleaned up the country. ‘These weak-kneed, lady believers like Obadiah make me weary The way to do is to stick out your chest and show them you are not afraid of them ; and you will have the country at your feet.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But if Elijah had been a man of that kind the Lord would not have used him in the first place. And rather than run the risk of making him such a man the Lord left Elijah in a humiliating situation. Personal pride and pugnacity were not to be the outstanding part of the story ; but the glory of the Lord was. Those who serve Jehovah faithfully will have no occasion to glory in the flesh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">IN FLIGHT</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Prophet could hardly hide again in Phtemcia to the west nor in Gilead, his home, to the east. So he departed toward the south, but not panic-stricken, so far as anything in the account shows. But Judah was in close affiliation w ith Israel at this time; so Elijah passed right on through to Beersheba, about a hundred miles from Jezreel. Beersheba lay originally in the land allotted to Simeon; but that tribe had been practically absorbed by Judah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At Beersheba the Prophet left his disciple and body-servant, and pressed on into the wilderness about thirty miles to the south.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was early summer and the sands were scorching hot. The long journey had fatigued Elijah; and the barrenness of the landscape only burnt in the design of disheartenment which had been painted on his soul during the last few days. He sat down under a broom tree and told the Lord just how he felt. “It is enough.’’ I have lived long enough. I can do </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">do</span><span class="font8"> more good among this people, let me now end my days. There Elijah “struck bottom”, and incidentally let out the secret that he had been a little inclined to preen himself on his superior faith and virtues. But after all he saw that he was no better than his fathers. He was no compliment to Jehovah ; but Jehovah’s use of him was an inestimable and unelicited favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SLEEP AND REFRESHMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Excessive anguish of mind frequently induces sleep, as well as great fatigue of body. Elijah slept, until an angel woke him up. He needed refreshment and God sent a heavenly messenger to bring him what was necessary. So God has done or will do for all those who acknowledge their own undone state. He has sent his own Son to touch, to awaken, and to nourish all who look to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A cake baked on hot stones was supernaturally provided for the Prophet, as also a cruse of water. Again he slept and w<sup>r</sup>as again awmkened and miraculously fed; this tune with the intimation that a long journey was before him. And after the second partaking of this heaven-proi ided bread the Prophet W’as strengthened to go some one hundred fifty miles through desert and hills to Horeb, the mount of God. The time consumed in the journey seems to hine been the same as the tune of the tast—forty days. So he fasted just the same time as Moses did at Horeb; and as Jesus did in the wilderness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It should be remembered also that these three personages it was who were represented in the vision in the holy mount: Moses, the law-giver; Elias, the law-restorer; and Jesus, the law'-fulfiller. So Elijah is seen in our lesson as working his way slowly back to the place where the law was given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Prophet lodged in a cave on the mountain side, winch is conjectured by some to be the same cave into which God put Moses that he might give him a glimpse of Ins glory.—Exodus 33 • 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“What doest thou here?” Is this a reproach for unbelieving fears’ Perhaps in a measuie; but also it is a way of reminding him that he has nothing to do and of thus preparing him for the new' commissions to follow. God wms about to comfort Elijah by giving him woik to do. He knew how discouraging it was for his Pi ophet to feel useless</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Eh]ah put in a plea which is described by the apostle Paul as being not so much </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font8"> himself as </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">uiiainst</span><span class="font8"> Israel (Romans II : 23) ; although he did comment, and justly, upon his own past zeal. His charge against Israel was threefold :</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">(1) They have forsaken thy covenant—they have cleaved to and worshiped other gods;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">(2) They have thrown down thine altars — endeavored as much as they possibly could to abolish thy worship and destroy its remembrance from the land, not only by quitting the worship at Jerusalem, but also by tearing down even the lay altais which represented prhnte w'orship:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">(3) And they hare slain thy prophets—that there might be none to reprove their iniquity, or teach the truth to those who desired to hear it</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">“I only am left.” They have succeeded in destroying all the rest of the prophets and they are determined not to rest till they slay me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A LESSON IN OMNIPOTENCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Elijah needed a little lesson in omnipotence and God gave it him. He was told to stand upon the mount and the Lord treated him in the same way that he treated Moses on a similar occasion; and it is not unlikely that Elijah stood upon the same spot.—See Exodus 19: 9, 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The great show of divine power which followed may have been to impress Elijah with the thought that God would look out after him. The sequence of the display also contained the thought that, while much of Elijah’s work in the past had been spectacular, the work which he would do for the rest of his life would be of a smaller, quieter, more patient, and plodding kind. There are not enough Carmels to go around for every day in the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The order of the phenomena at the mount is just the same as that connected with natural earthquakes of severity.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">(1) Previous to great earthquakes the atmosphere is much disturbed, mighty winds and tempests taking place.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">(2) This is followed by the actual agitation of the earth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">(3) In this agitation fire frequently escapes, or a burning lava is poured out, often accompanied with thunder and lightning.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">(4) And after these the air becomes serene, the thunder ceases to roll, the forked lightnings no longer play, and there remains but a gentle breeze.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">But while the order In this case is natural, the inducing cause is supernatural.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The tempest itself was terrible, rending the rocks and tearing off strong pieces of the mountain. But the Lord (thought to be represented here as elsewhere by the She-kinah or glory light) did not appear in the tempest. Nor did he in tile earthquake or even in the heavy play of celestial and terrestrial fire, but only after the storm gave room for the gentle voice, a sound with which no other sound was mingled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then it was that Elijah wrapped his face in his mantle. This he did to signify his </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">•&gt; cspect.</span><span class="font8"> so Moses had hid his face, tor he dared not to look upon God. (Exodus 3:6) Covenng the face was a token of respect among the Asiatics ; ns uncovering the head is among Europeans</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“WHAT DOEST THOU HERE?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">'1 he repented query as to what Elijah was doing in the wilderness brought forth the repeated defense: I am here because it has not been safe to be in Israel. Thereupon the Lord commissioned Elijah for a new and three-fold work, all of which implied divine protection until that work was done. But Jehovah did not ask him to take a road by which he would be likely to meet -Jezebel or any of his enemies, when another way would do just as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Elijah was instructed to anoint or to provide for the anointing of Hazael, Jehu, and Elisha. God was about to bring his judgments on the land and especially on the house of Ahab. The subsequent accounts show how this was accomplished. Hazael, Jehu, and Elisha, each in his own place, were to be the ministers of God’s vengeance against that disobedient and rebellious people. But the thousands who had not bowed to Baal nor kissed his image were to be spared in this destruction. Doubtless Elijah was astonished and consoled to learn that there were so many who loved Jehovah. It show’ed that there would be a work for him in the catechetical schools which Samuel had long ago founded and David fostered. There was someone who would be glad to learn of God’s law given from the same awful bench which the Prophet was just quitting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On his way up the east side of Jordan Elijah came upon the young farmer Elisha, plowing in a field. He himself was in the furrow', driving the hindermost of twelve yoke of oxen. He was with the last plow, doubtless, that he might keep an eye on the other plowmen. The number of oxen working indicated a secular standing considerably advanced over poverty, no small estate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Elijah walked up to the young man (he lived more than sixty years after this) and without a word cast his cloak of skin on his shoulders. Elisha understood perfectly thereby that he was to follow Elijah and succeed him m due course. The young man confer!ed not with flesh and blood, but determined al once to respond to the call. He was prompt to obey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But one thing he wished to do, to bid farewell to his parents. Elijah said that that would be all right, since to honor his father and mother was a command of the very law' he was expected to learn and to teach But in thus telling him to return for a few hours Elijah made it plain that the call w’as not from himself. ‘It was not my call. Don’t ask me about the matter. You are accountable to the Lord for the use or abuse of your call.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Elijah did not anoint either Jehu or Hazael. The latter w<sup>r</sup>as to be used to w’eaken Israel from without and Jehu was to succeed Ahab from within the kingdom. But Ahab showed such a measure of repentance at his share in the murder of Naboth that the Lord told Elijah the work of destroying the dynasty would be postponed until after Ahab’s death. (1 Kings 21:29) The judgment merely slept out of divine mercy to Ahab.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Loving Cnnstian greetings' It is with much gi.ititude in our hearts that we wish to thank you and our heavenly Father, who supervised the work, for the revised Taber-n,-de Shadows. We have just completed the study of the booklet; and we as a class can joyfully say that we have dei ived greater benefit and blessings through this study than in all our previous studies of the booklet combined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At first we thought that it would have been better to have made the corrections right in the text, instead of h iving the Appendix of Notes. But we have decided that the I,ord knew best and overruled in this also; for we have found that it has worked out a rich blessing to us, in looking up these notes and making the corrections ourselves thus noting the changes. This has enabled us to appreciate more perfectly the increasing light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We also desire to thank you for the blessed </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower,</span><span class="font8"> laden with such wonderful and inspiring articles. Surely we have an abundance of evidence that the Lord is still using the same channel in dispensing his truth and meat in due season! And we wish to assure you, dear Brethren that you have our hearty cooperation in the promulgation of these blessed truths, and that to the best of our ability we are endeavoring by word of mouth, both publicly and privately, and by the printed page, to give forth the witness. We have joined the Lord’s army, and through his grace hope to come off victorious. May the Lord’s guidance and blessing abide with you.</span></p>

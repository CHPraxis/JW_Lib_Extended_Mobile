<p id="p2" data-pid="2" class="sn">● In a fifteen-minute speech at St. Peter’s Basilica the pope said recently that the Roman Catholic Church cannot shun politics. According to the New York <em>Times </em>of July 23, 1956, “Pope Pius XII urged Roman Catholics today to take an active part in politics.” But Christ Jesus urged his followers to take an active part in preaching the good news of the Kingdom. As to politics a follower of Christ wrote under inspiration: “Do you not know that the friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever, therefore, wants to be a friend of the world is constituting himself an enemy of God.”—<a href="jwpub://b/NWTR/59:4:4-59:4:4" data-bid="1-1" class="b">Jas. 4:4</a>, <em>NW.</em></p>
